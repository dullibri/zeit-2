HEADLINE: ANXIOUS EUROPE EXAMINING WAYS TO QUELL A CRISIS

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Fears over the European financial crisis began to spread Tuesday from the weaker countries to healthier ones, including Italy and Belgium, and even much stronger Germany, spurring a stepped up search for a solution to the economic problems putting a strain on Europe's decade-old monetary union.
Despite the commitment of close to 200 billion euros ($260 billion) in bailout funds to two economically stricken nations -- Greece and Ireland -- borrowing costs across the continent rose as investors worried about the growing risks.
In recent days, investors have been selling the debt of Germany, whose economy remains relatively robust, because of worries it will bear much of the burden of the ever-higher costs of bailing out weaker countries. 
While German bonds recovered by the end of Tuesday, the cost to an investor for insuring against an unlikely German default also rose, signaling growing nervousness. Further reflecting those worries, the euro slipped to $1.3011 in the United States from $1.3117 Monday. As recently as Nov. 5, the euro traded above $1.40.
No one thinks that the financial problems of Italy and Belgium, much less Germany, are nearly as serious as those of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which also suffered a blow on Tuesday when Standard & Poor's warned of an impending downgrade of its credit rating.
Instead, the fear is that Europe's strategy so far -- painfully drawn out step-by-step rescues of individual countries -- has failed to calm the markets. If investors panic and the contagion spreads to larger economies like Spain and perhaps even Italy, the thinking goes, the much higher cost of bailing out those countries would be difficult for Germany to bear -- both financially and politically.
Even as the yields on the 10-year bonds of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain ended trading off their highs Tuesday, attention turned to the increase in interest rates on Italian debt to 4.64 percent, of Belgian bonds to 3.97 percent and the recent rise of German bonds, the European benchmark.
At 2.67 percent, the yield on German bonds was down marginally from Monday, but well above the 2.1 percent of last summer. Rising yields reflect increased risk in the eyes of investors, as well as inflationary expectations.
With financial markets still unsettled, fresh ideas about how to calm them have been floated. Some proposals, like a new European bond with fiscal conditions or the establishment of a European version of the International Monetary Fund with resources to help troubled countries, are considered more grandiose at the moment than practical.
But others, especially those that come with a call for bondholders to share the pain by taking some losses on their holdings, are being examined in a new light, even though investors remain adamantly opposed to such measures.
Europe's debt-ridden countries themselves are wary of any form of negotiated default that would lower the amount they owe creditors, because they fear that this would make it harder to find new lenders in the future. One reason for the increase in borrowing costs is that European countries that share the common currency agreed at the beginning of the week that, starting in mid-2013, lenders might be required to forgive debt as part of any future bailout plans.
One of the latest suggestions from outside specialists is for indebted European countries to consider something modeled on the so-called Brady plan that dealt with Latin American debtors in the 1980s and early 1990s. That could require bondholders to accept a write-down in exchange for a new, more tradeable instrument.
Others have suggested a so-called Abu Dhabi option under which the European Commission and the I.M.F. would promise bailout funds as long as private sector creditors shared the pain, in an echo of Abu Dhabi's bailout of its fellow emirate Dubai late last year.
But all such plans are difficult to consider in the current atmosphere.
The recent bond market attacks on Ireland and other weak European debtors increased after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, broached the idea of requiring bondholders to take a share of the losses. The concerns gathered speed this week when it became clear that Ireland, as well as Greece, would have to pay a still-steep 5.87 percent interest rate on their loans -- a tacit acknowledgment on Europe's part, analysts say, that even with its bailout package Ireland remains a significant default risk.
''We have created more doubts than existed before,'' said Paul De Grauwe, an economist who advises the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso. ''The interest rate now being charged for Ireland is a vote of no confidence for the package and it has obviously been inspired by a notion that we should punish our sinners. If we don't succeed in containing this thing it could lead to a disaster in terms of the euro's survival.''
Mr. De Grauwe, unlike many economists who shout loudly of the euro's inevitable demise, is no alarmist. He has been a longtime supporter of the European common currency project, giving his views extra weight.
He recently wrote a research paper that has drawn the attention of investors, academics and officials in Brussels and London. In it, Mr. De Grauwe compares the current cycle of soaring bond yields among European economies to the series of competitive devaluations that led to the collapse in the early 1990s of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, the precursor to today's monetary union that binds 16 nations in the euro zone.
Then it was investors betting on devaluations, most famously the one that led to the collapse of the British pound in 1992. Now, Mr. De Grauwe predicts, it will be bond investors zeroing in on Europe's weakest economies that, via a punishing cycle of soaring bond yields, could lead the euro zone to implode -- just as its precursor did -- as one country after the next defaults on rising debt.
Mr. De Grauwe proposes transforming Europe's financial rescue fund into a European equivalent of the I.M.F., but other specialists say that Europe is not prepared to undertake the long and political challenging treaty revisions that would be required to bring it to life. Still the feeling is growing that some form of restructuring is crucial.
Daniel Gros, the head of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, said that just as investors of Dubai World were required to share the pain in return for a rescue by Abu Dhabi, so should bondholders in Irish banks. ''It was not easy, but in the end all the creditors accepted it,'' Mr. Gros said.
Another idea that has gained some ground recently is a Brady plan for indebted European economies. The plan was put forward recently by a former Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, who led an effort in 1989 to help Mexico and other Latin American economies restructure debt -- requiring bondholders to take a loss of 30 percent in exchange for new, longer dated debt with lower rates backed by 30-year United States zero-coupon bonds. Criticized at the time, the plan is now seen as the first step of Latin America's recovery.
Mr. Brady presented the idea at an exclusive gathering of international financiers in Washington this year that included, among others, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet. Mr. Brady does not pretend to be an expert on Europe, but he does recall from experience that for any such plan to gain acceptance, unified leadership is crucial. While Mrs. Merkel has offered her own ideas, they have run into a storm of criticism from other European leaders, including Mr. Trichet.
''It was not easy but we drove the process and got the banks to write down their debt and accept a new security,'' Mr. Brady said during an interview. ''But now the question is who is going to stand up for the euro?''

HEADLINE: 'Financial Steroids'

 BODY:
Prosecutors are warning that the crime of insider trading is becoming an all too common way of doing business. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney policing Wall Street, recently told the New York City Bar Association that ''illegal insider trading is rampant'' and vowed that he would use ''every legitimate tool'' to track down and prosecute this crime. It's about time. 
With uncertainty about how aggressively Washington will enforce the new financial reform law -- and the financial industry's continued resistance to regulation -- such vigilance is particularly welcome.
Mr. Bharara's most high-profile case is against the Galleon Group, a former hedge fund, some of its principals and others who did business with the fund. The case became public a year ago when Mr. Bharara charged Raj Rajaratnam, the group's co-founder, and five others with running the biggest insider trading scheme in history involving hedge funds. Since then, 23 people have been charged with crimes, 14 have pleaded guilty and three have been sentenced.
Before the 2009 financial crisis, David Skeel, an expert on financial regulation, explained that ''hedge funds are best understood by what they are not. They are not regulated.'' Astoundingly, that is basically still true.
While the new reform law requires hedge funds to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and gives the S.E.C. the power to inspect them, the funds can still skirt nearly all the laws regulating investment funds. They can operate largely in secret unless the S.E.C. audits them. They don't have to file quarterly financial statements, disclose what they are investing in or worry about restrictions on risky investments.
This makes it far too easy to manipulate markets. In the Galleon case, millions of dollars were paid to insiders to provide secret information about such well-known companies as I.B.M., Lenovo and Advanced Micro Devices. That information was then used to trade stocks, reaping tens of millions of dollars of ill-gotten profits.
Mr. Bharara compared these kinds of insider tips -- so-called material nonpublic information -- to a ''financial steroid'' that is not only illegal and unfair but ''puts a black mark on the entire enterprise.'' He's right.

HEADLINE: In Tax Cuts, The Options Run Short

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Democrats have left themselves in a tough spot on the Bush tax cuts. After delaying the issue until after the election and then being trounced in that election, they find themselves with little leverage.
If they cannot come up with a plan that can win 60 votes in the Senate, which means at least two Republican votes, Republicans can filibuster any bill. All of the tax cuts would then expire on Dec. 31. When the new Republican House majority arrives in January, it will be able to make its first order of business a retroactive tax cut -- forcing President Obama and Senate Democrats to choose between a purely Republican plan and an across-the-board tax increase.
So the big question is whether Democratic leaders can come up with any compromise that centrist Democrats and a couple of Republican senators -- Scott Brown, who represents liberal Massachusetts? George Voinovich of Ohio, who is retiring? -- are willing to accept. 
Much of the recent commentary about the tax cuts has skipped over this political reality. It's instead focused on how tough the Democrats should be and whether they should insist on the expiration of all the Bush tax cuts on income above $250,000 a year. But that's no longer one of their options. Unless they believe they will benefit more than Republicans from a standoff in which taxes go up, which is hard to believe with a Democrat in the White House, their only choice now is among various versions of retreat.
A small group of Obama administration officials and lawmakers from each party will be negotiating over the next few days, and two possibilities are getting the most attention.
The first is a millionaire's tax, in which the Bush tax cuts would be extended only on income below $1 million. This would raise only half as much as Mr. Obama's proposal -- allowing the cuts to expire on all income above $250,000 -- but it would still eliminate roughly 8 percent of the medium-term budget deficit. A millionaire's tax would also mean that the tax code would again begin to distinguish between the merely affluent and the truly wealthy, as was the case decades ago.
The second, more likely option is to extend all the tax cuts -- and to package them with other tax cuts and spending likely to do more to help the economy than the Bush tax cuts. (Remember, after President George W. Bush signed the cuts in 2001, the economy lost jobs for the next two years, and economic growth during his presidency was mediocre.) These other measures could include a tax cut for businesses that added workers, an across-the-board payroll tax cut and an extension of unemployment benefits.
Combining the two ideas -- using the revenue from the millionaire's tax to pay for job creation programs -- may also be possible. Senator Mark Warner, a moderate Virginia Democrat, has been pushing a similar idea.
The safer strategy is focusing on job creation, without involving the millionaire's tax. Republicans would then be forced to accept additional tax cuts, some of which were originally Republican ideas, or to stand in the way of extending the Bush cuts. Democrats, for their part, could avoid repeating their mistake of early this year, when they assumed a recovery was under way and failed to do enough to help the economy.
Today, the economy looks striking similar to the way it did at the start of the year, with the latest numbers again pointing to a recovery. Retail sales over Thanksgiving weekend were strong. The last jobs report showed more hiring than expected. Yet the outlook remains highly uncertain, partly because of the debt troubles in Europe.
The great historical lesson of financial crises is they tend to have bigger, longer-lasting effects than policy makers think. Congress and the White House now have a chance to take out an insurance policy against the risk that the recovery will fade in coming months, just as it did over the summer. Because the Bush tax cuts will expire unless new legislation is enacted, they offer a chance to get that insurance policy through Congress.
The political argument for taking a risk and trying to pass the millionaire's tax is that it will allow the Democrats to cast themselves as friends of the middle class. The economic argument is that such a tax would probably do more long-term good than any of the other remaining options.
The country, as you've no doubt heard, is facing a huge budget deficit. To reduce the deficit to a level economists consider sustainable, Washington needs to find about $400 billion in annual tax revenue and spending cuts by 2015. A millionaire's tax would be a good start, producing about $30 billion a year. By comparison, Mr. Obama's plan to freeze federal workers' pay would save about $5 billion a year.
A millionaire's tax would also fall on an income group that, by almost any definition, can best handle a tax increase. Since 1980, pretax income for households making at least $1 million has more than tripled, after adjusting for inflation. Pretax income for households in the dead middle of the income distribution, making roughly $50,000, has risen just 13 percent.
At the same time, the wealthy have received a much bigger tax cut over the last three decades than any other group. The total federal tax rate on households making more than $1 million -- including the income tax, the payroll tax and others -- was above 50 percent in 1980. In recent years, it has been about 33 percent.
Finally, a millionaire's tax would make a distinction between the 400,000th dollar of income and the 40 millionth dollar. Today, the government taxes those dollars at the same rate, which is hard to justify in a country with a progressive tax system and high inequality. Until the 1970s, the highest tax bracket began at more than $1 million a year in today's dollars.
So which route should Democrats take? It depends on whether they think they have any chance of persuading a couple of Republicans to vote for a millionaire's tax. If the Democrats fail and don't leave themselves enough time to pass a bill with job creation measures, they will be facing total capitulation -- an extension of the high-end Bush tax cuts with nothing in return.
And what should the Republicans do? Perhaps, when faced with the final choice, a few of them will be willing to vote for either reducing the deficit or helping the economy.

HEADLINE: AS TIME RUNS OUT, DEBT COMMISSION STILL LACKS VOTES

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and PETER BAKER; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chairmen of President Obama's debt-reduction commission have been unable to win support from any of the panel's elected officials for their proposed spending cuts and tax increases, underscoring the reluctance of both parties to risk short-term political backlash in pursuit of the nation's long-term fiscal health.
The chairmen of the commission -- former Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican, and Erskine B. Bowles, a Democrat and former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton -- delayed for two days, until Friday, a final vote by its 18 members.
They said the delay was to provide more time to look at the final package, but it also gave them further opportunity to woo some of the 12 members of Congress on the commission, six from each party, whose support will be critical if the plan is to be taken seriously as a blueprint for eventual legislation. 
The commission pressed ahead with its last-ditch efforts as Mr. Obama and Republican leaders opened negotiations on Tuesday in search of what the president called ''sensible common ground'' in their debate over extending the Bush-era tax cuts. It is the most immediate domestic issue facing them and a key test of whether the two sides can work together in the new political order.
During their first meeting since the midterm elections rearranged the power map in Washington, Mr. Obama told Representative John A. Boehner, the incoming House speaker, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, that he regretted not reaching out to them more in his first two years in office and vowed to do better.
Mr. Obama assigned Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Jack Lew, the White House budget director, to put together a tax deal with Congress, and he suggested there would be more talks with the leaders of both parties, including a possible session at Camp David.
''Today we had the beginning of a new dialogue that I hope -- and I'm sure most Americans hope -- will help break through the noise and produce real gains,'' the president said after a two-hour session that included Democratic Congressional leaders as well. ''And as we all agreed, that should begin today because there's some things we need to get done in the weeks before Congress leaves town for the holidays.''
With a negotiating framework in place, lawmakers said they could begin to see the contours of a potential outcome that would extend the Bush-era tax cuts temporarily while giving Democrats some concessions on unemployment compensation, the estate tax or other tax cuts that were included in the stimulus package and will also expire this year.
''Now it is all about what Democrats can get,'' said one Democratic senator who did not want to be identified talking about the prospect of the White House and Congressional Democrats conceding on extending the tax cuts for affluent Americans.
Still, House Democrats said they could press ahead as early as Thursday with a vote to allow the tax breaks for income over $250,000 for a family to expire even though such a plan appears unlikely to be able to clear a Senate filibuster, given solid Republican opposition and resistance from several Democrats. Democrats said they could use the votes to make their position clear and also illustrate that they do not have the votes to block extension of those tax cuts, clearing the way for concessions.
Even as Congress moved toward extending some or all of the tax cuts, the commission was facing a potential break between its elected officials and its members who do not have to face the voters, people familiar with the panel's deliberations said.
The panel needs the agreement of 14 of its 18 members for its recommendations to go to Congress for a vote, a prospect that has been a long shot since it convened earlier this year.
But a failure to win support from at least some lawmakers from both parties would undercut the panel's ability even to set the terms of a debate between the administration and Congress over how to proceed in addressing chronic annual budget deficits and a national debt that is mounting toward unsustainable levels.
The chairmen's plan would cap annual spending for both domestic and military programs; build on the cost-savings steps in Mr. Obama's health care law; raise Social Security payroll taxes for affluent taxpayers and slowly increase the retirement age to 69 from 67; and reduce or eliminate a raft of popular tax breaks, including the mortgage interest deduction, in return for lower income-tax rates for individuals and corporations.
Among the lawmakers, the Republicans generally oppose the chairmen's draft plan because of its tax increases for upper-income Americans. The elected Republicans on the panel are Senators Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, and Representatives Dave Camp of Michigan, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Jeb Hensarling of Texas.
The elected Democrats on the commission are resisting the scale of proposed reductions from future health care and Social Security programs, according to people familiar with the discussions. Those Democrats are Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Max Baucus of Montana and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, and Representatives Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, Xavier Becerra of California, and John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina.
While the three House Republicans are said by people involved in the deliberations to be unbending in their opposition to the blueprint developed by the chairmen, the three Senate Republicans are not. Similarly, except for Ms. Schakowsky, the Democratic House and Senate members are said to be still negotiating with one another and the chairmen toward some compromise.
''Regardless of how the vote turns out,'' Mr. Bowles said at a news conference on Tuesday, he and Mr. Simpson will have won by demonstrating the difficult choices to be made on taxes and spending. ''The era of deficit denial in Washington is over,'' he said.
Among the nonelected officials said to be supportive of the chairmen are Alice M. Rivlin, a former budget director to Congress and to Mr. Clinton; David Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell International, and Ann Fudge, a former chief executive of Young & Rubicam.
The clash over taxes and government spending are defining the early stages of the post-election maneuvering in Washington and seem likely to remain in the forefront as the 2012 presidential campaign heats up next year.
House and Senate Republicans were adamant after the White House meeting that they would not give any ground on extending all the tax cuts. Top aides said they believed the negotiations by administration officials and Senators Baucus and Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, as well as Representatives Camp and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, would reach into other tax issues as lawmakers try to find a deal.
Members of both parties warned that while the door had opened to some possible resolution of what has proven to be an extremely difficult issue to resolve, the outcome remains uncertain.
''We had a very nice meeting today,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''Of course, we've had a lot of very nice meetings. The question is, can we find the common ground the American people expect us to find?''

HEADLINE: From WikiChina

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
While secrets from WikiLeaks were splashed all over the American newspapers, I couldn't help but wonder: What if China had a WikiLeaker and we could see what its embassy in Washington was reporting about America? I suspect the cable would read like this:
Washington Embassy, People's Republic of China, to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Beijing, TOP SECRET/Subject: America today. 
Things are going well here for China. America remains a deeply politically polarized country, which is certainly helpful for our goal of overtaking the U.S. as the world's most powerful economy and nation. But we're particularly optimistic because the Americans are polarized over all the wrong things.
There is a willful self-destructiveness in the air here as if America has all the time and money in the world for petty politics. They fight over things like -- we are not making this up -- how and where an airport security officer can touch them. They are fighting -- we are happy to report -- over the latest nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia. It seems as if the Republicans are so interested in weakening President Obama that they are going to scuttle a treaty that would have fostered closer U.S.-Russian cooperation on issues like Iran. And since anything that brings Russia and America closer could end up isolating us, we are grateful to Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona for putting our interests ahead of America's and blocking Senate ratification of the treaty. The ambassador has invited Senator Kyl and his wife for dinner at Mr. Kao's Chinese restaurant to praise him for his steadfastness in protecting America's (read: our) interests.
Americans just had what they call an ''election.'' Best we could tell it involved one congressman trying to raise more money than the other (all from businesses they are supposed to be regulating) so he could tell bigger lies on TV more often about the other guy before the other guy could do it to him. This leaves us relieved. It means America will do nothing serious to fix its structural problems: a ballooning deficit, declining educational performance, crumbling infrastructure and diminished immigration of new talent.
The ambassador recently took what the Americans call a fast train -- the Acela -- from Washington to New York City. Our bullet train from Beijing to Tianjin would have made the trip in 90 minutes. His took three hours -- and it was on time! Along the way the ambassador used his cellphone to call his embassy office, and in one hour he experienced 12 dropped calls -- again, we are not making this up. We have a joke in the embassy: ''When someone calls you from China today it sounds like they are next door. And when someone calls you from next door in America, it sounds like they are calling from China!'' Those of us who worked in China's embassy in Zambia often note that Africa's cellphone service was better than America's.
But the Americans are oblivious. They travel abroad so rarely that they don't see how far they are falling behind. Which is why we at the embassy find it funny that Americans are now fighting over how ''exceptional'' they are. Once again, we are not making this up. On the front page of The Washington Post on Monday there was an article noting that Republicans Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee are denouncing Obama for denying ''American exceptionalism.'' The Americans have replaced working to be exceptional with talking about how exceptional they still are. They don't seem to understand that you can't declare yourself ''exceptional,'' only others can bestow that adjective upon you.
In foreign policy, we see no chance of Obama extricating U.S. forces from Afghanistan. He knows the Republicans will call him a wimp if he does, so America will keep hemorrhaging $190 million a day there. Therefore, America will lack the military means to challenge us anywhere else, particularly on North Korea, where our lunatic friends continue to yank America's chain every six months so that the Americans have to come and beg us to calm things down. By the time the Americans do get out of Afghanistan, the Afghans will surely hate them so much that China's mining companies already operating there should be able to buy up the rest of Afghanistan's rare minerals.
Most of the Republicans just elected to Congress do not believe what their scientists tell them about man-made climate change. America's politicians are mostly lawyers -- not engineers or scientists like ours -- so they'll just say crazy things about science and nobody calls them on it. It's good. It means they will not support any bill to spur clean energy innovation, which is central to our next five-year plan. And this ensures that our efforts to dominate the wind, solar, nuclear and electric car industries will not be challenged by America.
Finally, record numbers of U.S. high school students are now studying Chinese, which should guarantee us a steady supply of cheap labor that speaks our language here, as we use our $2.3 trillion in reserves to quietly buy up U.S. factories. In sum, things are going well for China in America.
Thank goodness the Americans can't read our diplomatic cables.
Embassy Washington.

HEADLINE: Calls Grow for FIFA to Delay World Cup Vote

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
Continued allegations of corruption involving top officials at FIFA, soccer's world governing body, have called into question the integrity of Thursday's votes that will decide the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments -- the latter of which is being sought by the United States.
The Swiss chapter of Transparency International, an anticorruption organization, has called for the votes to be postponed until ''full light is shed'' on a spate of recent bribery allegations published and broadcast by European news media.
''These have brought such discredit to the decision-making processes at FIFA that a decision in the current circumstances would only fuel the controversy,'' Transparency International said in a statement. 
FIFA, which is based in Zurich, has given no indication that it would delay Thursday's voting.
While soccer is the most popular sport in the world, and the World Cup is the planet's biggest athletic event, FIFA is an insular group unregulated by any outside organization, even as it orchestrates a tournament worth billions of dollars in television rights fees, sponsorship fees and ticket sales. It has been criticized frequently for the opaque way it conducts business.
Cecilia Keaveney, an Irish politician and the chairwoman of the youth and sport committee of the European Council, renewed her call Tuesday for an independent anticorruption agency to oversee world sports. It would function similar to the way the World Anti-Doping Agency monitors the international use of banned performance-enhancing substances, she said.
Asked if she would consider Thursday's votes legitimate, Keaveney said in a telephone interview that she would ''like to see more transparency in how the decisions were reached.''
She added: ''When you have allegations alluded to, that leaves a lot of serious questions. The problem is whether the allocation of the World Cup is given for the right reasons or the wrong reasons.''
Internationally, soccer's popularity has been tempered by repeated scandals involving corruption, gambling and match-fixing. For instance, a match-fixing trial began in October in Germany that could involve the rigging of 300 matches in 15 European countries, according to the authorities.
The 2018 World Cup will be awarded to a European bidder from among Belgium/the Netherlands, England, Portugal/Spain and Russia. The United States, which hosted the 1994 World Cup, is bidding for the 2022 tournament against Australia, Japan, Qatar and South Korea. The voting will be determined by 22 members of the 24-member FIFA executive committee.
The latest corruption scandal surfaced in mid-October when reporters for The Sunday Times of London, posing as lobbyists for American business interests, reported that two members of FIFA's executive committee had offered to sell their votes. After the revelations, Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti were barred from the sport and fined by FIFA.
A former general secretary of FIFA, Michel Zen-Ruffinen, also reportedly told The Sunday Times while being secretly filmed the names of officials who could be bribed. And he told the paper that officials from the joint bid by Portugal and Spain for 2018 and the Qatar bid for 2022 had agreed to collude to exchange votes to enhance their chances.
The officials denied any collusion and FIFA said it found no evidence of attempts at vote swapping. But the charges of corruption have continued.
On Monday, the BBC public-affairs program ''Panorama'' reported that three other members of the FIFA executive committee -- Ricardo Teixeira of Brazil, Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Nicolas Leoz of Paraguay -- had taken kickbacks from 1989 to 1999 from FIFA's marketing arm, known as International Sports and Leisure, or I.S.L.
The marketing arm, now defunct, went bankrupt in 2001 in a scandal involving allegations of kickbacks over international television rights fees. Andrew Jennings, the British investigative reporter whose research provided the backbone of the ''Panorama'' program, said Tuesday that a confidential document indicated that I.S.L. had made 175 payments worth $100 million.
Hayatou told Reuters on Tuesday that he had not taken a bribe. ''Personally, I know no one can influence me,'' he said.
FIFA said it would not investigate the program's charges, noting that the fraud case had been investigated by the Swiss authorities in 2008 and that no official from the soccer governing body had faced criminal charges.
''Panorama'' also alleged that Jack Warner, a FIFA executive committee member from Trinidad and Tobago, had ordered $84,240 worth of tickets to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to sell at a profit, but that the deal fell through.
Warner dismissed the BBC program's report on Tuesday. A similar accusation against Warner appeared recently in the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet.
Alan I. Rothenberg, a past president of the United States Soccer Federation, called the Panorama report ''old news'' and said he did not think FIFA was inherently corrupt.
''We're probably the only country with a corrupt-practices act,'' Rothenberg said. ''We're constantly imposing our ethical standards on people who in their world, that's the way business is done.''
Declan Hill, a Canadian investigative journalist who is considered an authority on sports corruption, said Tuesday that recent allegations of wrongdoing against 6 of FIFA's 24 executive committee members will render Thursday's votes meaningless. He also suggested that the vote be postponed.
''There may be a few bushmen in the Kalahari Desert who still think FIFA's process has credibility,'' Hill wrote in an e-mail.
Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States soccer federation, did not return an e-mail asking whether he thought Thursday's vote should be postponed.
Richard Pound, a member of the International Olympic Committee from Montreal who investigated the bribery scandal that threatened the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, said corruption in international sporting bodies generally emanated from ''personal ego.''
He said: ''Most of these folks don't get into this stuff because of money, but they get these positions, then what becomes important is holding onto them. When the economic impact of whatever event -- the World Cup or the Olympics -- becomes astronomical, it's a push-and-pull thing. The push comes from the candidate cities or countries, and the pull is from people willing to step over the line.''
The 2010 World Cup generated about $3.4 billion in revenue for FIFA. Power in the organization is concentrated in fewer hands than in the International Olympic Committee. While all 115 or so Olympic delegates vote to award the Winter and Summer Games, FIFA's voting is limited to the two dozen members of its executive committee.
''It's relatively easier to pinpoint who is venal,'' Jennings said.
Hill said that nations were reluctant to challenge FIFA because it can refuse to let a country participate internationally in soccer for reasons of government interference.
''In countries where soccer is king, not many politicians want to take that risk,'' Hill said in a telephone interview. ''National governments have consistently backed down.''
Keaveney, the Irish politician, said she was dismayed by the backlash against recent news media allegations by officials who feared the reports would undermine England's bid for the 2018 World Cup.
''What screams out is the seeming lack of interest in the veracity of the allegations,'' Keaveney said in an e-mail. ''It is very much see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil.''

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; A.I.G. BOND SALE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
A.I.G. will sell about $2 billion worth of bonds in its first debt offering since the financial crisis.
The insurer will sell bonds in two tranches: a $500 million issue of bonds that mature in January of 2014 and a $1.5 billion issue of bonds that mature in December of 2020. The former carries a yield of about 3.7 percent, while the latter carries a yield of about 6.4 percent. 
12:47 pm. Original Post With an arrangement to repay its $130 billion taxpayer-financed bailout in place, the American International Group will seek another way to demonstrate its independence: it is planning a debt offering.
The insurer disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it would issue new bonds for the first time since it was rescued at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The preliminary prospectus did not list specific details like the size of the offering.
A.I.G.'s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, has long stressed the need for the company to hold a bond offering as a sign that the insurer is no longer a ward of the state.
The company has already raised billions of dollars by selling off noncore operations, including major international life insurance units like American International Assurance and the American Life Insurance Company.
Under the terms of its bailout repayment plan, A.I.G. plans to pay off the debt held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The process involves increasing the Treasury Department's common-share stake in the insurer to 92 percent from just under 80 percent, with the government planning to sell off its stake over time.
(It's worth noting that the prospectus still lists this among its risk factors: ''We depend on the support of the U.S. government. It is uncertain whether we will be able to develop and implement adequate restructuring initiatives, which businesses will remain part of our operations and whether we will succeed in operating without the support of the U.S. government.'')
One important element for a successful offering is for A.I.G. to obtain investment-grade credit ratings for the new bonds. The debt markets have indicated some confidence in the insurer's long-term prospects, and the company's long-term credit rating is listed at A3 by Moody's.
The prospectus lists four joint bookrunners: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Midwest Emerges as Center for Clean Energy

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio -- With surprising speed, and with the help of ample public incentives, a solar energy manufacturing center has emerged in the upper Midwest that is helping to supply the world's growing demand for clean power.
Here in this central Ohio city of 13,400 residents, DuPont is building a $175 million, 162,000-square-foot solar materials plant that will employ 70 people.
About 320 miles north, near Midland, Mich., Hemlock Semiconductor is completing a $1 billion polycrystalline silicon plant to supply a basic raw material in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to electricity. The Hemlock plant will add 300 new jobs by the end of the year.
In between the two plants are six more new solar facilities in Michigan and three others in Ohio. 
A number of conditions in the Midwest have allowed the sector to flourish. The upper Midwest has a history of advanced manufacturing, and machined parts and many of the basic materials of photovoltaic panels -- polycrystalline in central Michigan, glass in the Toledo region, plastic films in Ohio -- were already being made in the region.
Both states have an abundance of shuttered plants that can be readily converted to new uses and are close to highway, rail and shipping supply lines in the center of the country.
Equally important, both states have an army of unemployed or underemployed skilled manufacturing workers.
The new DuPont plant, part of which encompasses a facility that was idled in 2009, is expected to open next year.
''Frankly, an even bigger challenge we've had is to invest quickly enough to keep up with market demand,'' said John Odom, global business director for DuPont Photovoltaic Fluoro Materials.
This year the world will generate 38,000 megawatts of energy from the sun, 14,000 megawatts more than last year, according to a number of market research firms. The growth in the industry's generating capacity is equivalent to 14 large coal-fired power plants. In comparison, in 1997 global demand for solar photovoltaic equipment totaled just 125 megawatts. Sales of photovoltaic cells and panels will reach $24 billion in 2010, according to the European Photovoltaic Industry Association.
Much of that market is supported by incentives in the United States, Europe and Asia to build and install photovoltaic equipment. DuPont received $50.1 million in federal manufacturing tax incentives from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It also gained $7 million in state aid.
Michigan has leveraged the 2009 federal stimulus bill and an array of state manufacturing incentives, tax credits and other public aid to produce $4.1 billion in public and private investment in the state's solar manufacturing industry in the last three years, said Gregory Main, the chief executive of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, a state agency.
In a national census of solar industry employment released last month, the Solar Foundation found that with 6,300 jobs, Michigan ranked fourth in solar sector jobs behind California, Pennsylvania and Texas. The Ohio Department of Development counts 1,500 jobs in its solar manufacturing sector.
Toledo, Ohio, has become a center for the production of flexible sheets of photovoltaic cells called thin film that were developed from research programs at the University of Toledo. The sheets combine layers of hair-thin semiconductors with nonsilicon materials to generate power.
First Solar just finished a 500,000-square-foot, $141 million addition to its existing photovoltaic thin film plant in Perrysburg, a Toledo suburb. The company, awarded a $16 million federal manufacturing investment tax credit, added 200 workers, bringing the plant's employment to 1,100.
Early next year, the Willard & Kelsey Solar Group plans to start production in a 280,000-square-foot, $250 million thin-film plant in Perrysburg that will employ 100 people and that was built with nearly $20 million in state support.
Michael J. Cicak, the company's chief executive and chairman, said that the company had already sold out all its production from the plant and added that Willard & Kelsey was looking 50 miles north to Tecumseh, Mich., for a second manufacturing plant.
In Michigan, a center for solar industry is emerging in the Saginaw Valley around Hemlock Semiconductor's polycrystalline silicon plant, which involves constructing multiple facilities on a 500-acre site. It is being built with the help of a $350 million state energy tax credit, Mr. Main said.
Nearby in Midland, Dow Solar, a unit of Dow Chemical, plans a $249 million photovoltaic plant to make residential solar shingles, which generate electricity while serving as a conventional roof. The plant, which will open next year, was built with $17 million in federal manufacturing tax credits, and $123 million in various state aid programs.
More plants are on the way, Mr. Main said. Clairvoyant Energy last year committed to a partnership with the Ford Motor Company to install a solar manufacturing facility in a shuttered Ford auto assembly plant near Detroit.
But an industry that relies on government incentives and assistance is also vulnerable to the winds of political change.
This fall, for instance, the value of Ohio's public incentives and two-year-old state legislation to support solar and other clean energy manufacturing became an issue in the tight governor's race. The incumbent, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, argued that state grants, loans and tax incentives in the last three years helped to prompt nearly $750 million in new solar investment in Ohio and hundreds of new jobs.
But his Republican challenger, John Kasich, who on Nov. 2 defeated Mr. Strickland, said that Ohio's 2008 clean energy standard, which requires utilities to produce 25 percent of their electricity from solar and other ''advanced sources'' by 2025, would raise costs and was a government intrusion. ''You can't mandate invention,'' Mr. Kasich said.
Three weeks later in Washington, the United States Trade Representative's office announced it would investigate Chinese government support for makers of solar, wind and other clean energy products that compete with similar equipment now made in the Midwest. Chinese officials responded that the investigation could set off an trade battle that the United States could not win.
Solar industry analysts said that a confrontation with China could hit DuPont hard. The company's new plant will manufacture Tedlar, a durable plastic film used to protect solar photovoltaic panels from moisture and ultraviolet radiation.
Most of the Tedlar produced in Ohio will be sold to producers in China, who are now making half of the solar photovoltaic panels in a global market that is growing 30 percent annually.
In both states, solar executives and political leaders expressed concern that the Democratic lawmakers both states sent to Washington, as well as the governors of both states that helped the solar initiatives had been replaced by Republicans who had expressed skepticism about publicly financed incentives.
Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Governor-elect Kasich, said Mr. Kasich did not oppose Ohio's renewable energy standard and would not seek to repeal it.
''I know some people have said some negative things, but I suspect that we will continue to pursue alternative energy production,'' said Mr. Main of Michigan's development agency. ''The track record in job growth has been so strong in our state. I can't imagine us walking away.''

HEADLINE: Low Taxes Attract Foreign Companies to a Geneva Stretched Thin by the Growth

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
GENEVA -- The financial crisis may have crimped corporate investment across the West, but companies still appear willing to spend in one corner of Europe -- the Lake Geneva region -- for a simple reason: It saves them money on taxes.
Companies from Europe and the United States, and more recently, Asia, are being drawn to the area by low taxes, generous write-offs and labor laws that are more flexible than much of the rest of Continental Europe. Then there's the central location and, of course, all that fresh air.
The influx has brought this placid region revenue, jobs and other benefits. But the growth has not come without a price, pushing up the cost of living and, some say, detracting from the quality of life for local residents and expatriates alike.
In October, a leading Geneva politician broke a taboo by suggesting the city had reached its limits in its ability to absorb large foreign companies. 
''We would hesitate to welcome a company with more than 5,000 employees because we would not know where to house the employees and their families,'' Pierre-Francois Unger, the city's economy and health minister, said during a news conference.
A senior official at an international organization, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of offending the authorities in Geneva, used to work in the United States for a nongovernmental organization. In Geneva, she said, she earns twice as much, ''but now I'm clearing much less.''
''Most other cities have a range of price points,'' she added. ''Here, it's all expensive.''
Geneva officials mostly play down the problems, arguing that the city will manage its growth through smart infrastructure choices and a focus on smaller investors like the online travel company Expedia, which decided this summer to move the division that handles its hotel and lodging business from Washington State. That created more than 40 jobs in Geneva.
''It's never been the case that we've welcomed a firm of 5,000,'' said Daniel Loeffler, director of the Economic Development Office. ''When you move headquarters or set up a service center, it tends to start with 20 to 50 people and then a big project grows to maybe 100 to 200.''
According to his office, Geneva is host to 569 multinational businesses, including small hedge funds and corporate giants like Procter & Gamble, which employs 3,000 at its European headquarters here. Arrivals in recent years include Yahoo, McDonald's Europe and Nissan.
In addition, more than 20,000 civil servants from other countries and international organizations work in Geneva.
In the competition to attract business, Geneva considers its primary rivals to be Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin and Dubai. Mr. Loeffler said expressions of interest were rebounding after tapering off during the global financial crisis, with companies from Asia among the newest arrivals.
He was speaking recently just before a Chinese delegation's visit. Alibaba, the Internet marketplace, was the first Chinese company to open shop in Geneva, in 2007. It was followed a year later by Bank of China. Brightoil, a petroleum company, is planning to come, according to reports.
All the new companies, however, are confronted by the scarcity of available space.
Geneva and the surrounding canton cover 282 square kilometers, or 109 square miles, and that area has a population of 460,000. By 2030, the canton estimates that number will grow to 540,000. About 40 percent of the residents are foreigners.
Land for new development is scarce, especially around central Lake Geneva, and roads are often gridlocked. Overcrowding has already pushed some newcomer companies to set up nearby, notably the towns of Avenches, Eysins and Nyon in the neighboring canton of Vaud.
The absence of real estate agents on the streets of Geneva is notable. They do not need to push their services -- clients tend to find them. It has become so tough to rent an apartment here that a number of United Nations employees hold on to theirs and sublet them if they are reassigned to New York.
Such scarcity has pushed up prices. A four-bedroom house with a garden in central Geneva rents for 9,500 francs, or $9,507, a month before utilities and other costs. A furnished studio apartment near the lake is 2,000 francs. The situation has pushed some foreigners -- known as frontaliers in French -- to settle across the border in France and commute to their offices in Geneva. The perception that they do not pay their share of local taxes has been exploited by a political group, the Geneva Citizens' Movement, which is gaining in popularity.
For a foreigner, buying a residence is rarely an option. A law known as lex Friedrich sets strict limits on foreigners' ability to buy property, and prices are prohibitive. A five-bedroom house just outside the city is priced at 3.3 million francs.
''If the authorities want to remain ahead of the game,'' said Dominique Tombeur, a consultant who has lived in Geneva for two decades, ''they'd better start thinking smart.''
The government has tried to respond and has high hopes for a local development project, the Praille Acacias Vernets, which is converting office space into housing. Laws have also been passed to allow some residential apartment blocks to build one story higher.
To address the busy roads, authorities are trying to expand tram and train services -- including a rail link that will extend around the lake to France. But local protests have stalled or halted the construction of several proposed roads, bridges and tunnels.
Still, the foreign companies keep coming.
Andrio Orler, a partner at the law firm Tavernier Tschanz, said the fiscal structure remained crucial. Outwardly, the tax structure appears complex, given the need to pay communal, cantonal and federal taxes. But companies end up saving money.
Geneva's corporate tax rate has edged up to about 24 percent, Mr. Orler said, but that is a ''starting rate.'' Companies can negotiate with the canton to be excused from paying all or part of their tax bills for up to 10 years if they fulfill certain conditions, including creating jobs. That can reduce the applicable tax rate to as low as 7.8 percent.
The effective corporate tax rate, incorporating allowances, last year was 9.7 percent in Hong Kong, 27.7 percent in London and 34.1 percent in nearby Lyon, according to BAK Basel, a consulting firm.
Personal income taxes are less attractive. The effective rate in Geneva for an unmarried person with an annual salary of 300,000 francs is 36 percent, and 43 percent on an income of one million francs. Social security charges are around 20 percent. There are ways to manage the pain; some smaller cantons offer lower rates, and expatriates are able to offset certain expenses like school fees and rent. There is also no capital gains tax for individuals.
Another enticement is the panoramic mountain views when skies are clear, and the Rhone River gently rolling by. The nearest ski resort is just 35 kilometers away, and residents swim in the lake in the summer. This year the city ranked third, behind Vienna and Zurich, in a worldwide quality-of-living index compiled by Mercer, a consulting firm.
''It's a place that people would like to relocate to,'' said Per Harkjaer, chief executive of United Coffee, which this year moved its European base here from the Netherlands. ''It's expensive, and schooling and housing can be an issue. But so far, our people have settled in.''

HEADLINE: Dueling Beauty Pageants Put Income Gap on View

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jenny Carolina Gonzalez contributed reporting from Bogota, Colombia.

 BODY:
CARTAGENA, Colombia -- The Champagne flowed. Cigar smoke floated in the thick air of the tropical night. Women in miniskirts and men in pressed guayaberas danced at Jet-Set magazine's fete in this city's Naval Museum, as the candidates for Miss Colombia sashayed about, flashing perfect smiles and impossibly high cheekbones.
Another party unfolded the same night last month outside Cartagena's stone ramparts. In a slum called Boston, Ivonne Palencia, an elegant 19-year-old, tiptoed in the mud outside her family's hovel. Amid the din of firecrackers and reggaeton music, neighbors toasted her victory as Miss Independence, the queen of this city's slums, with beer.
''We have our queen,'' said a glowing Patricia Alvarez, 44, a social worker in Boston who led a collection drive to support Ms. Palencia's candidacy. ''They have theirs.'' 
Despite making strides in stabilizing the economy in the last decade, Colombia has South America's most unequal distribution of wealth, except for small Paraguay, according to the Center for Economic Development Studies in Bogota. And each November this port city puts that inequality on open display, when it hosts two beauty pageants at the same time. The rival contests offer views not only of the country's yawning income gap but of issues of race and class in a country that has, by some measures, the Spanish-speaking world's largest black population.
Miss Colombia, the better-known event, features two dozen strutting candidates, many of them light-skinned daughters of prominent families. The pageant positions Cartagena as its boosters often market it: a playground for the global elite with $475-a-night boutique hotels and Audis prowling the narrow streets of a colonial gem once coveted by corsairs.
In the shadows of that opulence, Cartagena's slums hold their own pageant celebrating the city's declaration of independence from Spain in 1811. Largely featuring Afro-Colombian candidates, the contest, which unfolds during a tumultuous street festival, reveals rival concepts of beauty in a city that was also imperial Spain's major port of entry for slaves being shipped to its South American colonies.
''One pageant portrays Cartagena as its elite wants it to be seen: rich, white and glamorous,'' said Elisabeth Cunin, a French sociologist who studies Cartagena. ''The other reflects the reality of the city as the majority of its inhabitants know it: poor and neglected, a complex mix between racial domination and an emerging current of black consciousness.''
The national pageant, founded here in 1934 as a tourism linchpin, employs a multilingual staff at an air-conditioned building in Parque de Bolivar in the old center, attracting sponsors like Edox, a Swiss watch manufacturer. The municipal contest, created in 1937, operates on a shoestring budget from a crumbling structure a few blocks away.
Few nations, with the exception of neighboring Venezuela, attach as much importance to such pageants. In addition to Miss Colombia and Miss Independence, Colombian juries award many lesser titles, like Miss Plantain and Miss Coal. Cellblocks in a Bogota women's prison have their own pageants. One town in northern Colombia takes it even further, putting makeup and wigs on its donkeys then parading them for its annual Miss Burro celebration.
No pageant attracts as much obsessive attention as Miss Colombia. Paparazzi swarm the city each November. Gossip columnists speculate about plastic surgery, while investigative journalists try to uncover whether drug kingpins paid the surgeons' bill. In a further stamp of legitimacy, Colombia's intellectuals deride the event.
The writer Laura Restrepo skewered the whole scene with the words of a cynical reporter in her novel ''The Angel of Galilea.'' ''Of all my assignments for Somos, covering the pageant was by far the worst, having to rhapsodize on Miss Boyaca's Pepsodent smile, Miss Tolima's dubious virginity, Miss Arauca's preoccupation with poor children.''
One of this year's candidates boasted that she was studying at DePaul University in Chicago. Yet another emphasized that she was born in Paris. In contrast, the bios from the municipal pageant described one candidate who came from a family of 10 children. Another said she simply dreamed of visiting the capital, Bogota.
Sometimes the candidates from both pageants have to greet one another, as they did at a military parade one morning in November. Organizers seated them side by side under a canopy shielding them from the sun.
Awkwardness reigned. The mostly fair-skinned Miss Colombia candidates fidgeted. There were attempts at small talk, and smiles for the cameras.
In an interview, Raimundo Angulo, a former mayor of Cartagena who now directs the national pageant, chafed at criticism that his event was somehow racist or excluding. He said the pageant could improve life for residents by helping to make Cartagena into ''the Monte Carlo of the Caribbean,'' replete with chic casinos and a Formula One race.
''It is democratically elitist,'' he contended of his pageant. ''I simply want what is beautiful, wherever it comes from, according to certain principles, certain values.''
As Mr. Angulo points out, an Afro-Colombian candidate has even been named Miss Colombia. That happened precisely once in the pageant's 76-year history, in 2001, when Vanessa Mendoza won the crown. Winners of the local contest sometimes go on to compete in the national pageant the following year.
As with the national pageant, the views here of the local contest are far from unanimous. Some Afro-Colombian leaders see it as a poor imitation of the rival pageant, while reinforcing standards in which women are judged almost solely on their appearance.
Still, it is clear which pageant elicits the most excitement on Cartagena's streets. The candidates from the slums strut through different districts as the city's carnivalesque celebration of its independence from Spain unfolds. Shop owners shut early, fearful of assaults. A bawdy parade is led by a troupe dressed as whip-wielding priests pursuing sinners, re-enacting the Spanish Inquisition's tribunal, once based here.
This year, bystanders greeted them with cries of ''Long live our queens!'' as they marched through the Getsemani district. Bands of youths roamed the streets carrying buckets of black paint, threatening to paint the faces of visitors. For a few small bills they would relent.
Within this anarchic scene, a panel chooses a winner. The title of Miss Independence this year went to Ms. Palencia, who took time off from her job as a preschool teacher to compete. Her slum, Boston, said to be named for a red-light district once frequented by foreign sailors, erupted in celebration.
Ms. Palencia's mother, Yadira Querubin, 50, a maid who earns $6 a day cleaning houses in a rich area of Cartagena, proudly welcomed a visitor into their home, which has a dirt floor that turns into mud when rain leaks through the ceiling. ''I'm a maid, and I have a daughter who is a queen,'' said Ms. Querubin. ''Maybe my lovely girl, from this difficult place, will have a more dignified life than my own.''

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; CODE CLASH

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Chip East/ReutersSergey Aleynikov, a former programmer for Goldman Sachs, is on trial on charges that he stole trading code from the firm.
Is Sergey Aleynikov an evil computer scientist who brazenly stole valuable, closely guarded trading code from Goldman Sachs, his former employer?
Or is he a humble Russian immigrant who, upon leaving his programming post at Goldman for a higher-paying job, innocuously took some open-source code with him on his way out the door? 
Those dueling depictions were on display on Tuesday in a federal courtroom in Manhattan, where Mr. Aleynikov is on trial on charges that he stole computer source code used in high-frequency trading at Goldman Sachs.
The case is expected to shine a spotlight on high-frequency trading, an increasingly important driver of profit at investment banks and hedge funds. The trial is also a test of the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets.
Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Aleynikov in July 2009 after Goldman reported the suspected theft to authorities. Free on bail since his arrest, the 40-year-old Mr. Aleynikov faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of stealing trade secrets.
''This is a case about greed and theft,'' said Joseph Facciponti, an assistant United States attorney, during the government's opening statement.
Mr. Facciponti told the jury that the evidence would show that Mr. Aleynikov knew that making off with crucial parts of Goldman's trading code would help his new employer, Teza Technologies, a new high-frequency trading firm started by a former executive at the Citadel Investment Group, the large Chicago hedge fund.
Mr. Aleynikov was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever in how he went about'' stealing Goldman's code, which ''allows the bank to make lightning-fast trades in markets around the world,'' Mr. Facciponti said. The computer programs form the building blocks of high-frequency trading and power an important part of Goldman's business, he said.
The prosecutor likened Goldman's protection of its high-frequency trading code to Coca-Cola's guarding of its secret formula for Coke. (What would a trade secrets case be without an allusion to Coke's secret formula?)
Kevin Marino, the defense lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, spent much of his opening statement acknowledging that his client undoubtedly -- and foolishly -- violated Goldman's confidentiality policy in downloading code from the firm's computers. But he repeatedly emphasized that this breach was not a criminal act.
''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime,'' Mr. Marino said, raising his voice for dramatic effect.
Mr. Marino also focused on the issue of intent. He said that in downloading open-source code from the firm's computers, Mr. Aleynikov never intended to harm Goldman's business -- a crucial element of proving that a trade-secrets crime was committed. As far as the proprietary code his client took, Mr. Aleynikov did not intend to steal that from Goldman, he said.
Attempting to humanize Mr. Aleynikov, Mr. Marino described a meeting between Mr. Aleynikov and his new employer. During that meeting, in which Mr. Aleynikov is alleged to have shared Goldman's secret code, Mr. Marino said his client was using his computer to play a satire of a Russian folk song about how programmers are married to their jobs and not their wives. ''A little sad, but hardly subversive,'' he said.
Mr. Marino got himself into trouble with Judge Denise L. Cote when he twice suggested that this case should be a civil matter and that Goldman could have sued Mr. Aleynikov instead of referring the case to criminal authorities.
Visibly upset, Judge Cote interjected both times and instructed the jury to disregard those remarks.
At the conclusion of the lawyers' opening statement, the judge reminded the jurors that ''this is a criminal trial'' and the defendant has been accused of violating federal laws.
The trial puts mighty Goldman Sachs in the unusual role of victim. A Goldman spokesman and a lawyer from the firm sat in the back row of the spectators' gallery. The spokesman declined to comment on the case, but said the firm would have a representative present for the duration of the trial.
The government has requested that portions of the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, be closed to spectators because of the confidential nature of certain testimony. Judge Cote has said she favors an open courtroom and will consider specific requests from the prosecution as the trial progresses.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Investor Pessimism Persists Over European Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street declined on Tuesday as well as for the month of November as concerns over Europe's financial health lingered.
Concerns peaked in the spring over sovereign debt problems in Greece, and in recent weeks, they spread to Ireland, with fears mounting of contagion to other countries in the euro zone.
''Investors are focusing on the negative,'' said Alan B. Lancz, the president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates. ''Obviously, Europe and continued deterioration in the sovereign debt situation, as far as what investors were hoping was just Greece, trump any kind of positive news that we are getting economically.'' 
In Europe, the FTSE 100 index in London declined 22.68 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,528.27. The CAC 40 in Paris dropped 26.52 points, or 0.73 percent, to 3,610.44. The euro fell slightly, to $1.3011.
Taking its cues from Europe, the markets in the United States started out lower but then regained some ground in part because of signs that consumer confidence was improving.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 46.47 points, or 0.42 percent, at 11,006.02. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.21 points, or 0.61 percent, at 1,180.55, and the Nasdaq was off 26.99 points, or 1.07 percent, at 2,498.23.
For the month, the Dow was down 1 percent, and the S.& P. and Nasdaq were each less than 1 percent lower.
Nick Kalivas, vice president for financial research at MF Global said the United States markets had recently shown a tendency to strengthen after European markets close.
The technology sector declined nearly 1.4 percent in the broader market. Google fell $26.40, or 4.54 percent, to $555.71 on Tuesday, when the top European antitrust regulator opened an investigation into the company to examine accusations that it has abused its dominance in online search.
Bank of America shres fell 3.18 percent, to $10.95, on worries that it might be the target of the next WikiLeaks document release.
In an interview posted online Monday by Forbes magazine, Julian Assange, the founder of the WikiLeaks, said his group would release internal documents from a major United States bank early next year. He declined to name the bank, but in an Oct. 2009 interview with Computerworld, Mr. Assange said WikiLeaks had obtained five gigabytes of data from a Bank of America executive's hard drive.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, to 98 16/32. The yield fell to 2.80 percent, from 2.82 percent late Monday.
Still, there was some relief in economic reports on the housing market and consumer sentiment.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence for November increased 4.2 points, to reach 54.1, the highest level since June, while the expectations of consumers as measured by the index rose to 74.2, the highest level since May.
''The increase in consumer optimism is very good news for retailers, since holiday sales for many retail outlets are crucial, and for many, it is a make-or-break situation,'' said Chris G. Christopher Jr., the senior principal economist for IHS Global Insight, in a research note.
Traders on Wall Street also pondered the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller report, which said 18 of 20 cities in the latest housing index recorded price declines in September. The home price index fell 0.7 percent, a rate that reflects transactions from July through September.
Weak demand, foreclosures and a glut in homes for sale could translate into a further 5 percent to 10 percent decline, said Patrick Newport, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
Several European countries -- in particular Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- had increased spreads against the benchmark 10-year German bond as investors sold off government bonds.
Bond traders in Europe have focused in part on a plan announced by euro zone authorities over the weekend to make private investors pay part of future bailouts from 2013.

HEADLINE: Economies Strong Where It Counts

BYLINE: By IAN CAMPBELL and ANTHONY CURRIE

 BODY:
First Greece, then Ireland, next Portugal? It would be easy to think the whole world is sinking. It isn't. Small euro zone periphery economies are in deep trouble. Spain, if it descends, which it might, is larger and would force a more expensive and problematic rescue by the Continent. For the global economy, however, the periphery is a sideshow. For now, world economic prospects don't look bad at all.
Even in Europe, there is life at the core. The German economy will grow by close to 4 percent this year. Investment in machinery and equipment is booming as Germany re-equips itself for exports, which increased by 22.5 percent in September. German consumers are responding, too, though none too boldly. Consumer spending rose by 0.4 percent in the third quarter. 
Germany's revival is linked to the resurrection of the great American consumer. In the United States, spending by consumers on durable goods has been rising at a healthy rate in the first three quarters of 2010. As America spends again, its trade deficit is widening. It was $44 billion in September, nearly double the $25 billion of May 2009, when the global downturn was at its worst. Germany, Japan and other exporters benefit.
China and emerging economies are among them. China's gross domestic product is expected to grow, again, at a 10 percent rate this year and next. That is keeping commodity prices high, helping raw material exporters. The West sees opportunity and is pouring investment into emerging economies. Issuance of local currency bonds in emerging East Asia has risen by 17 percent in the last year. India is in good shape too.
There are risks in the recovery, of course. Quantitative easing and low interest rates in the developed world are behind some of the capital flowing to the emerging world, a flow that is almost certainly excessive. More damaging bubbles risk being inflated. And the world's reliance on a big American trade deficit is growing again.
But for the time being, the world can be pleased about one thing. It's the peripheral economies that are blowing up. Big ones like the United States and Germany are getting better.
Fairy Tale Bank
Banks these days don't generally make for good fairy tales. But First Republic gets pretty close. What looked like a happy ending three years ago turned out to be a tough existence trapped inside not one, but two, grim houses before eventual escape. Now, First Republic's narrative is turning into a buyout Goldilocks.
Merrill Lynch overpaid for the lender and wealth manager back in the overly hot market of January 2007. The $1.8 billion price tag equated to 24 times expected earnings. It left the Thundering Herd's investors feeling burnt even before the market crashed and profit plummeted.
First Republic spent time being owned first by the imploding Merrill and then by its savior, Bank of America, which subsequently became a scary yarn itself. Bank of America also had already taken in a bigger wealth manager, U.S. Trust, and had no need for the relatively small amounts of loans and deposits First Republic had to offer.
What's more, Bank of America sorely needed to raise equity to comply with the results of regulatory stress tests. So in last year's cool market for bank deals, it agreed to offload the unit to management and an investor group led by Colony Capital and General Atlantic. It appears the bank did, at least, get roughly the price Merrill had paid for it -- the new owners put in around $1.8 billion of equity. But after a bumper 2009, they look to have picked up First Republic for around five times earnings.
Now, just five months after completing their buyout, Colony and General Atlantic are preparing an initial public offering. It values First Republic at about 12 times this year's earnings, based on annualizing the results to September. That's a tad better than larger banks like JPMorgan Chase and looks just right for a bank that caters to the rich, has low loan losses and should be relatively unscathed by new regulations.
To top it off, the valuation would deliver the new owners a tasty 77 percent return. It may not yet be happily ever after, but First Republic has certainly come out of the woods.

HEADLINE: Unemployment and Financial Strains Test a Bronx Family Stalked by Mental Illness

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
In Gladys Rosario's family, mental illness is not just an affliction but a legacy, one that has touched each member in a different way.
Two of Ms. Rosario's brothers, Edwin and Nelson, medicated themselves with intravenous drugs; Edwin died of pancreatic cancer at 31, and Nelson of AIDS at 48.
Ms. Rosario's eldest daughter, Karen DeJesus, is hamstrung by social anxiety and has not attended school since the eighth grade. ''I start shaking and crying; I can't breathe,'' she said. She takes Zoloft and sees a therapist. 
Ms. Rosario's mother, Isabel DeLeon, 75, has schizophrenia, and her mental state is so precarious that Ms. Rosario has not told her of Nelson's death this year. Respecting a deathbed request from her brother, she does not plan to.
''She always dreams about him, and asks me how he's doing, and I have to lie to her,'' Ms. Rosario, 53, said, her voice choked with tears.
For her own bipolar disorder, Ms. Rosario takes medication and undergoes therapy. ''I have two daughters,'' she said. ''I have to live for my daughters.''
For the past six years, Karen, 18, and Michelle DeJesus, 15, their mother and their father, Ralph DeJesus, 54, have shared a modern two-bedroom apartment abutting the Bronx Zoo, with a washing machine and hardwood floors. The apartment costs $1,300 a month, but a Section 8 subsidy covers all but $304.
It is a giant leap forward from the year and a half the family spent in a shelter when the girls were 7 and 10.
''It was real, real hard,'' Ms. Rosario said. ''I cry a lot.''
Mr. DeJesus is an unemployed maintenance worker. His jobless benefits recently ran out after 99 weeks, and Ms. Rosario is unable to work because of her bipolar disorder. The only money coming in are disability payments for Karen and her mother that total $1,000 a month.
When her brother died in February in Puerto Rico, where the family is from, Ms. Rosario sent what little money she had to cover the funeral. She was unable to pay her utility bill and spent two sweltering weeks at the end of August with no electricity.
As she worked her way through the social services maze, she found the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. A social worker there secured $500 to pay the electric bill and to have her utilities restored.
The financial strain is testing Ms. Rosario's 19-year marriage; Mr. DeJesus is staying in Bayonne, N.J. But her troubled marriage is only one of her worries.
''I have no teeth,'' she said. Infection and a critical lack of calcium in her blood led to their gradual loss. ''I need an operation, but I have no money,'' she said.
Ms. Rosario was referring to dental implants, which cost $2,500 to $3,500. Medicaid does not cover the cost of implants, which she was told were her only option. Her toothlessness is not at all apparent. But she knows.
''Sometimes I don't go outside,'' she said. ''I feel real bad.''
HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245. All gifts are acknowledged; special letters are not possible. A check intended for a particular agency should be written to and mailed to the agency, noting that it is a Neediest Cases gift.

HEADLINE: A Solar Installation Spree as the Deadline for Federal Grants Approaches

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
Owners of commercial buildings are rushing in such numbers to meet an end-of-the-year deadline for a federal Treasury grant program for solar energy installations that inventories of some equipment have dried up, solar energy experts said.
Incentives for owners to install solar panels on their warehouses, or even on excess land, have been growing in recent years, with one of the most important being a federal tax credit for 30 percent of the solar project's cost. That credit was converted to a Treasury grant program in February 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Instead of having to wait to take the credit against taxes owed, owners receive a check within 60 days of the project's completion.
As an example, an owner installing a typical 500-kilowatt photovoltaic system on a 100,000-square-foot rooftop at a cost of about $2.2 million would receive $660,000. Depending on how the building is used, that 500-kilowatt system could generate all the building's power or, for high-demand uses like data centers or refrigeration, as little as 2 percent. 
According to a September study by the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance, a group of renewable energy financiers, investment in solar systems nationwide doubled from 2008 to 2010 under the Treasury grant program, going from $3.4 billion to an estimated $6.7 billion by the end of 2010. By Oct. 26, 1,118 solar energy systems had been installed under the grant program, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.
But the federal grant program will expire on Dec. 31. If Congress does not renew it, it will revert to an investment tax credit valid through the end of 2016. Without an extension of the Treasury grant program, industry groups say they expect investment in solar systems to shrink drastically.
Few commercial owners could come up with the capital expenditure necessary without the help of the 30 percent Treasury grant, said Jamie Hahn, a managing director at Solis Partners, a solar developer based in Manasquan, N.J. He said that after Congress established the grant program, the market for solar installations on commercial buildings changed from one in which the installations were mostly owned by investors, who then sold power back to building owners, to one where the business owners themselves did the installations.
''Prior to the cash grant coming out, about 70 percent of large-scale commercial solar projects were owned by third-party investors,'' he said. ''The cash grant made it feasible for actual building owners and companies themselves to own the solar assets.''
Whoever owns the system gets the most benefit, Mr. Hahn said. With federal, state and local subsidies, he said, the investment in a solar system can be extremely attractive. It can even generate income for the business, while locking in or providing free electricity for the 25 years the systems are typically under warranty.
Owners of commercial buildings are lining up to install their solar systems before the grant program expires. Donnelly Mechanical Corporation, a mechanical contractor based in Queens, plans to install a 50-kilowatt system on a 25,000-square-foot building with warehouse and office space, said Robert Ragozine, the company's president. That will reduce the company's electricity bill by about 15 percent.
Mr. Ragozine said he expected to meet the Dec. 31 deadline. To qualify for the grant, either a large enough part of the construction of the solar installation must be completed or 5 percent of the cost must be incurred. But if Donnelly does not make the deadline, Mr. Ragozine said, it will continue with the project and receive the tax credit.
Donnelly's project is intended to maximize incentives. The solar installation is small for the size of the rooftop, but anything larger would not qualify for a solar rebate program, worth $1.75 a watt, offered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
''We could fit more on the roof, but we'll max it out at 50 kilowatts,'' said Mr. Ragozine, whose solar installation will cost about $275,000. ''That's a maximum rebate of $87,500.''
Other perks include a federal tax benefit for depreciating the system over five years instead of 39, he said. Also, New York City allows building owners to deduct 8.75 percent of the solar installation costs over a four-year period from their property taxes, with a maximum of $62,500 in taxes offset, Mr. Ragozine said.
''With the solar installation that we're looking at, we would probably be able to save $11,000 to $12,000 a year off our electric bill,'' he said. ''And with the incentives, we're looking at a payback about Year 4.''
Incentives have greatly shortened the period of time that owners must wait to break even on their investment. LPS Industries, a packaging maker in Moonachie, N.J., worked with Solis Partners to install a system on its 165,000-square-foot rooftop last June at a cost of $5.7 million. Adding in federal and state incentives, LPS anticipates payback in about five years, said Madeleine Robinson, the company's chief executive.
Ms. Robinson said she had been so pleased with the solar installation -- for which she received her 30 percent Treasury grant about 20 days after installation -- that she would like to install a solar farm on adjacent vacant land owned by LPS. The 704-kilowatt system on the roof at LPS now provides almost 25 percent of the company's energy, saving about $10,000 to $20,000 monthly, she said.
Also, New Jersey, instead of offering rebates, has a thriving market for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates, which enable owners of solar installations to sell their clean energy credits to utilities looking to avoid penalties enacted by the state for generators of ''dirtier'' energy. Companies can sell these credits for 15 years after the system's installation.
Other building owners have been scrambling to qualify for the Treasury grant. As a result, crucial equipment, like solar panels and inverters, are on back order, taking as long as eight to 12 weeks to arrive, Mr. Hahn said.
But owners still have time to sign a contract and start a paper trail demonstrating that they have paid for 5 percent of the project by Dec. 31, he said.
Owners who are considering a new roof could qualify for the credit by installing a system made by Solyndra, a solar manufacturer in Fremont, Calif., that uses photovoltaic cylinders that capture light not only from the sun, but also from a reflective white roof. Solyndra has determined that the re-roofing, if done before Dec. 31, can qualify for the Treasury grant -- and the 30 percent grant will include the cost of re-roofing.
Mr. Hahn said the Solyndra system was optimal for owners facing weight constraints because it is light, and for those facing heavy winds because as air flows between the cylinders.
''You might get a roof laid in two weeks,'' Mr. Hahn said, ''and as long as the roof makes up over 5 percent of the project, that would qualify you for the Treasury grant.''

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects Health Law Challenge

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For the second time in two months, a federal judge has upheld the constitutionality of the new health care law, ruling on Tuesday that the requirement that most Americans obtain medical coverage falls within Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce. 
The judge, Norman K. Moon of Federal District Court, who sits in Lynchburg, Va., issued a 54-page ruling that granted the government's request to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Liberty University, the private Christian college founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Last month, in a separate case, Judge George C. Steeh of Federal District Court in Detroit also upheld the law.
Like Judge Steeh, Judge Moon was appointed by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.
Two other federal judges, Henry E. Hudson in Richmond, Va., and Roger Vinson in Pensacola, Fla., are expected to rule in similar cases in the next few months, and each has expressed considerable skepticism about the law's constitutionality. Judge Hudson and Judge Vinson were appointed by Republican presidents.
Lawyers on both sides expect that the Supreme Court may eventually have to decide among conflicting lower-court opinions.
There have been approximately two dozen distinct legal challenges to the law since its enactment in March. The measure is designed to cover the majority of the country's uninsured by requiring that most people have insurance and providing subsidies to make it affordable.
Judge Moon rejected the argument by plaintiffs around the country that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not empower Congress to require Americans to buy a commercial product like health insurance. To do so, they argue, would amount to the regulation of inactivity.
In disagreeing, Judge Moon embraced arguments made by the Justice Department. ''Far from 'inactivity,' '' he wrote, ''by choosing to forgo insurance, plaintiffs are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later, out of pocket, rather than now, through the purchase of insurance.''

HEADLINE: Global Businesses Turn to Sri Lanka, Land of Accountants

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Southern China has its assembly plants. India has customer support centers, research laboratories and low-cost lawyers.
And Sri Lanka's contribution to global outsourcing? Accountants -- thousands of them, standing ready to crunch the world's numbers.
As this tiny island nation staggers back from a bloody, decades-long civil war, one of its brightest business prospects was born from a surprising side effect of that conflict. Many Sri Lankans, for various reasons, studied accounting in such numbers during the war that this nation of about 20 million people now has an estimated 10,000 certified accountants.
An additional 30,000 students are currently enrolled in accounting programs, according to the Sri Lankan Institute of Chartered Accountants. While that ratio is lower than in developed economies like the United States, it is much greater than in Sri Lanka's neighboring outsourcing giant, India.
Offices in Sri Lanka are doing financial work for some of the world's biggest companies, including the international bank HSBC and the insurer Aviva. And it is not simply payroll and bookkeeping. The outsourced work includes derivatives pricing and risk management for money managers and hedge funds, stock research for investment banks and underwriting for insurance companies. 
Many developing countries have ''one particular competency that they do better than anyone else,'' said Duminda Ariyasinghe, an executive director at Sri Lanka's Board of Investment. ''Financial accounting is that door opener for us.''
With widespread use of English and a literacy rate of over 90 percent, along with rock-bottom wages, Sri Lanka hopes to transform its postwar economy from a sleepy tea and textiles island into a tiny, high-end outsourcing powerhouse.
Already there are thousands of other Sri Lankans working in more common outsourcing fields, like information technology and software development. About 50,000 people in Sri Lanka are now employed in one form of outsourcing or another, according to Slasscom, an outsourcing trade group, and that figure is growing by 20 percent a year.
But accounting is Sri Lanka's specialty.
During the war, Sri Lankan certified accountants would often use their skills as a springboard out of the country. That is why there are now Sri Lankans sprinkled among executive suites around the world, including the vice president of global business services at American Express and a financial controller at Standard Chartered Bank in the United Arab Emirates.
Now, though, the government and business community hope the country's young financial whizzes will have reason to stay home instead.
Sri Lanka's government, headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, expects revenue from so-called knowledge-based outsourcing -- which includes accounting -- to triple to $1 billion in revenue by 2015.
The stark wage differences between Sri Lanka and America, or even Sri Lanka and India, are a big part of the country's drawing card.
In the United States, the median annual wage for accountants and auditors in May 2008 was $59,430, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sri Lankan workers in the accounting profession receive an average annual pay package of $5,900, according to a 2010 survey by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
Wages in Sri Lanka for financial outsourcing are about one-third less than in neighboring India, and hiring educated employees is easier in Sri Lanka, according to executives who do business in both countries.
''Skilled talent is accessible,'' said Dushan Soza, managing director of the Sri Lanka office of WNS Global Services, an outsourcing company with about 350 people in the country. Because Sri Lanka's accountants are still a relatively untapped asset on the global market, Mr. Soza said, hiring is easy and turnover is minimal.
In the Indian city Mumbai, companies like his would have to go far out of the city to hire because of the level of competition, he said, but here in Colombo ''two miles from my office is my hiring range.''
Many international executives also quietly admit that Colombo's colonial architecture, excellent seafood restaurants and proximity to miles of sandy beaches make it a more alluring business travel destination than India's outsourcing centers.
Sri Lanka's accounting specialty is rooted in the country's history of colonialism and conflict.
State-financed universities here have traditionally not had enough places for qualified students, and they were often closed intermittently during the war. So students who could afford to attended private schools instead -- in many cases accounting schools with British origins that date to Sri Lanka's independence from Britain in 1948.
Over time, becoming a qualified accountant has become something well-educated, business-minded people in Sri Lanka do in addition to getting a degree in, say, physics or business management.
Now, though, many students choose accounting over another degree. When Nilushika Gunasekera, secured a coveted spot at a public university, she turned it down to go to a privately run accounting school. University students do not get any exposure to a real business environment, she said, and they have several years to ''take things easy.''
''I didn't think going to the university would add value,'' she said.
After accounting school, Ms. Gunasekera joined an outsourcing company doing work in cash management and banking. She now works for the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in Colombo, a trade group.
If the rest of the world discovers Sri Lanka's pool of low-cost accountants, as the government hopes, the country could lose some of its competitive edge because wages will go up and there may not be enough workers to meet the demand.
But the government is offering various other incentives -- including tax breaks, subsidized telecommunications and streamlined procedures for setting up new businesses -- meant to encourage international companies to come here instead of India, Eastern Europe or the Philippines.
As foreign companies ramp up their presence here, local developers are building to accommodate them. In a neighborhood thick with tea warehouses and crossed by rail tracks, Jeevan Gnanam is turning the textile mills his grandfather built into a high-tech outsourcing center.
Orion City, as the development is called, is miles from Colombo's slick World Trade Center skyscrapers, near a canal fringed with rundown buildings and palm trees. But it has already drawn big-name clients, including a division of the publishing giant Pearson and MphasiS, a technology company partly owned by Hewlett-Packard, which has said it will hire 2,000 people here in the next three years.
''Sri Lanka offers us a rich talent base that will allow us to serve our global clients,'' said Dinesh Venugopal, chief corporate development officer for MphasiS.
Ultimately, Orion City will have three million square feet of office and retail space, including a 19-story building, said Mr. Gnanam, 28, who is the chief executive of the consortium that manages the development. It was difficult to convince his father and uncle that technology, not textiles, were Sri Lanka's future, he said, but they have come around recently. Building the industry and attracting foreign investment is crucial, he believes.
''Economic development has to take place,'' he said, ''for people to put the war in the past.''

HEADLINE: ABB to Buy Baldor, a Motor Manufacturer

BYLINE: By CHRIS V. NICHOLSON

 BODY:
The Swiss group ABB is set to buy the Baldor Electric Company, an American motor manufacturer, for $3.1 billion, the companies said on Tuesday in a joint statement
ABB, which specializes in automation, has offered $63.50 a Baldor share as it makes a push into North America. The deal will also give Baldor access to global markets for its industrial electric motors. 
The acquisition is the largest yet for Joseph M. Hogan, the American chief executive ABB brought in more than two years ago from General Electric, a company known for producing managers.
In an interview, Mr. Hogan said ABB had room to grow in the United States, which he said was on the verge of ''reindustrializing'' as it seeks to reinvigorate its economy and upgrade its physical plants.
Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said it did not seem that ABB was gaining access to special technology with the deal, just a toehold with American customers and a manufacturing center that was closer to them.
Mr. Hogan disagreed, pointing to Baldor's low-voltage motors as being ahead of ABB's.
The move into the United States is a shift for ABB, and the result of what its chief executive calls a shift from the company's engineering-oriented focus to a more market-oriented one.
The deal is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2011, and the companies said they expected annual savings of $100 million by 2015. They plan to keep Baldor's management in place and maintain its headquarters in Fort Smith, Ark. ABB will also be taking on Baldor's debt of $1.1 billion.
Baldor, which employs about 7,000 people, reported third-quarter net income of $25.7 million last month, a 104 percent increase from the period a year earlier, when the company was doing poorly as the United States struggled through its recession.
The United States Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is set to take effect on Dec. 19, and Baldor says that will affect the type of electric motors it sells, and how much it earns from them.
The law raises the minimum efficiency of such motors, which Baldor sells at a premium of 20 to 30 percent, and which it expects to make up half its sales. The companies said they expected the American market for the motors to grow 10 to 15 percent next year.
Electric motors are estimated to consume about a third of the world's power.
ABB hired Citigroup as its financial adviser, while Baldor employed UBS.

HEADLINE: SPORTS BRIEFING AUTO RACING; Petty Motorsports, Mired In Debt, Is Sold

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Richard Petty's Nascar business has not proved as legendary as his driving.
In 2008, he sold a majority of Petty Enterprises to the private equity firm Boston Ventures to raise needed capital. About six months later, it merged with Gillett Evernham Motorsports. 
The new business, called Richard Petty Motorsports, has had its woes, none more dire than the majority owner George Gillett Jr.'s default on a reported $90 million in bank loans earlier this year.
So on Tuesday, Petty Motorsports was sold for considerably less than the value of the debt to an investment group comprised of Medallion Financial, DGB Investments and Petty himself. ''It was less than $50 million,'' said Andrew M. Murstein, the president of Medallion Financial, the lead investor, which is best known for financing the purchase of taxi medallions in New York, Boston, Chicago, Newark, Philadelphia and Baltimore.
''In effect,'' Murstein said, ''we got George Gillett's stake by buying the debt.''
He added, ''It's a great business that's been strangled by debt.''
Petty's investment of ''several million dollars'' gave him a one-third stake in the business, Murstein said. Petty will oversee its operations.
''Richard's going to run it,'' Murstein said. ''He knows the business better than we do. You want to hitch your ride to him. He's invigorated.''
Petty Motorsports has cut back to two teams from four, with A. J. Allmendinger and Marcos Ambrose, who moved from JTG Daugherty Racing. The company released an increasingly unhappy Kasey Kahne from his contract -- he jumped quickly to Red Bull Racing, and will move to Hendrick Motorsports starting in 2012 -- and Elliott Sadler has left for Kevin Harvick Inc.
Murstein said that without the debt, Petty Motorsports's finances were solid, with $30 million in sponsorships locked up. The Stanley Tools sponsorship of Sadler's car has shifted to Ambrose's, and an extension of Best Buy's sponsorship of Allmendinger's car is being negotiated.
Murstein has coveted a sports franchise for a few years; he raised $215 million in a public offering in 2008, was an early bidder for the Chicago Cubs, and looked at the Montreal Canadiens.
In 2010, having made no acquisitions, the fund was liquidated.
High debt, mixed with the recession, has led to the recent sale of two high-profile sports teams.
After defaulting on $525 million in debt on the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Stars in 2009, Tom Hicks filed for Chapter 11 protection before the Rangers were sold in a federal bankruptcy court auction to a group led by Nolan Ryan and Chuck Greenberg for $593 million.
In England, Hicks and Gillett were forced to sell Liverpool F.C. in October for about $480 million after they were unable to refinance $445 million in debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland.

HEADLINE: Back-Scratching With a Global Reach

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The United States is overwhelmingly the best candidate to hold the 2022 World Cup of soccer.
Which may not matter.
The American bid will be judged by FIFA, the world soccer body, whose expressed idealism often scurries around the corner and merges with crassness.
In classic form, FIFA has ensured that vote-trading is inevitable on Thursday, when members will choose from among four European entries (two are joint bids) for the 2018 World Cup and from among five candidates for the 2022 tournament. 
Voting will be a trifle light in Zurich because two of the 24 potential voters on the executive committee have been suspended for appearing all too willing to take gifts from bidding nations during a sting operated by a British newspaper. Four former FIFA executive members were also suspended.
On Tuesday, FIFA's president, Sepp Blatter, stonewalled the suggestion that FIFA postpone the vote after the BBCreported on Monday that bribes were paid to three executives, from Brazil, Cameroon and Paraguay, who will be voting Thursday. The money is said to have gone through International Sport and Leisure, the defunct marketing arm of FIFA. On Tuesday, FIFA issued a statement that the case was beyond the statute of limitations, a highly reassuring view of FIFA ethics.
Putting the two bids in the same process has guaranteed previously unknown alliances among the candidates -- England, Russia and joint ventures from Belgium/the Netherlands and Spain/Portugal for 2018; and the United States, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Qatar for 2022.
The assumption in recent years was that England -- the mother ship of soccer -- was due to host the World Cup for the first time since 1966. Lately, Russian money and power has asserted itself, and financially strapped Spain and Portugal have been rumored to form a new and special friendship with oil-rich Qatar and the South American voters, giving the United States cause to be quite nervous.
For most nations, hosting the World Cup is a dubious prize, as proved by the recent World Cup in South Africa, which mustered great talent and energy but was stuck with new stadiums yawningly empty in the aftermath.
Major sports events are often ruinous to the fragile economies of the hosts -- Greece after the 2004 Olympics comes to mind. The rising economic power Brazil is holding the 2014 World Cup and Rio de Janeiro is hosting the 2016 Olympics, and we will see how that works out.
FIFA is on record that it wants to move the World Cup from continent to continent -- admirable on one level, risky on another. Some European nations with modern stadiums and rail systems and hotels could hold the World Cup on six months' notice, but the economic meltdown in Spain and Portugal could be a warning to the delegates, or not.
The United States would seem to be a no-brainer for 2022; it sold a record 3.5 million tickets during a highly successful World Cup in 1994.
The United States is proposing to sell an unprecedented five million tickets in stadiums that are already built, using hotels and roads already in place.
Which may not count for much.
Americans also bought copious numbers of tickets to the South African World Cup while stay-at-homes packed urban pubs for just about every game. Also, the American national team has played in six consecutive World Cups, getting past the first round three times.
Which may be almost as irrelevant as the claim that another World Cup would help build the United States as a soccer power.
One impediment to an American World Cup is that FIFA loves American dollars and American vacations, but cannot control American government and American corporations the way it does in other parts of the world.
FIFA, ever crafty, noted in its evaluation that the United States government had not provided written assurance of financial support for 2022. One would like to think FIFA leaders are sophisticated enough to know the United States already has more than enough American football stadiums in place, needing only to remodel the corners to allow for the wider soccer field.
The United States is not a walkover for 2022. Japan and South Korea, co-hosts in 2002, are probably blocked by China's potential candidacy for 2026. Everybody loves Australia, but its distant time zones may be inconvenient for television.
Then there is Qatar, which has never qualified for a World Cup but is perfectly willing to build as many as nine new stadiums in a cluster by 2022, and dismantle most of them after the last whistle, and move them to disadvantaged countries. Qatar is talking up a green World Cup, but at the same time is promising to air-condition stadiums against 110-degree Fahrenheit temperatures, which somehow does not sound very green.
The vote in Zurich will be complicated by celebrity lobbyists, a growing trend. In 2004, the frail Nelson Mandela was forced to fly to Trinidad and Tobago to lobby a World Cup vote from the manipulative delegate Jack Warner. In 2005, Tony Blair, the British prime minister, flew to Singapore and worked the room of Olympic delegates, helping London gain the 2012 Games over Paris.
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia attended the subsequent vote for the 2014 Winter Games, and the city of Sochi was chosen over a more prepared region of South Korea.
Last year, Brazil's president traveled to Copenhagen to support Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympics, and President Obama flew there to represent Chicago. It was Rio's time, South America's time, and only a political opponent could fault Obama for sticking up for a great American city.
This time, England will be represented by Prince William, David Beckham and Prime Minister David Cameron. Putin is expected to attend, as is the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and top officials of other countries.
Former President Bill Clinton and the actor Morgan Freeman (who portrayed Mandela in the film ''Invictus'') are traveling to Zurich as the face of the American bid. Clinton has been an enthusiastic supporter, particularly in South Africa, where he celebrated with the players after the last-minute rally against Algeria.
''He is one of a handful of truly global figures who is highly respected,'' said Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation.
How helpful can this well-known former American president be in the thicket of FIFA?
''President Clinton has been in politics and knows how to approach an election,'' Gulati said, adding, ''This is, after all, an election.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices Falling at Faster Rate, New Report Shows

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The decline in home prices is accelerating across the nation, according to a new report, and a record number of foreclosures is expected to push prices down further through next year.
But a second report released on Tuesday indicated that consumer confidence in the economy rose in November to the highest level in five months amid some more hopeful signs.
The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released Tuesday fell 0.7 percent in September from August. Eighteen of the 20 cities recorded price declines. 
Cleveland recorded the biggest drop, 3 percent from a month earlier. Prices in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, which had been showing strength this year, also dropped in September from August.
Washington and Las Vegas were the only metro areas to post gains in monthly prices.
The 20-city index has risen 5.9 percent from its April 2009 bottom. But it remains nearly 28.6 percent below the peak, in July 2006. And home prices have fallen in 15 of the 20 cities in the last year.
Prices rose in many cities from April through July, mostly helped by government tax credits that have since expired.
The national quarterly index, which measures home prices in nine regions of the country, dropped 2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter.
In the other report, the Conference Board said that its Consumer Confidence Index for November rose to 54.1 points, up from a revised 49.9 in October. Analysts were expecting 52.0. November's reading is the highest since June's 54.3.
The November reading is the highest since June, when the index stood at 54.3 just as the economy's recovery started to lose momentum. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected 52.0.
It takes a level of 90 to indicate a healthy economy, which has not been approached since the recession began in December 2007.
One component of the index, how Americans feel now about the economy, rose to 24, up from 23.5. The other gauge, which measures how American feel about the economy over the next six months, rose to 74.2, up from 67.5 last month.
''Consumer confidence is now at its highest level in five months, a welcome sign as we enter the holiday season,'' Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said in a statement. ''Consumers' assessment of the current state of the economy and job market, while only slightly better than last month, suggests the economy is still expanding, albeit slowly. Hopefully, the improvement in consumers' mood will continue in the months ahead.''
Others were less optimistic.
''The rise in consumer confidence in November is not consistent with a sustained acceleration in consumption growth at a time when income growth is weak, the unemployment rate is high and a double dip in house prices is under way,'' said Paul Dales, United States economist at Capital Economics.
The consumer confidence index, which measures how respondents feel about business conditions, the job market and the economy over the next six months, has recovered fitfully since hitting a record low of 25.3 in February 2009. Economists watch confidence closely because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity and is crucial to a strong rebound. The improved confidence mirrors an increase in spending in November, fueled by early discounting on holiday goods that lured shoppers into stores.
The Conference Board's index, based on a random survey mailed to 5,000 households from Nov. 1 to Nov. 19, showed that worries about jobs eased, but that concern remained high.

HEADLINE: WORLD BRIEFING MIDDLE EAST; Iran: Date Set for Nuclear Talks With European Union

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YONG and J. DAVID GOODMAN; William Yong reported from Tehran, and J. David Goodman from New York. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iran and the European Union agreed Tuesday on a date for nuclear talks in Geneva next week, but President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insisted in a speech that Iran would not give ''one iota'' in the discussions. 
The meeting between Saeed Jalili, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, and Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, would be the first high-level negotiations in more than a year and would follow revelations, in leaked diplomatic communications, of widespread concern among Iran's Arab neighbors about the nation's nuclear program.
The agreement on when to hold the meeting came a day after the killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran.
Speaking to a crowd of supporters in northern Iran on Tuesday, Mr. Ahmadinejad took a hard stance ahead of the talks. Iran had always been willing to talk ''under the conditions of justice and respect,'' he said, but added that ''the people of Iran will not back down one iota'' on demands to curb the nation's nuclear program, which Iran claims is directed only at nonmilitary purposes.
Mr. Ahmadinejad appeared to frame the Geneva meeting, scheduled for Dec. 6 and 7, in terms of the economic sanctions imposed by the Western powers. ''I advise that if they want to get results from these talks, they must put aside their outdated behavior'' in order to talk ''about international cooperation, solving the problems of humanity and about economic and nuclear issues,'' he said in a speech that was broadcast on state television.
In the view of American and European officials, the new willingness by Iran to engage in talks may indicate that new and tougher sanctions, approved this year, are having an effect on its troubled economy.
Officials from the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain are expected to attend the meeting, although Ms. Ashton said she would negotiate with Iran ''on behalf'' of those six nations, her office said in a statement confirming the meeting. On Monday, attackers riding motorcycles killed one prominent Iranian nuclear scientist and wounded another in separate bombings in Tehran. The scientist who survived, Fereydoon Abbasi, is on the United Nations Security Council's sanctions list for ties to the nuclear effort, and the highly targeted nature of the attacks led to accusations of a renewed effort by the United States and Israel to disrupt Iran's program.
In diplomatic cables revealed by the Web site WikiLeaks on Sunday, Arab allies of the United States, including King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, candidly voiced concerns over the leadership of Mr. Ahmadinejad and Iran's path on nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: U.S. and South Korea Balk at Talks With North

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER AND SHARON LaFRANIERE. 
Helene Cooper reported from Washington, and Sharon LaFraniere from Seoul, South Korea. Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States, South Korea and Japan are all balking at China's request for emergency talks with North Korea over the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, as high-profile military exercises between South Korea and the United States in the Yellow Sea continued on Monday in a show of force.
Obama administration officials said that a return to the table with North Korea, as China sought this weekend, would be rewarding the North for provocative behavior over the past week, including its deadly artillery attack on a South Korean island and its disclosure of a uranium enrichment plant. Beijing called for emergency talks with North Korea, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Russia, participants in the six-party nuclear talks, which have been suspended indefinitely.
''The United States and a host of others, I don't think, are not interested in stabilizing the region through a series of P.R. activities,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman. 
He said that the talks ''without an understanding and agreement from the North Koreans to both end their behavior as they exhibited last week, but also to come to the table with a seriousness of purpose on the denuclearization issue -- without that seriousness of purpose, they're just a P.R. activity.''
Rejecting the emergency talks amounts to a pointed rebuke to China. The United States wanted China to signal clearly that North Korea's aggressive behavior would not be tolerated. Instead, Beijing remained neutral about who was responsible for the recent flare-up, and offered only to provide a venue for all sides to air their differences.
Yet turning down China's offer may also reveal the limited options available to the Obama administration and the South Korean leadership. Aside from a show of military solidarity, the two countries have based their response largely on hopes that China, as the North's main economic and diplomatic supporter, might punish the reclusive government for its series of provocations.
Mr. Gibbs and other administration officials said that the United States also wanted to see North Korea take steps to denuclearize, which most Asia analysts said might be a tall order for the North at a time when its government is undergoing a leadership crisis.
South Korea and Japan are also clearly skeptical of whether the consultations, as suggested by the Chinese, are worth a try. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea and Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan on Monday both denounced what they called North Korea's brutality.
President Lee pointedly said nothing about the Chinese proposal; analysts in Seoul described it as disappointingly familiar. A spokesman for the Japanese prime minister said that while Japan is cautiously reviewing China's offer, talks hinge on whether North Korea changes it behavior.
It remains unclear just what the United States would actually accept from North Korea to return to talks. One Obama administration official said that the United States wanted a clear sign that the North ''will stop provocative behavior.''
''We're trying to get out of this cycle where they act up and we talk,'' the official said. He spoke on grounds of anonymity under diplomatic rules.
Emotions continued to run high on Tuesday in both Seoul and Pyongyang. In an editorial in the government-run newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea threatened to step its uranium enrichment program. North Korean officials last week unveiled a surprisingly sophisticated enrichment plant north of the capital to an American scientist.
The editorial said the uranium development ''will be pushed harder'' to meet North Korea's energy needs, according to a report by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. But scientists say the plant with 2,000 centrifuges could be quickly converted to produce highly enriched uranium for bomb fuel and South Korean analysts interpreted the editorial as a not-so-veiled threat.
In Seoul, police officials said up to 10,000 protesters gathered in two plazas to demand that their government take a stronger stand against the North. Military veterans, retired police officers and activists carried pickets and banners calling for retaliation against the North during the three-hour protests.
''We came to show our commitment to overthrow Kim Jong-il. We have to show it in action,'' said Lee Jae-myung. 63, a retired police officer who traveled with about 100 former officers two hours by train to participate in the rally.
On the diplomatic front, two North Korean envoys arrived in Beijing for four days of talks. Choe Thae-bok, secretary of the Workers' Party of North Korea's Central Committee, and Kim Yong-il, director of the party's international department.
Separately, South Korea's military appeared to step back from one confrontational stance on Monday , canceling live-fire artillery drills on the island in the Yellow Sea attacked by the North a week ago.
While the military exercises continued, the prospect of the South Korean live-fire drills -- scheduled for Tuesday but canceled within four hours of the announcement -- had been sharpening tensions on a peninsula on tenterhooks after the North's artillery attack last week on a garrison island that is also home to about 1,350 civilians, mainly fishermen. The attack killed two South Korean marines and two civilians, and wounded 18 people.
North Korea blamed the South for provoking the attack by firing at it from the island, Yeonpyeong, which lies in waters disputed by the two sides. The South, which returned fire, insisted it had been firing only test shots and that none were in territory it recognized as the North's.
The United States announced the date of the joint exercises as an immediate response. China -- which the United States, South Korea and other countries hoped would act to calm the North -- responded by warning the United States not to operate in waters it claims as a sovereign zone.
In Washington, the Pentagon cited security concerns and declined to say precisely where in the Yellow Sea the exercises were taking place. But a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity acknowledged that some of the exercises might be within 200 nautical miles of the Chinese coast. China defines that zone as within its exclusive sovereignty, but the United States and many other nations do not recognize its claim. ''We have a large operating area and some of it may be, and some of it may not be'' within 200 miles of China's eastern border, the official said.
South Korea naval authorities on Yeonpyeong warned residents by loudspeaker on Monday afternoon that they should move to bomb shelters by 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning because live-fire drills would take place at 10 a.m.
But Monday night, they announced that no firing would take place. A South Korean military official declined to explain the shift, saying only that the exercise ''will be conducted at an appropriate time.''
At the United Nations, the Obama administration called for tighter enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. The Security Council met on Monday to discuss the crisis, but did not emerge with any new plans for what to do next, further reflecting the mounting frustration in the international community over how to rein in North Korea.
Diplomats said that at the moment, the most they could do was to try to make sure countries enforce existing sanctions against North Korea, including an arms embargo and a travel ban against people linked to the country's nuclear weapons program.
Susan E. Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that the United States looked ''to China to play a responsible leadership role in working to maintain peace and security in that region.''
White House officials said last week that Mr. Obama planned to call President Hu Jintao of China to discuss the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Gibbs said Monday afternoon that the call had not happened yet.

HEADLINE: College Campuses Are Producing a New Style of AIDS Activist

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- David Carel was never a rabble-rouser. But amid the clutter of his dorm room at Yale University, Mr. Carel, baby-faced and slight-shouldered at 19, keeps evidence of his new life as an AIDS activist: posters, banners and the flier demanding ''$50 bn for Global AIDS'' that he concealed in his fleece jacket one Saturday in late October when, heart pounding, he sneaked past security into a Democratic campaign rally in Bridgeport.
There, Mr. Carel did something he ''never would have imagined'': he heckled the president of the United States.
Cameron Nutt, a medical anthropology student at Dartmouth, says he backs President Obama ''100 percent.'' But, incensed over the president's ''failure to remain true'' to a campaign promise to spend $50 billion over five years fighting the AIDS epidemic overseas, Mr. Nutt disrupted Mr. Obama this fall at a Boston rally. His co-protesters included Luke Messac, a University of Pennsylvania medical student and a field organizer for Mr. Obama's presidential campaign, and Krishna Prabhu, a Harvard University senior who caucused for Mr. Obama in Iowa in 2008 -- and rescheduled his final exam in global health to attend the president's inauguration. 
''The promise has not been fulfilled,'' Mr. Prabhu said, sounding more disappointed than angry.
Roughly a quarter-century after gay men rose up to demand better access to H.I.V. medicines, a new breed of AIDS advocate is growing up on college campuses. Unlike the first generation of patient-activists, this latest crop is composed of budding public health scholars. They are mostly heterosexual. Rare is the one who has lost friends or family members to the disease. Rather, studying under some of the world's most prominent health intellectuals, they have witnessed the epidemic's toll during summers or semesters abroad, in AIDS-ravaged nations like Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.
College activism, and AIDS activism in particular, is nothing new. On Wednesday, World AIDS Day, students across the nation will participate in speeches, fund-raisers and the like. But a loose-knit band of about two dozen Ivy Leaguers, mostly from Harvard and Yale, is using more confrontational tactics, as well as some high-powered connections, to wangle encounters with top White House officials in a determined, and seemingly successful, effort to get under Mr. Obama's skin.
Their protests -- which have drawn a sharp rebuke from the president (not to mention some disapproving parents) -- come as many in the AIDS advocacy community are wondering aloud whether Mr. Obama is as devoted to their cause as his immediate predecessor, George W. Bush. In 2003, Mr. Bush began vastly increasing spending on lifesaving antiretroviral medicines for AIDS patients in impoverished nations; the number receiving the drugs has shot up from 50,000 to more than five million today. Yet the World Health Organization says as many as 10 million lack needed therapy.
While spending on global AIDS has gone up on Mr. Obama's watch, and the United States remains the world's largest contributor to such programs, independent analysts say that the rate of increase has slowed significantly and that it will be difficult for the president to keep his $50 billion pledge -- or even meet a lesser goal, set in 2008 by Congress, of $48 billion for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by 2013. The task may grow even harder under a new Congress, with the incoming House Republican majority intent on cutting spending and Tea Party-backed Republicans in both chambers expressing skepticism about all types of foreign aid.
Still, armed with data from Health Gap, an AIDS advocacy group, the students are determined to hold Mr. Obama to his word. When Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and health adviser to the president (and brother of the former White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel) spoke at Yale two weeks ago, he wound up sparring with Mr. Carel at a fruit-and-cereal breakfast at the campus Hillel House, a meal arranged by a fellow Yale student, Dr. Emanuel's daughter. Later that day, Mr. Carel led a demonstration outside Dr. Emanuel's talk, which ended with students chanting at the adviser as they followed him down the street.
When Eric Goosby, Mr. Obama's global AIDS coordinator, traveled to Boston in November for a panel discussion with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, he was collared at a cocktail party by Mr. Prabhu, the Harvard senior. Also on the panel was Mr. Prabhu's professor, Dr. Paul E. Farmer, founder of the global nonprofit Partners in Health.
''These students are my retirement plan,'' Dr. Farmer said in a telephone interview from Haiti, where he is treating cholera patients. ''A lot of them are doing much more than going to protests; they're writing papers and articles, they're doing graduate studies.''
Mr. Messac, the University of Pennsylvania medical student, explored the origins of Mr. Bush's AIDS program in a 120-page paper, ''Lazarus at America's Doorstep,'' for his Harvard undergraduate thesis. Mr. Carel, who spent last summer working at a hospital in the rural South African village of Tugela Ferry, now studies Zulu and persuaded a visiting professor from South Africa to let him take her upper-level course on ''the political economy of AIDS.'' (He had to skip Zulu class for the Emanuel protest; he said his professor understood.)
The students have also befriended a longtime veteran of the AIDS wars, Gregg Gonsalves, who at 47 is completing his undergraduate degree in evolutionary biology on a full scholarship at Yale. Mr. Gonsalves often lectures public-health classes on what he calls ''ancient history'' -- the work of groups like Act Up in the 1990s.
''Theirs is not a first-person commitment, in the sense that none of them is living with H.I.V.,'' Mr. Gonsalves said of the new AIDS protesters. ''It's all based out of a sense of solidarity and social justice. I used to wonder where the next generation would come from. They're here.''
Inside the White House, Dr. Emanuel, for one, is not impressed. He says the students are serving up tired arguments about dollar amounts that ignore the Obama administration's emphasis on spending money more efficiently and offering services, like circumcision, that can reduce the spread of H.I.V. While Mr. Bush emphasized AIDS and malaria, Mr. Obama is promoting a six-year, $63 billion ''global health initiative'' that seeks to address a range of diseases, with emphasis on women and children.
''To be honest, and this is no put-down to the sincerity of the students, I didn't hear a new argument that I haven't heard for months,'' Dr. Emanuel said in an interview after his breakfast with Mr. Carel. ''I've not seen a blog post on the number of people we have circumcised, or the number of mothers we treat in maternal-child health. Those are real performance measures.''
Dr. Emanuel would not discuss any conversations with the president about the students, but Mr. Obama's reaction when he was disrupted in October at the rally in Bridgeport made clear he was irked. ''You've been appearing at every rally we've been doing,'' the president complained, telling them it was not ''a useful strategy.''
The students were pleased that he addressed them directly, but their heckling prompted even some fellow AIDS activists to take issue with their tactics. Regan Hofmann, editor in chief of Poz, a magazine for people living with or affected by H.I.V., questioned the wisdom of disrupting the president on the eve of a critical election for Democrats.
Mr. Carel says he and his fellow protesters thought long and hard about that. It was his first demonstration; his parents told him they wished he would be ''more respectful.'' His friends were shocked. Still, he says it was worth it.
''There are very few ways we could have any access to him,'' he explained. ''This was a way to get Obama's ear.''

HEADLINE: Groups Make Late Push to Salvage Bill Aiding Illegal Immigrant Students

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Immigrant advocate groups have mobilized across the country in what they call a last-ditch effort to persuade Congress to pass a bill that would grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant students, pressing for action in the remaining weeks when Democrats control both houses of Congress.
The groups held marches, hunger strikes, prayer vigils and protests at lawmakers' offices on Monday and Tuesday in support of the bill, which they call the Dream Act. Opponents are also in high gear, swamping some senators who have not disclosed their positions with faxes and phone calls. 
A vote on the bill has not been scheduled, but Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has said he could bring it up as early as this week. While its prospects do not look strong, both sides expect that any measure to legalize illegal immigrants would have far slimmer chances in Congress next year, when Republicans will have a majority in the House and increased strength in the Senate.
''We see this as our best opportunity now to get something done,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group that favors the bill.
''Since they are giving it everything, so are we,'' said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, which seeks reduced immigration and opposes the student bill. He said his group had delivered more than 650,000 faxes to lawmakers in recent days.
''We think if we beat this one we won't have to deal with amnesty for many years to come,'' Mr. Beck said, referring to legalization legislation.
At the San Antonio offices of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, 15 protesters supporting the bill were arrested Monday night, charged with trespassing. In a statement, Ms. Hutchison, a Republican, said that she had asked that the students be escorted from her office without arrests, but that they had resisted.
Ms. Hutchison does not support the student bill in its current form, the statement said.
In California on Tuesday, caravans of students, immigrants and labor union members stopped at offices across the state of eight Republican and four Democratic House members, demanding that they declare support for the legislation. An estimated 550,000 illegal immigrant students in California could be eligible for legal status under the bill, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group.
In Washington State, immigrant and farm worker groups demonstrated outside the offices of Republican House members. In Washington, D.C., illegal immigrant students marched into an Army recruiting station and asked to enlist. Immigrants who lack legal status are currently prohibited from joining the armed forces.
University presidents in the Northeast and Illinois signed letters of support or attended campus rallies, including leaders at Brown, Harvard, M.I.T. and Northwestern. A coalition of immigrant groups and unions announced a radio and print advertising campaign this week focused on undecided senators from five states.
In the past the bill has enjoyed broader support than other immigration measures because it would benefit young people who were brought to this country illegally by their parents and have generally performed well in school. It would open a path to legal status for illegal immigrant high school graduates who came to the United States before they were 16 years old, have been here for at least five years and have no criminal record, provided they complete two years of college or military service.
But prayers and demonstrations did not appear to be attracting any swell of support to the bill. One of its firmest adversaries, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, took the lead in marshaling opposition, sending out action alerts detailing a 10-point critique of the bill. He said it would give safe harbor to some immigrants with criminal records and could benefit illegal immigrants who were no longer youths.
Senator Reid is fulfilling a promise from his recent re-election campaign by bringing up the student bill for a vote. His re-election victory came in large part from Latino votes. President Obama has said he wants to see the bill passed now, and Arne Duncan, his secretary of education, has been promoting it in public appearances.
''I think we are fundamentally wrong on this as a nation,'' Mr. Duncan said in a call Monday with reporters. Illegal immigrant students ''have played by all the rules, gone to school, worked hard, full attendance. Then they graduate and the doors of opportunity basically slam shut,'' he said.
But Republican lawmakers seemed in no hurry to give the Democrats a triumph during the lame-duck session. Some of the protests in support of the bill took place at the Utah offices of Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican who was one of the first sponsors of the bill, early in the decade.
''Knowing full well it won't become law, Democrats are cynically using this legislation for political purposes to curry favor with a political constituency,'' said Antonia Ferrier, his spokeswoman. She said Mr. Hatch wanted to focus in the current session on tax-cut legislation and other economic issues.

HEADLINE: Debt-Busting Issue May Force Obama Off Fence

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
When President Obama's fiscal commission offers its proposals on Wednesday, after the release by several liberal groups of their own debt-busting plans this week, the essential decision facing Mr. Obama in these last two years of his term will have been neatly framed. He can side either with centrist reformers in both parties, who would overhaul both cherished entitlements and the tax system, or with traditional liberals, who prefer new levies on the wealthy and substantial cuts in military spending.
In other words, the suddenly pressing issue of the debt will force Mr. Obama to choose, at last, between the dueling, ill-defined promises of his presidential campaign -- between a ''postpartisan'' vision of government on one hand and a liberal renaissance on the other. 
Partisans on either side in Washington, of course, would tell you that Mr. Obama has already made this decision -- although they differ on which side he's chosen.
Republicans depict the president as having governed just to the left of Hugo Chavez, nationalizing companies while centralizing power in the hands of the federal bureaucracy. Liberals complain that Mr. Obama has time and again abandoned his party's principles in search of some centrist consensus that doesn't exist, and they point to his creating a bipartisan fiscal commission as a case in point.
In truth, though, Mr. Obama has almost invariably sought to position himself halfway between traditionalism and reform, just as his vague notions of ''hope'' and ''change'' during the 2008 campaign were meant to appeal simultaneously to both disaffected independent voters and core progressives. And in virtually every case, he has satisfied pretty much no one.
Take the example of Mr. Obama's first initiative, the roughly $800 billion stimulus bill, which independent and conservative voters revile as a huge government handout, while liberals deride it as too small and too timid. Or look at the health care law, which struck independents as liberal overreach and yet bitterly disappointed the left because it didn't include a government-run plan. Just where Mr. Obama actually lives on the ideological continuum -- that is, exactly what kind of Democrat he sees when he looks in the mirror to examine his busted lip -- is the most vexing question of his presidency.
The body of Mr. Obama's writing and experiences before he became a presidential candidate would suggest that he is instinctively pragmatic, typical of an emerging generation that sees all political dogma -- be it '60s liberalism or '80s conservatism -- as anachronistic. Privately, Mr. Obama has described himself, at times, as essentially a Blue Dog Democrat, referring to the shrinking caucus of fiscally conservative members of the party.
In a 2005 blog post that may be as valuable as either of his books in identifying the inner president, then-Senator Obama castigated his own party's ideological activists for their attacks on Democratic senators who had voted to confirm John G. Roberts Jr. as chief justice. ''To the degree that we brook no dissent within the Democratic Party, and demand fealty to the one, 'true' progressive vision for our country, we risk the very thoughtfulness and openness to new ideas that are required to move this country forward,'' Mr. Obama, who voted against confirming Chief Justice Roberts, wrote then.
At the same time, Mr. Obama has been loath to publicly disown his base on any specific issue, even where he disagreed and where his political prospects might have benefited. And this probably says more about his personal philosophy than it does about his ideology.
You have to remember that Mr. Obama first entered politics in Illinois in the mid-1990s, when ''triangulation,'' as practiced by Bill Clinton, was becoming a vile curse word in liberal circles. Mr. Clinton had repeatedly solidified his own standing by putting a good bit of distance between himself and his own supporters on the left -- a tactic liberals found both dispiriting and distasteful.
Part of the contrast Mr. Obama sought to draw with Hillary Rodham Clinton during the 2008 campaign was that you would never catch him triangulating against his friends for political gain. It was a point of pride for Mr. Obama that he would have no so-called Sister Souljah moments, even when he vehemently disagreed with liberals.
The problem with this stance, two years into his presidency, is that it seems to have put Mr. Obama in something of a box. Since he isn't willing to break publicly with liberals, independent and conservative voters tend to see him as a tool of the left. And since he generally won't do exactly what the left wants him to do, he ends up with very little gratitude from his own party.
This political no-man's land, however, is about to become uninhabitable. The national debt is near the top of any list of voter concerns at the moment, and when his commission votes Friday on its final recommendations, Mr. Obama will be handed concrete and contrasting options for addressing it.
Budget experts from both parties agree, for instance, with the commission's co-chairmen, Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson, that some reduction in Social Security benefits will be essential to the nation's long-term fiscal stability. But liberal groups are adamant about preventing any change to the structure of the program, which they see as the last unassailable pillar of New Deal liberalism.
Should Mr. Obama embrace the commissioners' argument on Social Security, the sense of betrayal on the left will be so intense that he could conceivably draw a primary challenge over it in 2012.
Another critical question is whether Mr. Obama will embrace some overhaul of the tax code that leads not just to broader payroll taxes but also to reductions in income tax rates in return for eliminating many tax breaks, as the commission's chairmen suggested in their initial draft. Liberals propose raising taxes on wealthier Americans and businesses instead.
Mr. Obama's opening move this week in the fast-forming budget debate was to propose a freeze in salaries for federal employees -- a classic, Obama-like gambit that mildly annoyed the left and will do little to assuage public fears about spending. More consequential decisions are coming, however, and they will tell us much about the kind of president Mr. Obama still intends to be.

HEADLINE: Economic Policy? More Listen to Conservatives

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republican economists are back in vogue.
The Republican takeover of the House has energized scholars and researchers whose views on taxes, regulation and the proper scope of government fell out of favor after Democrats swept control of Congress in 2006 and took the White House two years later.
At the libertarian Cato Institute, a daylong conference this month on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy drew a standing-room-only crowd. Scholars at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University are suddenly in demand by journalists and Congressional aides. 
And just days after midterm elections delivered what President Obama called a shellacking for his party, the free-market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, a major source of policy ideas for Republicans, organized a half-day discussion on scaling back the health care overhaul, cutting spending and reducing the size of government.
The heightened activity by conservative economists is hardly a victory parade. With Democrats in control of the Senate and the White House, legislative proposals from House Republicans could turn out to be symbolic irritants to Mr. Obama instead of serious policy options.
But the change in the intellectual mood appears to be substantial and could sway the debate on issues, including trade and financial regulation, that do not always fall along neat partisan lines.
''Even if the next two years do not result in legislative compromises on taxes or entitlement reform or other issues, we will see a vigorous and open debate in Congress about economic policy -- a huge change from the Obama administration's closed-minded and self-righteous approach,'' said Phillip L. Swagel, who was assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy from 2006 to 2009 under President George W. Bush.
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who is in line to be speaker of the House, has assembled a kitchen cabinet of economic advisers who have served as a sounding board over the last few months. Core members of the group include:
Allan H. Meltzer, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the leading historian of the Fed, who has sharply criticized the central bank's conduct of monetary policy under its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke;
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who sits on the commission that is investigating the causes of the 2008 financial crisis and is due to deliver its report in January;
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor who worked in the Bush White House and helped devise the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, major provisions of which will expire at the end of this year unless they are extended by Congress;
Kevin A. Hassett, a tax policy expert and former Fed researcher who directs economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and, like Mr. Holtz-Eakin, advised Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, during his run for the presidency in 2008; and
Donald B. Marron Jr., who directs the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, and was an adviser to Mr. Bush.
But for all the credentials of those advisers, Mr. Boehner has not put forward many specifics of the Republican economic agenda.
Indeed, the ''Pledge to America,'' the policy document that House Republicans released in September, was criticized for its vagueness; it largely avoided specific proposals that might anger voters.
It called for a ban on tax increases, a tax deduction for small businesses and a reduction in government regulations. However, its proposals for paring the budget deficit -- canceling unspent stimulus funds, ending government control of the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, capping new discretionary spending and rooting out wasteful programs -- are hardly sufficient to get the nation onto a fiscally sustainable path, as a number of nonpartisan analyses have pointed out.
''I don't see a comprehensive statement of Republican policy,'' said Murray L. Weidenbaum, who was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the first two years of the Reagan administration. ''I've read the agenda. The artwork's the best part of it. My favorite part is the cowboy on his horse, twirling his lariat.'' (The photo takes up Page 19 of the 48-page document.)
Similarly, Mr. Hassett said the ''Pledge to America'' did not contain enough details on spending cuts. He also said that Republicans should focus their efforts on overhauling the tax system -- including lowering corporate tax rates -- rather than trying to preserve all the Bush-era tax cuts.
''The Bush tax cuts have become a black hole that has attracted, with deep gravitational force, all of the debate about taxation,'' he said. ''The tax code needs to be fixed, and we need to stop obsessing over where it was yesterday.''
Where the economists and the lawmakers are in broad agreement is their emphasis on cutting taxes and regulation to spur growth, rather than pursuing additional spending along the lines of the Obama administration's stimulus effort, a target of Republican attacks.
''I think the stimulus didn't work, not because it was too small but because it was imprudently designed,'' Mr. Hassett said.
Mr. Meltzer called for fiscal retrenchment, not expansion.
''It's clear that there has to be a budget reduction, that it should be comprehensive and that it should involve the Medicare and Medicaid programs,'' Mr. Meltzer said. ''I also think that the biggest single thing the administration and the Congress could do to get the economy back stronger would be to put a moratorium on new regulations.''
Mr. Meltzer said he believed that uncertainty over taxes and regulations was the greatest factor holding back business investment. The United States Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby that spent heavily to defeat Democrats in the midterm elections, has repeatedly made the same argument.
Tony Fratto, who was a spokesman for the Treasury Department and the Bush White House and is now a strategist focused on economic and regulatory matters, said Republican lawmakers were seeking practical advice.
Their situation is not comparable to that of the Republicans who took control of Congress in 1994 ''in either emotions or expectations,'' he said.
''They're just much more realistic and pragmatic,'' he said. ''House Republicans can fight a rhetorical battle here -- lay out markers and bills on their side -- but they're under no illusion that what they get through the House will get through the Senate and pass muster with the White House.''

HEADLINE: G.M. to Hire 1,000 to Engineer More Electric Cars

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors is adding 1,000 jobs in Michigan to develop more electric and hybrid vehicles similar to the Chevrolet Volt, which it officially introduced on Tuesday, the company said.
The new jobs, in engineering and research, are the latest commitment by G.M. to broaden its lineup of energy-efficient models as well as to invest in its home state, which has the nation's second-highest unemployment rate.
G.M.'s chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, announced the jobs in a ceremony for the start of production of the Volt at a plant in the city of Hamtramck, which adjoins downtown Detroit. 
With plant workers cheering him on, Mr. Akerson said the plug-in hybrid Volt was proof that G.M. would be a leader in new technology in the aftermath of its $50 billion government bailout last year.
''I believe and our board believes that electrification is critical to the global automotive industry,'' said Mr. Akerson.
Michigan has been among the states hit hardest by the recession and the shrinking of Detroit's Big Three automakers.
The state has lost an estimated 800,000 jobs in the last decade, and it has an unemployment rate of 12.8 percent, behind only Nevada's 14.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The G.M. jobs are part of a growing list of investments in the state by companies building batteries and other parts integral to electric cars, said Gov. Jennifer Granholm. ''Seventeen companies are making batteries or are suppliers for batteries and are projected to create 63,000 jobs in the state over the next decade,'' she said.
In addition to G.M.'s announcement, Chrysler said Tuesday that it would hire 1,000 new engineers and technicians by early next year to work on its next generation of small and midsize cars.
G.M. has already invested $700 million in eight facilities in Michigan in support of the Volt. The company said it would add the jobs over the next two years.
Mr. Akerson drove the first Volt off the assembly line on stage for Tuesday's ceremony.
That car will be kept by the company for display at its G.M. Heritage Center museum. The second Volt made in Hamtramck will be auctioned off to raise money for math and science education in the Detroit public schools.
The Volt has become something of a symbol of a reborn G.M. after its bailout and trip through bankruptcy court last year.
''We have created the new soul of this company,'' said Mark L. Reuss, head of G.M.'s North American operations.
The company's image received a big boost with its $23.1 billion public stock offering on Nov. 18, which, when completed, will cut the government's previous 61 percent ownership stake in half.
But G.M. executives are counting on a hot start for the Volt to cement its comeback in the minds of consumers.
The car is the first of its kind to use battery power alone for relatively short drives, and then to augment its range with the assistance of a small gasoline engine that generates electricity.
The Environmental Protection Agency said last week that the Volt had a fuel-economy rating equivalent to 93 miles per gallon on battery power alone. The combined battery-and-engine rating is 60 miles per gallon, the E.P.A. said.
Mr. Akerson said he and his wife had driven a Volt for the last six weeks and had rarely traveled more than the 35 miles per day that the E.P.A. says can be achieved with a full battery charge.
''We've gone 450 miles and we've used 1.2 gallons of gas,'' he said. ''I haven't seen a gas station for six weeks.''
The Volt, which is priced at $41,000, is scheduled to go on sale this month in California, Michigan, Texas, the District of Columbia and the metropolitan New York area. It will become available in the rest of the country by 2012.
G.M. plans to build about 10,000 Volts by the end of next year and 45,000 in 2012.
A version of the car is expected to go on sale next year in Europe as an Opel model.
The Volt faces competition for buyers of electric-powered cars initially from the Nissan Leaf, an all-battery-powered model that the E.P.A. rates at 99 miles per gallon.
Next year, Ford Motor will introduce an all-electric version of its Focus compact car. Like the Volt, the car will be built in Michigan at a factory in the city of Wayne that previously made full-size sport utility vehicles.

HEADLINE: Before Business Leaders, Bernanke Discusses Unemployment's Toll on Americans

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, found some respite on Tuesday from the second-guessing the central bank has faced since it announced a $600 billion effort to stimulate the slow recovery.
During a 75-minute discussion here with five business leaders, including the chief executives of I.B.M. and Ford Motor as well as the founder of a local chain of ice cream stores, inflation and monetary policy were not even mentioned, much less debated.
Mr. Bernanke did, however, emphasize the toll high unemployment was taking on families and on the share of the unemployed -- more than 40 percent -- who have been jobless for at least six months. 
''At the pace of growth that we're seeing now, we're not growing fast enough to materially reduce the unemployment rate,'' he said. The economy needs to grow at an annualized rate of 2 to 2.5 percent just to accommodate new workers coming into the labor force, he said. Mr. Bernanke has made this point repeatedly this year.
At 9.6 percent, the unemployment rate is about where it was when the recession officially ended in June 2009, Mr. Bernanke said, and only about a million of the 8.5 million jobs lost since the peak of the last economic expansion have been restored.
''Part of the barrier to faster growth and recovery is confidence in households that they will be financially secure and that they can make purchases and take chances in changing careers and changing locations,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''With unemployment so high, that confidence is hard to come by.''
The discussion, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and held at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University, was part of an effort by Mr. Bernanke to reach out more.
''We spend a lot of time, of course, looking at data, sitting in Washington, looking at the screen, but there's only so much you can learn from that,'' he said.
Sandra Pianalto, the president of the Cleveland Fed, who moderated the discussion, referred obliquely to the firestorm the Fed has faced in recent weeks. ''Through my interactions with Ben, I've learned that extreme circumstances often require very creative and aggressive policy responses, and that the right decisions sometimes aren't the most popular decisions,'' she said.
While none of the executives criticized the Fed, Samuel J. Palmisano, the chief executive of I.B.M., said that uncertainty, particularly over regulations, was holding back businesses, not financial constraints.
''Clearly, there's tons of liquidity, as you know,'' he told Mr. Bernanke, who was seated to his left. ''There's probably more than we could consume. It's not a credit issue. It's not the financial system or a banking issue. I think at the end of the day it's clarity.''
But two of the three local business owners on the panel said financial conditions were still tight. ''Credit is much more tight today than it was in past years,'' said Dwight E. Smith, founder of Sophisticated Systems, a provider of information technology services.
Curtis J. Moody, co-founder of Moody Nolan Architects, said, ''The lines of credits are more difficult to get, and they're lower.''
The business leaders agreed that the partisan climate in Washington was not helping matters. ''Exports aren't partisan, competitive tax policies aren't partisan,'' Mr. Palmisano said. ''Economic expansion, job creation, isn't political at the end of the day.''
Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive of Ford, said the government needed ''a laser focus on creating an environment where businesses can grow.'' He said that ''currencies need to be set by the market'' and ''not manipulated,'' and added, ''We need to have trade agreements that actually allow us to export.''
That appeared to be a reference to a free trade agreement with South Korea that was negotiated by the Bush administration and is opposed by Ford. The Obama administration wants to complete the deal and submit it to Congress, but negotiations with South Korea have become stuck over restrictions on American auto and beef exports.
Mr. Bernanke said he took away from the discussion the need for clarity on regulatory, trade and fiscal matters. He also emphasized the importance of government support for technological innovation and the need to improve public education, community colleges and work force training.
Several M.B.A. students in the audience said that they had hoped Mr. Bernanke would discuss the Fed's decision to buy bonds to reduce long-term interest rates, a topic they had debated in class. The students were generally skeptical about the strategy's effectiveness.
''If you inflate the economy without doing anything about growth, you're just printing money,'' said one of the students, Jyotisko Sinha, 27.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Studies Band Surgery For Less Obese

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Weight-loss surgery, once a last resort for extremely overweight people, may soon become an option for those who are less heavy.
An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration will consider on Friday a request by Allergan, the pharmaceutical company, to significantly lower how obese someone must be to qualify for surgery using the company's Lap-Band device, which restricts intake to the stomach.
On Wednesday, the F.D.A. acknowledged that a new study by the company showed that people in the proposed range of obesity who had the band experienced ''statistically significant decreases in all measures of weight loss.''
If the agency approves the change, the number of Americans eligible for the Lap-Band operation could easily double, ensuring more sales for Allergan and probably more insurance coverage for such operations. But the proposed change, sought at a time when the obesity epidemic in the United States seems intractable, still leaves some people uneasy, in part because of side effects and failure rates. In addition, long-term weight reduction is hard to maintain. 
''You're talking about millions and millions of people who would meet these criteria,'' said Dr. George Blackburn, associate director of the division of nutrition at Harvard Medical School. ''Let's make sure by the most rigorous research that this is safe and effective.''
A new generation of diet pills has failed to gain federal approval, limiting options for overweight Americans, and Allergan and other companies are betting that surgery will become more of a frontline option rather than a last resort.
''It would be kind of ironic if people have access to surgery and not medical therapies, where they can go from Weight Watchers to surgery and have nothing in-between,'' said Dr. Louis J. Aronne, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medical College. ''But it appears it may be the way it will be in the near future.''
Doctors have already started to operate on extremely heavy teenagers, not just adults. And some experts are recasting weight-loss procedures, known as bariatric surgery, as metabolic surgery, saying that it might be justified to treat diabetes, even in people who are barely obese or not obese. Gastric banding involves placing an inflatable silicone ring around the upper part of the stomach, which limits food consumption and makes one feel full faster.
Current guidelines say weight loss surgery is appropriate for people who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise and have a body mass index, or B.M.I., of 40 and above, or 35 and above if a person has at least one serious health problem, like diabetes or high blood pressure, that is tied to obesity. Allergan wants to lower the threshold for the Lap-Band to a B.M.I. of 35 with no associated health problems and to 30 with such problems.
For instance, a person who is 5 feet 6 inches and has diabetes would have to weigh 216 pounds to qualify now. Under the proposed lower threshold, that person could weigh 30 pounds less, or 186 pounds.
Federal statistics suggest that nearly 20 percent of the adult population has a B.M.I. between 30 and 35, more than double the population above 35. Probably half or more of the people between 30 and 35 have some associated health condition.
Bariatric surgeons and some obesity experts say that surgery has proven to be the only way many people can lose a lot of weight and keep it off, and some cite a Swedish study suggesting that it prolonged lives. And, they say, the operations have become safer since the obesity thresholds were first set in 1991 in a meeting organized by the National Institutes of Health.
''The whole risk-benefit ratio is completely different than it was back then,'' said Dr. Marc Bessler, chief of the division of minimally invasive and bariatric surgery at Columbia.
Banding is a less radical operation than the main alternative, the gastric bypass. It is also reversible and costs less -- from $12,000 to more than $20,000, compared with $20,000 to more than $30,000 for a bypass. But banding also leads to a weight loss of about 20 percent on average, less than that of bypass.
Bypass has been the preferred operation in the United States, though Allergan executives said on a recent call with investors that banding now has about 50 percent market share. Within the banding market, Allergan's Lap-Band has about 70 percent market share, according to the company, with the rest belonging to the Realize Band sold by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, a division of Johnson & Johnson. Allergan's band was approved in 2001.
To win approval of the lower threshold, Allergan sponsored a study in which 149 of these less obese people had the band implanted. About 80 percent of the participants achieved the goal of losing at least 30 percent of their excess weight, meaning the amount by which they were overweight, after one year. About 70 percent of patients experienced a side effect, like vomiting or pain. The F.D.A. indicated on Wednesday that it had questions about how meaningful the weight loss was and whether the results of the study would be applicable to people other than the white women who made up a large portion of the participants.
Some doctors are dropping the band, in part because some older studies suggest that up to a third of patients eventually have the band removed because of side effects or ineffective weight loss. While about one in 1,000 patients die within 30 days of surgery, a survey of members of the bariatric surgery society suggested that deaths occurring later are under-reported.
''Before they start putting the Lap-Band on patients who are 50 pounds overweight, the public has to be made aware of how dangerous this is,'' said Stephanie Quatinetz, a New York lawyer whose daughter, Rebecca, died at age 27 in August 2009, two months after getting Lap-Band surgery.
One factor that is moving some experts to advocate surgery for lower body mass index levels is its effectiveness in resolving diabetes, hypertension and some other ills associated with obesity.
''There are dramatic metabolic effects that in many cases go well beyond the weight loss effects,'' said Dr. Lee M. Kaplan, director of the weight center at Massachusetts General Hospital.
He said that while it was once thought that surgery worked mainly by mechanically restricting how much one can eat, it is becoming clear that gastric bypass, at least, has effects on hormones.
Some experts say body mass index does not adequately measure risk of health problems. For instance, Asians tend to get diabetes at a lower B.M.I. than whites.
''The B.M.I. limitation of 35/40, set in the period when the major objective of the operations was weight control, is no longer the primary appropriate guideline for the selection of candidates for bariatric surgery,'' Dr. Walter J. Pories, a surgeon, and colleagues wrote in the journal Obesity earlier this year. Dr. Pories will be a member of the F.D.A. advisory committee on Friday.
Allergan, known mostly for its Botox product, which is approved for cosmetic and medical ailments like chronic migraines, wants to reverse slowing sales of the Lap-Band that the company attributes to the weak economy. In the first nine months of this year, sales of its obesity products, mostly Lap-Band, fell 4 percent, to $182.4 million.
Even if Allergan's application is approved, perhaps a small fraction of the new candidates are likely to opt for surgery because many people avoid operations. ''I don't think it's enough to overwhelm the health care system,'' said Dr. Bruce Wolfe, president of American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, whose executive council unanimously endorsed Allergan's proposal. ''That's not happening with the people who are heavier and need it even more.''
The society says that 220,000 bariatric surgeries of all kinds were performed in the United States last year. That is more than twice as many as in 2003, but represents a small fraction of the potential pool.
Still, some less obese patients do want the surgery. Some online discussion boards tell of people who purposely gained weight to qualify, and some messages give advice to others on wearing hidden weights.
Rashida Brown says she wants surgery to help control her diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension. But her insurer has refused to pay twice in the last few years. At the time, Ms. Brown, who is 5 feet 7 inches, weighed 195 to 220 pounds, putting her index below 35.
''I am willing to bet there are quite a few people in the same category as myself -- just waiting,'' said Ms. Brown, 53, a clinical social worker from Boston.
She may still have to wait, now that she weighs 175 pounds -- putting her below even the proposed lower threshold.

HEADLINE: Too Big to Succeed

BYLINE: By THOMAS M. HOENIG. 
Thomas M. Hoenig is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

 BODY:
Kansas City, Mo.
THE world has experienced a severe financial crisis and economic recession. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve took actions that saved businesses and jobs and may very well have saved the economy itself from ruin. Still, the public seems ungrateful, expressing anger at these institutions that saved the day. Why?
Americans are angry in part because they sense that the government was as much a cause of the crisis as its cure. They realize that more must be done to address a threat that remains increasingly a part of our economy: financial institutions that are ''too big to fail.'' 
During the 1990s, Congress, with encouragement from academics and regulators, repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that had barred commercial banks from undertaking the riskier activities of investment banks. Following this action, the regulatory authority significantly reduced capital requirements for the largest investment banks.
Less than a decade after these changes, the investment firm Bear Stearns failed. Bear was the smallest of the ''big five'' American investment banks. Yet to avoid the damage its failure might cause, billions of dollars in public assistance was provided to support its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase. Soon other large financial institutions were found to also be at risk. These firms were required to accept billions of dollars in capital from the Treasury and were provided hundreds of billions in loans from the Federal Reserve.
In spite of the public assistance required to sustain the industry, little has changed on Wall Street. Two years later, the largest firms are again operating with bonus and compensation schemes that reflect success, not the reality of recent failures. Contrast this with the hundreds of smaller banks and businesses that failed and the millions of people who lost their jobs during the Wall Street-fueled recession.
There is an old saying: lend a business $1,000 and you own it; lend it $1 million and it owns you. This latest crisis confirms that the economic influence of the largest financial institutions is so great that their chief executives cannot manage them, nor can their regulators provide adequate oversight.
Last summer, Congress passed a law to reform our financial system. It offers the promise that in the future there will be no taxpayer-financed bailouts of investors or creditors. However, after this round of bailouts, the five largest financial institutions are 20 percent larger than they were before the crisis. They control $8.6 trillion in financial assets -- the equivalent of nearly 60 percent of gross domestic product. Like it or not, these firms remain too big to fail.
How is it possible that post-crisis legislation leaves large financial institutions still in control of our country's economic destiny? One answer is that they have even greater political influence than they had before the crisis. During the past decade, the four largest financial firms spent tens of millions of dollars on lobbying. A member of Congress from the Midwest reluctantly confirmed for me that any candidate who runs for national office must go to New York City, home of the big banks, to raise money.
What can be done to remedy the situation? After the Great Depression and the passage of Glass-Steagall, the largest banks had to spin off certain risky activities, and this created smaller, safer banks. Taking similar actions today to reduce the scope and size of banks, combined with legislatively mandated debt-to-equity requirements, would restore the integrity of the financial system and enhance equity of access to credit for consumers and businesses. Studies show that most operational efficiencies are captured when financial firms are substantially smaller than the largest ones are today.
These firms reached their present size through the subsidies they received because they were too big to fail. Therefore, diminishing their size and scope, thereby reducing or removing this subsidy and the competitive advantage it provides, would restore competitive balance to our economic system.
To do this will require real political will. Those who control the largest banks will argue that such action would undermine financial firms' ability to compete globally.
I am not persuaded by this argument. History suggests that financial strength follows economic strength. A competitive, accountable and successful domestic economic system, supported by many innovative financial firms, would restore the United States' economic strength.
More financial firms -- with none too big to fail -- would mean less concentrated financial power, less concentrated risk and better access and service for American businesses and the public. Even if they were substantially smaller, the largest firms could continue to meet any global financial demand either directly or through syndication.
Crises will always be a part of our capitalist system. But an absence of accountability and blatant inequities in treatment are why Americans remain angry. Without accountability, we cannot hope to build a national consensus around the sacrifices needed to eliminate our fiscal deficits and rebuild our economy.

HEADLINE: STATE'S SECRETS DAY 4; Below Surface, U.S. Harbors Dim View of Putin and Russia

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Early in 2009, as recession rippled around the world, the United States Embassy in Moscow sent to Washington a cable summarizing whispers within Russia's political class. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, the rumors said, often did not show up at his office.
The embassy titled the cable ''Questioning Putin's Work Ethic.''
''There are consistent reports that Putin resents or resists the workload he carries,'' it said, citing Mr. Putin's ''fatigue,'' ''hands-off behavior'' and ''isolation'' to the point that he was ''working from home.''
The cable, approved by the American ambassador, John R. Beyrle, assessed the Kremlin rumors not as indicators of Mr. Putin's weakness, but of the limits of his position in a period of falling commodity prices and tightening credit. Russia's most powerful man sat atop Russia's spoils. The recession left him with less to dole out, eroding ''some of his Teflon persona.'' 
''His disengagement reflects,'' the cable concluded, ''his recognition that a sharp reduction in resources limits his ability to find workable compromises among the Kremlin elite.'' Officially, the United States has sought since last year what President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitri A. Medvedev, have called a ''reset'' in relations.
But scores of secret American cables from recent years, obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to several news organizations, show that beneath the public efforts at warmer ties, the United States harbors a dim view of the post-Soviet Kremlin and its leadership, and little hope that Russia will become more democratic or reliable.
The cables portray Mr. Putin as enjoying supremacy over all other Russian public figures, yet undermined by the very nature of the post-Soviet country he helped build.
Even a man with his formidable will and intellect is shown beholden to intractable larger forces, including an inefficient economy and an unmanageable bureaucracy that often ignores his edicts.
In language candid and bald, the cables reveal an assessment of Mr. Putin's Russia as highly centralized, occasionally brutal and all but irretrievably cynical and corrupt. The Kremlin, by this description, lies at the center of a constellation of official and quasi-official rackets.
Throughout the internal correspondence between the American Embassy and Washington, the American diplomats in Moscow painted a Russia in which public stewardship was barely tended to and history was distorted. The Kremlin displays scant ability or inclination to reform what one cable characterized as a ''modern brand of authoritarianism'' accepted with resignation by the ruled.
Moreover, the cables reveal the limits of American influence within Russia and an evident dearth of diplomatic sources. The internal correspondence repeatedly reflected the analyses of an embassy whose staff was narrowly contained and had almost no access to Mr. Putin's inner circle.
In reporting to Washington, diplomats often summarized impressions from meetings not with Russian officials, but with Western colleagues or business executives. The impressions of a largely well-known cadre of Russian journalists, opposition politicians and research institute regulars rounded out many cables, with insights resembling what was published in liberal Russian newspapers and on Web sites.
The cables sketched life almost 20 years after the Soviet Union's disintegration, a period, as the cables noted, when Mr. Medvedev, the prime minister's understudy, is the lesser part of a strange ''tandemocracy'' and ''plays Robin to Putin's Batman.'' All the while, another cable noted, ''Stalin's ghost haunts the Metro.''
Government Corruption
In the secret American description, official malfeasance and corruption infect all elements of Russian public life -- from rigging elections, to persecuting rivals or citizens who pose a threat, to extorting businesses.
The corruption was described as a drag on the nation of sufficient significance to merit the attention of Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Putin, who, paradoxically, benefited from cronies who orchestrate graft but support the Kremlin.
A cable describing the government and style of Yuri M. Luzhkov, then the mayor of Moscow, presented the puzzle.
Since 2008, Mr. Medvedev has been the face and cheerleader for the nation's supposed anti-corruption campaign. Yet a veritable kaleidoscope of corruption thrived in Moscow, much of it under the protection of a mayor who served at the president's pleasure.
The embassy wrote of a ''three-tiered structure'' in Moscow's criminal world, with the mayor at the top, the police and intelligence officials at the second tier and those regarded as a municipality's predators -- ''ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors'' -- at the bottom.
In this world the government effectively was the mafia. Extortion was so widespread, the cable noted, that it had become the business of the Interior Ministry and the federal intelligence service, known by their initials in Russian, the M.V.D. and the F.S.B.
''Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) since they not only have more guns, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law,'' the cable noted, citing a Russian source. ''For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand.''
The cable further described a delicate balance.
On one hand, the prime minister and the president benefited from votes Mr. Luzhkov delivered to the country's ruling party, and perhaps from corruption that one embassy source said was so profligate that witnesses saw suitcases, presumably full of cash, being carried into the Kremlin under armed guard.
On the other, the corruption and a flagrantly rigged election in 2009 for the city's legislature had raised the question of whether Mr. Luzhkov was worth the trouble.
The cable ended on a prescient note. ''Ultimately, the tandem will put Luzhkov out to pasture,'' it said. Eight months after this cable was written, Mr. Medvedev dismissed Mr. Luzhkov.
The embassy's consistent assessments left little hope that removing one person would be enough. Russian corruption, the cables said, was structural.
One foreign citizen, whom the embassy described as having ''made a fortune in Russia's casino business,'' said in 2009 ''that the 'levels of corruption in business were worse than we could imagine' and that after working here for over 15 years and witnessing first-hand the behavior of GOR [government of Russia] officials at all levels, he could not imagine the system changing.''
The same cable noted that even if the government wanted to change it might not be able to, given that ''in 2006 -- at the height of Putin's control in a booming economy -- it was rumored within the Presidential Administration that as many as 60 percent of his orders were not being followed.''
Secretive Business Deals
In Russia, the separation between the most important businesses and government officials runs from blurry to nonexistent. The cables rendered darkly how Russian companies -- often relying on what one cable called ''secretive deals involving intermediary companies with unknown owners and beneficiaries'' -- conducted their affairs.
The cables also detailed two separate but related concerns about Russia's oil and gas sectors: a lack of modern management and capital-improvement programs, and a tendency in Mr. Putin's circle to see energy resources as political levers.
One prominent Western oil executive told Ambassador Beyrle that the inefficiencies ''are so huge'' that ''a well that would take ten days to drill in Canada would take 20'' in Russia.
''Multiply that by hundreds or thousands and you can start to imagine the costs to the economy,'' the cable quoted the executive as saying.
The embassy's 2009 assessment of state-owned Gazprom, Russia's largest company, was similar. ''Gazprom, it said, ''must act in the interests of its political masters, even at the expense of sound economic decision-making.''
The cables also showed how bureaucratic, national and economic power often all converged in the Kremlin, and how the state's suitors grasped that access often equaled results.
The summary of a meeting between an Italian and American diplomats in Moscow documented the Italian diplomat's exasperation with Mr. Putin and Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, who had gained Russia's ear.
The diplomat said that the pair enjoyed such a close relationship that they shared a ''direct line,'' and that the Italian Foreign Ministry and Embassy ''only learn of conversations'' between the premiers ''after the fact, and with little detail or background.''
The diplomat then ''explained that while the close relationship is not ideal from the bureaucracy's perspective and more detrimental than beneficial, it can be useful at times.
''He cited,'' the cable added, ''the case of the sale to Gazprom by Italian energy giant ENI of its 20 percent share in Gazprom's oil subsidiary Gazpromneft. He said Gazprom had insisted on paying far below the market price, but that it ultimately paid the market price after Berlusconi weighed in with Putin.''
Other cables described how Western businesses sometimes managed to pursue their interests by personally engaging senior Russian officials, including President Medvedev, rather than getting lost in bureaucratic channels.
The experience in late 2009 of the Intel Corporation, which hoped to import 1,000 encrypted computers for its Russia offices, offered insights into the benefits of courting the top.
''Several high-level Intel officers, including CEO Craig Barrett, and other officials, such as American Chamber of Commerce President Andrew Somers, highlighted to the GOR interlocutors, including President Medvedev, the role Intel plays in employing over 1,000 Russian engineers,'' a cable said.
''This high-level lobbying secured Intel a meeting with key FSB officials to explain its needs,'' it continued. ''Intel was able to demonstrate the reasonableness of its request and, as a result, by-passed the current extensive licensing requirement.''
Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, said that the meetings were not about one shipment of computers; they created an expedited process for importing such equipment, not only for Intel but for their customers and distributors. ''We didn't get this as a one-time thing,'' he said.
The cables further revealed how the nexus of business and state interests among Russia's ruling elite had fueled suspicions in Washington that Mr. Putin, in spite of his vigorous denials, had quietly amassed a personal fortune.
A confidential cable pointedly mentioned the Swiss oil-trading company Gunvor, as being ''of particular note.''
The company, the cable said, is ''rumored to be one of Putin's sources of undisclosed wealth'' and is owned by Gennadi N. Timchenko, who is ''rumored to be a former K.G.B. colleague of Putin's.'' One estimate said the company might control half of Russian oil exports, potentially bringing its owners billions of dollars in profit.
Gunvor's profits were especially high, the cable claimed, because in one of the few deals in which details were known, a source said that the firm included a surcharge of $1 per barrel of oil. More competitive traders, the source said, might mark up a barrel by only a nickel.
The cables provide no evidence to support the allegations about Gunvor and Mr. Luzhkov, the former Moscow mayor; neither has been charged with any crimes.
Patience Unrewarded
If two words were to summarize the secret American assessment of its relations with the Kremlin, it would be these: suspicion and frustration.
A cornerstone of Washington's approach to the relationship has been patience. Privately, American diplomats have described the hope that by moderating public criticism of Russia and encouraging market principles, Russia's government and important companies might with time evolve.
The cables underscore how frustrating the patience has been.
A summary in November 2009 of the security dialogue between the United States and Russia coolly stated that in spite of warm words between Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Obama and the establishment of a new military-to-military working group, there remained ''challenges in effecting real, substantive and ongoing'' dialogue.
The Defense Ministry, the cable said ''has not changed its modus operandi for information exchange nor routine dialoguing since the end of the Cold War.''
Russian attendees at meetings, the cable said, ''are closely monitored by their Military Intelligence (GRU) handlers,'' and are reluctant ''to engage in any dialogues outside of tightly controlled statements recited from prepared texts.''
When diplomats did meet Russian officials who chose to be candid, the message they heard was sometimes blunt.
In June 2009 a delegation of Washington analysts who were accompanied by diplomats met with Aleksandr Y. Skobeltsyn of Russia's Department for Military-Technical Cooperation to discuss American concerns about sales of anti-tank guided missiles and shoulder-launched antiaircraft missiles.
The latter are a special worry in the West, where security officials fear terrorists could fire them at passenger jets.
Mr. Skobeltsyn said that Russia ''shared U.S. concerns about re-transfer vulnerabilities, noting that Latin America and Middle East were especially sensitive areas.''
''But, he argued, if Russia did not provide these weapons to certain countries, then 'someone else' would.''
Outright distrustful relations between the Kremlin and the Soviet Union's former vassals were also evident in the records. At an appearance in Washington in 2009, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski of Poland said that American forces would be welcome in Poland ''to protect against Russian aggression.''
The comment, unwelcomed by Russia and the United States alike, ignited a minor flare-up. In a cable after Mr. Sikorski's appearance, the American Embassy said that Poland had established a Bureau of European Security, which ''Polish diplomats jokingly refer to as the 'Office of Threats from the East.' ''
The back-channel quip eventually provided insight into the diplomatic climate in Moscow. A Polish official, formerly posted to Moscow, noted that Russia's Foreign Ministry ''threw this moniker back at him during a meeting.''
He told his American colleagues that the ''only way'' that Russia's Foreign Ministry could have known of the nickname ''was to have been listening in on his phone conversations with Warsaw'' -- a clear suggestion that his office in Russia had been bugged.

HEADLINE: Lame Ducks Gone Mad

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Strange signs and portents abound in the land.
In Brooklyn, bees are turning red.
The innocent residents of Boca Raton, Fla., are living in terror of an attack otter, which climbs out of the water to bite people in their backyards.
And in Washington, the Senate passed a big bipartisan bill. 
Is it any wonder that people speak in trembling whispers of the end of days?
Fortunately, things are not quite as apocalyptic as they seem at first glance. The bees, according to a column by Susan Dominus in The Times, had been hanging around a maraschino cherry factory. A wildlife expert told The South Florida Sun-Sentinel that people may have been feeding the otters, which makes them aggressive.
And the bipartisan bill, which would overhaul the nation's food safety system, still has to go back to the House, so there's plenty of time to screw it up.
Congress has been working on this legislation since 2008, when a big food-poisoning epidemic reminded everyone that the Food and Drug Administration is currently working with laws written during the Great Depression. It survived endless delays by Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who believes the free market is your last, best defense against E. coli.
But staff members for the leading Democratic and Republican senators on the health committee actually got together and worked things out the way they used to do in olden days. Most of the negotiators were women, and while I am certainly not saying that made a difference, I am, sort of, just saying.
Not everybody was impressed by the achievement.
''Oh, my gosh! It's so important,'' said Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ''I'm glad I rushed back from our break to work on food safety.''
Brown felt the Senate should have been focusing on economic issues, particularly his effort to stop the extension of unemployment compensation benefits until the Senate agrees to the Scott Brown Unemployment Compensation Funding Plan.
''Is it because I'm a Republican that we're not going to pass that? Is it because I'm the new guy?'' he demanded.
We will now have a moment of silence to contemplate the suffering of Senator Brown. Who had to come back the week after Thanksgiving in order to vote on a major bipartisan bill aimed at keeping people from being poisoned by contaminated food. And then became a victim of discrimination.
Congress is not exactly in a holiday mood. The Senate Democrats are frustrated because the Republicans won't let them bring up any bills until they vote on extending the Bush tax cuts. On Wednesday night, Senator Charles Schumer of New York proposed that everybody just compromise and extend the tax cuts for people with an income under a million dollars a year. ''Will you accept?'' he asked Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. ''That's a great compromise. Or are you going to say, 'Oh, no. Hold out for the millionaires?' ''
Alexander is a particularly affable guy, as he demonstrated the other day when he got up and announced he was going to say ''one good thing'' about each of the 16 retiring senators.
The whole world waited to see what he was going to do with Jim Bunning of Kentucky, who has reset the bar when it comes to combining craziness and crankiness. Was Alexander going to find some way to make a warmhearted anecdote out of the time Bunning single-handedly held up an important administration confirmation because he was angry at Canada for banning the sale of flavored tobacco?
No, as it turned out, Bunning ''has been a persistent leader in fighting for sick nuclear workers who served our country during the '50s and '60s.'' Who knew? Good work, Senator Alexander.
But that was a fleeting moment, foam of friendliness in a sea of rancor. Alexander quickly dodged Schumer's offer, insisting that the Senate could actually do nothing whatsoever about taxes until it got results from the ''great negotiations'' that were begun by the White House.
While it was extremely pleasant to hear Alexander finding a way to extol some unlovable outgoing senators, it was very unnerving to hear him sounding so confident about the White House's willingness to negotiate away taxes on the rich.
So the Senate Democrats are frustrated. And the Senate Republicans are unhappy, too, because the Democrats keep saying that the G.O.P. cares more about ''a tax cut for millionaires'' than the middle class, the unemployed, gay soldiers, immigrant college students or stopping nuclear war. This appears to be true, but that doesn't make it any less irritating to hear approximately five thousand times an afternoon.
Maybe things will work out. Maybe the White House will not cave, and the Republicans will not be intransigent, and the Democrats will get their act together and be canny and unified.
Maybe we should not rule out the possibility of zombie otters.

HEADLINE: U.S. Drops Bid To Explore Oil In Eastern Gulf

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration announced on Wednesday that it had rescinded its decision to expand offshore oil exploration into the eastern Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast because of weaknesses in federal regulation revealed by the BP oil spill.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazarsaid that a moratorium on drilling would be in force in those areas for at least seven years, until stronger safety and environmental standards were in place. The move puts off limits millions of acres of the Outer Continental Shelf that hold potentially billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas.
The decision essentially reverses the much-disputed drilling plan announced in March, which would have initiated environmental studies and exploration activity in previously untouched areas off the Gulf Coast of Florida and along the East Coast from Florida to Delaware.
''As a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we learned a number of lessons,'' Mr. Salazar said in an afternoon briefing, ''most importantly that we need to proceed with caution and focus on creating a more stringent regulatory regime.'' 
After the BP spill, Mr. Salazar disbanded the discredited agency charged with regulating offshore oil and gas operations, the Minerals Management Service, and replaced it with a new bureau with enhanced powers. The agency was faulted for inadequate staffing, a cozy relationship with the oil industry, a failure to perform regular inspections of oil rigs and lax enforcement of environmental and safety rules.
Exploration and production will continue in the central and western Gulf of Mexico, although under a set of new safeguards that were put in place after the deadly BP Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in April. Future gulf leases will be subject to further environmental and safety studies, he said.
Shell's pending lease in the Arctic Ocean off the Alaska coast will be honored, but drilling will be allowed only after a new environmental review is completed and more spill response requirements are met. That may push the oil company's plans back by a year or more, officials said.
Other potential drilling sites in the Arctic will be studied before any leasing decisions are made for 2012-2017, Mr. Salazar said.
The Interior Department identifies areas for potential leasing by oil companies in five-year periods. It concluded that the enormous task of drawing up detailed rules, conducting environmental studies and drafting spill response plans for vast swaths of the gulf and Atlantic where drilling has never taken place should not be rushed in preparation for that leasing phase.
The proposal to expand drilling to those areas, unveiled just three weeks before the BP accident, was part of a political plan to encourage more domestic oil production in exchange for Congressional action to limit carbon dioxide emissions that are contributing to global warming.
The eastern gulf and the Atlantic Seaboard had been off limits to oil companies for years because of Congressional opposition, but lawmakers in Atlantic coast states have been pushing for offshore oil activity to reduce foreign imports and to generate tax and royalty revenue.
Ultimately, Wednesday's announcement was an admission that the Interior Department erred in deciding last spring to open up vast new areas offshore to drilling without adequate safeguards. And politically, the plan brought the Obama administration nothing.
The administration's package fell apart as a result of the oil spill and the Senate's refusal to take up comprehensive legislation on energy and climate change. Prospects for such legislation are even dimmer now after the Republican takeover of the House.
Oil company executives said that while they had been eager to begin drilling in the eastern gulf and along the Atlantic coast, they could not estimate how much they would have been willing to invest there. That would require exploration, which will now be deferred for years to come, although federal geological officials could potentially carry out acoustic tests to map oil reserves.
The government estimates that the eastern gulf contains 3.7 billion barrels of oil and 21.5 trillion cubic feet of gas, while the Atlantic coast has 3.8 billion barrels of oil and 37 trillion cubic feet of gas. Taken together, that is roughly comparable to Norway's proven oil reserves and Canada's proven gas reserves.
The expansion of offshore drilling announced in March only partly opened those waters; but it still would have made available enough oil to fuel more than 2.4 million cars and gas to heat 8 million households for 60 years.
The administration imposed a moratorium in May on all deepwater offshore drilling while the new safety procedures were drawn up. Mr. Salazar lifted the ban in October, and oil companies have been seeking new permits to resume exploration in the gulf.
Industry executives complained Wednesday that the government was overreacting to the BP spill and called the new safeguards more than adequate to prevent another major spill.
''This is an unfortunate decision that will eliminate badly needed government revenues, inhibit employment growth and increase reliance on imported energy,'' said Kenneth Cohen, vice president for public and government affairs at ExxonMobil. ''It ignores the industry's track record and commitment to improving environmental and safety performance as well as the overwhelming evidence that the Gulf of Mexico spill resulted from practices far outside industry norms.''
The American Petroleum Institute called the decision a mistake at a time of economic distress.
''I'm surprised and disappointed by this decision, which will stifle investment and clearly stop the creation of tens of thousands of jobs,'' said Jack Gerard, president of the petroleum group. ''This really compounds the problem with the existing de facto moratorium in the gulf. Eventually the oil and gas pipeline for production for the country will slow to a trickle.''
Environmental advocates welcomed the administration's reversal of a policy they had vigorously opposed.
''What it means is they've learned a great deal from the Macondo blowout and they're taking a lot of places off the table that originally were going to be considered,'' said Marilyn Heiman, an oceans expert at the Pew Environment Group. She said she was troubled, however, by the decision to move forward with exploration off Alaska. ''They still need to learn a lot more as it relates to drilling in the Arctic.''
Ola Morten Aanestad, a vice president at Statoil, a Norwegian company, said the eastern gulf and Atlantic coasts offered ''significant potential.'' But what is most vital to the industry, he said, is that drilling be allowed to begin again in areas where the deepwater moratorium was lifted in October but there have been continuing delays in permits.
Separately, BP said it was suspending an Arctic drilling project that sits on a small artificial island in 22 feet of water and is not classified as an offshore rig.
BP said it was having unspecified technical problems with the rig, designed to drill two miles down and then six to eight miles across to reach what is believed to be a 100-million-barrel reservoir of oil under federal waters.

HEADLINE: The Un-Sensible Common Ground

 BODY:
The odds of a calm and reasoned deficit debate have never been good. Politicians from both parties favor deficit reduction until it comes to raising taxes on the rich or making actual cuts in the big-dollar programs, like Social Security and defense. The events of this week, however, have been truly absurd. Deficit talk reached new decibel levels, as lawmakers and administration officials huddled over extending budget-busting, Bush-era tax cuts.
On Monday, calling for shared sacrifice, President Obama proposed a two-year pay freeze for federal civilian employees. Broad sacrifice is a tenet of deficit reduction, and a freeze would save $5 billion through 2012, and $60 billion over 10 years. But Mr. Obama did not say who else should sacrifice. Closing the pet loophole of multimillionaire private equity partners would raise $25 billion over 10 years. Ending Bush tax cuts for affluent Americans would raise $700 billion over 10 years. 
On Tuesday, looking for ''sensible common ground,'' Mr. Obama dispatched two top White House officials to negotiate with Republicans on the Bush-era tax cuts. The problem is, common ground has already been found -- and abandoned. Both sides have long agreed that tax cuts for people earning less than $250,000 should be extended. That is more than enough. It would preserve $3.2 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. Republicans, however, insist that the high-end cuts also be extended, bringing the total 10-year cost to $4 trillion.
Congressional Democrats were too timid to bring the issue up for a vote before the election and took a beating anyway. Now they are faced with extending the tax cuts in the lame-duck session and are bound to extend some or all of the cuts for the rich. The only real question is in exchange for what, if anything?
On Wednesday, the White House's bipartisan deficit reduction commission released its final report, calling for nearly $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years -- the same amount that will be added to the debt by extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts.
The report, which gets a commission vote on Friday, is not expected to win the supermajority needed to require consideration by Congress. Not a big loss. The final report is not an improvement on the earlier draft proposal, which was a promising start in its broad strokes, but misguided in many details.
The final report, for example, fails to call for significant near-term stimulus spending to counter the effect of deficit reduction. It also aims for an arbitrary -- and dangerously low -- spending target of 21 percent of the economy, a level that would make it impossible to meet coming challenges. In tax reform, it does not consider a value-added tax and a financial transactions tax.
On health care, the biggest driver of deficits, the final report raises big questions, like how it would achieve its assumed savings if overall health costs continue to soar. It also urges repeal of a minor part of the health reform law, a small change but a bad political omen.
The broad outlines of meaningful deficit reduction are not hard to draw. It would start with powerful stimulus -- a large payroll tax holiday and a yearlong retroactive extension of jobless benefits that expired on Dec. 1. That would ensure that the economy can withstand the tax increases and spending cuts to come.
A good plan would acknowledge that the recent health reform law represents the best shot at curbing the inexorable rise in health costs and deficits, and that repealing or obstructing the law, as Republicans aim to do, is antithetical to deficit reduction. It would call for new forms of taxation to bring revenues in line with spending and would balance spending cuts and tax increases to help ensure that no one bears an outsize burden.
Budget cuts need not and should not start today. Rather, the nation's leaders should start to develop and enact a plan to put the budget on a sound path as the economy recovers. They are off on the wrong foot.

HEADLINE: Exploring the Meaning of 'Constitutional Conservatism'

BYLINE: By LINCOLN CAPLAN

 BODY:
John Boehner, the next House speaker, expresses the message of constitutional conservatism in calling for every bill to identify the part of the Constitution it rests on. Sarah Palin used the phrase to campaign for limited government. Tea Party members call themselves constitutional conservatives. It is the new mantle in which Republican politicians are wrapping themselves. 
The challenge lies in understanding what, if anything, it actually means.
The phrase is used mainly in opposition: against health care reform; against the General Motors bailout; against President Obama's policies. A year ago, conservatives focused on the gravity of economic problems. This election, their concern shifted to the danger represented by solutions.
Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm, says the message that 4 out of 5 Republicans wanted to send in the House elections was that American governance must ''return to the Constitution.'' Constitutional conservatives have an ill-defined faith in the redeeming power of the founders' vision.
A polemic called the Mount Vernon Statement used the phrase last winter to rally an expanded Republican Party. The statement noted five principles: limited government; individual liberty; free enterprise; advancing freedom, opposing tyranny; and defending family, neighborhood, community and faith.
The phrase is connected to a radical vision. (The Web site of Mike Lee, the Republican senator-elect from Utah, touted him as a constitutional conservative and, as The Times reported, he ''views much of what the federal government currently does as unconstitutional.'') But the statement is a vague, highly selective catchall.
It makes no mention of ''We the people,'' of forming ''a more perfect union'' or pursuing ''the general welfare'' -- of equality arm in arm with liberty. It seems based on nostalgia for an inadequate version of the country's past. Like many slogans, it doesn't bear close examination. Which Americans don't want liberty, or support tyranny?
That doesn't mean the effort can be ignored. The prime mover behind the statement, and its first signer, was Edwin Meese III, the former attorney general who helped shape the Reagan revolution. A quarter of a century ago, Mr. Meese led a similar effort to turn a slogan into a movement. That campaign aimed to stem the tide of liberalism in law and bring about a ''restoration of fundamental Constitutional values.''
Mr. Meese stirred an impassioned controversy. He drew then-Justices William Brennan and John Paul Stevens into a debate -- the first sitting justices to respond to a challenge by an executive branch official since F.D.R.'s court-packing scheme.
Justice Brennan summed up, ''It is arrogant to pretend that from our vantage we can gauge accurately the intent of the framers on application of principle to specific, contemporary questions.''
The news media judged that the justices got the better of the attorney general, but Mr. Meese's rhetoric had political appeal even when it lacked legal persuasiveness. It helped energize a change in government that made conservatism dominant in the law. It helped ensure the strong influence of conservatism generally.
The anger felt by those who favor constitutional conservatism is potent. Call the slogan vague. Call it arrogant. It would be shortsighted to dismiss this increasingly used rallying cry.

 BODY:
RAYMAN BOOZER is a survivor, a member of that hardy (dare one say quixotic?) tribe known as independent retailers. Sixteen years ago, Mr. Boozer, an Indiana-born interior designer, opened Apartment 48 on West 17th Street. He had worked at Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Conran's and was eager to create his own retail magic.
He laid out his 1,000-square-foot home-goods store like a real apartment, with kitchen, living, dining and bedroom areas, and filled it with an ever-changing mise-en-scene of artifacts -- melamine nesting bowls, Moroccan lanterns, jewel-tone glass boxes that looked plucked from a Paris flea market -- and brightly colored contemporary furniture, like Parsons tables covered with lacquered grass cloth. He also offered decorating services, along with wallpaper and textiles.
Then, two years ago, just as the economy in Manhattan was about to implode, he moved to a spot down the block that was double the size and nearly triple the rent, and watched his business shrink in inverse proportion to his new investment. 
''My sister calls it 'broke at a higher level,' '' Mr. Boozer said. ''I'd say we're at where we were before.'' Meaning before the downturn. ''But we are spending more, and seeing fewer customers,'' he said. ''We used to have folks come in and do all their shopping here: weddings, holidays and whatever. We are seeing less and less of that.''
People do not decorate like they once did, either, he added. ''They used to go for whatever was trendy. We did a lot of wallpaper. Now they want to know: 'Will it improve my home? Will it be relevant in five years?' And I think that a lot of people who shopped in the store regularly must have worked in the area, and they don't have a job anymore. They just vanished. Retail has shifted, and I don't see it shifting back.''
On the Tuesday afternoon before Thanksgiving, Mr. Boozer was doing what he does best: fashioning a little universe in his own image. He and Brian Bohon, his assistant, were wrestling with a half-built holiday window display involving chicken wire, potting soil and adhesive spray mount. There was a tangle of Christmas lights and two-by-fours.
When they were finished, late on Wednesday evening, the diorama they had made displayed an arch vision of Americana: a 1960s suburban clapboard ranch house trimmed in colored lights sitting on top of a warren of tunnels and holes, a kind of giant ant farm, except that there were treasures tucked inside.
Mr. Boozer said he played with the idea of borrowing a live rabbit. ''But it didn't seem practical. Anyway, it's still kind of fun, right?''
For some shoppers, the holidays signal deep discounts at big-box stores, a chance to indulge in a Darwinian struggle to attain the largest electronic device for the lowest possible price without sustaining bodily injury.
But for many others, the season offers a chance to experience a bit of flair, some old-fashioned creative merchandising, as retailers like Mr. Boozer exercise their individual talents by creating little stage sets and somehow managing to hang on in the new economic climate. This shrunken market of wary consumers is no temporary dip, most of these merchants say. It is their new reality. And they have adjusted.
Kevin Brynan, who opened Mxyplyzyk, the quirky design and gift shop on Greenwich Avenue, in 1992, said he had adjusted by streamlining his operating costs: he has a new insurance plan with a premium that is 20 percent lower, a phone bill that is half of what it used to be and fewer employees.
''The whole staff has taken a salary cut,'' he said. ''I am looking for ways to save. Most of my inventory is up front. I have never showed more discipline in my purchasing. Instead of going deep on items, I am going wide and shallow. I'm still around, and I'm in survival mode.''
For his part, Mr. Boozer noted one happy byproduct of the new economy: a weakened euro means he can shop in France again (that's where he found his artisanal corkscrews, $38, Page 7, far right).
In November, the New York State tax authorities briefly closed Moss, home of five- and six-figure functional artwork, for nonpayment of taxes. It was a chilling event, as Murray Moss, the gallery's owner, noted. Though a payment plan had been in place for the taxes owed, Mr. Moss said, a paper had been misfiled by the store's lawyer. It took four days to right the error, and when the doors reopened, more New Yorkers than just Mr. Moss breathed a sigh of relief.
In the smackdown between the economy and independent businesses, he said, ''Maybe we are the poster child.''
His store, like others, has trimmed its fat and adjusted its practices, cutting back on staff, trucking, warehousing, overseas shipments and even electrical use, Mr. Moss said. ''Good news, no cuts in friends,'' he added by e-mail. ''In fact, we've discovered that to be an area of real growth.''
Mr. Moss is focusing -- fixating, he said -- on moving forward. For the holidays, he has strewn his store with timepieces, including an alarm clock that looks like a fire bell for $70 (Page 1, center), and he is planning a huge clock show for next May.
''I guess that I felt I needed to see time move on,'' he said. Right now, he added, time may be the best gift of all.
Anna Cosentino, an owner of Spring, a seven-year-old gallery and design store in Dumbo, Brooklyn, described the past year as ''one of the more difficult ones, even worse than the year before. People are limiting their spending, perhaps delaying longer on some decisions. We are trying to counteract that, in a way, by directing them toward things that are less whim and more substantial.''
Like Moss, Spring sells functional artwork. One example is the Dandelight, an exquisite piece from a Dutch team called Designdrift that consists of dandelion fluff, LEDs, copper and a battery ($120, Page 6, bottom left). It looks excruciatingly delicate -- those are real dandelion seeds -- and comes with precise instructions on how to extricate it from its box.
''Designdrift is on a really great road,'' Ms. Cosentino said, noting the company's inclusion in a show last year at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. ''They are exploring a lot of beautiful nature-based processes.''
Aurelie Tu, a former designer at Nike, began selling her work -- intricate cut-felt and leather wall and floor coverings and vessels (one lap-size leather container is $1,599; Page 1, top right) -- at crafted-systems.com in June.
Her crisp designs seem to merge origami and quilting, and hit that sweet spot between art and design. They also have a compelling back story. The pieces are made by ''women in transition,'' Ms. Tu said, at a Y in Seattle, her hometown. The women are paid by the piece, she added, ''so they can take as long as they want. It's very healing, like a knitting circle.''
AFTER so many years at Nike, Ms. Tu said, she ''craved handcrafted products, things with a story and with a bigger purpose than an injection-molded product that's mass-produced.''
Her business model is right on target for these times.
''Products that have a soul have been at the forefront for us,'' said Jesse James, a founder of Aesthetic Movement, a design representation and branding firm in Brooklyn.
Mr. James handles companies like Roost, a 10-year-old wholesaler of decorative accessories, lighting and furniture made from natural materials in organic forms, like a naif leather piggy bank with a coiled spring for a tail (from $45; Page 1, center) that is for sale at Mxyplyzyk.
These days, Mr. James's company faces ''a smaller landscape of retailers,'' he said. ''We have less orders but more volume from the orders we do get. Retailers are making pointed decisions about what they are going to bring to their stores.''
Because there is less competition, he added, ''it's allowing those who are still in retail to have a point of view, as opposed to everyone and their brother having a design shop.''
''When a really great retailer comes into our showroom and chooses three or four items and merges those with a curated assortment of like-minded goods,'' he said, ''it creates that kind of magic that's still the best thing in the world.''
On a recent Saturday, Mxyplyzyk was packed with shoppers trawling among the bowls made from bottle caps ($22.95, Page 1, bottom right), swoopy glass bird ornaments ($9.95, center left) and stacks of ''Simple Times,'' Amy Sedaris's dystopian craft book.
The Rev. Jim Erwin, an Episcopal priest from Riverside, Conn., had stopped in for gift ideas, as he said he did every year at this time.
''Holidays are my busy time, so I have to shop early,'' he said.
''I come here because at Christmastime you want something unique, something that isn't at every other store. I have a daughter at college. I don't want to shop at J. Crew.''

HEADLINE: Frazzled Moms Push Back Against Volunteering

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
IT was last spring, somewhere between overseeing Teacher Appreciation Week and planning the fifth-grade graduation party, when Jamie Lentzner, mother of two in Foster City, Calif., reached her breaking point.
She had already designed the fifth-grade T-shirt, taught art twice monthly to three different classes, and organized movie night, restaurant night and beach night fund-raisers. She was overscheduled and exhausted. She had scant time to help her children with their school projects because -- coincidentally -- she was always working on projects for their school. ''You've got to stop,'' said her husband, Darin, who worried that the constant stress she seemed to feel was damaging to her health.
Ms. Lentzner realized that she had spiraled out of control. She vowed to put an end to all this volunteering -- and to recapture some of the serenity in her family life that had vanished because of nothing more than a well-intentioned desire to pitch in. 
Today, more than three months into the school year, Ms. Lentzner is a new woman. She has yet to attend a PTA meeting or decorate so much as a classroom doorknob. When she saw her name listed as chairwoman of the annual Donuts for Dads Day (another event she oversaw last year) on a volunteer sign-up sheet, she whipped out a Sharpie and crossed it out.
''No, I'm not,'' she wrote.
Her business -- she designs children's room decor -- improved, and at home, the change has been striking. She has time to play Ping-Pong and Wii with the children. She hosted 27 relatives and friends for Thanksgiving last week, and for the first time in years she enjoyed the holiday. ''I told my husband, 'I am not stressed,' '' she said. ''I did not have some event hanging over my head, or a T-shirt design that had to be done. I think I finally have my priorities in the right place.''
Around the country there are a number of altruistic, devoted and totally burned-out mothers just like Ms. Lentzner who are becoming emboldened to push back against the relentless requests from their children's schools for their time. What started out as an admirable civic gesture somehow snowballed into an inability to say no to any committee assignment or project request, and spiraled into night, weekend and after-school commitments, middle-of-the-night e-mail exchanges, as well as frozen dinners, takeout pizza and baby sitters at home.
With the holidays approaching, the call for parental help at school has reached a fever pitch, but this demand is not just seasonal. As local and state economies continue to struggle, budget cuts to rich and poor school systems are increasing the reliance on unpaid parent help. The need is so great that some school districts, like a couple of specialty schools in Prince William County, Va., have made it mandatory to commit to a small amount of volunteer time, and others are considering it. In San Jose, Calif., one elementary school district has been discussing a proposal that the families of its 13,000 students commit to 30 hours of volunteer work during the year.
Many parents are happy to volunteer uncoerced, and most everyone recognizes the worthiness of the cause. But the heightened need and expectations are coming at a time when many parents have less and less time to give.
''Volunteerism is way down at our school this year,'' said Gary Parkes, the PTA president at Carmel Elementary School in Woodstock, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. At the school's recent annual fall festival some games had to be closed down because of a lack of adult volunteer supervisors.
Economic necessity, Mr. Parkes said, has forced some stay-at-home mothers to go back to work. ''People are so busy trying to stay afloat, they just do not have as much time as they would like to give,'' Mr. Parkes said, adding that he has heard similar laments in regional PTA meetings. ''This seems to be a problem for a lot of schools.''
(Mr. Parkes has been getting creative. He reached out to the Cub Scouts to help with the fall festival and recruited the girls' lacrosse team at the high school to operate the crazy-hair and face-painting stations. He is also exploring arrangements with the R.O.T.C. and with corporations that have public service programs.)
Other forces are at work besides the lack of free time. The growing world of mom blogging has provided ample forums for exposing the darker feelings of motherhood, and a number of women have taken to cyberspace to gripe about school volunteer work. Some complain that the system preys on maternal guilt and that it creates a sense that a mother's worthiness is measured in how many hours she puts in at her children's schools. Under the headline ''Just Say NO to Volunteering,'' Sarah Auerswald, a former PTA president in Los Angeles, wrote in June, ''What I am about to say is not very PC, so get ready: Moms, stop volunteering so much.''
Ms. Auerswald, who estimated that she had sat through 1,000 meetings over the last 10 years as a volunteer, said all her work for the schools had left her ''a run-down, crabby, resentful wreck.'' Worse, she said in an interview, ''My kids got really resentful.'' When she would leave them with yet another baby sitter, or drag them along for yet another Saturday Clean-up Day at school, they implored, ''Why is it always you who has to do everything, Mom?''
Ms. Auerswald emphasized that her children's school had a very real need for parents' volunteer work. But she said she has learned that parents need to set realistic expectations about what they can accomplish and how much of themselves they can give.
Because the work is unpaid, some volunteers say, few realize the toll it can take on people. ''I know a woman -- the work she did for the public schools was so critical -- she made me look like a loafer,'' Ms. Auerswald said. ''Then her husband left her because she was never home.''
That news was startling to Ms. Auerswald. ''Not that my husband was leaving, luckily,'' she said, ''but he was not happy about how much I was doing.''
Part of the burnout stems from the fact that in most schools a small number of volunteers shoulder the vast majority of the work.
Everyone recognizes this, but they can't help but wring every ounce of commitment out of those who seem willing. Consider the case of Zan Jones.
Ms. Jones is a mother of two in Keller, Tex., who works part time as a booking manager for professional speakers. This fall she was co-chairwoman of the Scholastic Book Fair, a commitment of five full days on top of the multiple meetings required to organize the event. And the decorating.
This year's theme was superheros, so Ms. Jones made the sign with Superman saying, ''It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a book fair!'' She made tall buildings out of cardboard boxes. She stuffed the Spider-Man costume that she had found and bought herself. When it was over, she helped pack everything up and take the money to the bank.
That's a lot of work -- especially since her children don't go to the school anymore.
Near the end of the summer, Ms. Jones's children, a third grader and a fifth grader, were accepted to a charter school, but she felt uneasy about breaking volunteer commitments she had made to their old school. And, apparently, the school was desperate for help.
''They were panicked,'' Ms. Jones said. ''There was not one mention of 'Oh, don't worry about it.' If there was, I probably would have taken it and run with it.''
Still, Ms. Jones insisted that she was happy to help, and no sooner did she fulfill hercommitments at the old school than she started volunteering at the new one. She has chaperoned three field trips, worked in the library and helped set up a ''mad scientist'' dry ice center for a Halloween party. But she admitted she considered bowing out.
''Selfishly, I thought, 'Oh my God, this is my chance for a clean break,' '' she said. ''I thought, 'I can go somewhere where no one knows me, and I can sit silently under the radar and not volunteer.' ''
But, she explained: ''My kids really like me volunteering. Their faces light up when I'm there.''
That is what most parents assume -- that school volunteer work is in the best interests of their children. But some veterans are skeptical. Jen Christensen's epiphany came on her 41st birthday in May 2009. She was presiding over Teacher Appreciation Week at her children's school in San Mateo, Calif., and getting up daily at 4 a.m. to work on the school auction. She was so overcommitted, she said, that she could not find time to celebrate.
What hit harder still was that she had given up working when she had children to be home with them -- and now she was continually leaving them with baby sitters because she had to attend a meeting at school.
The next fall, Ms. Christensen declared herself off-limits to all school volunteer requests. ''I said: 'I'm done. I quit. Don't call. Don't e-mail.' I said I have given so much of myself. I'm spending 50 hours a week working on a volunteer position. Where does it end? You want some blood? I wouldn't even let my husband write a check.''
Ms. Christensen added: ''It felt fabulous. I took a step back and was able to see what was wrong and appreciate the opportunity I have. I don't have to work, and being able to spend time with my kids is what my job really should be.''
She noted the simple pleasure of reading with her 8-year-old son, Owen, in their special ''reading chair.''
''It was calmer in our home and I think everyone was much happier,'' she said.
Some of the push-back stems from just plain irritation over the way volunteer requests are made, often involving large numbers of increasingly desperate-sounding e-mails. A few years ago, Karen Bantuveris was on a plane on a business trip. ''I looked down and literally saw my BlackBerry fill up with reply-all e-mails about whose turn it is to help at recess and to bring snacks,'' she said. ''The more I talked to working moms, the more I heard: 'I can't volunteer anymore. This is ridiculous.' ''
Ms. Bantuveris put her training as a management consultant to work. She invented an online system -- similar to the popular Evite invitation service -- that sends a calendar of volunteer opportunities and allows parents to sign up for those of their choosing without multiple e-mail exchanges. She now runs a company called VolunteerSpot that markets the system, coordinating 460,000 volunteers, 75 percent of them parents in schools.
Even among those who have made the break from volunteering, there is always guilt. ''There is such a need,'' Ms. Christensen said. Her year of saying ''No'' ended when school started this year. But still she is a far cry from her old uber-volunteer self.
She agreed to be a ''room parent'' for the third grade, which means she plans class parties. And she did consent to oversee the kitchen-tour fund-raiser, but she is now ''kind of regretting it.'' It is scheduled for September 2011, Ms. Christensen said, noting, ''I still have time to get out of it.''

HEADLINE: New York's House Delegation to Lose One or Two Seats

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The Census Bureau will announce later this month that the New York Congressional delegation will shrink to the smallest it has been in 200 years, continuing to erode the state's clout in Washington.
The 435 seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned every decade on the basis of population. As a result of the steady tilt to the South and West, New York's 29-member delegation will lose at least one seat and possibly two, continuing an inexorable slide that began after World War II. The loss of two seats appears to be a little less likely because migration from the Northeast lagged during the recession.
Yet the loss of even one seat will make the New York delegation that convenes in 2013 the smallest numerically since 1810, when James Madison was president and fewer than a million people lived in the state. New Yorkers held 27 of the nation's 181 Congressional seats in 1813. 
The delegation peaked at 45 of the total 435 seats in the 1940s.
Proportionately, the New York delegation, which accounted for 15 percent of the Congress in 1813, will be barely 6 percent in 2013.
Whatever modest population growth New York State has recorded since 2000 pales in comparison to that of a number of states in the South and West. In the state, growth has been driven by New York City and several suburban counties, which means they are expected to gain Congressional and legislative seats at the expense of upstate areas.
Which seats are eliminated, of course, depends on a number of variables, the most important being which party controls the Legislature. (Right now, the Democrats comfortably lead the State Assembly while control of the State Senate is unclear, because of races that are still undecided.) Also, lawmakers are under pressure from good government groups to relinquish control over redistricting, ceding it to a nonpartisan commission.
When population shifts between 1990 and 2000 resulted in the loss of two seats for New York, Democrats and Republicans compromised, eliminating one district belonging to a Democrat in Buffalo and one held by a Republican in the Hudson Valley.
Despite Republican gains in November, when the new Congress convenes in January, Democrats will still dominate the delegation, with Republicans occupying just eight or nine seats, depending on the outcome of a Suffolk County race.
The logical region for eliminating districts is upstate, where old cities and towns are emptying out. Moreover, for legislative (but not Congressional) reapportionment, a new law requires state prison inmates to be counted in the urban Democratic districts where they last lived instead of the rural Republican districts where they are incarcerated.
''If New York State loses one seat, most of that loss will come upstate,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist, who analyzed the population shifts for The New York Times. ''If it loses two seats, then the older suburbs downstate will also lose, while New York City and the fast-growing outer ring suburbs will more likely hold their own.''
Districts are supposed to be roughly equal in population. If the delegation is reduced by one seat, each of the remaining 28 Congressional districts should have an average of at least 700,000 residents. Under that formulation, according to Dr. Beveridge's analysis, two upstate districts, the 27th and the 28th, will each fall about 100,000 people short. If the state loses two seats, those two districts and five others upstate with too few people will need to be reconfigured.
The 27th Congressional District, on Lake Erie, is represented by Brian Higgins, who was first elected in 2004. The 28th, abutting Lake Ontario, is represented by Louise M. Slaughter, who has been in office for 24 years. Both are Democrats.
One approach would combine those districts with one or more of the upstate seats won last month by Republicans.
''Usually, it is the newer members whose districts get cut out and are forced to run against another incumbent,'' said Jerry H. Goldfeder, an election law expert.
The governor-elect, Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has signaled his support for a nonpartisan commission to oversee redistricting. But it is far from clear that legislators motivated by self-preservation will give up the coveted power to redraw district lines, even though a majority publicly pledged to New York Uprising, a civic coalition organized by former Mayor Edward I. Koch, that they would support an independent redistricting process.
And with legislative districts also facing revisions, state lawmakers have their own futures to think of, too.
''One dynamic to watch is do Senate Republicans worry about themselves and leave congressmen on float or do they hunker down?'' said Bruce N. Gyory, a political consultant.
State Senator Martin Malave Dilan, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a co-chairman of the Legislative Advisory Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment, has convened a public hearing for Tuesday on redistricting.

HEADLINE: In Crisis, Fed Opened Vault Wide For U.S. and World, Data Shows

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JO CRAVEN McGINTY; Sewell Chan reported from Washington, and Jo Craven McGinty from New York. Reporting was contributed by Eric Dash, Diana B. Henriques, Griff Palmer, Ben Protess and Tom Torok in New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As financial markets shuddered and then nearly imploded in 2008, the Federal Reserve opened its vault to the world on a scope much wider and deeper than previously disclosed.
Citigroup, struggling to stay afloat, sought help from the Fed at least 174 times during one remarkable 13-month period. Barclays, the British bank, at one point owed nearly $48 billion to the Fed. Even better-off banks like Goldman Sachs took advantage of Fed loans offered at rock-bottom rates.
The Fed's efforts to stave off a financial crisis reached far beyond Wall Street, touching manufacturers like General Electric, the Detroit automakers and Harley-Davidson, central banks from Britain to Japan and insurers and pension funds in Sweden and South Korea.
Under orders from Congress, the Fed on Wednesday released details of more than 21,000 transactions under the array of emergency lending programs and other arrangements it conjured up in response to the crisis. 
The disclosures, which the Fed had resisted, offer the most detailed portrait of a panicky period in which the Fed lent money to banks, brokers, businesses and investors to keep the financial system functioning.
The documents show that some of the biggest names in American business were either coming to the Fed in need of a bailout, or trying to make money at a time when the Fed was trying to entice investors back into the markets. Among the latter were prominent investors and entrepreneurs like John A. Paulson and Michael S. Dell, and the pension funds of the Philadelphia Teamsters and Omaha's teachers, who were betting they could profit if the rescue worked.
At its peak at the end of 2008, the Fed had about $1.5 trillion in outstanding credit on its books. The central bank, in essence, pumped liquidity, the lifeblood of credit markets, into the circulatory system of an economy that was experiencing a potentially fatal heart attack.
''I think our actions prevented an even more disastrous outcome,'' said Donald L. Kohn, who was the Fed's vice chairman during the crisis. Without the Fed's help, he said, ''liquidity would have dried up even more than it did, asset prices would have fallen even more than they did, and economic activity and employment would have fallen further and faster then they did.''
But Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, who wrote a provision in the law requiring the disclosures by Dec. 1, reached a different conclusion.
''After years of stonewalling by the Fed, the American people are finally learning the incredible and jaw-dropping details of the Fed's multitrillion-dollar bailout of Wall Street and corporate America,'' he said. ''Perhaps most surprising is the huge sum that went to bail out foreign private banks and corporations.''
Mr. Sanders said the Fed should have forced banks to restrict executive pay and reduce the financial burdens on mortgage borrowers as a condition of its aid.
The Fed, already reeling from attacks from both the right and the left over its latest effort to spur the economy, a plan to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities, braced itself for another moment in the spotlight.
In a statement accompanying the disclosure, the Fed said it had fully protected taxpayers. ''The Federal Reserve followed sound risk-management practices in administering all of these programs, incurred no credit losses on programs that have been wound down, and expects to incur no credit losses on the few remaining programs,'' it said.
The 21,000 transactions span the period from December 2007 to last July.
Even as investors began poring over the disclosures, details emerged from the trove of new data.
From December 2007 to October 2008, the Fed opened swap lines with foreign central banks, allowing them to temporarily trade their currencies for dollars to relieve pressures in their financial markets.
The European Central Bank drew the most heavily on these currency arrangements, the records show, but nine other central banks also made use of them: Australia, Denmark, England, Japan, Mexico, Norway, South Korea, Sweden and Switzerland.
At home, from March 2008 to May 2009, the Fed extended a cumulative total of nearly $9 trillion in short-term loans to 18 financial institutions under a credit program.
Previously, the Fed had only revealed that four financial firms had tapped the special lending program, and did not reveal their identities or the loan amounts.
The data appeared to confirm that Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were under severe strain after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. All three tapped the program on more than 100 occasions.
The American subsidiaries of several foreign banks also benefited substantially from the program. Those institutions included UBS of Switzerland; Mizuho Securities of Japan; and BNP Paribas of France. The impaired credit markets quickly stretched well beyond Wall Street, engulfing money-market mutual funds and commercial paper -- short-term borrowings that companies rely on for day-to-day operations like meeting payroll and paying vendors.
In short order, the Fed set up programs to prop up both markets and get credit flowing again. The new data shows that some of the biggest names in the mutual fund industry sold assets to Fed-financed buyers during the credit crisis, including funds sponsored by Fidelity, BlackRock, Merrill, T. Rowe Price and Oppenheimer.
In the first week of the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Fed bought more than $225 billion in debt. Companies ranging from Ohio's Fifth Third Bank to the best-known bank franchises of Europe and Asia, like Royal Bank of Scotland and Sumitomo, were the primary occupants of the new lifeboat, along with the finance arms of the nation's hard-pressed automakers.
But joining them were issuers of commercial paper with ties to Caterpillar, McDonald's and Verizon.
The data also show that the commercial paper market was impaired well into the latter half of 2009.
Another Fed program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, brought the Fed into the unprecedented position of supporting small business, auto, student, and credit card loans. Plentiful helpings of low-cost debt encouraged institutions to ramp up lending and lured back private investors.
Among prominent investors in that program were the businessmen H. Wayne Huizenga and Julian Robertson; Kendrick R. Wilson III, a former Goldman executive who had been a top aide to Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary during the crisis; and Christy K. Mack, the wife of John J. Mack, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley.
Other surprises emerged from the data. Both the American International Group, the insurer bailed out by the government, and Lehman owned big stakes in funds that bought TALF securities. So did Jonathan S. Sobel, who ran the mortgage department at Goldman Sachs.
Big institutional investors, like Pimco, T. Rowe Price and BlackRock, borrowed from the TALF program. So did the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, and several insurers and university endowments.

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Backs Plan To Honor Privacy Of Online Users

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and TANZINA VEGA; Edward Wyatt reported from Washington and Tanzina Vega from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Signaling a sea change in the debate over Internet privacy, the government's top consumer protection agency on Wednesday advocated a plan that would let consumers choose whether they want their Internet browsing and buying habits monitored.
Saying that online companies have failed to protect the privacy of Internet users, the Federal Trade Commission recommended a broad framework for commercial use of Web consumer data, including a simple and universal ''do not track'' mechanism that would essentially give consumers the type of control they gained over marketers with the national ''do not call'' registry.
Those measures, if widely used, could directly affect the billions of dollars in business done by online advertising companies and by technology giants like Google that collect highly focused information about consumers that can be used to deliver personalized advertising to them.
While the report is critical of many current industry practices, the commission will probably need the help of Congress to enact some of its recommendations. For now, the trade commission hopes to adopt an approach that it calls ''privacy by design,'' where companies are required to build protections into their everyday business practices. 
''Despite some good actors, self-regulation of privacy has not worked adequately and is not working adequately for American consumers,'' Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the trade commission, said. ''We'd like to see companies work a lot faster to make consumer choice easier.''
Many of the problems the F.T.C. is trying to tackle involve third parties that use technology to surreptitiously follow a user around the Web, collecting data and then selling it, usually without the user's knowledge.
''Our main concern,'' Mr. Leibowitz said, ''is the sites and services that are connecting the dots between different times and places that a consumer is online and building a profile of what a consumer is doing.''
The recommendations, which were contained in a 79-page report, were cautiously received by browser makers including Google, Mozilla and Microsoft, who said they would examine the report and provide feedback to the commission.
Mike Zaneis, the senior vice president and general counsel of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, said the industry generally supported the concepts proposed but opposed some of the strict measures preferred by consumer advocates.
The online advertising industry, Mr. Zaneis said, would suffer ''significant economic harm'' if the government controlled the do-not-track mechanism and there was ''a high participation rate similar to that of do not call.'' Mr. Zaneis said the industry would continue to build upon a self-regulatory framework and had recently put in place the use of icons on select online advertisements that allow users to opt out of customized advertising.
''If your goal is to have a red flashing icon that says, 'Click here to opt out of targeting,' and to incentivize people to opt out, then we don't share that goal,'' Mr. Zaneis said.
Currently, millions of Internet users who want to opt out of behavioral tracking have to navigate their browser privacy controls, download plug-ins or opt out by clicking on an icon near an ad that is part of the industry self-regulatory program.
The report recommends that companies adopt simpler, more transparent and streamlined ways of presenting consumers with their options rather than the ''long, incomprehensible privacy policies that consumers typically do not read, let alone understand.'' And the report recommends that data brokers give consumers ''reasonable access'' to any data they have collected.
Mr. Leibowitz said the commission's report was not a call for legislation but a guide to lawmakers and regulators.
''Most of us on the commission believe it is time for a 'do not track' mechanism,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. But at least one commissioner refused to support the issuance of a report that included requiring the mechanism.
In addition, David C. Vladeck, director of the commission's consumer protection bureau, said Wednesday at a conference sponsored by Consumer Watchdog, ''I do not think that under the F.T.C.'s existing authority we could mandate unilaterally a system of 'do not track.' ''
The F.T.C. report asks for the public and industry to comment on its recommendations and to make other suggestions over the next two months.
On Thursday, the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection will hold a hearing to examine the feasibility of a simple method of opting out of online tracking.
If Congress were to mandate a ''do not track'' feature, it could upend the business models of some advertising agencies and companies who gather consumer data and build profiles of Internet users. But it would not prevent basic targeted advertising, where an individual site serves up ads related to a search terms.
Marc Rotenberg, the executive director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the proposal of a 'do not track' mechanism was an important step but not the end of the conversation.
''There's a growing sense that the online ad industry is out of control from a privacy perspective and that some rules need to be put in place,'' said Mr. Rotenberg, whose organization has not decided whether to support the 'do not track' proposal. ''I don't think we're at the point yet where we can say 'do not track' is the silver bullet when it comes to online advertising.''
The makers of the most widely used Web browsers said Wednesday that they supported consumer privacy and had already made efforts to protect it as part of their products.
In a statement, Google said, ''We agree with the F.T.C. that people should be able to understand what information they share and how it's used. That's why we simplified our privacy policies earlier this year, offer control through our privacy tools, and explain our approach to privacy in plain language and through YouTube videos in our privacy center.''
Harvey Anderson, general counsel for Mozilla, stated in a blog post: ''While we'll need more time to digest and evaluate the details, we're encouraged by what we've seen so far. In particular, the F.T.C. has proposed a set of principles that align well with the Mozilla manifesto and our approach to software development.''
Apple, which makes the Safari browser, declined comment. In a statement, Microsoft said that the latest version of its browser, Internet Explorer 8, ''has some of the most robust privacy features on the market,'' including features it calls InPrivate Browsing and InPrivate Filtering, which allow a user to browse the Web without being tracked.
But those types of features also illustrate some of the shortcomings that the F.T.C. found in current industry efforts. The Microsoft browser requires a user to set those enhanced privacy controls at the start of every new browsing session.
Chris Soghoian, a privacy and security researcher, said using privacy options in most Internet browsers ''doesn't do much.''
At the Consumer Watchdog conference, Mr. Soghoian said that because many of the companies that make Web browsers are also supported by advertising networks, ''the design decisions are motivated by a desire not to hurt their advertising divisions.''
''The situation right now is laughable,'' he added. ''There certainly isn't a single one-stop shop.''

HEADLINE: As Officers Are Cut, Fears of a Regression Take Root in Newark

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; Richard Perez-Pena, Matt Rainey and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
NEWARK -- For Ramon Tabera, the news that this city was laying off 163 police officers brought back memories of the pain in his left knee and right ankle, where he was shot five years ago during a nighttime robbery at a grocery store where he works.
''It's bad,'' Mr. Tabera said Wednesday as he stocked shelves, adding, ''A lot of police is a good thing.'' 
A day after Mayor Cory A. Booker announced that the city was laying off roughly 13 percent of its police force, residents battered by decades of runaway crime and stampeding blight raised the specter of the bad old days.
For some that went back as far as the 1970s, when residents abandoned Newark in droves. That was before Mr. Booker, who was elected in 2006, promised to focus on bringing the city's crime rate down, an effort he pursued with early success: the murder rate fell for two years in a row, and one calendar month last spring there was not a single killing, something that had not happened since the 1960s.
But there has been a rise in crime rates this year, and in the neighborhoods surrounding the grocery store where Mr. Tabera stocked shelves on Wednesday afternoon, the murder rate has nearly doubled since last year.
On Wednesday, as officers continued to turn in their badges and guns at police stations and the Guardian Angels offered to help patrol the streets, citizens, police officers and politicians wrestled with the consequences of a depleted police force.
Mr. Booker acknowledged the perception problem caused by the layoffs, but said that any comparison to the past was unfounded. The city spent years streamlining and modernizing the department, he said, an effort that helped reduce the rate of shootings. ''It was a very bad week -- there's no doubt about it,'' Mr. Booker said. ''This is not something anyone could choose, but it's not going to stop our momentum.''
Newark's police director, Garry F. McCarthy, said by consolidating or reorganizing departments the city would be able to keep enough officers on the streets. But some of the cuts were more painful: last month, anticipating the layoffs, the department suspended Operation Impact, a program that deploys officers in high-crime areas.
''It's disappointing,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''It was totally avoidable.''
The layoffs came after Mr. Booker, trying to close an $83 million budget shortfall, was unable to wrest nearly $10 million in concessions from Newark's largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police.
During a protracted dispute, the union accused the city of negotiating in bad faith, while Mr. Booker said the union rejected even modest concessions. The union president, Derrick Hatcher, did not return calls seeking comment.
Cities across New Jersey have resorted to similar layoffs, their hands forced by falling tax collections, cuts in state aid and rising expenses. On Tuesday, the State Civil Service Commission approved Camden's plan to lay off 383 of the city's 1,100 employees, the deepest cuts in any major municipality. One-third of the Fire Department jobs would be eliminated, along with about half of the police force, which had been spared in previous cuts. All nonuniform city employees are already on unpaid furlough one day a week.
Camden's layoffs would take effect Jan. 18, and city officials say there is still time to reduce the number if the unions will agree to concessions, but so far the unions have refused.
Trenton has sent layoff notices to about 400 city workers, and Atlantic City has laid off 60 police officers.
The layoffs in Newark represented the deepest cuts to the Police Department in decades. The number of layoffs cited by the city did not include four officers who had passed the civil service exam but had not been hired, Mr. Booker said, adding that he hoped to rehire the officers. One veteran police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the department, said belt-tightening and reorganization was already causing hardship in Newark's police districts.
He said the number of detectives in one high-crime district had been cut in half, leaving the remaining detectives overburdened and falling behind on their caseloads. ''Without detectives, you're not solving crimes. You got guys out on patrol responding and no one to back them up. The quality of investigations is not going to be there.''
The Police Department acknowledged what they said were temporary staffing shortages, but said that the headcount in individual police districts would be maintained.
That did nothing to soothe nerves on the streets of Newark on Wednesday -- or calm the anger at the political establishment. At lunchtime at Je's Restaurant in downtown Newark, Kimble Wright, 42, a teacher, said the layoffs were caused by a city government spending beyond its means. ''We have enjoyed a lifestyle that cannot be maintained,'' he said. ''I think we're coming back to the fundamentals, when block associations used to do the jobs that we hired police to do.''
Angel Williams, 32, who sat nearby and works in child care, said she feared a return to the lawlessness of the 1970s. ''I think it's going to get really bad without more cops,'' she said. ''If they take them away, who's going to protect us?''
In the morning's pouring rain, Kelvin Barnett, 26, who joined the Police Department in 2008, left a precinct stationhouse after turning in his gun and badge. He had been on vacation when news of the layoffs -- including his -- came. He filed for unemployment on Tuesday.
Mr. Barnett, born and raised in Newark, said he had loved being a police officer and still hoped to find work in his city or another one. He said he and his out-of-work colleagues were worried about being civilians again and living among men they had arrested. And while he was disappointed at the layoffs, he refused to point fingers at either the city or the union.
''I guess people didn't try hard enough,'' he said. ''It feels like cutting public safety should be the last resort.''

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; WALL OF JUNK

BYLINE: By HEIDI N. MOORE

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's data dump of more than 21,000 loan documents from the financial crisis provides a vivid reminder of how ugly it can get when the credit markets freeze up. In order to get crucial overnight loans, hundreds of banks had nothing else to give the Fed as collateral except junk-rated loans and bonds -- valued at $1.3 trillion.
Securities rated that low are risky because no one wants to buy them when the markets freeze up. As a result, many banks could not push these junk securities off their balance sheets by selling them. 
Could this happen again? Perhaps not on the same scale, but it would be a mistake to believe that the overhang of junk is lifting. New research from Moody's Investors Service suggests that low-rated American companies have about $100 billion more in debt to refinance than analysts previously thought.
This year has seen a boom in higher-yield leveraged loans -- risky corporate loans with low credit ratings -- and in their cousins, junk bonds. In fact, there has never been a bigger year than 2010 for junk bonds and leveraged loans, the high-risk debt that help companies with low credit ratings sustain their businesses.
The conventional wisdom has been that many companies have been running to the credit markets this year to refinance expensive loans taken out during the financial crisis. The new debt has lower interest payments -- which is good for the economy, since it improves those companies' balance sheets and lessens the pressure to lay off employees.
If the markets should freeze up again, hundreds of American companies would be left short of at least $215 billion they need to survive -- or about $100 billion more than expected.
Here's why: Moody's found that many companies that take out leveraged loans do them in pairs, by signing a term loan and a revolving credit facility that they plan to renew regularly. About 97 percent of the companies they studied did that. That, in turn, means that companies have to refinance more loans than previously predicted, because they're working in pairs.
The two loans are governed by the same credit agreement, but they are likely to mature at different dates: for instance, one will come due in 2013 and the other in 2014. Companies prefer not to refinance twice -- they will do it just once. So this means that the ''wall of debt maturities'' coming due in 2013 and 2014 will result in more and bigger loans being issued this next year.
That, of course, assumes investors are still willing to buy those loans. But if investors lose their appetites, these low-rated companies could be left in the lurch, owing billions.
Tiina Siilberg, the author of the Moody's report, said the biggest factor keeping the leveraged-loan market afloat was liquidity, or the ability to find a buyer for every seller.
The market ''needs to continue to help the companies refinance the facilities to support the recovery,'' she said. ''If it continues the same way, the companies should be able to refinance their facilities. However, if there's a pullback, or another liquidity crunch, then there are going to be some issues.''
There's no telling what could cause a liquidity crunch. There could be a shock to the market, or demand could simply fall off. Many investors have loaded up on junk bonds and leveraged loans for the past two years; they might find their portfolios full. Or, if interest rates go up, those investors may start to prefer Treasury bonds.
The potential consequences of the market freezing up again, however, should be enough to make deal makers think about coming up with a good Plan B.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Glimmers of Hope for Small Films During Glittery Oscar Promotions

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK; Mekado Murphy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
''Brooklyn, Brooklyn in the house!'' Darren Aronofsky shouted from the front of the Ziegfeld Theater on Tuesday night. Mr. Aronofsky, the director and Coney Island native, was living out a childhood fantasy when his film ''Black Swan'' had its New York premiere at that Midtown Manhattan movie palace, which he frequented while growing up. ''Mom, I have a confession: I cut out of high school to see 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in this theater,'' he said, later admitting it wasn't a one-time thing.
It was a local-boy-made-good moment for ''Black Swan,'' which opens in select cities on Friday. For the premiere the red carpet extended down the block, the paparazzi screamed for the stars -- Natalie Portman, in a decollete black gown, Mila Kunis, in a cream one, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder, Vincent Cassel -- and afterward, everyone gathered at a party in the chandeliered St. Regis hotel, which was decked out in tarnished mirrors and strategically placed black and white feathers. The mood was jubilant, and the look was slightly creepy, appropriate for a fantasy- and horror-tinged story of a perfectionist ballerina (Ms. Portman) madly preparing for ''Swan Lake.'' 
Downtown on the same night, in the back room of an Italian bistro in Chelsea, ''The Kids Are All Right'' was having a little soiree, one so low key that even the presence of two of its stars, Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo, caused barely a ripple among the restaurant patrons out front. The film, about lesbian parents (Ms. Moore and Annette Bening) who must deal with meeting their children's sperm donor (Mr. Ruffalo), was a Sundance Film Festival hit and an indie success story when it opened this summer. Both films represent the vision of dedicated directors, who labored for years to get their work on screen despite having impressive credits. And both could wind up in a catbird seat come Oscar night. Already this week they have earned accolades, scoring multiple nominations from the Film Independent Spirit Awards, which will be handed out the day before the Oscars at the end of February. As a director Mr. Aronofsky was also honored Monday night at the Gotham Independent Film Awards, the traditional opening day of statuette campaigning in New York. (''Black Swan'' and ''The Kids Are All Right'' were nominated there too but lost the top prizes to ''Winter's Bone,'' a lower-budget drama set in the Ozarks.)
As surely as the holiday season brings sugarplum fairies and eggnog, it also means the start of a few months of fiercely competitive self-promotion for Hollywood. The weeks leading up to the Oscars are a fanciful slog of cocktail parties, luncheons, lesser award shows and industry screenings, all of which I chronicle daily in my role as the Carpetbagger columnist. Already there is a short list of films that are likely to be anointed with one of the 10 best-picture spots, including, in addition to ''Black Swan'' and ''The Kids Are All Right,'' ''The Social Network,'' ''Inception,'' ''The King's Speech'' ''Toy Story 3,'' ''127 Hours'' and ''Winter's Bone.'' ''The Fighter,'' a boxing film from David O. Russell, and ''True Grit,'' the Coen brothers remake of that John Wayne classic, are latecomers to the still wide-open race, adding drama to the ever-shifting predictions from Oscarologists.
One thing my compatriots agree on: The contest for best actress will be noteworthy. Besides Ms. Bening, Ms. Moore and Ms. Portman, Jennifer Lawrence, the 20-year-old star of ''Winter's Bone,'' and Nicole Kidman, playing a grieving mother in ''Rabbit Hole,'' are being lauded for standout performances. (In what may be a glimpse of the competition to come, the Spirit Awards nominated six actresses instead of the usual five this year; Ms. Bening got a nod, but Ms. Moore didn't.)
Directors rarely admit to Oscar considerations when making a film, but Lisa Cholodenko, the director and co-writer of ''The Kids Are All Right'' with Stuart Blumberg, is an exception. ''We did so many revisions,'' she said, having a cigarette outside her party on Tuesday, ''and we were so painstaking about making sure these characters were spot on, and that they worked and they worked together and they were funny and complicated and dramatic and all the things we knew they could be. And at the end of the day we thought: If we get the right people to play these parts, and it all comes together in the right way, these are like Oscar parts.''
But even with Ms. Bening and Ms. Moore attached ''The Kids Are All Right'' was difficult to make. ''I was with the project for five years,'' Ms. Moore said at the party. She hung on through all the revisions and delays because, she said, she liked Ms. Cholodenko's work, her colloquial style and the story. Ms. Cholodenko, whose previous films ''High Art'' and ''Laurel Canyon,'' made her an indie darling, built the film around her two stars. ''I was desperate to work with them,'' she said. Still, her budget was scraped together.
The same was true for Mr. Aronofsky. He got a taste of the awards hullabaloo with his previous film, ''The Wrestler,'' about a washed-up fighter played by Mickey Rourke, and has been plotting a ballet film for years. '' 'Black Swan' was probably harder to make than any film I ever did,'' he said. ''I thought because I was doing something sexy with Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel,'' who plays the ballet company's director, ''I thought it was going to be really easy. And then we had to split our budget by two-thirds to get it made.'' (The film, from Fox Searchlight, cost $13 million; ''The Kids Are All Right,'' which cost less than $4 million, was bought by Focus Features after Sundance.)
In Hollywood terms those are pittances. (The forthcoming Disney movie ''Tron: Legacy,'' for example, has a production and marketing budget of at least $150 million.) But it's worth noting that both ''Black Swan'' and ''The Kids Are All Right'' wound up at the boutique divisions of major studios, which still have the distribution and marketing might the smaller indies can only dream of. The distance between economic reality and Oscar glitter may be the greatest for ''Winter's Bone,'' a modest film, in budget and style, which was a surprise Gotham winner.
''It's a huge deal to have work that can't be on billboards, necessarily, be spoken about, and have clips shown, and have a discussion ensue,'' said Debra Granik, the film's director. She admitted to having serious nerves about awards season. ''The contraction of the lungs, the viscera, the capillaries -- it's just not a way to live,'' she said.
But for the anointed few there is more agita, and promotion, ahead.
''I've done 20 days of press,'' Mr. Ruffalo said at the party for ''The Kids Are All Right,'' ''for a movie I worked 6 days on.''

HEADLINE: Asia Captured Lion's Share of Big Stock Offerings in 2010

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG - A bank whose customer base is larger than the population of the United States, a French cosmetics maker, a microlender and a Chinese pharmaceutical company that makes an anticoagulant derived from pigs' guts: Asian stock exchanges have seen it all this year.
And it is not just the variety of stocks on offer. It is the sheer number of companies rushing to market in Asia, and the huge amounts they are raising. General Motors may have raised $23.1 billion in its initial public offering - but it is fast-growing Asia, not Wall Street, that has had most of the world's new listings this year. 
Eight of the 10 largest market debuts in the world this year took place on Asian stock exchanges. Two of the biggest - for American International Assurance, the Asian unit of American International Group, and the giant lender Agricultural Bank of China - each raised more than $20 billion. That is about three times as much as the total amount raised in 70 share listings in North and South America during the third quarter of this year.
''The rise of Asia has been accelerating since the financial crisis,'' said Vikram Malhotra, co-head of investment banking for the Asia-Pacific region at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.
In 2000, 21.5 percent of all initial public offers globally, in terms of value, were raised on stock exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region. This figure has climbed to 64 percent, according to data compiled by Dealogic. The Americas, which in 2000 accounted for 41 percent, have dropped back to 20 percent - even with the G.M. issue.
And despite the recent market nervousness, which has prompted at least two companies in Asia to put their I.P.O.'s on ice, the total value of initial public offerings in the region this year could match, or even exceed, the boom year of 2007, many investment bankers say.
In terms of volume, ''this could be the best year ever for Asia, outside Japan,'' said Ashok Pandit, co-head of equity capital markets for Asia at Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong. And 2011, he added, could be just as strong.
And it is not just Asian companies that are going public in the region. L'Occitane, the French cosmetics maker, and Rusal, the aluminum giant controlled by a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, were among the first to seek primary listings in Hong Kong - rather than in Paris or Moscow - this year. Last week, Caterpillar issued a renminbi-denominated bond for about $150 million, highlighting how important a location Asia has become for other forms of issuance, too.
The reason for all this activity is that Asia - outside Japan - is enjoying stellar economic growth. Investors are eager to secure exposure to Asian markets - and with interest rates still low in many parts of the world, there is plenty of cash looking for potentially higher returns in the region.
All this has helped send stock markets across much of the region higher this year and ensured that even large listings like that of American International Assurance in October were heavily subscribed.
In Europe and the United States, by contrast, economies are still struggling to gain speed, while jitters about the debt levels of countries like Ireland and Greece have affected sentiment.
''There was a lot of caution in the markets during the first seven months of the year,'' said Todd Marin, the head of investment banking in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, at JPMorgan Chase. ''But since August, we've seen a huge amount of cash looking for a home - and Asia comes out looking very appealing.''
The flow of capital into Asian assets has been so rapid that some analysts say asset bubbles are in the making. But most say that Asia is not quite there yet and that the rally in Asian stock markets - and initial public offerings - still has some way to run.
''Tactically speaking, there may be too much froth at present,'' analysts at Citibank wrote in a recent note. ''But we are strongly of the belief that markets are not in bubble territory.''
The Asian share of global mergers and acquisitions has grown as well. The region is not quite as dominant in this field as it is in share listings, but the last few years have seen overseas companies making more purchases in Asia and Asian companies becoming more active acquirers. Nearly 23 percent of mergers and acquisitions globally by value have been on assets in the Asia-Pacific region this year, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. That is up from 21.8 percent in 2009. Similarly, 25 percent of purchases so far this year were staged by Asian-based acquirers, up from 21 percent last year.
''Back in 1999, no one would have said that this part of the world was a serious M.&A. market,'' said Gordon Paterson, who heads Deutsche Bank's team in the Asia-Pacific region for mergers and acquisitions. ''China was not even on the map, as far as M.&A. activity is concerned. It's only in the last six years that Chinese companies have emerged as serious buyers.''
Average deal sizes remain smaller than in the West. But increasingly, Asian companies are venturing into mergers and acquisitions as a way to expand their geographical reach, or to gain access to resources and expertise.
''Most markets in Asia are still showing strong growth, so companies don't need to turn to M.&A. to drive their revenue,'' said Mr. Marin of JPMorgan. ''That said, many Asia companies have now grown to a size and scale where M.&A. becomes one tool by which to address some of their strategic issues - say integrating across the vertical chain or growing offshore capabilities.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Small-City Congregations Try to Preserve Rituals of Jewish Life

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Although Irving Greenblum, an 81-year-old investor and retired furniture store owner, has four grown sons, he says he is ''the last Greenblum who lives in Laredo,'' a city on Texas' border with Mexico.
That is because his sons -- three trained as lawyers, one as an architect -- have moved away and built their careers in larger Texas cities, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. 
Born in Mexico to immigrant Russian Jews, Mr. Greenblum said that with a dwindling population, the rituals of Jewish life are fading in Laredo, including the pastime of schmoozing by border merchants. His father, who started the family's furniture business in 1937, ''used to spend a whole afternoon going from store to store'' having coffee with local Jewish merchants. ''Nowadays, when I go downtown there are few to visit,'' he said.
Faced with an economic and social decline, shrinking synagogue membership and the eventual end of cemetery oversight, struggling Jewish communities like Laredo, Sumter, S.C., and Marion, Ind., are turning to a philanthropic matchmaker for help: David Sarnat, the developer of the Jewish Community Legacy Project, helps them find organizations in places with thriving Jewish populations that can take over cemetery maintenance and transfer or sell synagogues, religious scrolls and other assets when their members have moved away or died.
The Legacy Project adapts a familiar concept -- the living will -- with a novel twist. First introduced in California in 1976, this legal document has evolved beyond its original goal of letting people specify the medical treatment they would like at the end of their lives.
After the 2008 banking crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act instructed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to have the largest financial institutions in the country write a living will to plan for their orderly demise, if necessary.
Last summer, Mr. Sarnat, former head of the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta, obtained a $600,000 two-year grant for the project from the Marcus Foundation, established by Bernard Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot. (Mr. Marcus and his wife, Billi, were among the first 40 signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment by wealthy Americans to donate the majority of their fortunes to charity.)
According to Jonathan D. Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, most Jews in the United States have migrated from small communities to large cities: he estimates that 85 percent of the country's 5.2 million Jews live in 20 metropolitan areas, primarily on the East and West Coasts and in Sun Belt states.
Mr. Sarnat estimates there are 150 to 200 communities across the country that could benefit from the project's help.
The process of dismantling a community, experts say, is fraught with potential tensions involving both purse and heartstrings. Mark A. Raider, a professor of modern Jewish history at the University of Cincinnati, cited disagreements over disposition of material assets.
''Where there's money, real estate and other significant resources, there tends to be differing and often opposing views about who should control it,'' Dr. Raider said.
Rabbi Mychal Springer, director of the Center for Pastoral Education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, says the project will have to deal with ''extraordinary sensitivity on the part of all people involved.''
''When a community is shutting its doors and making decisions about what should be,'' Rabbi Springer said, ''some people let go sooner and others hold on longer. There can be a lot of angst, disagreement and regret.''
Such emotions embroiled members of Temple Sinai, a Reform congregation in Sumter with 36 mostly elderly members. When Roger Ackerman, the 78-year-old retired owner of a metal recycling business, proposed the concept of a ''temple will'' to congregation members in 2005, not everyone supported him.
''People hope the problem will go away,'' Mr. Ackerman said.
Raymond Reich, a Sumter city official and president of Temple Sinai, said Mr. Ackerman's opponents ''felt that saying the congregation was going to die, that it was no longer viable, was taking a negative approach.''
''In my opinion,'' Mr. Reich added, they were ''putting their heads in the sand.''
The congregation eventually came around: They created a committee to plan the synagogue's future, which Mr. Ackerman leads, and, with Mr. Sarnat's help, signed an agreement for cemetery maintenance with the Charleston Jewish Federation.
Members of Laredo's Jewish community, whom Mr. Sarnat has introduced to officials of the Federation of Greater Austin for cemetery care, are facing the community's decline with both sadness and resignation.
''It doesn't make me feel too good,'' Mr. Greenblum said. ''This is the place where I grew up, my home, my background. It's dying. But you have to face reality.''
His sister and parents are buried in Laredo's Jewish cemetery, and he has set aside plots there for himself and his wife, Shirley.
Evelyn Selig, 64, a Laredo retailer and widow whose three children have moved away, said the membership of her Conservative synagogue had dwindled to 40 families, from a peak 30 years ago of more than 100.
''My synagogue is my home,'' Ms. Selig said. ''But I'm a realist.''
The handover of the cemetery's maintenance, she explained, will not occur ''for over 20 years.'' ''But,'' she said, ''we want to get it established and know there is some succession and continuity in oversight.''
Mr. Marcus said the project made people ''think about the inevitable, compels them to focus in on areas where they'd like to have a legacy established.''
And that might well have a positive ripple effect, predicted Eli N. Evans, a writer on Southern Jewish life and former president of the Charles H. Revson Foundation.
Mr. Marcus' support of a national initiative ''should be a signal to other philanthropists with smaller family foundations to help locally in the states and communities they live in,'' he said.
In the meanwhile, Jewish life, however diminished, continues in Laredo. Ms. Selig's synagogue will celebrate Hanukkah at a party on Sunday, with close to 50 people expected. Four or five will be children; years ago there would have been 40.
''I'm sorry there won't be more children,'' she said. ''But I am happy we are celebrating, doing a party and making an effort to have an active community.''

HEADLINE: Embracing Georgia, U.S. Misread Signs of Region's Rifts, Cables Show

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Throughout the cold war and often in the years since, Western diplomats covering the Kremlin routinely relied on indirect and secondhand or thirdhand sources. Their cables were frequently laden with skepticism, reflecting the authors' understanding of the limits of their knowledge and suspicion of official Russian statements.
A 2008 batch of American cables from another country once in the cold war's grip -- Georgia -- showed a much different sort of access. In Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, American officials had all but constant contact and an open door to President Mikheil Saakashvili and his young and militarily inexperienced advisers, who hoped the United States would help Georgia shake off its Soviet past and stand up to Russia's regional influence. 
The Tbilisi cables, part of more than a quarter-million cables made available to news organizations by WikiLeaks, display some of the perils of a close relationship.
The cables show that for several years, as Georgia entered an escalating contest with the Kremlin for the future of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two breakaway enclaves out of Georgian control that received Russian support, Washington relied heavily on the Saakashvili government's accounts of its own behavior. In neighboring countries, American diplomats often maintained their professional distance, and privately detailed their misgivings of their host governments. In Georgia, diplomats appeared to set aside skepticism and embrace Georgian versions of important and disputed events.
By 2008, as the region slipped toward war, sources outside the Georgian government were played down or not included in important cables. Official Georgian versions of events were passed to Washington largely unchallenged.
The last cables before the eruption of the brief Russian-Georgian war showed an embassy relaying statements that would with time be proved wrong.
''Deputy Minister of Defense Batu Kutelia told Ambassador at mid-day August 7 that Georgian military troops are on higher alert, but will not be deploying,'' one cable noted, as Georgian heavy military equipment was en route to the conflict zone.
Mr. Kutelia's assurance did not stand, even in real time. In one of the few signs of the embassy's having staff in the field, the cable noted that ''embassy observers on the highway'' saw about 30 government buses ''carrying uniformed men heading north.''
Still the embassy misread the signs, telling Washington that while there were ''numerous reports that the Georgians are moving military equipment and forces,'' the embassy's ''initial impressions'' were that the Georgians ''were in a heightened state of alertness to show their resolve.''
In fact, Georgia would launch a heavy artillery-and-rocket attack on Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital, at 11:35 p.m. on Aug. 7, ending a cease-fire it had declared less than five hours before.
The bombardment plunged Georgia into war, pitting the West against Russia in a standoff over both Russian military actions and the behavior of a small nation that the United States had helped arm and train.
A confidential cable the next morning noted that Georgia's Foreign Ministry had briefed the diplomatic corps, claiming that ''Georgia now controlled most of South Ossetia, including the capital.'' The cable further relayed that ''Saakashvili has said that Georgia had no intention of getting into this fight, but was provoked by the South Ossetians and had to respond to protect Georgian citizens and territory.''
Rather than emphasize the uncertainties, it added, ''All the evidence available to the country team supports Saakashvili's statement that this fight was not Georgia's original intention.'' Then it continued: ''Only when the South Ossetians opened up with artillery on Georgian villages'' did the offensive begin.
This exceptionally bold claim would be publicly echoed throughout the Bush administration, which strongly backed Georgia on the world's stage. To support it, the American Embassy appeared to have no staff members in the field beyond ''eyes on the ground at the Ministry of Interior command post'' on Aug. 8. The cable did not provide supporting sources outside of the Georgian government. Instead, as justification for the Georgian attack the previous night, a Georgian government source, Temuri Yakobashvili, was cited as telling the American ambassador that ''South Ossetians continued to shoot at the Georgian villages despite the announcement of the cease-fire.''
The cable contained no evidence that the Ossetian attacks after the cease-fire had actually occurred and played down the only independent account, which came from military observers in Tskhinvali from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The observers, in the heart of the conflict zone, did not report hearing or seeing any Ossetian artillery attacks in the hours before Georgia bombarded Tskhinvali. Rather, they reported to an American political officer that ''the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali began at 2335 on Aug. 7 despite the cease-fire.''
Nonetheless, the American cable, relying on Georgian government sources, offered as ''one plausible explanation for all this'' that South Ossetia's leader, Eduard Kokoity, had ''decided to roll the dice and stimulate a conflict with the Georgians in hopes of bringing in the Russians and thereby saving himself.''
It was not Mr. Kokoity who would require saving. On Aug. 9, as Russian forces flowed into Georgia, a cable noted that ''President Saakashvili told the Ambassador in a late morning phone call that the Russians are out to take over Georgia and install a new regime.''
Still the reliance on one-sided information continued -- including Georgian exaggerations of casualties and Mr. Saakashvili's characterization of Russian military actions.
The Saakashvili government was publicly insisting that its bombardments of Tskhinvali were justified and precise. But an American cable noted that when Russian ordnance landed on the Georgian city of Gori, Mr. Saakashvili took a different view of the meaning of heavy weapons attacks in civilian areas. He called the Russian attacks ''pure terror.''
By then the West and Russia were mostly talking past each other, and Georgia's American-trained military had been humiliated in the field and was fleeing the fight.
A few weeks later, after a more stable cease-fire had been negotiated and at a time when the American economy was sliding into a recession, President George W. Bush announced a $1 billion aid package to help Georgia rebuild.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Finds Pace Of Growth Still Sluggish

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The economy continued its slow recovery in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, with pockets of strength in manufacturing offset by ''depressed'' housing markets and employers still reluctant to hire in significant numbers.
The central bank's beige book, a report prepared for the Fed's Dec. 14 policy meeting, showed more anecdotal evidence that the economy was struggling to break into expansion that was fast enough to generate sufficient job growth. 
The lukewarm report appeared unlikely to derail the Fed's latest efforts to push down borrowing costs by increasing its purchases of Treasury debt.
''Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts indicate that the economy continued to improve, on balance, during the reporting period from early/mid-October to mid-November,'' the Fed said in the report.
The Fed said economic activity in its Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco districts increased at a ''slight to modest'' pace, while the New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City districts reported a ''somewhat stronger'' pace of activity.
Philadelphia and St. Louis reported business conditions as ''mixed,'' the Fed said.
The beige book showed that manufacturing continued to expand in almost all districts, with ''relatively strong growth seen in the metal fabrication and the automotive industries.''
But it said housing markets remained depressed, with several districts reporting a further weakening in the sector over the last six weeks.
The Fed said reports on consumer spending were seen as positive, with several districts expecting holiday sales to exceed levels from last year.
But it noted that households were vulnerable to prices and were still focused on buying necessities.
''Hiring activity showed some improvement across most districts, although employers are waiting for clearer signals of expanding business prospects before adding significantly to payrolls,'' the Fed said. Wage pressures remained ''subdued'' across districts, indicating little inflation pressure.
The Fed said prices for final goods and services were fairly stable across districts despite rising input costs, especially for agricultural commodities, metals and fuel.
In other reports, private sector payrolls in November rose by the biggest amount since November 2007, while manufacturing data showed that growth was intact.
Private employers added a stronger-than-forecast 93,000 jobs after an upwardly revised gain of 82,000 the month before, according to data by ADP Employer Services, which developed the report with Macroeconomic Advisers.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity dipped to 56.6 last month from 56.9 in October, in line with expectations and well above the 50 level which indicates expansion.
The report also showed employment plans were steady with the prior month.
A government report showed construction spending rose 0.7 percent in October, better than the 0.4 percent forecast by analysts.
Another report showed that nonfarm productivity grew faster in the third quarter than previously estimated.
According to the government data, productivity increased at an annual rate of 2.3 percent rather than the 1.9 percent pace reported last month, as employers squeezed more output from workers and kept costs down.
Also, the number of planned layoffs in November rose to the highest since March, according to a report by the consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Employers announced 48,711 planned job cuts last month, up 28 percent from 37,986 in October.
The government and nonprofit sector led the rise, the report showed.

HEADLINE: U.S. Diplomats Fretted About Canadians With a 'Chip on Their Shoulder'

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE; Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In early 2008, American diplomats stationed in Ottawa turned on their television sets and were aghast: there was an ''onslaught'' of Canadian shows depicting ''nefarious American officials carrying out equally nefarious deeds in Canada,'' from planning to bomb Quebec to stealing Canadian water supplies.
In a confidential diplomatic cable sent back to the State Department, the American Embassy warned of increasing mistrust of the United States by its northern neighbor, with which it shares some $500 billion in annual trade, the world's longest unsecured border and a joint military mission in Afghanistan. 
''The degree of comfort with which Canadian broadcast entities, including those financed by Canadian tax dollars, twist current events to feed longstanding negative images of the U.S. -- and the extent to which the Canadian public seems willing to indulge in the feast -- is noteworthy as an indication of the kind of insidious negative popular stereotyping we are increasingly up against in Canada,'' the cable said.
A trove of diplomatic cables, obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to a number of publications, disclose a perception by American diplomats that Canadians ''always carry a chip on their shoulder'' in part because of a feeling that their country ''is condemned to always play 'Robin' to the U.S. 'Batman.' ''
But at the same time, some Canadian officials privately tried to make it clear to their American counterparts that they did not share their society's persistent undercurrent of anti-Americanism.
In July 2008, Canada's intelligence service director, James Judd, discussed a video showing a crying Omar Khadr, then a teenager and a Canadian detainee at the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Judd ''observed that the images would no doubt trigger 'knee-jerk anti-Americanism' and 'paroxysms of moral outrage, a Canadian specialty.' ''
A cable that briefed President George W. Bush before a visit to Ottawa in late 2004 shed further light on the asymmetrical relationship with Canada -- a country, the embassy wrote, that was engaged in ''soul-searching'' about its ''decline from 'middle power' status to that of an 'active observer' of global affairs, a trend which some Canadians believe should be reversed.''
It also noted that Canadian officials worried that they were being excluded from a club of English-speaking countries as a result of their refusal to take part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The United States had created a channel for sharing intelligence related to Iraq operations with Britain and Australia, but Canada was not invited to join.
The Canadian government ''has expressed concern at multiple levels that their exclusion from a traditional 'four-eyes' construct is 'punishment' for Canada's nonparticipation in Iraq and they fear that the Iraq-related channel may evolve into a more permanent 'three-eyes' only structure,'' the cable said.
Four years later, after President Obama's election, the embassy reported that Canadian officials had a different potential irritant: Mr. Obama was far more popular in Canada than they were.
The embassy also said Mr. Obama's decision to make Ottawa his first foreign trip as president would ''do much to diminish -- temporarily, at least -- Canada's habitual inferiority complex vis-a-vis the U.S. and its chronic but accurate complaint that the U.S. pays far less attention to Canada than Canada does to us.''
Still, just a few months earlier, during a national election in Canada, the embassy had marveled that ''despite the overwhelming importance of the U.S. to Canada for its economy and security,'' parliamentary candidates were rarely mentioning anything about relations with their southern neighbor.
''Ultimately, the U.S. is like the proverbial 900-pound gorilla in the midst of the Canadian federal election: overwhelming but too potentially menacing to acknowledge,'' the cable said.

PERSON: Samuel T. Cohen 

HEADLINE: Samuel T. Cohen, 89, Dies; Invented Neutron Bomb and Was Its Chief Advocate

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Samuel T. Cohen, the physicist who invented the small tactical nuclear weapon known as the neutron bomb, a controversial device designed to kill enemy troops with subatomic particles but leave battlefields and cities relatively intact, died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 89.
The cause was complications of stomach cancer, his son Paul said.
Unlike J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller, the respective fathers of the atomic and hydrogen bombs, Mr. Cohen was not well known outside government and scientific circles, although his work for years influenced the international debate over the deployment and potential uses of nuclear arms.
In contrast to strategic warheads, which can kill millions and level cities, and smaller short-range tactical nuclear arms designed to wipe out battlefield forces, the neutron bomb minimized blast and heat. Instead, it maximized a barrage of infinitesimal neutrons that could zip through tanks, buildings and other structures and kill people, usually by destroying the central nervous system, and all other life forms. 
While doubters questioned the usefulness, logic and ethics of killing people and sparing property, Mr. Cohen called his bomb a ''sane'' and ''moral'' weapon that could limit death, destruction and radioactive contamination, killing combatants while leaving civilians and towns unscathed. He insisted that many critics misunderstood or purposely misrepresented his ideas for political, economic or mercenary reasons.
A specialist in the radiological effects of nuclear weapons, he relentlessly promoted the neutron bomb for much of his life, writing books and articles, conferring with presidents and cabinet officials, taking his case to Congressional committees, scientific bodies and international forums. He won many converts, but ultimately failed to persuade the United States to integrate the device into its tactical nuclear arsenal.
The Reagan administration developed but never deployed the weapons in the 1980s. France, Israel and the Soviet Union were believed to have added versions of the bomb to their arsenals. Western military planners rejected their use in the Vietnam War and regarded them only as a possible deterrent to superior Soviet tank forces in Europe. But the end of the cold war obviated even that purpose.
A graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Cohen was recruited while in the Army in World War II for the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, N.M. After the war, he joined the RAND Corporation and in 1958 designed the neutron bomb as a way to strike a cluster of enemy forces while sparing infrastructure and distant civilian populations.
Fired via a missile or an artillery shell and detonated a quarter-mile above ground, his bomb limited death to an area less than a mile across, avoiding wider indiscriminate slaughter and destruction. It was not a radioactively ''clean'' bomb, but its neutrons dissipated quickly, leaving no long-term contamination that could render entire regions uninhabitable for decades.
But many military planners scoffed at the idea of a nuclear bomb that limited killing and destruction, and insisted that deployment would escalate the arms race and make nuclear war more likely. The device was anathema to military contractors and armed services with vested interests in nuclear arsenals. Even peace activists denounced it as ''a capitalist weapon'' because it killed people but spared the real estate.
Washington rejected the bomb repeatedly. The Kennedy administration said it might jeopardize a test-ban moratorium. The Johnson administration said its use in Vietnam might raise the specter of Hiroshima -- Asians again slaughtered by American nuclear bombs -- drawing worldwide condemnation. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter said development might impede disarmament prospects.
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ordered 700 neutron warheads built to oppose Soviet tank forces in Europe. He called it ''the first weapon that's come along in a long time that could easily and economically alter the balance of power.'' But deployment to the North Atlantic alliance was canceled after a storm of antinuclear protests across Europe. President George Bush ordered the stockpile scrapped.
By 1982, Mr. Cohen had abandoned his deployment quest. But he continued for the rest of his life to defend the bomb as practical and humane.
''It's the most sane and moral weapon ever devised,'' he said in September in a telephone interview for this obituary. ''It's the only nuclear weapon in history that makes sense in waging war. When the war is over, the world is still intact.''
Samuel Theodore Cohen was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 25, 1921, to Lazarus and Jenny Cohen, Austrian Jews who had migrated to the United States by way of Britain. His father was a carpenter and his mother a housewife who rigidly controlled family diets and even breathing habits (believing it unhealthy to breathe through the mouth). The boy had allergies, eye problems and other ailments, and for years was subjected to daily ice-water showers to toughen him up.
The family moved to Los Angeles when he was 4. He was a brilliant student at public schools and U.C.L.A., where he graduated in 1943 with a physics degree. He joined the wartime Army and was posted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for advanced training in mathematics and physics.
In 1944 he was tapped for the Manhattan Project to analyze radioactivity in nuclear fission. He worked on Fat Man, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945, days after Little Boy destroyed Hiroshima.
Mr. Cohen was married twice. His first marriage, to Barbara Bissell in 1948, ended in divorce in 1952. In 1960, he married Margaret Munnemann. She survives him, as do their three children, Carla Nagler, Paul and Thomas, and three grandchildren.
Mr. Cohen joined RAND in Santa Monica in 1947 and 11 years later designed the neutron bomb as a consultant to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Many technical features of what the Pentagon called an ''enhanced radiation weapon'' had been known for years, and scientists had theorized about a nuclear device that would release most of its energy as radiation.
All nuclear explosions produce a rain of potentially lethal neutrons, uncharged particles from an atom's nucleus, and Mr. Cohen, by adjusting components and reshaping the bomb shell, limited the blast and released more energy as neutrons -- so tiny they passed easily through solid inanimate objects, but killed all living things in their path.
The military successfully tested the bomb, and over the next two decades Mr. Cohen campaigned for its deployment without success. He left RAND in 1969, but continued writing about the bomb. His articles appeared in The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other publications. He was featured in a 1992 segment of the BBC-TV series ''Pandora's Box.''
His books included ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons: An Examination of the Issues'' (1978); ''The Neutron Bomb: Political, Technological and Military Issues'' (1978); ''Checkmate on War'' (1980); ''The Truth About the Neutron Bomb'' (1983); ''We Can Prevent World War III'' (1985); and ''Nuclear Weapons, Policies and the Test Ban Issue'' (1987). His memoir, ''Shame: Confessions of the Father of the Neutron Bomb,'' was published on the Internet in 2000.
In recent years, Mr. Cohen prominently warned of a black market substance called red mercury, supposedly capable of compressing fusion materials to detonate a nuclear device as small as a baseball -- ideal for terrorists.
Most scientists call the substance mythical, and stories about it, many circulating on the Internet, are widely regarded as spurious.

HEADLINE: The Crush Builds As SoHo Revives

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HEYMAN

 BODY:
ON Nov. 9, about 700 people, some who had arrived as early as 4:30 a.m., lined up outside the American Eagle Outfitters flagship store at 599 Broadway for its grand opening.
One week earlier, the police had to restrain crowds at Dash, a new clothing boutique by the Kardashian sisters at 119 Spring Street.
And just before that, a tornado of fast-fashion devotees stormed Uniqlo's store on Lower Broadway, where there were hourlong waits for Jil Sander's second +J collection. 
As anyone who has spent a recent weekend getting elbowed there knows, the shopping hordes have returned to SoHo.
Not a week goes by, it seems, without the arrival of a new flagship or buzz-generating boutique in this tourist-friendly district.
The last few months have seen more than 20 stores open --indie-cool boutiques like Wendy Nichol (147 Sullivan Street) and Realm (98 Greene Street), and global brands like Chanel (which renovated its boutique at 139 Spring Street), Moncler (90 Prince Street) and AllSaints Spitalfields (512 Broadway).
''There's a new energy in the neighborhood,'' said Julie Haus, a former magazine editor turned runway designer who opened her first boutique on 458 Broome Street in September. ''Things tend to be moving toward Canal. There are lots of other independent designers coming in. The spaces here lend themselves to the gallery-style look and feel, which we love.''
What a difference a year makes. In 2009, commercial real estate in SoHo was reeling, with one out of 10 shops in the retail-heavy stretch between West Broadway and Broadway vacant, according to real estate agents. Rental prices fell by as much as 30 percent from their pre-recession levels, according to Stephen Tarter of Tarter Stats O'Toole, a commercial real estate firm that specializes in SoHo and other neighborhoods downtown.
While rents were low, Mr. Tarter said, smart landlords resisted signing long-term leases, and instead invited in temporary tenants, which explains in part the recent vogue for pop-up shops.
The neighborhood has welcomed a revolving door of pop-ups since 2009, stores as varied as Gucci, Anna Sui for Target, Yohji Yamamoto, Under Armour, Piperlime, Zimmermann, Brides magazine and Blurb, a self-publishing upstart.
''I just got 10 calls this week for new pop-up shops,'' Mr. Tarter said. ''There's no space anywhere. I've never seen a turnaround this quick.''
As the retail outlook improved, SoHo once again became a prime location for brands seeking a prestigious address and a high concentration of affluent, fashion-savvy shoppers. ''With the designer tourist traffic, people are going to Isabel Marant and then they're coming to us,'' she said. ''And Phillip Lim is right next door.''
One of the flashiest new arrivals to SoHo is Technogym, an Italian fitness-equipment company that sells $10,000 treadmills and weight-trainers. The company toasted its sleek two-floor showroom at 70 Greene Street, complete with a vertical garden, with an opening party that was attended by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
ALSO last month, two iconic footwear companies unveiled new New York locations: Dr. Martens, the British brand, opened a 2,000-square-foot space at 148 Spring Street, and Converse opened a 7,000-square-foot branch at 560 Broadway, with a huge American flag made from red, white and blue sneakers.
Not everyone considers the increased retail offerings a boon. Long-suffering residents say that the crush of shoppers has worsened.
''It's hateful,'' said Sean Sweeney, director of the SoHo Alliance, a residents' advocacy group, who has lived in the neighborhood for 33 years. ''Who wants to live in a shopping mall? Who wants to burst through a phalanx of tourists who walk three or four abreast, as slowly as possible?''
Things may only get worse for Mr. Sweeney. Among the big-name fashion stores planning to open in SoHo next year are Diane Von Furstenberg (135 Wooster Street), Ralph Lauren (109 Prince Street), and Alexander Wang, who is opening his first boutique at 103 Grand Street, in a cast-iron storefront previously occupied by Yohji Yamamoto.
And then there are the mini-department stores. The outdoors chain Recreational Equipment Inc., better known as REI, plans a 39,000-square-foot space on three floors of the Puck Building at 295 Lafayette Street next fall.
And on West Broadway, Nordstrom will open an 11,000-square-foot concept store with an unusual conceit: all the profits will be donated to charity.

HEADLINE: Fresh Details on the Fed Rescue of A.I.G.'s Insurance Units

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The documents released by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday provide new details of how close to the precipice some insurance subsidiaries of the American International Group came in 2008.
They also show just how far Fed officials veered from their usual duties to keep those subsidiaries from toppling, delving into an industry not regulated at the federal level. The state regulators responsible for their oversight could not see the insurers' whole problem, which spread across a number of states. 
A.I.G. also faced a crisis in its financial products group through derivatives transactions with an array of banks and others worldwide, and the prospect of its failure posed a threat to the financial system.
The insurance business, however, is often overlooked in reports of the financial crisis. In fact, 11 of A.I.G.'s life insurance units were caught in a risky investment pool that broke down in September 2008, feeding the turmoil. About 40 percent of the money the Federal Reserve Bank of New York lent to A.I.G. was tied to those companies.
The life insurers had been letting hedge funds and other traders borrow securities from their investment portfolios. Because the insurers took collateral in return, the practice had been considered safe.
Instead of holding the collateral, though, A.I.G. chased higher yields by reinvesting it in mortgage-backed securities.
This web of lending and reinvestment was conducted entirely off the balance sheet, by insurers in half a dozen states. So state regulators were unaware of the program's total size or the degree of risk until too late.
The value of the mortgage-backed securities plunged in September 2008, leaving A.I.G. and its insurance units billions of dollars short of what they needed to settle with those who had borrowed their securities.
The Fed had to jump in, lending A.I.G. $20.5 billion in cash just to settle those securities-lending trades. As collateral, the new documents show, the Fed took about $24 billion of the insurance companies' assets.
This arrangement was highly unusual. Insurance assets are held to secure policyholders' claims and are not supposed to be encumbered or pledged. At one point, the A.I.G. Annuity Insurance Company, of Texas, had more than $10 billion of its assets under Fed control, the new records show. That subsidiary is now known as Western National.
The securities lending program was terminated in 2008. The insurers handed over the offending mortgage-backed securities to a special-purpose vehicle created by the Fed, and then they got their assets back.
Most of the mortgage-backed securities are now rated as junk, but the Fed says it is collecting income on them and expects to recover their full value.
Fed officials declined to comment on their foray into the insurance world. State insurance regulators said they did not believe any subsidiary was ever insolvent, though some came close. They have since tightened the rules on securities lending, requiring it to be shown on the insurer's balance sheet.

HEADLINE: The UnMuseum

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
EVEN if it were just another glimmering new Lower East Side tower full of multimillion-dollar condos, the sleek, eight-story glass tower at 257 Bowery would qualify as a statement building, with its room-size red elevator visible through the building's corrugated-glass facade and its sensuously undulating balustrade, perched high above the 29-foot-tall ground-floor exhibition space.
As an art gallery, the new, Norman Foster-designed home of Sperone Westwater seems an almost Trumpian expression of ambition, especially one that is opening at a time when the economy is not exactly humming along. 
But ambition is not what Angela Westwater, one of its owners, seems eager to talk about. Nor are the considerable social and artistic connections of a woman who has become, over the course of four decades, an art world eminence, representing artists like William Wegman, Tom Sachs, Susan Rothenberg and Richard Long.
What, you may ask, does Ms. Westwater, above, want to talk about? Electrical sockets.
''Everyone loves these plugs, these little plugs the size of a quarter,'' she said recently, pointing to stylized, round wall sockets near the sycamore desk in her fifth-floor office in the building, which opened in September.
Hmmm. For sockets, they do have a certain pizazz. But what about the larger significance of the building? She and her partner, Gian Enzo Sperone, left their old space on West 13th Street, hired a world-famous architect, and built a sleek temple for contemporary art on a block better known for restaurant supply stores: was it a statement of faith that the Lower East Side is about to become another art center, like West Chelsea?
Oh, that's a little lofty, she seems to suggest. Teetering across the polished concrete floors of the gallery's main viewing space in a vintage Chanel suit and Christian Louboutin heels, she steered the conversation to topics she clearly is more comfortable with.
Like how the building has great street access. And plenty of library space for old auction catalogs. And a lot of versatility for the artists who show there.
Yes. Yes. That all seems great, you want to say to Ms. Westwater. But isn't there something, well, exciting about building a gallery that is every bit as challenging to convention as the artworks within? Should it be judged like an architecturally ambitious museum?
''It's more about the future than the past,'' she said matter-of-factly. ''It's the burgeoning spirit that we're more interested in, rather than creating any kind of mausoleum. There are enough museums out there to do that.''
This reticence, this seeming aversion to self-promotion -- even in the context of an interview to promote her new gallery -- is perhaps why Ms. Westwater is not exactly a household name among noncollectors, with none of the celebrity enjoyed by, say, Larry Gagosian. But within the art world, she has been a quiet force since her run as the managing editor of Artforum in the 1970s. She opened her first gallery on Greene Street with Mr. Sperone in 1975, and now functions as the face of the New York gallery while Mr. Sperone oversees its European operations.
Along the way, Ms. Westwater -- a Columbus, Ohio, native with impeccable social graces and aristocratic bearing -- has become something of a Pamela Harriman of the New York art world, a highly connected hostess whose invitations are sought-after among artists like Julian Schnabel or the fashion designers Thakoon Panichgul and Francisco Costa. At a dinner at her apartment overlooking Central Park, Harold Koda of the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute, or Desiree Rogers or Agnes Gund might be mingling beneath originals by Andy Warhol and Hans Arp.
Indeed, her connections are a form of capital. Without them, she would have never ended up with an eight-story monolith on the Bowery, courtesy of the Pritzker-prize-winning British architect behind the transformation of the Reichstag in Berlin. (The gallery is Mr. Foster's second building in New York, after the 46-story Hearst Tower.)
Ms. Westwater and her husband, David Meitus, knew the Fosters through the Tate museum in London, where Mr. Meitus is a member of the International Council, formerly headed by Mr. Foster's wife, Elena Ochoa Foster. Ms. Westwater invited him to consider the project in 2007, when the gallery sought to expand from its old home and resettle on a narrow parcel of land a few doors from the New Museum of Contemporary Art.
She and Mr. Sperone met with Mr. Foster for an informal brainstorming session over pizza on a mountaintop in St. Moritz, where the architect has a home -- and cobbled together a vision of a unique high-rise gallery.
The resulting building opened in September, creating considerable buzz in the art world. Some critics praised the unusual gallery space as ''exhilarating,'' an ''elevation of the Bowery''; although its exposed I-beams in front and corrugated-metal exterior walls were also criticized as looking utilitarian.
Regardless, the gallery is the most visible evidence since the New Museum's opening that the Lower East Side is becoming an art destination, and it is something of a homecoming to Ms. Westwater, who traversed these streets nearly 40 years ago as a Smith College graduate when she accompanied John Coplans, the editor of Artforum, to see Roy Lichtenstein at his studio, or heard a Philip Glass recital in an unheated loft.
She seems content with whatever the future will bring. She recalled attending an art-world ceremony a decade ago with the composer Steve Reich and the artist Bruce Nauman (the hands above are from a video installation in his show, now at the gallery). A speaker at the ceremony recited a quote from Henry James: ''We work in the dark, we do what we can, we give what we have, our doubt is our passion, and passion is our task -- the rest is the madness of art.''
''Hmmm, Henry James, pretty good,'' she remembered thinking. ''That's become a kind of a mantra.''

HEADLINE: Potential Seen in Test For Trauma Of Brain

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
In a finding that could eventually lead to ways to identify and perhaps treat athletes who have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Boston-based researchers announced on Wednesday that a new imaging technique found chemical changes in the brains of living athletes with a history of head trauma. 
C.T.E., whose diagnosis in more than a dozen deceased N.F.L. players and one collegian has helped lift the dangers of sports concussions to national prominence, can be confirmed only through a specialized examination of brain tissue after death. As such, the question of whether a particular living athlete who is showing symptoms of the disease -- anger control, memory loss and more -- has C.T.E. has remained only gnawing speculation.
At the Radiological Society of North America's annual meeting in Chicago, Dr. Alexander Lin of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston described how magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans identified biomarkers in five athletes showing signs of C.T.E. The subjects were three retired N.F.L. players, one boxer and one wrestler; their scans were compared with those of nonathletes of the same age and relative lifestyle.
''We measured the brain chemistry of men with a broad history of brain trauma and found these changes that indicate something biochemically abnormal,'' Lin said. ''We don't know whether they have C.T.E. We don't know at this point if these living changes are related.''
One of the study's co-authors, Dr. Robert Stern of the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, expressed similar caution that these preliminary results not be over-interpreted, particularly given the public's growing understanding of C.T.E. and its effects.
It remains unknown whether brain trauma caused the chemical changes, Stern said, something that further studies could help determine. Stern said that potential treatments would be best pursued through the identification of living people with the disease.
''This is a first step in a long process,'' Stern said. ''This is an initial study with a very small sample that shows us that the technology may be of use in C.T.E. diagnosis. It does not, however, suggest that we are close to being able to use the technology in the near future.''
Any proven method to diagnose C.T.E. in a living person could have major economic effects on the N.F.L. Retired players with cognitive problems still cannot prove their condition was caused by football, which has limited their ability to obtain benefits either through the league's disability plan, state worker's compensation or lawsuits.
Given California's unique worker's compensation system, which allow players who played one game in the state to file claims years after their retirement, proof that cognitive decline was related to their N.F.L. career could lead to teams' owing millions of dollars for medical treatment (including institutional care) for each retiree.

HEADLINE: Conspicuously Sparse in Sundance Competition Lineup: Movie Stars

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The lineup of films competing in the 2011 Sundance Film Festival is heavy on off-the-wall stories, light on war documentaries and -- for better or worse -- nearly devoid of one of the festival's signature ingredients of late: stars.
As both a pre-eminent showcase for American independent cinema and a freewheeling bazaar for movie executives Sundance is carefully scrutinized for signals about where creative, low-budget movies are headed. If these filmmakers represent the future, what's on their minds?
Sundance programmers on Wednesday announced a schedule of 58 features and documentaries in competition, culled from 3,812 submissions, that answers that question with more clarity than usual. 
''We certainly do not intend to create themes,'' said John Cooper, the festival's director. ''But there does seem to be some similar things that are permeating the minds of artists today.''
Most noticeable among the competing films is a lack of movie stars, who have flocked to independent film over the last decade in search of meatier roles, a patina of hipness and Oscar statuettes. Last year's competition slate included the usual parade of fame in multiple pictures: Natalie Portman, James Franco, Michelle Williams, Orlando Bloom, James Gandolfini, Kristen Stewart. This year, only one entry, ''The Untitled Sam Levinson Project,'' has the slightest whiff of mainstream star power. Featuring Demi Moore and a clutch of indie favorites -- Ellen Burstyn, Ellen Barkin, Thomas Haden Church -- that film centers on a chaotic wedding in a highly dysfunctional family.
Where have all the stars gone? It could be a passing illusion. Sundance's slate of films out of competition, which will be announced on Thursday, will undoubtedly be stuffed with them. Maybe programmers just didn't think some star-driven pictures were up to snuff. Or, some industry veterans speculated, the shortage could mean that a segment of indie film, its financing hurt by the credit crisis and the recession, has grown too small to attract top-tier names.
''For whatever reason, there aren't as many big stars doing an independent turn as in past years, and that's perfectly fine with us,'' said Mr. Cooper, nodding to criticism in years past that Sundance was too hung up on marquee names.
The competition slate is also notable for an unusual diversity of stories, albeit many centered on teenagers. ''Another Earth'' is a science-fiction-tinged tale of a tragedy that alters the lives of two strangers on the eve of the discovery of a duplicate Earth. ''Benavides Born'' looks at a teenage girl who is a power lifter. ''Here'' stars the critical favorite Ben Foster (''Alpha Dog'') as a cartographer on assignment to create a satellite survey of Armenia.
''There has been a swing toward greater authenticity,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''Young filmmakers for a time were more consumed with trying to make something that would sell. Now there seems to be more of a feeling that they should just make the movie they want to make.''
One of the more intriguing entries is ''Higher Ground,'' directed by Vera Farmiga, who is known for her roles in ''Down to the Bone,'' ''The Departed'' and ''Up in the Air,'' from last year, for which she received an Academy Award nomination. Ms. Farmiga, a first-time director, also stars in ''Higher Ground,'' as a frustrated mother who turns to a fundamentalist group for answers (several Sundance selections look at religion and faith).
Like Ms. Farmiga and in keeping with Sundance custom, most of the feature directors in competition are behind the camera for the first time or have limited experience in shorts. One exception is Azazel Jacobs, whose ''Momma's Man'' had a celebrated turn at the festival in 2008. Mr. Jacobs returns with ''Terri,'' the story of an orphan whose unlikely friendship with a vice principal helps him overcome ruthless teasing.
The festival's documentary slate conspicuously lacks the searing military stories of previous years. There are no war-related entries in the United States documentary competition and only one in the World Cinema documentary race: the British production ''Hell and Back Again,'' an examination of the war in Afghanistan through the eyes of one Marine, who has a distressing return to the United States.
The selected documentaries tackle serious subjects -- environmental radicalism, assisted suicide -- but also show a lighthearted side. There are three entries with music themes, including a look at the 1990s hip-hop act A Tribe Called Quest called ''Beats, Rhymes and Life,'' directed by the actor Michael Rapaport (''Zebrahead,'' the television series ''The War at Home.'') ''Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey'' falls squarely in the heartwarming category.
Jennifer Seibel Newsom, the wife of Gavin Newsom, who soon leaves his job as mayor of San Francisco to become California's lieutenant governor, examines the mainstream media's portrayals of women in ''Miss Representation.'' (Another documentary with a Big Media focus is ''Page One: A Year Inside The New York Times,'' directed by Andrew Rossi.)
The festival is scheduled Jan. 20 to 30 in Park City, Utah. (A full list of films in competition can be found at nytimes.com/carpetbagger.) On Thursday Sundance will unveil its features out of competition.
Feature-length submissions from the United States totaled 1,943 -- a slight increase from last year -- while foreign feature-length submissions inched up to 1,869. There was a sharp increase in the number of submitted shorts, particularly from overseas, perhaps the result of the growing affordability and ubiquity of digital filmmaking equipment.
Over all, total submissions crossed the 10,000 mark for the first time; to compare, the festival received about 7,000 submissions in 2006, a year when independent film was considered to be in full bloom.
The physical strain of screening all of those submissions, festival staffers say, pales in comparison to the aggressive push by agents, investors and some directors to sway the selection process. ''To remain independent these days,'' Mr. Cooper said, ''takes relentless vigilance.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture credit on Thursday with an article about movies that will be in competition at the Sundance Film Festival in January misstated the surname of the photographer who took the picture of Vera Farmiga and Norbert Leo Butz in one of those movies, ''Higher Ground.'' She is Molly Hawkey, not Hawke.

HEADLINE: Wild Cards Are in Play For 2022 Cup

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
London
As things stand, the vote Thursday in Zurich to determine the host for the 2022 World Cup will offer a far more challenging and imaginative choice than deciding who gets the 2018 tournament.
FIFA can play it safe, and go back across old ground to the guaranteed full houses and gargantuan profits of the United States.
It can go East to revisit Japan or South Korea, with the latter still proposing, despite the recent military flare-up, to explore holding matches across the border in the North. 
Soccer's governing body can believe in a mirage made possible by new technology, a World Cup inside air-conditioned stadiums built to withstand the desert heat of Qatar, for which money is no object.
Or it can fulfill an old billionaire's dream Down Under, giving the enterprising, 80-year-old Frank Lowy what he and Australia seek: a soccer World Cup in a land that has successfully staged just about every other sporting event, from the Olympics to the rugby World Cup.
Five choices, five disparate circumstances, five demands on the capacity of FIFA's 22-man committee to make the right decision for an event scheduled for 12 years from now.
And FIFA, in its wisdom, has allotted just two hours on Thursday afternoon in which to decide, by secret ballot, the destination of the two World Cups. They will first select among four bids from Europe to host the 2018 tournament.
Then they will dust off the 2022 bids, with their complexities of race, religion, culture and climate. One vote depends to some extent on the other. If FIFA chooses to take a risk and pick Russia for 2018, that means three successive World Cups will have gone to nations whose infrastructure and other necessities needed to be built from the ground up.
South Africa last summer was a triumph of hope over inexperience. Brazil in 2014 is the world's foremost soccer nation in terms of playing talent, but it is a mighty gamble that an apparently burgeoning economy can meet deadlines on new stadiums, new airports, new everything.
Consider FIFA's own priorities. It operates on billion-dollar margins that would exceed the budget of many small nations. It demands of whichever host it opts for a complete waiving of entry visas; total exemption of taxation on its profits; and on brand exclusivity for the six companies that pay FIFA almost as much in sponsorship deals as it will receive in world television rights.
In short, as we witnessed in South Africa, there must be laws to prevent any rival companies to Adidas, the Emirates airline, Hyundai, Sony, Visa and Coca-Cola from exploiting FIFA space. Imagine what those stipulations will mean to Eric Holder, the United States attorney general, who flew to Zurich with the nation's presentation panel (former President Bill Clinton; the actor Morgan Freeman; Sunil Gulati, the head of the United States Soccer Federation; and Landon Donovan, the national team player) as it made its pitch to FIFA on Wednesday. His country may also face any number of security issues at entry points in 12 years.
But according to the way FIFA dealt with the Netherlands' objections to its demands, a bidder that seeks to maintain its own rule of law risks being marked down, or struck off the ballot.
The United States handled FIFA's tournament, and its restrictions, handsomely and profitably enough in 1994. Its bid now is to some degree based on the sure-footedness of that tournament, on the billions of dollars that can be taken for granted, and on the possibility that a second running of the World Cup would capitalize on the evident growth of soccer across the ethnically diverse United States.
Coca-Cola, you would imagine, might have quite a say in whether it is America's time again.
Or Visa might see more market growth in the new Tiger economies rising in the East.
Ostensibly, the sponsors have little or no input in how FIFA shapes its future, and the world game. But few of the 22 men who cast the vote can possibly know what it took for Lowy, an immigrant from Czechoslovakia, to master the language and build up his real estate and shopping mall empire that makes him the ultimate go-getter in Australian society.
Lowy's campaign survived accusations of attempted bribery for FIFA votes. But that, as we hear all too loudly, is not exactly unheard of in the FIFA family.
''The global power that flows from a simple round ball will, if we get the World Cup, deliver benefits for this generation and generations of Australians to come,'' Lowy said.
Building stadiums and transportation across Australia's vast distances would be one challenge. Converting Australians from Aussie rules to FIFA rules would be another.
At the opposite extreme, Qatar, a relatively tiny land, has the oil money to build all the stadiums FIFA requires in a space more compact than any before. Its soccer culture is undeveloped, but it hired Zinedine Zidane, one of the sport's greats, to spread the word that Arabia, and the Muslim people, deserve a shot at the world's most-watched sporting event.
Money, no problem. Vision within sight. Technology to cool every stadium, whatever the boiling temperatures outside. And inside FIFA's power structure, it has Mohamed Bin Hammam, the president of the Asian Football Confederation, an undoubted force on the executive committee and perhaps a potential FIFA president before 2022.
Also on that committee, also rich and politically engaged, is Chung Mong-joon. The South Korean, whose father fled communism in the North, has the fortune of a Hyundai corporation that was built from nothing, along with the determination to push for almost anything.
When the North fired on the South's island Yeonpyeong last month, there were some assumptions that this meant it was game over for the bold idea of uniting the Koreas through soccer's World Cup.
All of this has everything, and nothing, to do with choosing a World Cup venue. But FIFA loves a legacy, and now is not the time to rule anything out.
Albert Einstein once said that politics is far more complicated than physics. Einstein never, of course, encountered the politics of a double World Cup ballot in Zurich.

HEADLINE: As Final Debt Plan Is Released, Signs That the Fight Is Just Beginning

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Members of President Obama's debt-reduction commission indicated on Wednesday that they were split over their chairmen's far-reaching plan for long-term spending cuts and tax increases, a development that suggests the proposal is more likely to be a framework for next year's debates than the basis for legislation anytime soon.
As the chairmen released their final package of proposals for trimming nearly $4 trillion from projected deficits through 2020, the 18-member commission met publicly for the first time since the midterm elections gave Congressional Republicans more power, and more responsibility, for the nation's problems.
In advance of the commission's vote on Friday, the divisions over how to curb the nation's mounting debt -- and the political wariness about embracing changes to popular tax breaks and benefit programs, like those included in the package -- were in sharp focus even as two senior members of the Senate Budget Committee lent the plan a measure of bipartisan support. 
The senators -- Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican, and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, a Democrat -- joined in backing the plan, along with the two commission chairmen and three other members whom Mr. Obama named to the panel and are not elected officials. The commission includes 12 members of Congress and six private citizens, including the chairmen, former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, a Republican, and Erskine B. Bowles, a Democrat and former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton.
''While there are things in this plan I dislike intensely, and I do, there are also things in this plan that I think are grand-slam home runs for the American economy and for the future competitive position of our country,'' said Mr. Conrad, who will remain the Budget Committee's chairman in the next Congress. Among the measures he cited with approval was the proposed overhaul of the tax code to close tax breaks, lower rates and raise revenues.
Mr. Conrad, who will be up for re-election in 2012, also invoked the recent debt crises in Europe, saying, ''If we fail to act now, our country could find itself in a circumstance in which we have to take draconian action at the worst possible time, in the midst of a crisis.''
But with opposition from four House members on the panel -- three Republicans and one Democrat -- and with several other commission members indicating that they were leaning in that direction, the panel seems all but certain to fall short of Mr. Obama's 14-vote threshold for sending a package to Congress for a vote.
What is unclear is whether that outcome would consign the plan to a dusty shelf along with many past commissions' well-intended but politically unpalatable recommendations for addressing the nation's fiscal imbalances, or whether Mr. Obama or the Republicans in Congress will move aggressively to pursue at least some of its measures.
That was the idea among some advisers at the White House when Mr. Obama established the commission by executive order in February.
Two of the aides who have since left -- Rahm Emanuel, who was the chief of staff, and Peter R. Orszag, who was the White House budget director -- envisioned that the panel's recommendations on overhauling the tax code and Social Security, for example, could be adapted for the president's annual budget that is due early next year.
Some Democrats said the White House remained interested in that possibility, depending on the commission's final vote, especially now that Mr. Obama is weighing how to counter the antispending and tax-cutting agenda of the Republicans who will now control the House.
The solid bloc of opposition from the three House Republican leaders on the commission confirmed that they had been emboldened by the midterm results and would follow their own course, though they have not spelled out how they will cut spending on the scale they have promised.
Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who in January will become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes and entitlement programs, was not present for the meeting. He was negotiating with administration officials and other Congressional leaders to resolve the debate over the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, but he signaled his opposition to the panel's plan in a recent speech.
Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican who will be chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, a member of the House Republican leadership team, each said at the meeting that the package presented by Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson cuts domestic spending by too little, especially for Medicare and Medicaid; raises taxes too much; and does not repeal the health care law pushed by Mr. Obama and enacted this year.
In contrast, Senator Gregg, who is retiring at the end of the year, said Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson were right not to reopen the health care debate and to build upon the law's long-term cost-saving provisions instead -- as other deficit-reduction plans have recommended.
The health care law would save an estimated $1 trillion over the next two decades by squeezing payments to health care providers and increasing out-of-pockets costs for many beneficiaries. The chairmen's plan would go further, which caused some Democrats on the panel to object to it.
While the House Republicans complained about the proposed tax increases, they applauded the chairmen for producing revenues not by raising income-tax rates but by proposing to eliminate up to $1 trillion a year in tax breaks for individuals and corporations. The chairmen's plan would use the revenues from reducing or closing tax breaks, including the mortgage-interest deduction, to lower income-tax rates for everyone. A smaller amount would go to deficit reduction.
Considering the low expectations that have attended the commission from the start, the endorsements of several members and tentatively supportive words from others plainly buoyed the two chairmen. Depending on how the wavering lawmakers vote, the plan could get a bipartisan majority -- if not a 14-vote supermajority -- that could enhance its standing as a model for legislation.
The plan would also cap annual spending for domestic and for military programs, and would make Social Security solvent for most of this century by raising payroll taxes for wealthier taxpayers and slowly increasing the qualifying age for full benefits to 69 from 67 by 2075.
Mr. Conrad cited the solvency of Social Security as ''one of the most important things'' the plan would do. And Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who remains undecided, acknowledged that he was breaking with other liberal Democrats to endorse the higher retirement age. ''To raise it two years over 65 years is not radical,'' he said, especially considering that the plan would have a hardship exemption for physical laborers.
Mr. Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, and Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, who lost his race for re-election last month but for now is still the chairman of the House Budget Committee, are considered potential votes in favor of the plan. And two Senate Republicans, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, indicated they were considering joining Mr. Gregg in support.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cup Bid Emphasizes Diversity

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton and the actor Morgan Freeman joined the star soccer player Landon Donovan on Wednesday to try to convince FIFA officials that the United States deserves to host the 2022 World Cup.
President Obama made a video appearance at the American bid presentation, which was broadcast live from Zurich before Thursday's vote.
The presentation focused on the diversity of the United States, its passion for soccer, its preparedness for the World Cup and the country's ability to assist FIFA in its social mission to use soccer as a unifying global force. 
Freeman, who played Nelson Mandela in the recent rugby film ''Invictus,'' conjured Mandela's words that sport ''has the power to change the world'' and added that the United States was ''the most diverse nation on earth.''
Clinton picked up on that theme, saying that the proposed American host cities all have residents from 100 to 150 nations.
''Maybe America's best claim to this World Cup is that we have the only nation that can guarantee, no matter who makes the finals, we can fill the stadium with home-nation rooters,'' Clinton, the honorary chairman of the United States bid committee, told FIFA officials.
The United States, which hosted the 1994 World Cup, is bidding for the 2022 tournament against Australia, Japan, Qatar and South Korea. The bidding process has been marred by charges of corruption against 6 of the 24 members of FIFA's executive committee, which will vote to award both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups on Thursday. Two members have been barred from the voting, and some critics have called for the vote to be postponed, saying the process lacks credibility. FIFA has said it will hold the vote as scheduled.
Perhaps Clinton's most persuasive points during the half-hour American presentation came when he said that the United States could best help FIFA to use soccer in such global initiatives as H.I.V. awareness and the tempering of political differences.
''The unifying power of this game to address the major challenges of the 21st-century world, with all of its interdependence, to reduce its inequalities and instabilities, to transform it into a place of shared responsibilities and shared opportunities is enormous,'' Clinton said. He added, ''I believe the United States is perhaps in the best position to support you in fulfilling that mission.''
Obama held a soccer ball as he spoke from Washington. His presence was orchestrated, in part, to convince FIFA that the federal government was fully behind the American bid. The president said that it would be ''an incredible honor'' for the United States to host the World Cup again and that the country would be ''an excellent host.''
He noted that 3.6 million spectators attended the 1994 World Cup, the largest attendance in the tournament's history.
''Every four years we stand transfixed as some of the world's most talented athletes compete in the beautiful game,'' Obama said.
Donovan said that more than 100 million Americans had watched some part of the 2010 World Cup from South Africa, and he noted that Major League Soccer had just completed its 15th season as a professional league.
To show just how consumed Americans were by the 2010 World Cup, the bid presentation showed viewers reacting ecstatically in cities around the country as Donovan scored his last-minute goal to defeat Algeria and advance the Americans into the second round.
''The World Cup captivated our country,'' Donovan said. ''We set new records for TV and online viewing, and we truly inspired and unified a nation.''
A video presentation noted that M.L.S. had broken the four million mark in attendance; that the Seattle Sounders averaged 36,000 fans a game; that huge stadiums are regularly filled for 150 international friendly matches played in the United States each year; and that two television channels in the United States exist primarily to broadcast soccer.
Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, spoke of the inviting legacy the 2022 World Cup would bring. The American viewing audience could double to 200 million for that tournament, he said.
Some $1 billion has been spent to build nine soccer-specific stadiums for M.L.S. teams, he said, and every league team will most likely have its own stadium in the coming years. These would serve as state-of-the art training sites for the 2022 tournament.
Eighteen candidate host cities have stadiums that are already built and average 76,000 seats, Gulati said. The economic legacy for 2022 would be record attendance (projected at five million) and record profits for FIFA, which earned about $3.4 billion for the 2010 World Cup, Gulati said.
Television rights fees in the United States virtually double with each World Cup, Gulati said, suggesting that the current figure of about $212 million for the 2014 World Cup could perhaps reach $1 billion in 2022 -- an amount similar to what NBC paid for the rights to broadcast the 2012 London Olympics.
The $200 million currently spent per year on soccer sponsorships in the United States could escalate to more than $1 billion annually if the United States hosts the 2022 World Cup, Gulati said.
''Combined with growing broadcast fees, this provides extraordinary financial resources for the U.S. and for FIFA to grow the game not only in the United States, but throughout the world,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shares Soar on Signs of Global Growth

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and DAVID JOLLY; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks surged on Wednesday as investors temporarily put aside worries over Europe's debt crisis and focused on signs of global economic growth, particularly in the United States and Asia.
Hope that the United States job market may be coming back to life gave a powerful push to prices on Wall Street. The monthly report from ADP Employer Services, the payroll processing firm, said that private employers added 93,000 jobs in November, more than expected.
''It would be jobs data that was the primary stimulus, and also some comfort coming out of the European situation,'' said Dan McMahon, director of equity trading at Raymond James & Associates. 
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 249.76 points, or 2.3 percent, higher at 11,255.78. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 25.52 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,206.07, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite added 51.20 points, or 2 percent, to close at 2,549.43.
The 2.2 percent rise in the S.& .P 500 was the biggest gain in the index since Sept. 1.
Weeks of worry that debt troubles in Europe could spread beyond Ireland appeared to settle somewhat. The Portuguese government successfully sold debt, albeit at higher interest rates, and there was speculation that the European Central Bank would step up to confront the turmoil in the euro zone.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, hinted on Tuesday that the bank could adopt more aggressive bond-buying measures if needed, saying that investors might not fully appreciate the European Union's resolve. ''Pundits are tending to underestimate the determination of governments,'' Reuters quoted Mr. Trichet as saying.
The Portuguese debt management agency sold 500 million euros, or $654 million, of 12-month Treasury bills on Wednesday at an average yield of 5.281 percent -- up from 4.81 percent for a similar auction in November. Although investors were asking for a higher return to take on a greater perceived risk, demand for the securities was a healthy 2.5 times the amount offered.
Scott Marcouiller, the chief technical market strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, said that investors were probably learning to live with the uncertainty over Europe's financial troubles.
''People are buying the dips,'' he said. ''People are looking past the negative news and willing to buy short term.''
The International Monetary Fund and the European Union agreed on Sunday to rescue Ireland with a $111 billion program, after a similar bailout of Greece last spring, though neither action has done much to alleviate fears that the contagion will spread.
The global stock rally on Wednesday got its start in Asia as an upbeat manufacturing report in China eased concerns that the Chinese economy could slow as it wrestled with inflation and soaring housing prices.
In Beijing, the state-affiliated China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reported that its purchasing managers index rose to 55.2 last month, from 54.7 in October. A similar manufacturing survey by HSBC rose to an eight-month high.
''When days like this come along it becomes a buying opportunity for commodities,'' said Paul Christopher, senior international investment strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors.
As a result, the energy, industrials and materials sectors were the biggest gainers on the broader market.
Indeed, recent data have suggested that manufacturing and economic activity is increasing. That, in turn, has set off a broad-based rise in the price of commodities, Mr. Christopher said.
In the United States, the Labor Department revised higher the annual rate of worker productivity in the third quarter to 2.3 percent on Wednesday.
The data was the latest in a series of encouraging economic reports, including better retail sales and an upward revision to the pace of the nation's economic output in the third quarter, to an annualized 2.5 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, Mr. Marcouiller said.
As a result, he said, stocks in economically sensitive sectors like industrials and materials would probably show improvement, while the dollar was likely to decline as the Federal Reserve pursued its quantitative easing program of purchasing government securities.
All of the Dow components rose on Wednesday, while 483 stocks on the S.& P. 500 finished higher.
Energy stocks were up nearly 3 percent, while materials and industrial stocks rose more than 2 percent. Schlumberger rose 4.54 percent, to $80.85, and Anadarko Petroleum was up 4.86 percent, to $67.28. General Electric was up 2.97 percent, to $16.30. Alcoa was up 3.39 percent, to $13.57.
Bank of America rose 3.20 percent, to $11.29, retracing ground after it had fallen 3.18 percent on Tuesday on worries that it might be the target of a forthcoming WikiLeaks document release.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell more than a full point as its yield rose to 2.96 percent, from 2.80 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Advances on the AIDS Front

 BODY:
Promising scientific developments to prevent AIDS, not just treat its victims, have sparked hope among health officials, researchers and advocacy groups struggling to control the epidemic. Unfortunately, the global recession and soaring deficits in advanced nations have made it unlikely that sufficient money will be available to fully seize the new opportunities. Some agonizing choices will have to be made. 
The most encouraging breakthrough was proof last week that a pill containing two standard drugs used to treat AIDS could prevent the disease if given to gay men not infected with H.I.V. In a trial conducted in the United States and five other countries, healthy gay men who took the pill daily were 44 percent less likely to get infected than those given a placebo. Even better, those who adhered most closely to the daily regimen achieved a 73 percent reduction in the risk of contracting H.I.V.
These results come a few months after a separate study found that a vaginal gel could cut a woman's risk of infection with H.I.V. by 39 percent over all and by 54 percent among those who used it most regularly.
Two other developments last week also buoyed hopes for faster progress. Pope Benedict XVI expressed the view that condoms could be used to prevent disease transmission. That could make it easier for ecclesiastical workers and AIDS prevention programs to promote their use.
Meanwhile, the United Nations AIDS program announced that at least 56 countries have managed to stabilize or slow down the rate of H.I.V. infections. Fewer people are becoming infected with H.I.V. and fewer people are dying of AIDS than at the peak of the epidemic.
The problem is that people are still becoming infected twice as fast as they can be put into treatment programs. Five years ago, fewer than 500,000 people were receiving AIDS drugs; now five million are. But another 10 million should be receiving treatment and aren't getting it because donor nations and the afflicted countries feel too strapped to pay the bill. Now that the same drugs used for treatment look like a valuable tool to prevent infections, the financial shortfall will only grow worse.
Further studies are under way to confirm that the pill and gel work as well as initial studies suggest, to evaluate long-term safety, and to assess what groups might benefit most. The next big challenge will be to determine how best to allocate scarce resources between these promising prevention tools and life-saving treatments for people already infected.

HEADLINE: Obama Seeking Aid for Jobless In Any Tax Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is holding out for an extension of unemployment assistance and of a variety of expiring tax breaks for low-wage and middle-income workers as part of a deal with Congressional Republicans to extend all the Bush-era tax cuts.
But it is unclear how much leverage the White House has in the tax negotiations, given the drubbing Democrats took in the midterm elections, the tight Congressional calendar and a threat by Senate Republicans to block any legislation until the tax fight is resolved.
In a symbolic nod to President Obama's pledge to let the tax cuts on upper-income brackets expire on Dec. 31, as scheduled by law, the House on Thursday approved a bill to continue the lower tax rates enacted during the Bush administration for Americans they described as ''middle class.'' The vote was 234 to 188, with three Republicans joining 231 Democrats in favor; 20 Democrats and 168 Republicans were opposed.
The bill, however, has no chance of passage in the Senate, where even some Democrats say the tax cuts should be extended for everyone, at least temporarily, given the continued weakness in the economy. 
Senate Democratic leaders scheduled their own symbolic votes for Saturday, intending to demonstrate their desire to end the tax cuts for the rich.
Republicans, meanwhile, expressed dismay at the posturing by Democrats, which they said was delaying the inevitable and even getting in the way of a potential deal on aid for millions of unemployed Americans whose benefits have started to run out.
Administration officials said no deal was at hand, and negotiators from the administration and the two parties in Congress met only briefly on Thursday. It is possible that the parties will be unable to reach a compromise, in which case tax rates will revert at the end of this year to their pre-2001 levels, meaning an across the board tax increase. However, the Treasury could be directed to keep the current rates while negotiations continue.
But the sense within both parties was that Democrats were essentially negotiating the terms of their major retreat on an issue that they once considered a slam-dunk on both substantive and political levels.
Senior Senate Republican aides said that an extension of all the income tax cuts was a foregone conclusion, but that a deal on jobless aid was possible if Democrats agreed to cover the cost. Democrats expressed indignation that Republicans were insisting on finding spending cuts to offset the unemployment benefits while being perfectly willing to add to the national debt the $700 billion cost of continuing the tax cuts on the highest incomes for the next decade.
''This is so grossly unfair,'' the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said in a floor speech urging passage of the so-called middle-class tax package.
While the House bill has no chance of becoming law, it holds enormous symbolism for Democrats, who used the debate to accuse Republicans of standing for the rich. In an indication of the tensions between the parties on the issue, the House Republican leader and soon-to-be speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, derided the Democratic maneuver to force a vote on the bill as ''chicken crap.''
Even as lawmakers were debating the bill on the House floor, negotiators, including the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, were meeting in talks that all sides expected to end in a temporary extension of the tax rates for all income levels, perhaps for two or three years.
At the White House, administration officials outlined a list of their demands for an extension of expiring tax breaks, including the $800-per-couple ''Making Work Pay'' tax credit for about 110 million households, a tuition tax credit for 8 million college students, and the earned-income tax credit and child tax credit for 15 million low-income families. They also listed expiring tax breaks for small businesses. They said those tax credits would have a greater impact on the economy than continuing the Bush tax cuts on upper income levels.
And with federal unemployment aid having expired on Tuesday for two million Americans, Mr. Obama is seeking a one-year extension. Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an effort by Democrats to take up a bill extending the benefits.
More Americans have been out of work beyond the 26-week period typically covered by state unemployment assistance than at any time in the decades since the government began keeping records. The unemployment assistance at issue is federal emergency aid for people who are unemployed beyond six months.
About 6.2 million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or more, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mr. Obama's Council on Economic Advisers reported on Thursday that nearly seven million Americans could lose benefits through next November as more people remained out of work for long periods.
Talks at the Capitol involving senior lawmakers from both parties, Mr. Geithner and the White House budget director, Jacob Lew, are expected to continue into next week.
But in the meantime, the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he would bring the House bill to the Senate floor on Saturday and would hold votes on that measure, as well as on an alternative Democratic proposal to raise the threshold at which the lower rates expire to $1 million.
Democrats had hoped to hold those votes on Friday, as well as votes on two Republican proposals for extending the tax breaks, but late Thursday a single Republican senator registered an objection stopping those votes.
That prompted Mr. Reid to note that even after agreeing to take up the tax issue before anything else, he was encountering Republican obstruction.
''I think everybody remembers that famous letter that was written to me saying until we get tax cuts resolved, funding the government, we're not going to let you do anything legislatively,'' he said at a news conference late Thursday. ''We're at a new one tonight. They are not going to let us do anything with tax cuts or funding the government.''
The Republican alternatives include one from the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that would indefinitely extend all of the Bush-era income tax cuts. None of the measures is expected to win the 60 votes needed to advance.
Congressional Democrats expressed deepening frustration with the White House, which they said had made numerous missteps that gave Republicans the upper hand. Some Democratic aides said that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had been asked to attend a caucus meeting to defend the White House negotiating stance. A spokesman said Mr. Biden had a previous commitment.
Congressional Democrats also voiced worries that the administration was ready to give in quickly to Republican demands, in a bid to preserve time on the Senate calendar for ratification of an arms control treaty with Russia known as New Start.
Separately, the Senate approved a 15-day extension of the temporary spending measure that has financed the federal government since Oct. 1 and was set to run out on Friday.

HEADLINE: Europe Bank Extends Emergency Support

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Matthew Saltmarsh reported from Paris. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank on Thursday continued its emergency support to weak countries within Europe but stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis that has already engulfed Greece and Ireland.
Just months after the central bank indicated that it would wind down its extraordinary loan program to banks, its officials conceded that the program was still needed. Traders said the central bank was also buying Irish and Portuguese debt on open markets on Thursday, continuing a program begun this year and pushing up bond prices and lowering the cost of borrowing for these countries.
Grappling with sharply divergent economic performance by euro area members, the central bank disappointed investors who had looked for more than just a continuation of existing programs and had awaited a signal of a bold expansion of monetary support.
Investors have criticized European governments for a lack of decisiveness during the crisis and had hoped the central bank might step in to fill the void, specifically by broadening its purchase of government bonds through quantitative easing, as the Federal Reserve has done to put cash into the United States economy. 
The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said an ''overwhelming majority'' of the bank's governing council had agreed to continue the debt purchases begun in May -- an admission that the decision was not unanimous. Instead of promising stronger measures, he emphasized that the central bank's action was ''not quantitative easing.''
Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote, ''We are disappointed.''
He added, ''We see no reason to think any risks -- perceived or imagined -- arising from the twin crises of Euroland's sovereign debt and banking sector are reduced by today's E.C.B. council meeting.''
Mr. Trichet must balance a number of opposing forces. Growth in Germany has been better than expected but contrasts ever more sharply with the results in weaker countries. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, expanded 0.7 percent in the third quarter, the European statistics agency Eurostat said Thursday. That compared with 0.4 percent growth for the entire euro zone, and a 1.1 percent decline in Greece.
Inflation remains subdued, but the central bank could face a quandary if prices start to rise in faster-growing parts of the euro area. Sworn to keep prices in check, the central bank might have to raise interest rates even while weaker countries still struggle to grow.
The bank's governing council left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 percent on Thursday, as expected. The bank has stood pat on interest rates since May 2009. Most analysts do not expect an increase until well into 2011.
Asked Thursday at a news conference if diverging growth rates made it more difficult for the bank to develop a monetary policy that is right for all 16 euro area members, Mr. Trichet argued that growth in the strong countries would help the weak members.
''Those parts of the euro area economy that have real gains in competitiveness through hard work can now be a source of growth for the benefit of the euro area as a whole,'' he said. The central bank on Thursday revised its forecast for the entire area slightly higher.
Mr. Trichet also faces a divide among bank policy makers much like the one among European governments.
Axel A. Weber, the president of the Bundesbank and a member of the governing council, has criticized the central bank's bond purchases, and he said that investors should share the burden of future debt and bank crises -- a position shared by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany but not Mr. Trichet.
On Thursday, Mr. Trichet seemed to reject the role that others often want to thrust on him as the euro's last line of defense.
Speaking in New Delhi, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, suggested that central banks could do more to support growth.
''Growth is the most important thing,'' he said, according to Reuters. ''But because of a very high level of public debt, the burden falls on monetary policy.''
Mr. Trichet, however, put the onus on governments rather than the central bank to respond more firmly.
''We need an improvement in the 'E' letter of E.M.U.,'' he said, referring to European Monetary Union. He added, though, that ''observers should never underestimate'' European leaders. ''When times are very demanding, the Europeans are making decisions,'' Mr. Trichet said.
In Brussels, suggestions that the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was pushing for an emergency weekend summit meeting were played down. Diplomats said a meeting would be useful only if far-reaching plans were under way.
Financial markets reacted positively on Thursday, apparently cheered by the extended support for banks and reports that the central bank was buying bonds of weak countries.
''As Trichet was speaking, the E.C.B. moved in aggressively, buying Portuguese and Irish bonds,'' said Charles Diebel, chief strategist at Lloyds TSB Bank in London. ''The E.C.B. is saying, 'We're doing as much as we can within our remit. Now it's over to the governments.' '' But Mr. Diebel added: ''This doesn't sort out the real, underlying problems in the euro zone.''
Prices on Italian, Portuguese, Belgian, Irish and Spanish 10-year bonds rose sharply, while the safer German 10-year benchmark issue slipped a touch. Earlier, an auction of Spanish government debt met with firm demand, which also helped improve sentiment.
The euro rose to $1.3210 in New York from $1.3139 on Wednesday.
European stocks rose after the central bank meeting, having slipped earlier in the day. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 2.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London was up by the same amount.
In Madrid, the Spanish government sold 2.5 billion euros, or $3.3 billion, of three-year bonds at an average yield, or effective interest rate, of 3.7 percent. Though the yield was well above the 2.5 percent the state paid at a similar auction in October, the offering was oversubscribed, showing solid demand. A higher yield suggests that investors were demanding a premium to compensate for a higher perceived risk.
''Trichet tried to calm markets without giving them everything they wanted,'' said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING in Brussels. ''After today's E.C.B. meeting, turbulence on bond markets is not likely to calm down quickly.''
As of Monday, the European Central Bank had spent 69 billion euros buying government bonds on open markets, a fraction of the Fed's bond purchases. Unlike the Fed, the central bank ''sterilizes'' the purchases by taking in the same amount in bank deposits, avoiding perceptions it is printing money and fueling inflation. Mr. Trichet said Thursday that the central bank would continue doing so.
The bank has been trying to reduce the extraordinary support it began extending to the banking system at the height of the financial crisis. But it is clear that institutions in Ireland and some other countries would not be able to function without the unlimited loans that the central bank has been providing.
The bank said Thursday that it decided to continue providing unlimited three-month loans to banks at least through mid-April. Previously, it had committed to providing the low-cost liquidity only until mid-January, making loans to banks at 1 percent interest, provided the institutions could offer collateral.
The bank began buying bonds in May to halt a run on Greek debt. Purchases dwindled after July, but they have increased recently. The bank bought debt worth 1.35 billion euros last week, a level that was still much lower than in May and June, when it spent 59 billion euros buying debt on secondary markets.
The central bank does not disclose what European government bonds it has bought. It reports only once a week, on Monday, on the size of the purchases.

HEADLINE: A Tax Reform Vision

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
I have a vision.
Sometime over the next couple of weeks, President Obama issues a statement that reads: ''Over the past several months, Republicans and Democrats have been fighting over what to do with the Bush tax cuts. I have my own views, but it's not worth having a big fight over a tax code we all hate. Therefore, I'm suspending this debate. We will extend the Bush rates for everybody for one year, along with unemployment benefits. But during that year we will enact a comprehensive tax reform plan.
''The plan we will work on this year will look a bit like the 1986 reform plan. We will clean out the loopholes. We will take on the special interests. We will lower rates and make the tax code fair.'' 
Then Obama asks his aides to come up with a tax reform proposal he can lay before Congress. The State of the Union, he knows, is the one big chance he will have to redefine himself before the American people. On the big night, Obama stands before Congress. He gestures over to a giant stack of papers. ''This is our tax code,'' he tells the American people. ''It's rotten and we're scrapping it.''
Then the president outlines his own proposal. It looks a bit like the plan hatched by Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and Judd Gregg, the outgoing Republican senator from New Hampshire.
The Wyden-Gregg plan simplifies the tax code and reduces the number of rates from six to three. Most taxpayers would be able to use a one-page 1040 I.R.S. form. It preserves some deductions, like the mortgage interest deduction and the child tax credit, but eliminates many others. The Heritage Foundation calculated that the measure would reduce the federal deficit by $61 billion a year and create 2.3 million jobs. The Tax Policy Center found it would make the tax code more progressive and reduce the tax bill for most families making less than $200,000.
In my vision, the president would lay something like this at the feet of the Republicans and ask: Are you ready to have a conversation, or are you the party that can't say yes?
This would put the Republicans in an interesting position. On Thursday, I debated Paul Ryan at the American Enterprise Institute on the proper role of government. Ryan is the incoming House Budget Committee chairman and one of the most intellectually formidable members of Congress. I really admire many of the plans he has put forward to bring down debt and reduce health care costs.
But Ryan and I differed over President Obama and the prospects for compromise in the near term. Ryan believes that the country faces a clearly demarcated choice. The Democratic Party, he argues, believes in creating a European-style cradle-to-grave social welfare state, while the Republicans believe in a free-market opportunity society. There is no overlap between the two visions and very little reason to think they can be reconciled.
I argued that Obama and his aides are liberal or center-left pragmatists and that nothing they have said or written suggests they want to turn the U.S. into Sweden. I continued that Ryan's sharply polarized vision is not only journalistically inaccurate, it makes compromise and politics impossible. If every concession is regarded as an unprincipled surrender that takes us inexorably farther down the road to serfdom, then nothing will get done and the nation will go bankrupt.
If Obama moved vigorously on this sort of tax reform, starting at the State of the Union, he would vindicate my description of him, which would be nice. He would also change the tone in Washington. The health care reform debate was polarized, but the tax reform debate is not. Almost everybody agrees on the basic outlines. The current system is so rotten everybody could get something they want out of reforming it.
The tax reform process would reintroduce the parties to each other, and reduce the Manichean caricatures that have built up in their heads. It would also shift attention from the same-old big government-versus-small government debate toward more concrete challenges: shifting resources from unproductive consumption to more productive investment; shifting money from the affluent elderly to the struggling young; eliminating the parts of the tax code that erode personal responsibility and buffing up the parts that encourage responsible risk-taking.
This tax reform debate would then lead naturally into the larger debate about federal spending and debt. If you looked at the various commission reports that have been released recently, you would find that here, too, there is more overlap than one would have imagined.
Some days, gridlock seems permanent and fatal. But it could be that we're on the cusp of a period of surprising instability, if only President Obama would grab tax reform and use it to smash the crust of the status quo.

HEADLINE: Freezing Out Hope

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
After the Democratic ''shellacking'' in the midterm elections, everyone wondered how President Obama would respond. Would he show what he was made of? Would he stand firm for the values he believes in, even in the face of political adversity?
On Monday, we got the answer: he announced a pay freeze for federal workers. This was an announcement that had it all. It was transparently cynical; it was trivial in scale, but misguided in direction; and by making the announcement, Mr. Obama effectively conceded the policy argument to the very people who are seeking -- successfully, it seems -- to destroy him. 
So I guess we are, in fact, seeing what Mr. Obama is made of.
About that pay freeze: the president likes to talk about ''teachable moments.'' Well, in this case he seems eager to teach Americans something false.
The truth is that America's long-run deficit problem has nothing at all to do with overpaid federal workers. For one thing, those workers aren't overpaid. Federal salaries are, on average, somewhat less than those of private-sector workers with equivalent qualifications. And, anyway, employee pay is only a small fraction of federal expenses; even cutting the payroll in half would reduce total spending less than 3 percent.
So freezing federal pay is cynical deficit-reduction theater. It's a (literally) cheap trick that only sounds impressive to people who don't know anything about budget realities. The actual savings, about $5 billion over two years, are chump change given the scale of the deficit.
Anyway, slashing federal spending at a time when the economy is depressed is exactly the wrong thing to do. Just ask Federal Reserve officials, who have lately been more or less pleading for some help in their efforts to promote faster job growth.
Meanwhile, there's a real deficit issue on the table: whether tax cuts for the wealthy will, as Republicans demand, be extended. Just as a reminder, over the next 75 years the cost of making those tax cuts permanent would be roughly equal to the entire expected financial shortfall of Social Security. Mr. Obama's pay ploy might, just might, have been justified if he had used the announcement of a freeze as an occasion to take a strong stand against Republican demands -- to declare that at a time when deficits are an important issue, tax breaks for the wealthiest aren't acceptable.
But he didn't. Instead, he apparently intended the pay freeze announcement as a peace gesture to Republicans the day before a bipartisan summit. At that meeting, Mr. Obama, who has faced two years of complete scorched-earth opposition, declared that he had failed to reach out sufficiently to his implacable enemies. He did not, as far as anyone knows, wear a sign on his back saying ''Kick me,'' although he might as well have.
There were no comparable gestures from the other side. Instead, Senate Republicans declared that none of the rest of the legislation on the table -- legislation that includes such things as a strategic arms treaty that's vital to national security -- would be acted on until the tax-cut issue was resolved, presumably on their terms.
It's hard to escape the impression that Republicans have taken Mr. Obama's measure -- that they're calling his bluff in the belief that he can be counted on to fold. And it's also hard to escape the impression that they're right.
The real question is what Mr. Obama and his inner circle are thinking. Do they really believe, after all this time, that gestures of appeasement to the G.O.P. will elicit a good-faith response?
What's even more puzzling is the apparent indifference of the Obama team to the effect of such gestures on their supporters. One would have expected a candidate who rode the enthusiasm of activists to an upset victory in the Democratic primary to realize that this enthusiasm was an important asset. Instead, however, Mr. Obama almost seems as if he's trying, systematically, to disappoint his once-fervent supporters, to convince the people who put him where he is that they made an embarrassing mistake.
Whatever is going on inside the White House, from the outside it looks like moral collapse -- a complete failure of purpose and loss of direction.
So what are Democrats to do? The answer, increasingly, seems to be that they'll have to strike out on their own. In particular, Democrats in Congress still have the ability to put their opponents on the spot -- as they did on Thursday when they forced a vote on extending middle-class tax cuts, putting Republicans in the awkward position of voting against the middle class to safeguard tax cuts for the rich.
It would be much easier, of course, for Democrats to draw a line if Mr. Obama would do his part. But all indications are that the party will have to look elsewhere for the leadership it needs.

HEADLINE: Cross Section of Rich Invested With the Fed

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and BEN PROTESS; Sewell Chan reported from Washington and Ben Protess from New York. Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One investor, Kenneth H. Dahlberg, is a World War II flying ace who, as a volunteer in President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign, was a minor figure in the Watergate scandal.
Another investor, Magalen O. Bryant, runs a horse farm in Virginia and is active in steeplechase racing circles. A third, Ward W. Woods, is the chairman of the nonprofit organization that runs the Bronx Zoo.
They were among scores of wealthy but lesser-known investors in an emergency lending program the Federal Reserve announced in November 2008, three weeks after President Obama's election, to support the market for student, auto, credit card and small-business loans.
The investors, whose identities were disclosed as part of a trove of 21,000 records released on Wednesday at the direction of Congress, are a cross-section of America's wealthy -- investors who, in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, heard about an opportunity and weighed the risk. 
The list, not surprisingly, includes famous Wall Street financiers like J. Christopher Flowers, John A. Paulson and Julian Robertson, demonstrating the extent to which the Fed relied on fast-moving hedge funds to keep credit flowing through the markets.
There were also institutional investors like the Ford Foundation and the pension plan for Major League Baseball. And there were wealthy businessmen like the computer executive Michael S. Dell and the home builder Bruce E. Toll.
Investors like Mr. Dell are identified in the Fed's data because they owned or were part of a group that owned a ''material'' stake in a company or a fund that received funding from the Fed. They may not have been involved in the decision to borrow from the Fed. Through the program, known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, the investors helped keep markets for consumer loans from seizing up by steadily buying securities. About $71 billion was lent by the Fed out of the $200 billion available. The program, which began in March 2009, ended June 30, 2010; two-thirds of the loans have been repaid early. The remaining ones come due as late as 2015. The Fed has said it does not expect to lose any money in the program.
The investors put up their own money in return for Fed financing that was then plowed into the markets for securitized loans -- bundles of credit card or auto dealership debt and student loans. The investors shouldered the risk that the loan packages could lose value and be worth less than the amount they had borrowed from the Fed.
Ordinarily, bundles of loans of this type are not difficult to sell, but after Lehman went bankrupt in September 2008, the market for such debt suddenly froze. The point of the program was to keep money moving through the markets while having investors, not the Fed, bear the risk.
Mr. Dahlberg was one such investor. The newly disclosed records show he was an investor in Broad Creek Partners, which borrowed $28.1 million from the Fed, through TALF, to purchase a portion of a security issued by GE Capital, the financing arm of General Electric. The security was backed by subprime credit card loans. To obtain the loan, Broad Creek pledged as collateral the market value of the security, $30.5 million.
Nearly all of some two dozen TALF investors contacted on Thursday declined to comment or did not respond to messages.
One who did agree to talk was Dov C. Schlein, a former president of the Republic Bank of New York, who estimated that he made a healthy profit, but not a killing.
''Realistically, if you were an early investor you could net 10 percent,'' he said. ''If you came in much later when the program looked to be successful, then the return dropped to 8, 7, 6, 5 percent.''
Mr. Schlein said he told fellow investors that they should be prepared for their names to become public at some point.
''I told anyone who invested in it at the time that if you're not prepared for that information to be disclosed, you should not invest,'' he said.
Mr. Schlein said he was by no means certain of making money; if unemployment had skyrocketed to 12 percent, for example, he would have expected to lose from huge defaults.
Indeed, when Mr. Schlein told students in his finance class at Baruch College, his alma mater, about the Fed program, some deemed it too risky. A year later, a new group of students said it was a shrewd gamble.
''They said, 'You got a gift from the Fed,' '' Mr. Schlein recalled.
Mr. Schlein was an investor in a fund that received 19 loans, totaling $260.9 million, to purchase securities backed by credit card, auto and student loans.
Another investor, Jeffrey R. Krinsk, estimated that he made a profit of about 13 percent, or more than $300,000 on his investment of roughly $2 million, in less than 18 months. ''The risk being assumed by investors was generally far less than the risk that was perceived by commentators who hadn't taken the time to look through the extensive documentation associated with the program,'' said Mr. Krinsk, a plaintiffs' lawyer in San Diego. ''It was actually less esoteric, less risky, than other investments I've made.''
Many of the investors in the program had backgrounds in finance, including Stephen Partridge-Hicks, who is credited with creating the market for structured investment vehicles, and Robert F. Corvino, who is a director of the CME Group, a major options and futures marketplace.
Many of the financiers, the records show, teamed up, like Jay M. Twery, Walt K. Weissman and M. Blair Wellensiek, who work at Tradelink Holdings, a Chicago trading firm.
Some financiers show up in the Fed data because of their ownership in companies that sought funds from the Fed. In one instance, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Flowers, the financiers, formed OneWest Bank, the successor to the collapsed lender IndyMac, which borrowed from the Fed. Mr. Dell's investment firm, MSD Capital, is an investor in the bank as well.
Records show that Ms. Bryant, the steeplechase enthusiast, was an investor in Belstar Credit Fund, which obtained 22 loans in amounts ranging from $2.5 million to $75.2 million. Belstar used the loans to purchase securities backed by credit card and auto loans, mortgages and small-business loans. When reached by phone, she declined to comment.
Mr. Woods, who is chairman of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the Bronx Zoo, and a former chief executive of Bessemer Securities, was an investor in the Nebris Corporation, which borrowed $10.2 million to purchase a security backed by student loans. He did not respond to messages left with his associates.
Mr. Dahlberg, a decorated aviator, became prominent early in the Watergate scandal because his name was on a check deposited in an account controlled by one of the burglars. Mr. Dahlberg, who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the scandal and is now a venture capitalist, did not return phone calls Thursday.
Mr. Schlein, the New York investor, said he felt he was helping out the Fed at a critical moment. ''The program was well thought-out,'' he said. ''I thought it was an exceptional program.''
But he also said there was a downside potential. ''The risk was that the economy was going to fall off a cliff,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Changing Views of Math and Science, Starting With the Young

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
WARSAW -- The newly opened science and technology center here was conceived not only as a place to excite young minds about science and discovery, but also as a chance for Poland to overcome at least one piece of its tragic past, to set aside one legacy of war and occupation -- the decline of math and science education.
''I see this as a vanguard in a revolution in education,'' said Prof. Lukasz Turski, a physicist with the Polish Academy of Sciences who lobbied the government to build the Copernicus Science Center, which opened in November.
The idea is to overcome a view of the hard sciences as inferior to the arts and humanities, a lingering perception that is today hampering Poland's efforts to advance. It is a concrete reminder of just how much history shapes and defines the present. 
Many nations have struggled to excite their children about math and science. But in Poland, it is different. In a nation that struggled to remain a nation even while it did not exist, geographically wiped off the map for more than a century, the arts proved to be a thread that bound generations of Poles together, preserving an identity and a rich language.
''The only form to create national identity was literature,'' said Janusz Reiter, a former ambassador to Germany and the United States, who now lives and works here in the capital.
So the humanities were important to Poland's survival, while math and the sciences languished.
''The reason we had a poor mathematical tradition is rather clear,'' wrote Wieslaw Zelazko, a mathematics professor with the Polish Academy of Sciences. ''In the 19th century, a period of great development of mathematics in Western Europe, Poland was not an independent country.''
Poland, Professor Zelazko continued, did have a period of math excellence that began after World War I, though in the sweep of history it was a relatively brief period, cut off by World War II, when the Nazis silenced, drove out or killed Poland's intellectuals. Schools and universities were shut down. (In Nazi ideology, Poles were ''subhumans,'' fit only to work as slaves on the farms that Germans would establish after the war on Polish territory.)
Later, after 40 years of Soviet domination, when the Iron Curtain fell, Poland moved quickly to overhaul its school system. But it failed to change the mind-set toward math. In 2001, the Education Ministry ruled that math was not an obligatory part of the series of tests needed to graduate from high school, Professor Turski said.
So lots of people just skipped math -- a legacy that Poland's fledgling high-tech sector is struggling with today. Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, a Polish daily newspaper, recently reported that job opportunities in these areas outnumbered applicants by 10 to 1.
Economists say that Poland lags far behind other nations of comparable resources in patent applications, and that in 2012 Poland will probably lose out on European Union financing for research and development.
''I am not qualified to be considered intelligentsia in this country,'' Professor Turski said, shouting with the enthusiasm of a man on a mission. ''It is more important to sit and discuss Plato than to know how the chip in the computer works.''
The decision to make math studies optional was finally reversed this past May, Professor Turski said, part of a long, slow process of trying to persuade Poles to forge values relevant to the modern world, and to get past values that evolved in very different times.
But that struggle is not just relevant to math, because it is essentially about reconstructing an identity free from suffering, free from occupation, free from the moral certainty that resistance is always the moral choice.
''The traditional assumptions of who we are no longer are useful,'' said Mr. Reiter, the former ambassador. ''Who are we? What is our mission in this world? What holds us together?''
These questions are a constant undercurrent in politics here, in attitudes toward the Roman Catholic Church and its role in society, and in how people view patriotism, in addition to attitudes toward learning.
The undercurrent is not the focus of debate, but it is often the context of the debate, said many academics and political scientists. The main difference between the two primary political parties is less about policy than about how to incorporate the past into the present: whether to continue searching for Communist collaborators, for example, or how closely linked national identity should be with religious identity and allegiance to the Catholic Church.
''One of the main divisions between political parties in Poland is not connected with the economy,'' said Pawel Spiewak, a sociologist at the University of Warsaw. ''Much more important is the attitude toward the sphere of culture, toward church, toward morality, toward the past.''
It is not even clear, Professor Turski said, that there is a general understanding and agreement on the need to improve education in science and math, if for no other reason than to help propel Poland's already successful post-cold-war economy.
''The only way for this country to move forward is for it to educate its own people, and our politicians don't understand this,'' Professor Turski said. ''You cannot move a country without great ideas.''
He is hoping that the Copernicus Center can at least inspire people, if not the system itself, to embrace science and math. The center has been open only a few weeks, but it has sparked a glimmer of optimism. It is always filled, with families on weekends and schoolchildren during the week.
''I think we see now there is a great need to learn mathematics and science,'' said Maja Topolnicka, a schoolteacher who was visiting the Copernicus Center with her students recently. ''I don't know why we did not see that before.''
Ms. Topolnicka watched as her 12-year-old students ran from exhibit to exhibit, pushing buttons, cranking handles and having a grand time even if they seemed to be missing the science behind what made the pistons go up and down, or the balloon shoot into the air. But that did not necessarily matter, because in the end, the science center might just find that it has a head start with a generation weaned not just on history and tradition but on video games and the Internet.
''I like math and science,'' said one student, Borys Kozdak, using English he said he learned from playing online video games.
Ilona Rusin was watching as her son, Sebastian, 10, dropped marbles into a long maze. She said he had made her promise to take him to the museum as soon as it opened, and they made it within the first week.
''No,'' she said, ''when I did my studies, I did not take math.'' Her son looked up from his activity and said with a shy smile that he loved computers and added, ''Everything in the world has something to do with math.''

In the past, the arts helped solidify Polish identity, while mathematics and science languished. Now, some Poles see a need to improve math and science education.

HEADLINE: Labor Fight Stops Work To Install Solar Panels

BYLINE: By JOHN UPTON. 
jupton@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
A bitter dispute over who can work on solar power projects has brought to a halt San Francisco's efforts to install solar panels at City Hall, Davies Symphony Hall and other prominent buildings. 
Electricians, roofers and other unions are battling over ''green collar'' jobs that are emerging with the city's aggressive pursuit of clean energy. In June, protests that led to shouting matches between electricians and other laborers stopped work on a five-megawatt solar power plant in the Sunset district.
Officials mediated that dispute, but the city later suspended about $7 million in similar projects after activists threatened more protests.
''We're going to protest it every time,'' said James Richards, leader of Aboriginal Blackmen United, a group that organized the June protests on behalf of workers from Bayview and other low-income neighborhoods. ''We deserve the work.''
The dispute underscores the complexities of how jobs will be divided in the green economy. State regulations provide limited direction for employers trying to determine which workers are appropriate for clean-energy projects.
San Francisco embarked on a solar power blitz in recent years, installing panels at San Francisco International Airport, the Moscone Center and elsewhere. Officials estimate that the stalled projects will create 6,700 hours of work -- enough to keep 28 people employed for six weeks. Scores of similar projects are planned throughout the city.
But the question of who will do the work remains heated.
The June dispute erupted after a contractor hired people represented by Aboriginal Blackmen United to work alongside union electricians. The electricians receive roughly $75 an hour, compared with $42 an hour for the other laborers.
After the electricians complained, the city's Office of Labor Standards Enforcement ruled that workers who install solar panels must be paid electricians wages. The contractor fired the workers represented by Aboriginal Blackmen United, which staged protests.
After city-mediated negotiations, the laborers were rehired at their original wages to sweep and perform other basic duties. Peace held until construction finished in October.
The electricians say they are ready to resume work on other projects, but insist that only they are qualified to perform the work.
''As soon as they're ready to move, we're certainly ready to go out and install,'' said John O'Rourke, business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 6.
City officials say work will remain suspended until the dispute is resolved.
Officials now say a proposed city ordinance forcing contractors to hire a minimum percentage of workers from San Francisco -- including its disadvantaged neighborhoods -- will help resolve the standoff by placing more Aboriginal Blackmen United members on solar energy job sites.
''If there is a path forward for how to get more locals on job sites, then that would help,'' said Barbara Hale, who heads the city's efforts to install the solar panels.

HEADLINE: U.S. Should Know There's No Sulking in Soccer

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Soccer is, after all, the world's game. It belongs to the 203 nations that play the sport, from Spain all the way to Papua New Guinea, neither of which will be hosting the 2018 or the 2022 World Cup.
Instead, Russia and Qatar will stage those two events, if the world holds together long enough. 
I heard enough natural-gas-and-oil jokes at a soccer gathering in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday. Supply your own. What happens if the world goes green next week? It won't.
Russia and Qatar will build the stadiums and the people will go, and the rising tide of American footie fans will watch in pubs, and travel to those games, and have a great old time as a growing soccer nation in its own right, consumers and participants.
What the United States needs to do right now, rather than sulk and mutter about being cheated, is continue developing soccer the way it has in the last generation. Holding the World Cup is not a birthright, not a prize for having a lot of hotels near a lot of stadiums. It's a big world out there.
There is no point saying the United States ''deserved'' the 2022 World Cup merely because it could hold the event next week, as soon as it erased those goofy stripes across perfectly good fields.
The United States delivered a superb bid plan, with every detail depicting a nation ready to hold the 2022 World Cup. So what? FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, had somewhat different priorities.
True, two of FIFA's 24 executive committee members were suspended for appearing willing to take bribes in a sting by a British newspaper, and also true, FIFA has a deserved reputation for graft and favoritism and opacity.
But FIFA also has a stated policy of helping the sport grow around the world. The hopeful group of 150 people from Major League Soccer and its sponsors that clustered in New York on Thursday watched on television as FIFA delivered the old one-two punch it had been telegraphing for days, weeks, months, years. You say bribes. They say vision. Split the difference.
England held an unforgettable World Cup in 1966 -- just yesterday. The United States held a hugely successful World Cup in 1994 -- a blink of an eye.
FIFA's president, Sepp Blatter, has been lusting after a Nobel Peace Prize -- for what, for being a sports entrepreneur? Part of his M.O. is to connect the dots on the globe. On Thursday he talked about the lessons of soccer -- winning and losing -- in less convincing fashion than anybody's youth-league soccer coach.
However it was done, whether by following Blatter's master plan or by horse trading by 22 committee members, Blatter did preside over moving the greatest sports event on the planet into two untapped regions: Mother Russia and the Muslim world. Oligarchs and sheiks instead of American hedge-fund operators and rogue bankers. Take your pick.
The mood was clearly despondent in New York, where the cadre from M.L.S. had been hoping to run a great event in 12 years.
''That being said, soccer continues to be a mainstream sport here,'' said Mark Abbott, the M.L.S. president.
Also in the room was John Harkes, once the captain of the United States national team and one of the first Yanks to succeed in English soccer. Now a commentator for ESPN, Harkes was sad for both England and the United States.
''My heart sank; it's a huge disappointment,'' said Harkes, who once scored a goal at Wembley, the home turf of the world sport. But he added diplomatically, ''FIFA has done its best to see where soccer is going to grow next.''
Speaking from Zurich later, Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, sounded boggled by FIFA's awarding two World Cups at the same time, which inevitably led to FIFA-like machinations.
''That's not how things are done in our country,'' Gulati said.
An economist who understands the interconnectedness of the world, Gulati told how he had come to realize in recent months that Qatar would be a contender, with its plans to build nine new stadiums within 25 miles and air-condition them and then dismantle them and give them to poor nations (a dubious gift, to be sure).
''I said, 'That's not a fantasy, it's a dream, and dreams come true,' '' Gulati said.
It's hard to judge what a Qatar World Cup will be like. Will the rich beer sponsors be able to vend and promote their product? Will female journalists and female tourists be able to visit in full equality? Will Qatar upgrade its national team, currently ranked 113th in the world, to avoid embarrassment in 2022?
But I can address a Russian World Cup. In 1986, I had the distinct pleasure of covering the first and best Goodwill Games in Moscow, beautiful midsummer Moscow. This was the time of Gorbachev and glasnost, and the oligarchs had not yet made their bundles -- at least not ostentatiously in public -- and the core of the city was poor. But people shared their hearts and their bread, and the games were run with skill and passion.
I would love to cover a World Cup in Russia. I wouldn't want to see Sepp Blatter get any prizes for moving a sports tournament around, under mysterious circumstances. But it's a big world.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales and Real Estate Help Shares Climb for a 2nd Day

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Matthew Saltmarsh, David Jolly, Jack Ewing and Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a second consecutive day on Thursday, lifted by encouraging reports on retail sales and the real estate market.
Developments in Europe, where the central bank took steps to support bond markets, also helped, lifting financial companies in particular.
The day's advance, averaging about 1 percent for the major indexes, came on top of gains of more than 2 percent on Wednesday. 
Improvements in consumer spending, the jobs market and housing are crucial to the economic recovery in the United States, and on Thursday investors got a fresh monthly snapshot of all three areas.
The nation's retailers reported that sales at stores open at least a year rose an average of 6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters, well above the 2.6 percent that analysts had expected.
''The good news is that consumers spent throughout the month of November,'' said John Long, a retail strategist at Kurt Salmon Associates, a consulting firm. Economic data on jobs and pending home sales on Thursday also showed signs of improvement. But developments in Europe vied for investors' attention. In Frankfurt, the European Central Bankextended its liquidity support program for banks and then bought bonds of risky euro-zone issuers.
The central bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said an ''overwhelming majority'' on the bank's governing council agreed to continue the debt purchases begun in May.
Investors had hoped the bank would make a major display of monetary firepower to prevent the sovereign debt crisis from spreading. Still, the bank's actions may have been more decisive than its words.
''As Trichet was speaking, the E.C.B. moved in aggressively, buying Portuguese and Irish bonds,'' said Charles Diebel, chief strategist at Lloyds TSB Bank in London. ''The E.C.B. is saying, 'We're doing as much as we can within our remit. Now it's over to the governments.' ''
But Mr. Diebel added: ''This doesn't sort out the real, underlying problems in the euro zone.''
Prices on Italian, Portuguese, Belgian, Irish and Spanish 10-year bonds rose, while the German 10-year benchmark issue slipped a touch. Earlier, an auction of Spanish government debt met with firm demand.
European stocks slipped early in the day but moved higher after the central bank meeting.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 106.63 points, or 1 percent, to close at 11,362.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.46 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,221.53, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 29.92 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,579.35.
Interest rates rose slightly. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32, to 96 28/32, and the yield rose to 2.99 percent from 2.96 percent late Wednesday.
Also on Thursday, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected to 436,000 for the week that ended Nov. 27. Economists had predicted that claims would rise by a seasonally adjusted 13,000 to 420,000.
Jobless claims had fallen four of the last six weeks and the seasonally adjusted four-week moving average was 431,000 in the week of Nov. 27, down from 437,000 the previous week.
''It is clear that initial unemployment claims are trending lower as the labor market recovers,'' Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said in a research note.
Economists from Goldman Sachs said the report was ''consistent with some improvement in the labor market.''
Financial shares led the broader market higher. Wells Fargo rose 4.5 percent to $28.78; Bank of America gained 3.5 percent to $11.68; and JPMorgan Chase rose 3 percent to $39.31. Citigroup rose 2.8 percent to $4.42.
William Fitzpatrick, an equities analyst for Optique Capital Management, said it appeared that the sector was rising as European policy makers ''seem to be embracing policy actions closer to what we have done here in the U.S., and that is what the markets are warming up to.''
He said the financial industry was also being bolstered by a better trend in economic data.
''There is no question there is a recovery taking place, and that goes a long way to restoring confidence in the marketplace,'' he said. Investors then go after the most ''beaten down sector, and that has been the financials.''
Jason Arnold, a financial analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said institutions closely tied to credit risk, exposure to mortgages and the housing market were the best performers.
''The key driver is the pending sales of existing homes, which was better than the market expected,'' Mr. Arnold said.
The National Association of Realtors' pending home sales index for October rose 10.4 percent, to 89.3. It reversed a 1.8 percent decline in September and exceeded analysts' forecasts of a 1 percent fall.
Home builders rose. Hovnanian Enterprises rose 5.9 percent to $4.02 and Beazer Homes USA was up 4.9 percent to $4.67.
Retail shares were mixed but mostly in line with November sales results. Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch rose more than 11 percent to $56.02 after exceeding expectations, while Aeropostale declined 14 percent to $23.04 after disappointing results.

HEADLINE: Google Signs Deal to Buy Manhattan Office Building

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In the biggest real estate deal of the year, Google signed a contract on Thursday to buy one of the largest office buildings in Manhattan for more than $1.8 billion, according to two real estate executives who have been briefed on the deal. 
Google put down a ''substantial deposit'' on the 15-story building at 111 Eighth Avenue, just north of the meatpacking district, and is expected to close the sale by the end of the year, said the executives, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal.
The contract not only signals a rebounding real estate market, at least for office buildings full of high-profile tenants paying good rents, but also reflects a vote of confidence by an expanding technology firm in New York City.
''This decision is further evidence that large-scale buildings are trading once again,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan and a former city economic development official, ''and high-end users are looking to take advantage of these opportunities.''
The brick building, which covers an entire block bound by 15th and 16th Streets, already houses Google's East Coast headquarters and 1,800 employees, as well as Lifetime Entertainment, barnesandnoble.com, Nike USA and Deutsch advertising.
But at 2.9 million square feet, it has more space than the Empire State Building and plenty of room for Google to grow.
The current owners -- the New York State Common Retirement Fund; Jamestown, a German investment group; and Taconic Investment Partners -- put the building on the auction block in September, hoping to attract foreign investors, private equity firms and other companies scouring the market for investment opportunities.
Douglas Harmon, the broker who handled the sale, snared a dozen bidders. But Google moved quickly to pre-empt other potential buyers and entered exclusive negotiations with the owners. On Thursday, both sides signed the contract.
Both the sturdy brick building, which has 15-foot ceilings and unobstructed views, and the neighborhood have undergone a remarkable transformation. The structure was built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1932 for port-related businesses. Taconic and its partners bought the property in 1998 and began stocking the building with telecom companies like Verizon and Sprint and later Deutsch advertising. Taconic is expected to continue managing the property.
As meatpackers moved out of the neighborhood to the south they were replaced by galleries, fashion houses and expensive shops.

HEADLINE: Met May Be Shopping to Fill Whitney Space

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
MIAMI BEACH - The crowds that used to form more than an hour before the opening of the ''First Choice'' portion of Art Basel Miami Beach-the four-hour window between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. when only elite collectors can enter and browse the fair-are gone. Gone too are the speculators who before the financial crisis used to race down the aisles as soon as the doors opened in order to snag a work that they thought they could flip at a profit a few months later. Indeed, on Wednesday during ''First Choice'' things seemed sedate compared to the years before 2008. Some described the giant convention hall as ''empty.'' 
That doesn't mean that things didn't sell. The extreme caution and modesty of 2008 and 2009, the hesitation to be seen spending, is gone, too. Pay in the financial world is roaring back to pre-crisis levels, and art is increasingly seen as a safe place to park money, like gold. So galleries including Gagosian, David Zwirner, Pace and Andrea Rosen all reported making several sales, and major collectors like Steven A. Cohen, Peter Brant, and David Tieger wandered around the fair, often being stalked by journalists hoping to catch them in the act of closing a deal. (The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Cohen bought Adel Abdessemad's ''Mappemonde'' for approximately $300,000 at Zwirner and a work by Tim Hawkinson for $180,000 from the gallery Blum & Poe.) But although many dealers and collectors cited a renewed optimism and exuberance-''I guess maybe the art world hasn't heard about the recession,'' said Don Rubell, the major Miami collector-later in the evening a more cynical European collector described the fair as relatively anemic. He recalled how, in earlier years, he had to arrive by 9:30 a.m. to have a chance of getting through the doors by 11:30. This year, he arrived at 10:45 and was the first in line. It worked out well for him: He walked right in and bought a piece.
Even after 3 p.m., when the fair opened to a wider crowd, the atmosphere was still so relaxed that Peter Benedek, a co-founder of United Talent Agency, whose clients include ''Sopranos'' creator David Chase and, more recently, the 24-year-old auteur Lena Dunham, actually sat down on the floor in Zwirner's booth to contemplate a Neo Rauch oil-on-paper work resting against the wall in front of him. Apparently, his communion with it was gratifying, because he ultimately bought it.
In some peoples' eyes, a positive consequence of the slower pace is that institutions have more of a chance to buy. Tanya Bonakdar said that she had sold a Haim Steinbach sculpture to the Hammer Museum at U.C.L.A., and the Mexican gallery kurimanzutto said it had a major work on hold for a museum.
Among the people who visited those booths was Anne Strauss, an associate curator in the department of 19th century, modern, and contemporary at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who said she was at the fair with a very specific goal: catching up on Latin American contemporary art, an area in which she said the Met was ''way behind.'' She had recently been to Brazil for the Sao Paolo Biennial and to visit Inhotim, the art park created by the iron magnate Bernardo Paz, but she said that Art Basel Miami Beach was ''indispensable'' as a way of further educating herself about the current trends in Latin American art, and would save her multiple other trips abroad.
She had visited a small group of galleries-in addition to Tanya Bonakdar and kurimanzutto, Anton Kern, Galerie Lelong, and the Brazilian gallery Fortes Vilaca-and looked at work by Ernesto Neto, Tomas Saraceno, Valeska Soares, and others. Asked where her directive was coming from, she said the Met was interested generally in becoming less Euro-centric and more global. A particular impetus, she said, was the Met's possible lease of the Whitney Museum of American Art's Breuer building on Madison Avenue (which the Whitney may abandon, at least temporarily when it moves downtown).
''If we make this move, even though it's temporary, it will offer an opportunity'' to acquire and show new work, Ms. Strauss said. Curators in the 19th century, modern, and contemporary department, she said, are working with others in photography and Asian and African art to conceive of a museum-sized exhibition of art made after 1960 from around the world. The Whitney may collaborate on the program, as well.
By 6:30 p.m., the cluster of Latin American galleries was definitely the most relaxing and pleasant place to be, as people with tired feet eagerly climbed inside a nylon sculpture by Mr. Neto that looked like a giant tomato and was the size of a small room, with a circular bench surrounding a drum that people were encouraged to strike upon entering. ''If they would now deliver some hot tea, that would be perfect,'' joked Julian Zugazagoitia, the director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, who hung out in the Neto sculpture for 40 minutes, chatting happily with people in English and Spanish.
Which is not to say that everyone was resting. At 8:30 p.m., 20-somethings jostled outside the Raleigh Hotel, hoping to get into the Vogue party. A bit later in the evening, at the Raleigh's beachside party site, the band LCD Soundsystem blasted its music to a large crowd at the MoCA L.A. party -- the former Deitch Projects party, retooled to fit Jeffrey Deitch's new role as director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. ''I was always central to Miami,'' Mr. Deitch had said earlier in the day, confessing that he was ''nostalgic'' for his days as a dealer there. ''They didn't even replace my booth - it's a group of benches now.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Homeless, Mentally Ill and, Soon, Short a Lifeline

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
At 8 a.m. on a Monday morning, as rush-hour traffic whisked by into downtown San Francisco, a disheveled, middle-aged man redecorated a shuttered business on 6th Street by fussily mounting a ''wet paint'' sign with tape, as if hanging artwork in an imaginary home.
The man sat down, surrounded by clothing strewn on the sidewalk, and began shouting to the universe. Occasional passers-by tried to engage him, but quickly scattered. His rant didn't seem to be directed at anyone visible to anyone else. 
Each day, scenes like this play out across the city, disturbing even streetwise residents and alarming tourists. Those who are both homeless and severely mentally ill are the toughest, most intractable cases of homelessness that few have the experience or fortitude to tackle.
Starting Jan. 1, even fewer will try.
Caduceus Outreach Services, a nonprofit organization that has provided free psychiatric care to the city's mentally ill homeless population since 1996, is scheduled to cease operations at the end of this year. There is no money to continue the program, even though it is inexpensive and operates, in large part, with volunteers.
The demise comes at a time when the need is acute. Some in the 6th Street area said the number of people requiring help there had increased since the old Transbay Terminal bus station on Mission Street closed for demolition in August, displacing about 100 homeless people.
''Homeless and mentally ill people are not at the top of anyone's list,'' said Marykate Connor, founder and executive director of Caduceus, which has a staff of four and a drop-in center off 6th Street. Its budget for the most recent fiscal year was about $475,000, including $350,000 from the city.
That is a pittance compared with the $174.7 million the city spent in the most recent fiscal year on services, health care, shelters and housing for homeless people.
Caduceus treats 100 patients each year, and has been able to operate so frugally because more than a dozen psychiatrists have donated their services.
In a vast bureaucratic system, a program where doctors work pro bono is an anomaly. But when Ms. Connor -- who has worked on homelessness for 25 years and is married to Paul Boden, an outspoken advocate for the homeless -- created Caduceus, she said she developed an unconventional approach to reaching those who live ''off the grid.''
Due to their illness, which is often accompanied by a history of abuse and drug and alcohol addiction, these are people who refuse to accept housing or to live in shelters. Many are unable or unwilling to follow even the most basic rules, like filling out forms or being fingerprinted to receive city services.
''If you're a psychotic homeless person, you don't have a lot of trust for the system,'' said Francisco J. Gonzalez, a psychiatrist and former Caduceus medical director who volunteered with the program for five years. ''They don't have the bandwidth to deal with that.''
Caduceus, which derives its name from the medical symbol, tossed the rule book to help these people. No identification, no problem. Missed an appointment or fell off the wagon? It's O.K. -- we won't expel you.
As a result, Ms. Connor said that there had been a 93 percent success rate in getting people connected to additional benefits, and that no patients had committed suicide in the 15 years of the program.
To explain how hard fought the victories are in this world, Dr. Gonzalez remembered a case where Ms. Connor was determined to reach out to one mentally ill homeless man. At first she simply walked by, so he might notice her presence. Eventually she made eye contact. Then came a nod, later a single word exchanged, and in time, a conversation and help. Establishing that modicum of trust took years.
But not following rules has ultimately led to the demise of Caduceus. With the economic downturn, Medi-Cal reimbursements for treating homeless patients have become essential to the city's budget. Ms. Connor said many Caduceus patients were unable to comply with Medi-Cal's identification requirements. No insurance means no financing for her program.
Dariush Kayhan, the city's director of homeless policy, said a recent survey counted 2,709 people living on the streets of San Francisco -- those who cannot or will not accept shelter. Of those, Mr. Kayhan said, about 20 percent have mental illness and shunned assistance. ''It is absolutely a challenge for us,'' he said.
The city has its own outreach teams, and Mr. Kayhan said they were trained to handle these difficult cases.
They will have 100 more once Caduceus disappears.

To the Editor:
Re ''Republicans Threaten to Bring Senate to Halt Over Tax Dispute'' (news article, Dec. 2):
I am a card-carrying member of the middle class -- a college-educated working mom with two children in college, two mortgages, some credit card debt and a decent 401(k). I make more than $50,000 but less than $100,000 and am better off financially than my parents. I am bewildered by all the ruckus about tax increases.
I work for a small business with fewer than 40 employees, and when the Bush tax cuts went into effect I went to every person in my company and asked how much his or her take-home pay had increased. The amount averaged $28 per month. 
I would gratefully sacrifice my $28 per month to secure a better future for my children. When it's explained in these terms, wouldn't anyone do the same?
Maureen Beamer Dunwoody, Ga., Dec. 2, 2010
To the Editor:
As a lifelong Republican, I read with dismay your article about the Senate Republicans' stance on tax cuts. The willingness to stop all legislative action if the current tax rates are not continued fails to recognize that the current tax structure is part of the reason we are in this mess. We cannot have a government that encourages its citizens to believe that there is a limited cost to the services we all consume.
So perhaps, instead of tirades from both sides about the evils of taxes and tax cuts, we might look for a phased restoration of higher tax rates across the entire spectrum. If we ever actually see a willingness to reduce spending, then tax cuts will be welcome.
It is not enough for Republicans to talk only in terms of reducing funds for social services and not seriously consider military spending. Without this, it is not just the Democrats who have misread the last election.
Nick Masucci Niskayuna, N.Y., Dec. 2, 2010
To the Editor:
Re ''In Tax Cuts, the Options Run Short,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, Dec. 1):
Conventional wisdom seems to hold that 60 votes are required for the Senate passage of any tax cut, and that since Republicans are unlikely to support any cut that does not extend to those earning more than $250,000 per year, the Democrats must retreat.
This analysis seems to forget that the original Bush tax cuts were passed under reconciliation rules, which required only a simple majority in the Senate. If those rules were good enough for the original tax cut, why aren't they good enough for the extension?
Under reconciliation rules, it should be a simple matter for Democrats, with their current majorities in both the House and the Senate, to extend the tax cut for everyone earning less than $250,000 before they expire. Then let the next Congress deal with the question of tax cuts for high earners.
Democrats will always have time to cave in next year -- why rush things?
Francois Furstenberg Montreal, Dec. 1, 2010
To the Editor:
That raging question of whether to extend the Bush tax cuts can be rather easily economically (and politically) solved: the $700 billion bonus for the privileged, if the tax cuts were extended for the wealthiest 2 percent, should be given instead to the middle class.
An additional benefit: the middle class will spend a greater percentage of that $700 billion than the wealthy.

I have been reading about the deficit commission since the chairmen shared their overview, looking for courage from our elected officials, only to be disappointed by the lack of political will on both sides of the aisle.
It is telling that neither extreme -- from Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, to Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican who will be chairman of the House Budget Committee -- shows any willingness to support the commission's proposed spending cuts and tax increases.
The facts are simple: the Bush tax cuts did nothing to spur growth. It is finally time to start paying off our foreign creditors and to adopt more sustainable fiscal practices. The pain should be shared across the board: from those who demand the most services, to those who benefit the most from our economy.
If Congress cannot muster a majority to make some tough choices to stop the sieve, then we must let the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone.

To the Editor:
When President John F. Kennedy presented his tax-cutting program, he added a nautical analogy: ''A rising tide lifts all boats.''
The Republican tax plan ought to have a similar analogy: ''This rising tide will lift all yachts.''

Re ''Obama Declares Two-Year Freeze on Federal Pay'' (front page, Nov. 30):
So far, the only ones asked to sacrifice for the sake of the nation are the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed, soldiers and the middle class.
When do the wealthy, big financial institutions, those who hire lobbyists, and the direct beneficiaries of this crisis get to sacrifice?

HEADLINE: Managing Risk for JPMorgan, and His Own Blindness

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON - As a trader at JPMorgan Chase in London, Ashish Goyal helps manage billions of dollars of the bank's exposure to risks like foreign exchange fluctuations. In his spare time, he takes tango lessons, plays cricket and goes clubbing with friends. Mr. Goyal is also blind.
Watching him in the middle of the trading floor as he switches back and forth between computer screens, that is not apparent at all. But to check his e-mail, read research reports and look at presentations, Mr. Goyal uses a screen-reading software whose speed is so high that it sounds like gibberish to the untrained ear. When he needs to read graphs, which the software cannot do, Mr. Goyal goes through the data and tries to imagine the graph in his head. 
On his desk, two computer screens show the usual flashing Bloomberg messages and spreadsheets of constantly changing numbers. Two keyboards are linked to headsets through which the information and figures are read out to him at rapid speeds. The same technology reads out text messages he receives on his cellphone.
''My colleagues already complained that they can't hear my phone speak, as it is too fast,'' Mr. Goyal said jokingly. ''I turn around and say, 'Well, I can't read your text messages, so it's only fair.' ''
Tolga Uzuner, executive director of JPMorgan's chief investment office and Mr. Goyal's boss, said he hired the 30-year old Wharton graduate because he was one of only a few candidates he interviewed who knew about Asian interest rates, had excellent risk management skills and knowledge of foreign exchange.
Vladimir Aleksic, who now works with Mr. Goyal, said: ''We walked out of the interview room and just said wow.'' Many people on the team analyze historical data and use comparisons to make decisions about risks, Mr. Aleksic said, but ''Ashish looks at where things are now and just follows the news flow. He's not blinded by the graphs.''
But as someone who can make out only light and shadows, Mr. Goyal also knows his limits. ''I told people, 'You can put me on the spot trading desk, but I'd be too slow,' '' he said. ''The challenges are to realize where I can add value and where I don't. You need to find your niche.''
Mr. Goyal says he always wanted to work in financial markets. But despite a resume that includes a top business degree from a university in India, another from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a three-year stint at an Indian subsidiary of ING bank, finding people who would hire him was not easy.
After gaining his first business degree, Mr. Goyal said he had made the short list of candidates for jobs at several firms, but once they realized he was blind he was turned away. When it was ING's turn, Mr. Goyal recalled, he was so frustrated that he just blurted: ''I'm blind. Do you still want to talk to me or not?''
''They asked whether I could do the job. I said I think I can, and I was hired,'' Mr. Goyal said.
Years later, when he applied to Wharton with the goal of getting a job in New York or London, Mr. Goyal said, the university's director of admission signed off on his application with the words: ''I have never seen a blind trader on Wall Street. I can't guarantee you'll get a job but you'll definitely be better off with a Wharton degree.''
Still, even after Wharton, many Wall Street firms rejected his applications because they could not find anybody else on Wall Street using the same screen-reading software. JPMorgan was the only bank to offer him a summer internship, which led to an offer of a permanent position.
Mr. Goyal was not born blind. Growing up in Mumbai, Mr. Goyal said he had a normal, happy childhood. But when he was about 9 years old, he noticed that he could not immediately recognize some people and could not see the lines in his notebooks at school. One night he walked into a ditch, later he crashed his bicycle, and then he started to miss the ball during his tennis lessons.
Mr. Goyal was told he had retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic condition that damages the retina, and would gradually become blind. By the time Mr. Goyal was 22, he had completely lost his eyesight.
''The worst thing was I didn't know what was happening and what to do about it,'' Mr. Goyal said. While other people his age were starting to date, he said, ''I was struggling to deal with a disability. What was I to tell people? 'Sometimes I can see you, sometimes not?' ''
The loss of his eyesight left Mr. Goyal ''scared and confused'' and with fewer friends, he said. ''I was ready to just give up and not take my final exam and just go and work for my dad,'' a real estate developer, Mr. Goyal said. But his mother forced him to sit for the exam, and to his surprise he not only passed but received good grades.
Today, Mr. Goyal said he was proud that he did not need help from others on a daily basis and he had again become active in sports, as he was as a child. Last year, his team won a cricket tournament for the blind, which is played with a slightly bigger ball that has sound.
Despite his achievements, which this year also included a national award from India for the Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Mr. Goyal speaks modestly of himself.
''One challenge is that I don't become a benchmark for other people,'' he said. ''I've done all these things but yes, it's been a struggle. Not everyone is as fortunate to have the support of friends and family and it wouldn't be fair. I'm mediocre at many things.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Groupon's Biggest Deal Could Transform City's Tech Start-Ups

BYLINE: By JIM KIRK. 
jkirk@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Chicago has been home to far bigger transactions than the one being discussed between Google and Groupon. But few, if any, have had as much riding on it for the city as this $6 billion deal does.
Groupon, a Chicago company coveted for its ability to mobilize millions of people online to buy local products, offers steep daily discounts to consumers on an array of products and services. If the Google-Groupon deal is completed, Groupon will be one of the country's biggest start-up success stories and one likely to spur a frenzy of new investment in Internet-based companies, including more in sometimes-overlooked Chicago.
For Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., the deal would be its biggest purchase, more than tripling what it paid for YouTube in 2006 and far richer than the $3.1 billion it spent in 2007 for DoubleClick, an online-advertising company.
For Chicago, the deal would represent something bigger than the price tag, which has been the buzz of venture capitalists, technology entrepreneurs and Wall Street investors for several weeks. The deal, tech executives say, could represent a game-changing moment for Chicago's economy -- a chance for the city to establish itself as a major tech hub that can grow talent and keep it here. 
It is a large enough transaction to make a number of executives rich overnight, in much the same way the online payment company PayPal did when it was bought by eBay for $1.2 billion in 2002. The move attracted a host of angel investors who breathed life into more than 20 other start-ups, enhancing Silicon Valley's reputation as the nation's high-tech center.
Analysts say the ability of the Groupon deal to stimulate more high-technology investment in Chicago depends, in part, on whether the new Groupon millionaires -- the second tier of managers who could gain big payouts as a result of the deal --will stick around the city and become investors in other local start-ups.
''As it spills down to lots of folks, that's when it becomes powerful,'' said Anand Sanwal, founder of CB Insights, which tracks high-growth and emerging companies.
But others warn that Chicago has been down this path before, with smaller successful start-ups that have failed to attract the investments needed to build a top-tier tech industry similar to hot spots in California, Texas and, recently, New York. In some instances, executives have left Chicago after a major buyout. After Google's acquisition of Chicago-based FeedBurner in 2007, Dick Costolo, the founder, joined Twitter in San Francisco, and was recently named its chief executive.
''It really depends on what Google does,'' said Adrian Holovaty, the Chicago founder of online company EveryBlock, which was sold to MSNBC.
Chicago's emerging online industry has been criticized for being splintered and lacking a deep pool of talent, the so-called tech geeks who are the backbone of innovation. City executives hope the Groupon deal will change that.
''It's a huge win, almost any way you look at it,'' said Matt Moog, a Chicago tech pioneer who is now the president and chief executive of Viewpoints Network, which provides online reviews and allows companies to establish online communities. Moog, whose CoolSavings was one of the city's early Web start-ups, said that, given the size of the deal and likelihood that many of the investors and managers would stay in Chicago, there is little doubt there will be a spillover effect for the city.
''It's validation for the city that you can create, launch, scale and sell a world-class digital company in Chicago,'' Mr. Moog said. ''In another year or two you may see Groupon alumni investing in other start-ups here.''
''A lot of people stand to make a lot of money from this, and they are not all going to leave,'' said Mr. Holovaty, who made sure to keep his company in Chicago.
Indeed, Andrew Mason, the Groupon co-founder and chief executive, and other co-founders like Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell, have publicly talked about the need to reinvest in Chicago start-ups in order to help jump-start the industry here, along with the need for state and city tax help to simulate job creation.
''But probably the No. 1 thing missing in Chicago today is an ego,'' Mr. Lefkofsky told Fortune magazine in an interview in October. Neither Mr. Lefkofsky nor Mr. Keywell could be reached for comment.
Groupon, which exploded onto the local scene barely two years ago, is this year's tech-industry darling. Starting with fewer than 200 employees, Groupon, which offers those who sign up huge discounts on items like restaurant meals, boat tours and hotel stays, has relied heavily on the viral nature of its business, where friends pass along the daily deals to other friends.
It is that ability to combine businesses and consumers on the local level that has attracted Google, which has had difficulty gaining local advertising market share and establishing a strong foothold in social media. Groupon's business caught fire and its growth has been breathtaking, even though its business model appears easy to replicate. The company, which is headquartered at the old Montgomery Ward catalog warehouse on the Near North Side, now boasts more than 3,000 employees and serves 300 markets. It counts 35 million subscribers and is reportedly profitable.
On Thursday, The New York Times reported that Groupon's revenue prospects are even better than first thought, possibly making the $6 billion price tag a relative bargain. Citing an unnamed source close to Groupon, the company's revenue may top $1 billion a year and its subscriber base tripled over the summer. Previously, analysts had estimated Groupon's revenue in the $500 million range.
Neither Groupon nor Google would comment Thursday on reports of the talks.
What sets Groupon's success apart from other ventures, executives say, are the local forces that came together -- academic, governmental (including $28 million in tax increment financing to refurbish the Montgomery Ward space for technology start-ups) and entrepreneurial -- to give Groupon and its forerunner, The Point, room to experiment, fail and eventually find a successful model.
''They relied on universities, local talent and engineers,'' Mr. Moog said. ''They were easily able to raise money from both Chicago and West Coast investors.''
Even as local entrepreneurs salivate at the prospect of more attention -- and potentially more cash -- that might be lavished on Chicago start-ups as a result of the Groupon deal, industry observers say the city's tech industry needs to do a better job of coming together, attracting more technical talent, and promoting itself.
Mr. Holovaty said the industry here has been fragmented for many years, but ''it's come together more than in the past,'' he said. ''Of course, that's not saying much.''
Mr. Holovaty said that, unlike Silicon Valley where executives and developers from other companies know one another and their businesses, he often eats lunch with an executive from the technology scene here who doesn't know other executives.
''It's been more focused on the suits rather than hackers and geeks,'' he said.
Still, at a time when investors are looking for a return and perhaps are more cautious about financing projects, Chicago may be more attractive. ''In Silicon Valley, a lot of people swing for the fences,'' said Alan Warms, founder and chief executive of Chicago-based Appolicious, which connects consumers to popular iPhone applications and works with companies on mobile strategies.
''People here start off saying they want to create a sustainable business,'' Mr. Warms said. ''If I can create an ongoing business, it leads to a little more sobriety.''

HEADLINE: After 30 Years, Preserving Nuns' Legacy

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
There is no way that Flor Lazo could have memories of the unspeakable crime that rocked her homeland, El Salvador, on a distant Dec. 2. That monstrous deed -- the torture, rape and murder of four American churchwomen by a military death squad -- took place in 1980, a brutal time in El Salvador. Ms. Lazo was not born until five years later.
Yet she feels connected to the victims. How could she not? New to this country, she is taking the first steps toward getting a command of English in classes held at a social services center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that bears the names of two of the churchwomen, Maura Clarke and Ita C. Ford. Both were Maryknoll nuns from New York City. 
Ms. Lazo's English is rudimentary. It was in Spanish that she told how she had let her mother know where she was studying. The mother's flash of recognition was instant. ''Yes,'' she said to her daughter, ''I remember that day when they were murdered.''
Others do as well. For many Catholics -- certainly for women who have dedicated their lives to the church -- the Dec. 2 anniversary brings back clear memories of where they were 30 years ago, just as people can tell you exactly what they were doing when they heard that John F. Kennedy had been shot or that the twin towers had fallen. Thursday, for some, was given to prayers for the four victims, who included Dorothy Kazel, an Ursuline nun, and Jean Donovan, a lay missionary.
Naturally, the day had special resonance at the Maura Clarke-Ita Ford Center, in a building on Menahan Street that is primarily a Roman Catholic school.
The nuns had gone to El Salvador to work with the poor. The Bushwick center does the same. Like many nonprofit organizations in these rough times, it has been forced to swim extra hard to keep its head above water. It helps new immigrants, most of them women from Spanish-speaking countries, to acquire job skills, get business pointers and -- the essential -- learn English.
Janet Marcic, the center's executive director, bent one of her own rules by letting Ms. Lazo speak Spanish. ''I try to encourage them to speak only English, short of a fire or some other emergency,'' Ms. Marcic said. ''They're comfortable in Spanish.'' The point is not to make them comfortable. It is to get them to learn.
The rules were relaxed again on Thursday for a memorial ceremony held in both languages. It ended with a prayer for the murdered women: ''Their lives challenge us to hear the urgent cry for justice in our world.''
That theme resounded the night before in an auditorium at St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights. There, 11 singers dressed in black performed ''Resilient Souls,'' a new oratorio by the composer and writer Elizabeth Swados.
A DECADE ago, on the 20th anniversary of the murders, Ms. Swados wrote an opera called ''Missionaries,'' focused on the lives of the four churchwomen. Her new hourlong work, which will also be performed this weekend in Manhattan and Queens, turns more on the lasting impact that the deaths had on others. It echoes with reflections on social and economic justice, a concept that seems to receive less emphasis from the church hierarchy today than concerns about matters like who wakes up in the morning next to whom.
''It's like a piece of cloth,'' Ms. Swados said, describing the oratorio to an audience of about 70 people. ''It's woven between the past and the present,'' all the while asking, ''Did the tragedy change the world?''
The deaths surely affected her, she said in an interview. ''They were regular women who really had guts,'' she said. ''At that time, it was very important to me as a person but also as an artist.''
She was captivated, too, by the denunciations of social injustice delivered back then by the Salvadoran archbishop, Oscar Romero, who was assassinated while celebrating Mass several months before the churchwomen were killed. ''I was just taken with his words and his courage,'' Ms. Swados said. And though she is Jewish, she said those Catholic women and the archbishop ''stood up for something that I believe in and I've never forgotten.''
Christine Morrison, the board chairwoman at Maura Clarke-Ita Ford, said Ms. Swados had told her more than once about ''the responsibility she feels to keep their legacy alive.''
''She says this is her mitzvah,'' Ms. Morrison said, using the Hebrew word for a good deed. ''She says it's a 30-year one.''

HEADLINE: Russia and Qatar Expand Soccer's Global Footprint

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN; Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from Moscow and Julia Werdigier from London.

 BODY:
The world's biggest sporting event continued its spread to new corners of the globe Thursday as Russia and Qatar were named as hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup soccer tournaments.
The fallout from the announcements in Zurich included a setback in soccer development for the United States, which lost its attempt to host the 2022 World Cup despite having an apparently superior technical bid. That tournament was awarded instead to Qatar, the tiny oil-rich nation in the Persian Gulf, meaning the World Cup will make its inaugural appearance in the Middle East.
''We go to new lands,'' Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, the sport's world governing body, told Reuters. ''Never has the World Cup been in Russia and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East and Arabic world has been waiting for a long time. So I'm a happy president when we talk about the development of football.''
FIFA is an insular body, frequently criticized for its lack of transparency. Thursday's votes by FIFA's executive committee were conducted in secret. It was impossible to discern fully the motives of Blatter and his colleagues. 
Some soccer officials believe Blatter is angling for a Nobel Peace Prize, having now orchestrated the awarding of the World Cup to South Africa in 2010, and soon to Russia and the Middle East, even if his chances of winning such an award might seem remote.
Surely, Thursday's votes reflected in part some murky internal FIFA politics. No doubt, too, Blatter has some sincere interest in taking his sport's grandest spectacle to all parts of the world.
The votes came amid recent news media accusations of corruption involving 6 of the 24 members of FIFA's executive committee. Two were barred from voting. Some observers called for a delay in the votes, saying their legitimacy had been compromised by accusations of vote selling.
American soccer officials had hoped to prevail with a bid that promoted the country's diversity, the potential for record attendance and record profits for FIFA, and the fact that all stadiums and necessary infrastructure were already built.
But perhaps FIFA officials felt they had sufficiently assisted the United States by giving it the 1994 World Cup.
And some observers felt that American bid officials lacked passion in explaining how a second World Cup would expand the game in the United States, which has not fully embraced the sport. FIFA had also expressed some concerns about a lack of federal government guarantees, one apparently having to do with its tax liability in the United States.
Eric Wynalda, a former star American forward and now a television commentator, suggested on Fox Soccer Channel that Qatar had in effect bought the World Cup in a triumph of money over merit. Perhaps he was referring to remarks in October by Michel Zen-Ruffinen, a former secretary general of FIFA, that Qatar was seeking to trade votes with the combined Spain/Portugal bid for 2018 to enhance both candidacies.
Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, said in a conference call from Zurich: ''Obviously, we're very disappointed with the outcome. We submitted what we think technically is a very good bid.''
He then congratulated Qatar, which has never played in the World Cup, and declined to make accusations of corruption in the bidding process.
Thursday's votes amounted to an election, Gulati said, adding: ''This isn't only about technical reports. A lot goes into that. In this case, it was a new part of the world.''
Qatar, with 1.7 million people, only 300,000 of whom are citizens, is the smallest nation to host a World Cup. But with one of the world's fastest-growing economies, it won with a bid that urged FIFA officials to make history as well as money. The success of the 2010 tournament, which was held in Africa for the first time, apparently further emboldened FIFA officials to continue to take its grandest spectacle to yet another part of the world, something that places soccer's vision far ahead of the Olympics.
''Thank you for believing in change,'' Qatar's emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, told FIFA officials.
Others bidding for 2022 were Australia, Japan and South Korea.
The head of Qatar's winning bid, Sheik Mohammed bin Hamad al-Thani, suggested Wednesday that the World Cup would help improve the Arab image internationally, while assuaging anti-Islamic feeling that has grown since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The 2022 World Cup will ''present a new image of the Middle East -- far away from cliches and closer to reality,'' bin Hamad al-Thani said.
Qatar's bid overcame concerns about heat that can reach 120 degrees there in the summer. Officials say they will build air-conditioned stadiums, spending $4 billion to upgrade three arenas and build nine new ones in a compact area connected by a subway system. Qatari officials have also said they will spend $50 billion on transportation and other infrastructure. After the 2022 World Cup, Qatar plans to dismantle its stadiums and give them to poorer countries.
Meanwhile, the defeated United States has now lost successive bids to host a major international sporting event. Chicago lost its bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, which were awarded to Rio de Janeiro. The World Cup bid failed even though it had support from President Obama and from former President Bill Clinton, who was honorary chairman of the bid committee.
When asked about Qatar's being awarded the 2022 tournament, Obama said, ''I think it was the wrong decision,'' but he added that he was confident the United States team would acquit itself well wherever it played.
Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's prime minister, did not travel to Zurich before Thursday's votes, obliquely accusing England, a rival bidder for 2018, of trying to undermine the voting process. This was an apparent reference to news media reports emanating from London that accused some FIFA officials of being willing to sell their votes.
After Russia won the 2018 World Cup, though, Putin said he would travel to Zurich to thank FIFA.
''This decision shows that Russia is trusted,'' Putin told reporters as he left Moscow.
President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who typically enjoys gadgets more than sports, said in a Twitter message: ''Hurray! Victory!''
Russia, which will also host the 2014 Winter Olympics, prevailed Thursday over England and joint bids by Spain/Portugal and the Netherlands/Belgium. Russia views the World Cup as a chance to help the country continue to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Concerns about a lack of infrastructure and travel in the far-flung country were apparently ameliorated in the bidding process.
Russia proposed to host the tournament in 13 cities grouped in four clusters. And Putin has said that visitors will not need travel visas. Match tickets will apparently serve as visas, as they did when the 2008 Champions League final was held in Moscow.
''Yes, we don't have the right infrastructure yet,'' said Igor Shuvalov, the Russian first deputy prime minister, who led the delegation. ''But we can overcome all difficulties. Let's create history together.''
Coupled with Russian elation, however, was disappointment from the other candidate countries, particularly in England, which had gained renewed confidence over the last 24 hours that its bid might be successful after Prince William, Prime Minister David Cameron and David Beckham flew to Zurich for some last-minute lobbying.
''What a killer,'' said Duncan Townsend, manager of No. 1 Sports Bar in London's financial district, where crowds had gathered to watch the vote. ''I was so looking forward to it. We have the passion and the infrastructure. It's a real shame.''
In 1994, the United States hosted what is widely considered the most successful World Cup. Some 3.6 million fans attended the matches, still a record number. The 2022 World Cup bid projected that as many as five million tickets would be sold. Gulati also projected that $1 billion in corporate sponsorships might be available in the United States by then, along with $1 billion in television rights fees paid by English- and Spanish-language networks.
Gulati has also said that the cumulative American television audience for the 2022 World Cup could be 200 million, double the viewers who watched the 2010 World Cup from South Africa.
Officials of Major League Soccer, the North American professional league that just completed its 15th season, had hoped to gain enhanced visibility over the next 12 years as the 2022 World Cup approached. Officials in the soccer federation had also hoped to use the tournament to foster youth development in the inner cities.
It is too early to say whether the United States will bid on the 2026 World Cup, Gulati said. Soccer growth in the country will continue, he said, but lost Thursday was an opportunity for ''putting a foot on the accelerator and taking a big jump.''

HEADLINE: Discounts Abound for Popular Hybrid Cameras

BYLINE: By RIK FAIRLIE

 BODY:
FOR several years, camera makers have trained their engineering expertise on the sweet spot between compact point-and-shoot cameras and chunky (yet capable) D.S.L.R.'s. An ideal combination would involve a small chassis, a big image sensor, the ability to swap out interchangeable lenses and snap-simple ease of use.
Today's mirrorless interchangeable lens (MIL) cameras deliver all that and more. They provide high-quality photos, particularly in low lighting, by employing large image sensors. To economize on size, these cameras omit the space-hogging pentaprism and mirror found in traditional D.S.L.R. cameras, resulting in a chassis that is comparatively small and lightweight.
And camera makers have taken great care to ensure that MIL cameras are amateur-friendly, with point-and-click ease of use and creative shortcuts, while maintaining full manual operation for camera control freaks. 
Olympus and Panasonic introduced the first mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras in 2008 under the Multi Four Thirds format. Shortly thereafter, Samsung introduced its own version of a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, and earlier this year Sony brought out its slick take on the hybrid ideal.
While many of these cameras were initially priced upward of $800, that's starting to change.
MIL cameras have been on a gentle downward cost curve that is becoming steeper as the holidays approach. Today some hybrids have dipped below $500, and manufacturers and analysts agree that discounts will intensify as the holidays draw near.
''If you want to buy a new camera, this is the year to do it,'' said Chris Chute, research manager of IDC's worldwide digital imaging practice. ''You'll find the best prices in a long time, particularly considering the value you're getting.''
Despite the lingering grip of the economic recession, consumers are snapping up detachable lens cameras. Sales of D.S.L.R.'s are up 20 percent this year, while inexpensive point-and-shoots are down 5 percent, according to the research firm NPD Group. (MIL cameras are included in the D.S.L.R. category and account for 5 percent of sales, up from 1 percent last year.)
The interest in detachable lens cameras is typically attributed to the fact that 80 percent of households in the United States already own a point-and-shoot camera. Yet another, less discussed factor may be at play: When given a judicious pitch, a more capable (and aesthetically pleasing) camera can meet the crucial ''wife acceptance factor.''
''In this economy it is interesting to see people investing in things that are important to the family,'' said Liz Cutting, executive director and senior imaging analyst at NPD Group. A largely male audience is driving sales of higher-end cameras, she said, ''because it's something they can buy without feeling guilty, since they can justify the purchase as a contribution to their family.''
Some people, including Mr. Chute of IDC, say they believe that sales of mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras may eventually outstrip those of entry-level D.S.L.R.'s.
That won't happen, however, without the participation of juggernauts like Canon and Nikon. Both manufacturers have ferociously loyal users, and their entry could significantly affect the market.
Neither will discuss plans for a mirrorless model, although it is clear that they are poised.
''We are watching this segment very quickly, and when the time is right I'm sure that we will be able to participate,'' said Chuck Westfall, a technical adviser in Canon's consumer imaging group.
Nikon is similarly oblique. ''If consumer demand grows for an alternative to compact and D.S.L.R. offerings, Nikon is extremely well positioned to innovate and offer something new,'' said Nikon's senior vice president, David Lee.
In the meantime, Canon and Nikon said their performance point-and-shoot cameras provided a viable alternative to MILs at a cost under $500. The Canon PowerShot G12 is a perennial favorite among professional photographers who want maximum control in a compact format. The Nikon P7000 is a similarly sophisticated point-and-shoot popular among hobbyists and professionals.
But for those who want the versatility of an interchangeable lens and the image quality that only a large sensor can bring, mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are well worth investigating this year. Here are our picks:
OLYMPUS PEN E-PL1 ($500 from Olympus, $500 at Amazon): The Pen E-PL1 with a 14mm-to-42mm lens (equivalent to a 28mm-to-84mm 35mm lens) is a great deal for $500. This sharp-looking Micro Four Thirds camera yields high-quality photos and enables casual photographers to achieve special effects without any knowledge of photographic terms like aperture, shutter speed or white balance. Its built-in Art Filters are entertaining and creative, and can be used in video mode as well as still photography. Olympus has a lineup of six lenses that are compatible with the E-PL1, including a new 40mm-to-150mm (80mm-to-300mm 35mm equivalent) for $300.
PANASONIC LUMIX DMC-GF1 ($900 from Panasonic, $650 at Amazon): The Lumix DMC-GF1 will be replaced by the GF2 in February, but for now it remains the most popular of Panasonic's Micro Four Thirds cameras. This sturdy little shooter, with an included 14mm-to-45mm lens (28mm-to-90mm 35mm equivalent), delivers excellent photos and snappy performance. For casual photographers, it offers features like Peripheral Defocus, which blurs the background while keeping the subject in sharp focus. Panasonic has 11 Micro Four Thirds lenses, including a new $600 Lumix G Vario 100-300 lens (200mm-to-600mm 35mm equivalent).
SONY ALPHA NEX-3 ($550 from Sony): Sony's superslick NEX-3 is the lightest MIL camera to date, at 8.4 ounces without its 18mm-to-55mm lens (27mm-to-82.5mm 35mm equivalent). Sony promotes the camera's ability to capture superior low-light photos by using a fast new processor and features like Twilight Handheld, which snaps six photos in half a second, then analyzes and layers them to achieve the best results. (Sony is so confident of the camera's ability to capture low-light photos that the NEX-3 doesn't have a built-in flash, although it ships with a small add-on unit.) The NEX-3 employs an APS-C image sensor that's about 60 percent larger than those of the Olympus and Panasonic models. Sony says it will soon ship a new 18mm-to-200mm (27mm-to-300mm 35mm equivalent), priced at $800.
SAMSUNG NX100 ($600 from Samsung): Samsung's new NX100 features a compact, comfortable chassis that ships with a 20mm-to-50mm lens (30.8mm-to-75mm 35mm equivalent). Like the Sony, it is built upon a large APS-C sensor for better low-light photography. While its i-Scene mode makes it snap-simple to point and click (and the interface is fresh and cool), the NX100 also offers a new i-Function feature that lets you turn the lens ring to adjust scenes, shutter speed, aperture and exposure compensation. For now, only two lenses are available, the 20mm to 50mm and a pancake 20mm lens. The NX100 doesn't have a built-in flash (you can purchase an add-on for $150). Travelers will appreciate a GPS add-on, due out soon, for automatic geotagging of photos.

HEADLINE: Ecuador Offers Incentives To Bring Emigrants Home

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
From a spare, second-floor office in Queens, an outpost of the Ecuadorean government offers English classes, computer training and after-school programs to immigrants building new lives in New York City. But these days, the office's busiest program works in the opposite direction -- helping Ecuadoreans go home.
The program, Welcome Home, offers an array of incentives to lure immigrants back to Ecuador: money to start new businesses, one-way airplane tickets and a waiver on import taxes and fees on any belongings they take home. 
In a battered American economy with high unemployment rates, a rising number of people are accepting the offer, Ecuadorean officials say.
The motives of the migrants vary. Some have been unable to find work; some miss their families, or want to retire at home. Some have been here for decades, while others have just arrived.
Victor Lopez, 49, is preparing to leave after 21 years. The decision was so hard, he said, that he was ''still shaking'' as he visited the government office to fill out paperwork.
Mr. Lopez is leaving for many reasons -- his hours as a restaurant manager were cut, he is tired of waiting for a green card, he has missed enough of his children's lives -- but the economy, he says, was the final straw. ''Whatever I'm making, I'm using to pay the bills,'' he said. ''I can work to survive over there, and there I can be surrounded by all my family.''
Ecuador is not the only nation to offer aid to returning countrymen. Many nations, including Ethiopia, Jamaica and Morocco, waive sizable import taxes on goods brought back. Some, like El Salvador and Mexico, offer bus fare and educational assistance to returning people deported from other countries.
But immigration experts say Ecuador stands out for its aggressive promotion of its campaign -- in New York, it advertises in bus-stop shelters and on Spanish-language television -- and for its special ministry dedicated to migrant affairs.
By no means has the program ignited an exodus. The Ecuadorean population in New York State has risen steadily over the past decade, to an estimated 175,000. But the ranks of those leaving have grown, too. Last year, the Queens office assisted 347 people with tax waivers as they left the country, more than twice as many as in 2008.
Pablo Calle runs the local arm of the program from the Casa Ecuatoriana in the Corona section of Queens. He said the office had been overwhelmed with requests for help moving back.
One recent morning, more than a dozen people -- everyone who came through the front door except a deliveryman -- wanted to register for the program or learn more about it.
''Everybody comes here,'' Mr. Calle said as the lobby chairs began to fill up.
Many in this steady stream of people, young and old, said they were finished with the scramble of immigrant life.
Luis Paramo, 32, a truck driver, said his work had dried up over the past two years. After seven years in this country, he said, he and his wife, Isabel, are planning to return to his family's home in central Ecuador. They said many friends in New York had already gone back.
''Here, you have to pay rent, buy food,'' Mr. Paramo said. ''There, I'm with family, so it's easier. I feel happy that I'm going home, but I'm scared to begin again.''
Welcome Home was started in 2007 by Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, a left-leaning economist. He had lived in Belgium and studied in the United States, and he made reaching out to expatriates a crucial plank of his election campaigns.
Mr. Calle, of the Welcome Home office in Queens, described the program as a much-needed service for weary immigrants, but also as a way to develop Ecuador, a poor Andean nation that is enjoying its most stable economic and political climate in years.
''People left because of a lack of opportunity,'' Mr. Calle said. ''To go back, we want to give them an opportunity to develop the country and their communities.''
One of the Ecuadorean government's lures is the Cucayo Fund, which has provided entrepreneurs with seed money -- up to $50,000 -- to start more than 1,900 businesses, officials said.
Mr. Lopez, the departing restaurant manager, plans to apply for a Cucayo grant and open a hotel in the city of Cuenca. But even if he does not get the money, he said, it is time to leave New York.
Since the recession began, his health benefits have been cut, his pay has dropped and his workload has increased. If he loses his job, he said, he doubts he will find another. And if the recession deepens, he fears losing what he has worked so long to achieve. Back home, he can meet his four grandchildren, and see his three sons for the first time in a decade.
''I cannot save money now,'' he said. ''The bills are the same, but the income is not the same.''

HEADLINE: Pending Home Sales Rose 10.4% In October

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people who signed contracts to buy homes rose in October, the third gain since contract signings hit a decade low.
The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that its index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes rose 10.4 percent in October. Contract signings were up in every region of the country except the West. 
Economists had expected contract signings to decline.
With the October gain, contract signings are 18.3 percent above June's index, which was at the lowest level since the private group began tracking signed contracts in 2001. Still, they remain 20.5 percent below the October 2009 level, the highest point since May 2006, before the housing market collapsed.
A year ago, potential buyers were rushing to close deals to take advantage of a federal home-buying tax credit that initially was to expire in November.
Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, said that even with the rebound in contract signings in October, housing was being held back by a number of factors from high unemployment to tighter standards on home mortgages.
''A return to more normal loan underwriting standards and removal of unnecessary underwriting fees for very-low-risk borrowers is needed and could quickly help,'' Mr. Yun said.
In a separate report, a foreclosure listing firm said that the worst summer for home sales in decades had dampened foreclosure sales.
RealtyTrac said foreclosure sales had dropped 25 percent in the July-September quarter versus activity in the April-June period, even as the average discount on distressed properties had increased.
The report on contract signings from the Realtors showed that signings were up 19.6 percent in the Northeast, 27.3 percent in the Midwest and 7.1 percent in the South. However, signings dropped 0.4 percent in the West region in October.
In a job-related report, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment aid rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 26,000, to 436,000. The previous week's claims were revised up slightly to show applications had tumbled by 31,000, to 410,000. The figures are often volatile during the weeks around the Veterans Day and Thanksgiving holidays.
Even so, the longer-term trend has shown a downward drift.
The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes volatility, fell to 431,000 last week, a two-year low.
Thursday's report also showed that the number of people continuing to collect unemployment aid rose to 4.3 million for the week ending Nov. 20.

HEADLINE: Luxury Home Contracts Fall

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Toll Brothers, the nation's largest builder of luxury homes, said on Thursday that its new-home contracts fell 27 percent in its most recent quarter from the year-earlier period. 
The results, which echo those of other large home builders in recent weeks, reflect a housing market that remains hampered by high unemployment, uncertainty over home prices and weak consumer confidence.
''Even though the unemployment rate among our buyers is about half that of the national average, many of our clients remain on the sidelines waiting for clearer signs that the economy is on the road to recovery,'' said Douglas C. Yearley Jr., Toll Brothers' chief executive.
The builder, which earned a profit with the aid of a tax benefit, said demand remained choppy, but noted that customer traffic and deposits on new contracts increased last month.
''November is typically not a strong month for sales, but certain well-located communities have sold well,'' Mr. Yearley said, citing a high-rise in Manhattan and developments near Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C.
Toll Brothers reported net income of $50.5 million, or 30 cents a share, for the period, reversing a year-earlier loss of $111.4 million, or 68 cents a share. Analysts expected a loss of 8 cents a share. The builder had a $59.9 million tax benefit in the quarter versus a tax expense of $4.7 million a year ago.
Revenue in the period, which ended Oct. 31 and was the fourth quarter of Toll Brothers' fiscal year, fell 17 percent, to $402.6 million from $486.6 million. Wall Street's forecast was $393.8 million.
Stock in Toll Brothers, which is based in Horsham, Pa., rose 41 cents, to $18.87 a share.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Fevered Ambition

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
There is something cozy and a little claustrophobic about Henry Jaglom's indulgent Hollywood satires, their characters adrift in a sea of self-involvement. Never mean-spirited or malicious, his tales of striving starlets and broken moguls are designed to amuse rather than mock, and ''Queen of the Lot'' (a sequel to his 2006 film, ''Hollywood Dreams'') is no exception. Filling the roles with friends and family and delivering a few sharp jabs to the industry's solar plexus, he mixes an exceedingly dry cocktail of fevered ambition and congealed disappointment. 
Tanna Frederick returns, now with screen name Maggie Chase but still the Iowa farm girl notable for her fame addiction and bulldozer personality. Together these traits have made her the star of a risible kung-fu franchise and the girlfriend of a moronic action hero (Christopher Rydell). Maggie wants the Old Hollywood life with none of the New Hollywood drawbacks -- like house arrest for her latest D.U.I. conviction.
A rabid narcissist who cares only about attaining more Google hits than Angelina Jolie, she appropriates the home of her slavish agent (Zack Norman) and the attention of an entire cast of handlers. ''I can't understand why I'm attracted to someone as superficial as you,'' says a morose writer (a very good Noah Wyle).
Juggling love story, jewel heist, suicide and a hilarious 12-step meeting, Mr. Jaglom displays his usual loosey-goosey style and insider wit. He's not too fussy about where he puts his camera, but who else can persuade Peter Bogdanovich to play a whiny, unemployed director, or require his heroine to flirt while spitting mouthfuls of ice cream? That's one skill even Ms. Jolie might hesitate to acquire.
''Queen of the Lot'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Pills, booze, breasts and gambling.
QUEEN OF THE LOT
Opens on Friday in New York.
Written and directed by Henry Jaglom; director of photography, Hanania Baer; edited by Ron Vignone; produced by Rosemary Marks; released by Rainbow Releasing. Running time: 1 hour 54 minutes.
WITH: Tanna Frederick (Maggie Chase), Noah Wyle (Aaron Lambert), Christopher Rydell (Dov Lambert), Peter Bogdanovich (Pedja Sapir), Dennis Christopher (Odin Johansen), Zack Norman (Kaz Naiman), Kathryn Crosby (Elizabeth Lambert), Mary Crosby (Frances Lambert Sapir) and Jack Heller (Louis Lambert).

HEADLINE: Death and Other Distress In a Town Produced by Disney

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta.

 BODY:
CELEBRATION, Fla. -- As if the Thanksgiving murder were not enough to ruin things in this subdivision that Disney designed. Now, tanks and SWAT teams?
Here in a community built 14 years ago by the Walt Disney Company as the happiest subdivision on earth -- and which, to be fair, has been largely free from urban strife -- two major crimes in the span of less than a week have made even the fake snow that blankets the town square every evening hour on the hour seem a little less cheery.
Late into Thursday night, sheriff's deputies barricaded several blocks in this neo-traditional town of 10,000 people and miles of white rail fencing, trying to talk a despondent and armed 52-year-old man out of his home. After more than 14 hours, sheriff's deputies entered his home early Friday and found him dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
Earlier, the schoolhouse near the town square was locked down. Buzzing helicopters interrupted horse-and-carriage rides. Even the holiday cocktail party at the golf course was canceled.
The situation, which a sheriff's deputy described as a domestic dispute involving a father who had lost a job and his marriage, was a tragic ending to a week that saw another violent death in Celebration.Sometime over Thanksgiving weekend, Matteo Patrick Giovanditto, 58, was murdered, the Osceola County Sheriff's Office said. It was the first murder in Celebration history. Concerned neighbors who had not heard from him went into his first-floor condo, one block from the artificial ice rink on the town square. He was on the floor covered with a blanket, according to the police.
Officers later located his black Corvette in a nearby town, but have yet to make an arrest. Residents were assured that there was nothing to fear.
''They've got some really substantial leads,'' said a sheriff's spokeswoman, Twis Lizasuain. ''We haven't disclosed what we found, but it was a big break in the case to find the vehicle.''
Mr. Giovanditto, who was from Massachusetts, moved to Florida in the 1980s to teach, his cousin, Theresa Troiano, said from Tewksbury, Mass.
''He was a wonderful young man from a big New England family,'' she said. ''We hope there is swift justice.''
Mr. Giovanditto moved to Celebration in 2004. He lived with his Chihuahua, Lucy, neighbors said. His house was a popular destination for trick-or-treaters, and he frequently weighed in on the Front Porch, a kind of Facebook for Celebration residents.
''He was a good guy online,'' said Alex Morton, the publisher of the monthly Celebration Independent and one of the first people to buy a house when the subdivision opened in 1996.
''This town is all corporate executives and golden parachuters,'' said Mr. Morton, who was holding up the printing of his paper until he had more news on the murder and, now, the standoff happening a few blocks from his tiny newspaper office.
The killing of Mr. Giovanditto was a crack in the facade of this community, a 10-minute drive from Disney World, that was just too hard to ignore -- especially with the standoff coming right on its heels.
''It's like Manhattan!'' said Vince Cassaro. He ought to know. The former Connecticut resident worked in New York City before moving his family here 12 years ago.
Had residents ever seen a SWAT team in town before?
''Maybe for the Boy Scouts when they do a display, but that's about it,'' said Jeffry Ewing, a resident who had to stop work on a house renovation that was within the police perimeter.
Of course, there have been other indications here that the ride might be over. Smaller crimes are not unheard of. In 1998, a robber who said he had a gun threatened a family and robbed them in their home. It was the town's first reported violent crime.
The economy has taken some of the shine from the streets, too. On Thanksgiving Day, the movie theater, which proudly showed its share of Disney films, went out of business. And there is no one who has not been hoping that home prices stop dropping. At their peak, homes sold for an average of $712,000. Now, they might go for half that.
Glenn Williams, who was watching the sheriff's deputies block the roads, said the price of his house had fallen to about $360,000 now from $825,000 two years ago.
Like others, he was sad for the families involved in the standoff and the murder.
''But I'm surprised it's been this long before something happened,'' Mr. Williams said.
For visitors who come to both gawk and admire the famously perfect community, the murder only added to the narrative.
Beth Guskay drove in from Lakeland, Fla., Thursday with her daughter and granddaughter to shop and hit a favorite sushi restaurant.
''I call it the 'Stepford Wives' community. As soon as you drive in, it's creepy,'' she said. ''I think it's for people who don't think anything bad is ever going to happen to them.''
It is not that, so much, residents said. Bad things happen everywhere.
Still, a murder and a standoff in the same week are a little much.
''It's a crack in the foundation, let's put it that way,'' said Jim Zimmer, who with his wife of 25 years maintains a house both in Celebration and Atlanta.
He made a case for downplaying the murder, even as he watched a sheriff's deputy with a rifle shoo a woman trying to get to her car back into her home.
''For our own property values,'' he said, ''we need the illusion.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 3 about the first murder in Celebration, Fla., a community built 14 years ago by the Walt Disney Company, referred incorrectly to the average sales price of homes there when the real estate market peaked. The median sales price in Celebration peaked at $712,000 in 2006, according to Trulia, a Web site that aggregates real estate listings. The average sales price was not $1 million.

HEADLINE: Dwindling Prospects

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The longer people stay out of work, the more trouble they have finding new work.
That is a fact of life that much of Europe, with its underclass of permanently idle workers, knows all too well. But it is a lesson that the United States seems to be just learning.
This country has some of the highest levels of long-term unemployment -- out of work longer than six months -- it has ever recorded. Meanwhile, job growth has been, and looks to remain, disappointingly slow, indicating that those out of work for a while are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Even if the government report on Friday shows the expected improvement in hiring by business, it will not be enough to make a real dent in those totals.
So the legions of long-term unemployed will probably be idle for significantly longer than their counterparts in past recessions, reducing their chances of eventually finding a job even when the economy becomes more robust. 
''I am so worried somebody will look at me and say, 'Oh, he's probably lost his edge,' '' said Tim Smyth, 51, a New York television producer who has been unable to find work since 2008, despite having two decades of experience at places like Nickelodeon and the Food Network. ''I mean, I know it's not true, but I'm afraid I might say the same thing if I were interviewing someone I didn't know very well who's been out of work this long.''
Mr. Smyth's anxieties are not unfounded. New data from the Labor Department, provided to The New York Times, shows that people out of work fewer than five weeks are more than three times as likely to find a job in the coming month than people who have been out of work for over a year, with a re-employment rate of 30.7 percent versus 8.7 percent, respectively.
Likewise, previouseconomicstudies, many based on Europe's job market struggles, have shown that people who become disconnected from the work force have more trouble getting hired, probably because of some combination of stigma, discouragement and deterioration of their skills.
This is one of the biggest challenges facing policy makers in the United States as they seek to address unemployment. Its underlying tenet -- that time exacerbates the problem -- means that the longer Congress squabbles about how to increase job growth, the more intractable the situation becomes. This, in turn, means Washington would need to pursue more aggressive (and, perversely, more politically difficult) job-creating policies in order to succeed. Even reaching an agreement over whether to extend benefits yet again has proved contentious.
Several factors lead to this downward spiral of the unemployed.
In some cases, the long-term unemployed were poor performers in their previous positions and among the first to be terminated when the recession began. These people are weak job candidates with less impressive resumes and references.
In other instances, those who lost jobs may have been good workers but were laid off from occupations or industries that are in permanent decline, like manufacturing.
But economists have tried to control for these selection issues, and studies comparing the fates of similar workers have also shown that the experience of unemployment itself damages job prospects.
If jobless workers had been in sales, for instance, their customers might have moved on. Or perhaps the list of contacts they could turn to for leads is obsolete. Mr. Smyth, for example, says that so many of his former co-workers have been displaced that he is no longer sure whom to call on about openings.
In particularly dynamic industries, like software engineering, unemployed workers might also miss out on new developments and fail to develop the skills required.
Still, this explanation probably applies to only a small slice of the country's 6.2 million long-term unemployed.
''I can't imagine very many occupations and industries are of the type that if you're out for nine months, the world passes you by,'' said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization. ''I think this erosion-of-skills idea is way overplayed. It's probably much more about marketability.''
Many unemployed workers fret about how to explain the yawning gaps on their resumes. Some are calling themselves independent ''consultants'' or ''entrepreneurs.''
Mr. Smyth has been working on his own documentary film and trying to develop ideas for new TV shows with a friend. But with financing for such projects scarce, he says he is still looking for a full-time job.
Employers are reluctant to acknowledge any bias against the jobless, and many say they try to take broader economic circumstances into consideration.
''Generally speaking, when the economy's good and someone's been out of work for a year, you might look at them funny,'' said Jay Goltz, who owns five small businesses in Chicago and contributes to a small-business blog for The Times. ''These days I don't know if you can hold it against somebody.''
Even so, old habits die hard, especially because unemployment has been unusually concentrated among a smaller group of workers in this recent recession than in previous ones, meaning that fewer workers bear the scarlet ''U'' of unemployment.
''From what I've seen, employers do tend to get suspicious when there's a long-term gap in people's resumes,'' said James Whelly, deputy director of work force development at the San Francisco Human Services Agency. ''Even though everyone on an intellectual level knows that this is a unique time in the economy, those old habits are hard to break with hiring managers and H.R. departments who are doing the screening.''
It does not help when job seekers are repeatedly rejected -- or worse, ignored. Constant rejection not only discourages workers from job-hunting as intensively, but also makes people less confident when they do land interviews. A Pew Social Trends report found that the long-term unemployed were significantly more likely to say they had lost some of their self-respect than their counterparts with shorter spells of joblessness.
''People don't have money to keep up appearances important for job hunting,'' said Katherine S. Newman, a sociology professor at Princeton. ''They can't go to the dentist. They can't get new clothes. They gain weight and look out of shape, since unemployment is such a stressful experience. All that is held against them when there is such an enormous range of workers to choose from.''
Though economists generally agree that getting the long-term unemployed back to work quickly is necessary to keep people from becoming unemployable, the mechanism to do so is unclear.
Most forms of stimulus try to create business conditions that foster the nation's output growth, which encourages companies to hire. Output has been growing slowly, however, and has not stoked much job creation. There have also been other indirect incentives, like a small tax break for hiring unemployed workers, but as yet their effectiveness is unknown.
Direct employment programs -- like the public works projects of the New Deal and World War II -- may be the fastest way to put people back to work, economists say. But those raise concerns of crowding out businesses and displacing other workers. Also the approach, which smacks of socialism to some, seems politically untenable at the moment.
One possible compromise might be broader-scale retraining and apprenticeship programs, suggests Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard.
''That's better than having more people just go on disability as a last resort, and then basically never return to work in their life, which many will do,'' he said. The Obama administration has recently thrown its support behind an effort to overhaul community college retraining programs.
''One of the reasons to focus on training for workers, even if you're not training workers for new jobs, is that when you have workers who have not been in a job for a long time, you need to do all you can to get them to look and feel job-ready when the openings do eventually come back,'' said Betsey Stevenson, the Labor Department's chief economist.
The real threat, economists say, is that America, like some of its Old World peers, may simply become accustomed to a large class of idled workers.
''After a while, a lot of European countries just got used to having 8 or 9 percent unemployment, where they just said, 'Hey, that's about good enough,' '' said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''If the unemployment rates here stay high but remain relatively stable, people may not worry so much that that'll be their fate this month or next year. And all these unemployed people will fall from the front of their mind, and that's it for them.''

HEADLINE: Nigeria Plans To Charge Cheney in Case Of Bribery

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) -- Nigeria's anticorruption police said Thursday that they planned to file charges against former Vice President Dick Cheney in a $180 million bribery case involving a former unit of the oil services firm Halliburton. 
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission summoned the country chief of Halliburton on Tuesday and last week raided its Lagos office and detained 10 staff members.
''We are filing charges against Cheney,'' said Femi Babafemi, a commission spokesman. But he declined to give further details on what the charges were, or where they would be filed.
The Houston-based engineering firm KBR, a former unit of Halliburton, pleaded guilty last year to charges in the United States that it paid $180 million in bribes between 1994 and 2004 to Nigerian officials to secure $6 billion in contracts for the Bonny Island liquefied natural gas project in the Niger Delta.
Mr. Cheney was the chief executive of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000, when he resigned to run for vice president.
KBR and Halliburton reached a $579 million settlement in the United States. But Nigeria, France and Switzerland have conducted their own investigations into the case.
Halliburton split from KBR in 2007 and has said that its current operations in Nigeria are unrelated. It has described the raid last week as ''an affront against justice,'' said its offices were ransacked, and pledged to defend its staff against what it said were ''completely false and outrageous actions.''
The company said in a statement last week that ''one of the participants'' in the Bonny Island project ''was a subsidiary of Halliburton Company for part of that period of time,'' but that Halliburton's oil field services ''have never in any way been any part'' of that project.

HEADLINE: Caustic U.S. Views of Berlusconi Churn Italy's Politics

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO and CELESTINE BOHLEN; Rachel Donadio reported from Rome, and Celestine Bohlen from Paris. Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome.

 BODY:
ROME -- In his dealings with American diplomats, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy has often said that he wants his country to be ''the best friend of the United States.'' In cables to Washington, American diplomats added a few caveats.
Preparing President Obama for a meeting with Mr. Berlusconi in June 2009, Elizabeth Dibble, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Rome, warned that some in the American government regarded the Italian leader as ''feckless, vain and ineffective as a modern European leader.'' Dealing with him, she said, ''requires a careful balance of close consideration.'' 
Such caustic characterizations -- revealed in a cache of leaked diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks and released to various news organizations -- caused a firestorm in Italy this week. They could further weaken the prime minister ahead of a Dec. 14 parliamentary showdown that could decide the fate of his government. Critics of Mr. Berlusconi are using the revelations to support their calls for his resignation. Experts say that he may yet win the vote but that his infighting government is not expected to last long, certainly not through its full term, which ends in 2013.
While experts said the revelations seemed unlikely to damage the close relations between Italy and the United States, they nevertheless could have a profound impact on Mr. Berlusconi's image and reputation -- long the core of his political strength.
''Now he can no longer claim that he is well respected and supported by the U.S. and that he vouches for the trans-Atlantic alliance,'' said Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome. ''Now he can no longer use that in domestic politics.''
Yet in a country with a wide divergence between what people say in public and in private and where saving face is a national art, some Italian commentators argued -- privately -- that the leaks reflected far worse on the United States for allowing a security breach that essentially hung their confidential sources out to dry.
Some American diplomats in Italy acknowledged that their sources were already more reluctant to speak candidly with them.
In an effort at damage control, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Berlusconi on Wednesday on the margins of a summit meeting in Kazakhstan, telling him Italy was the ''best friend'' of the United States.
In the cables, American diplomats describe Mr. Berlusconi, 74, as both a canny survivor of Italian politics, his own gaffes and steamy scandals, and a sometimes erratic partner on the international scene, ready to commit Italian soldiers to Afghanistan, but wobbly on critical issues like trade with Iran and relations with Russia.
''Our relationship with Berlusconi is complex,'' Ms. Dibble wrote. ''He is vocally pro-American and has helped address our interest on many levels in a manner and to a degree that the previous government was unwilling or unable to do.'' Yet, the diplomat noted, there are other areas where Mr. Berlusconi ''seems determined to be best friends with Russia, sometimes in direct opposition to American, and even European Union, policy.''
It was noted that Mr. Berlusconi had criticized the American missile defense project, eastward expansion of NATO and support for Kosovo's independence as ''provocations of Russia.'' Virtually alone among European leaders, he defended Russia's military push into Georgia during the August 2008 war and has backed joint energy projects between Gazprom in Russia and the Italian energy company ENI, at a time when the European Union is pushing for less dependence on Russian gas.
Mr. Berlusconi's ties with Russia and Vladimir V. Putin, its former president and current prime minister, are clearly a subject of American concern. Mrs. Clinton's office sent off questions to the American Embassies in Rome and Moscow, asking for anything that might cast light on the relationship. ''What personal investments, if any, do they have that might drive their foreign and economic policies?'' the cable asked.
Italy's cooperation on American-led sanctions against Iran has also fallen short of public promises, diplomats reported. ''The Italians want to have it both ways: they want to be seen as playing a leadership role in the international effort to ratchet up sanctions on Iran, while also wanting to leave the door open to future business deals for Italian companies,'' said a cable sent by the embassy on Feb. 10 this year.
Diplomats in recent encounters have found the Italian leader tired and weakened by a spate of scandals and a souring political atmosphere: in one meeting with the ambassador, he fell asleep. Writing about a lunch with Mr. Berlusconi in Milan last Dec. 30, soon after the Italian leader had been hit in the face with a model of the Milan cathedral, the ambassador said Gianni Letta, Mr. Berlusconi's top adviser and a longstanding confidant of American diplomats, was clearly assuming the ''position as co-regent.''
Mr. Letta offers a frank assessment of the Berlusconi government. In a cable from October 2009, he is said to describe Mr. Berlusconi as ''physically and politically weak,'' a statement that in the current unstable political climate comes across as particularly damning to Mr. Berlusconi, who places a profound value on personal loyalty.

HEADLINE: Some Democrats Count on 'Millionaires' Strategy on Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chances of Congress allowing income tax rates to go up only for millionaires: slim. The chances of Democrats using ''tax cuts for millionaires'' as a political bludgeon against Republican lawmakers: game on.
For several months, Democrats have railed against Republicans intent on extending all the Bush-era income tax cuts, accusing them of doling out ''tax cuts for the rich.'' They said it on the floor of the House and the Senate, and they had their people repeat and jam the idea into every news release and Twitter message they could. 
But now, faced with the likelihood that their generalized populist argument will not be enough to hold the line, some Senate Democrats are offering a new approach, and with it a new and more targeted buzz phrase.
In search of a compromise with Republicans, they are offering to extend the tax cuts for income up to $1 million, rather than the $250,000 per couple limit originally sought by President Obama. And to those Republicans who are resisting the idea, they are hurling the phrase ''tax cuts for millionaires.''
For Democrats, short on time and political mojo, the hope is that the phrase can define the debate with the same semiotic impact as ''death tax,'' the coinage used to considerable effect by conservatives in their drive to slash and eliminate the federal estate tax.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, began to float the idea of the millionaires' tax cut a few weeks ago. He is pressing it on what he sees as the substantive merits, but sees it as well as an example of how the way a policy is framed can determine its political viability.
''Just as the death tax sort of put Democrats on the defensive on the estate tax,'' Mr. Schumer said in a telephone interview, ''the millionaires' tax is putting the Republicans on the defensive on tax policy.'' He added, ''I think it is a potent issue with the public.''
On the floor of the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, he taunted, cajoled and politely begged his Republican colleagues to join him in supporting the new income cutoff, but none took the bait. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, took the floor Thursday morning to reiterate that his caucus would accept tax increases on no one, and cited Democrats who agreed with him.
But many Democrats are adopting Mr. Schumer's language. In a news release about the expiration of unemployment benefits this week, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said, ''At the same time that they deny assistance for out-of-work Americans, Republicans are pushing for more tax breaks for millionaires.''
Republicans have spent much of this week answering the charge.
''They are trying to create class warfare,'' said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina. ''But I don't care who they take it from. It's still money out of the private sector.''
But will the slogan have negative impact? ''We'll see,'' Mr. DeMint said with a smile, before dashing down a hallway.
Democrats are planning to stage votes to force Republicans to go on record supporting the high-end tax cuts and to use the outcome to cast Republicans as putting the interests of millionaires ahead of other priorities, like reducing the deficit and providing additional benefits to the unemployed.
How it will end is anyone's guess, though it seems increasingly likely that Democrats, unable to set an income ceiling that Republicans would accept and unwilling to blink and let all tax cuts expire, will agree to a temporary extension of the tax cuts at all income levels in return for concessions on some other issues.
But using votes cast by Republican senators -- some of them millionaires themselves -- as a blunt instrument of class rage is something Democrats hope will have legs beyond the lame-duck session that ends this month.
The strategy is hardly a slam-dunk, largely because it is late. Republicans have framed any eliminated tax cut as a pro forma increase. As such, failing to extend the current rates for millionaires may well be seen as less a cut for rich people than a tax increase on someone.
''The problem with that is that it seems so calculated now,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who is widely credited for popularizing the term ''death tax'' in the 1990s in reference to the estate tax.
''The issue with the death tax is that it tied the tax to the name of the event that caused it to be triggered,'' Mr. Luntz said, which ''tax cut for millionaires'' lacks.
While nearly all Republicans rallied around the ''death tax'' slogan to push for elimination of the estate tax -- an issue that continues to be fought over even today -- Democrats are not quite so united behind the ''millionaires' tax cut'' idea.
Some Senate Democrats support extension of the high-end tax cuts on the grounds that it is a bad idea to raise taxes on anyone when the economy remains so fragile. Many liberals say that the $1 million threshold is too high and that Democrats should fight to hold the line at the $250,000 level originally set by Mr. Obama.
Mr. Schumer is still counting on a potential bumper sticker. ''This is not just the issue for the moment,'' he said, ''This will be an issue for the next two years.''

HEADLINE: Congress Sends Child Nutrition Bill Championed by Mrs. Obama to President to Sign

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress gave final approval on Thursday to a child nutrition bill that expands the school lunch program and sets new standards to improve the quality of school meals, with more fruits and vegetables.
Michelle Obama lobbied for the bill as a way to combat obesity and hunger. About half of the $4.5 billion cost is financed by a cut in food stamps starting in several years.
Mrs. Obama said she was thrilled by passage of what she described as a groundbreaking piece of legislation. 
By a vote of 264 to 157, the House on Thursday passed the bill, which was approved in the Senate by unanimous consent in August. It goes now to President Obama, who intends to sign it.
On the final roll call, 247 Democrats and 17 Republicans voted for the bill. Four Democrats and 153 Republicans voted no.
Some liberal House Democrats and advocates for the poor railed against the bill in September, saying it was wrong to pay for the expansion of child nutrition programs by cutting money for food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Democrats put aside their disagreements on Thursday, after concluding that it was better to take what they could get than to gamble on their chances in the next Congress when Republicans will control the House. Mr. Obama tamped down concern by telling Democrats he would work with them to find other ways to pay for the bill, before the cuts in food stamps take effect.
''The president will do everything he can to restore these unconscionable cuts,'' said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Democrats and a few Republicans praised Mrs. Obama. ''She has been an incredible champion for our children, particularly in the areas of nutrition and obesity,'' said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Mr. McGovern, who is co-chairman of the House Hunger Caucus, said: ''Hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin. Highly processed, empty-calorie foods are less expensive than fresh nutritious foods.''
School meal programs have a major impact on the nation's health, and supporters of the bill said it could reduce the prevalence of obesity among children. The lunch program feeds more than 31 million children a day.
Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said, ''The bill sets national nutrition standards that will finally get all of the junk food infiltrating our classrooms and our cafeterias out the door.''
But Representative Paul Broun, Republican of Georgia and a physician, said: ''This bill is not about child nutrition. It's not about healthy kids. It's about an expansion of the federal government, more and more control from Washington, borrowing more money and putting our children in greater debt. The federal government has no business setting nutritional standards and telling families what they should and should not eat.''
The bill gives the secretary of agriculture authority to establish nutrition standards for foods sold in schools during the school day, including items in vending machines. The standards would require schools to serve more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products.
And for the first time in more than three decades, the bill would increase federal reimbursement for school lunches beyond inflation -- to help cover the cost of higher-quality meals. It would also allow more than 100,000 children on Medicaid to qualify automatically for free school meals.
One of the most contentious provisions of the bill regulates prices for lunches served to children with family incomes over 185 percent of the poverty level (more than $40,793 a year for a family of four).
''This provision would require some schools to raise their lunch prices,'' the Congressional Budget Office said.
Representative John Kline, Republican of Minnesota, said this provision was tantamount to a tax increase on middle-class families. The National Governors Association and local school officials objected to it as a new federal mandate.
But Margo G. Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a research and advocacy group, said: ''The price of paid lunches needs to go up. Schools are not charging enough to cover the cost. As a result, money intended to provide healthy food to low-income kids is being diverted to subsidize food for higher-income children.''
School districts that comply with the new standards can receive an additional federal payment of 6 cents for each lunch served. The National School Boards Association, representing local board members, said ''the actual increased cost of compliance'' was at least twice that amount.
The bill was written mainly by Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who lost her bid for re-election.
The bill rounds out the tenure of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. When she took the gavel in January 2007, she was surrounded by the children of House members, and she called the House to order in the name of ''all America's children.''

HEADLINE: In Critics of the Leaf, Nissan's Chief Sees Rivals Just Being Envious

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
YOKOHAMA, Japan -- Overhyped. Fanciful. Simply not viable.
Skeptics have been harsh in their appraisal of Nissan's grand plans for electric cars -- which the automaker will begin putting into practice with its all-electric Leaf compact, introduced in Japan on Friday. Critics scoff at everything from the car's limited driving range to what they consider its inflated price tag.
But Carlos Ghosn, chief executive at Nissan and its sister automaker, Renault, dismisses the scoffing as his rivals' lack of imagination -- and their envy.
''They don't have one, so it's not a surprise,'' Mr. Ghosn said in an interview here this week at Nissan headquarters. ''People who are challenged by innovation are going to fight it in the beginning,'' he said. 
Mr. Ghosn, whose stint running two global automakers has been so admired that the Obama administration courted him unsuccessfully last year to overhaul General Motors, is staking his reputation on what he calls the world's first mass-produced electric car.
The Leaf, a hatchback that the Environmental Protection agency says has a range of 73 miles on a fully charged battery, will start selling later this month for $33,600, including destination charges, in selected markets in the United States. It went on sale in Japan for about $45,120, and will be introduced to European markets next year.
The Leaf is part of a bigger mission by Mr. Ghosn to redefine a brand that has been something of a laggard in green technology, a field long dominated by Toyota and its pioneering Prius gasoline-electric hybrid.
''Nissan was a 'me too' company,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''But in electric, we're pioneers.''
Initial inventories of the Leaf will be modest. The automaker has the capacity to make 50,000 units in the first year, 20,000 of which will be allocated to the United States. Nissan has been taking reservations since earlier this year and says it already has filled its American quota.
Where Mr. Ghosn and the skeptics diverge is in forecasts for coming years, not only for the Leaf but for electric vehicles generally.
Mr. Ghosn said Nissan expected to sell at least one million units of the Leaf in its first six years -- considered a model's standard life cycle -- and recoup the company's investment within that period. In comparison, it took the Toyota Prius more than a decade from its 1997 debut to hit the one million-unit sales mark.
''We're not selling 5,000 or 10,000 cars,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''We're talking about a massive option in the market.''
Mr. Ghosn -- who splits his time between Yokohama and the Paris offices of Renault, which owns 44 percent of Nissan -- sees the Leaf as setting off a wider shift toward electric cars. Together with Renault, Nissan has spent nearly $5.3 billion since 1992 to develop the Leaf and seven other all-electric models in a joint zero-emissions project.
By 2020, Mr. Ghosn said, electric cars will account for a tenth of global auto sales.
Most industry forecasts have been far more conservative. J. D. Power, the market research company, predicts that in 2020 only 1.3 million of a projected 70.9 million cars that will be sold worldwide will be electric, fewer than 2 percent. Even the most optimistic analysts put the figure at no more than 5 percent.
The doubts about electric cars include concerns about their relatively low horsepower, the reliability of a new technology and the prospect of the batteries losing their charge on the road. The sticker-price premium of an electric car over a gasoline one will also dissuade consumers, critics say, especially now that gasoline prices have steadied.
Buyers of electric cars, the pessimists predict, will be limited to a demographic niche: high-income, environmentally conscious and early adopters of technology. ''It will be difficult to convince large numbers of consumers to switch from conventionally powered passenger vehicles,'' J. D. Power said in a report in October.
Mr. Ghosn has spent months trying to counter those concerns, one by one. He said the Leaf's traveling range between charges would meet the needs of most motorists. Volume production will bring down costs, Mr. Ghosn said, while tax credits, which Nissan says come to $7,500 in the United States, will offset some of the Leaf's price premium.
And while Mr. Ghosn acknowledged that the Leaf would not appeal to everyone, he said there was a viable target audience. ''The guy who is today driving a large pickup truck, doing a hundred miles a day -- if he doesn't come buy our electric cars, it's not a problem,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''Whom we are addressing first are environmentally conscious people who drive relatively moderate distances and really want something that's completely independent of oil.''
Those target consumers, he said, make up more than 10 percent of the market.
Mr. Ghosn's confidence is rooted partly in Nissan's strong rebound from a slump during the global economic crisis. In its most recent quarter, Nissan's net profit increased fourfold from a year earlier, prompting the automaker to raise its full-year net profit forecast to $3.2 billion, almost twice the previous estimate. It is Nissan's second turnaround under Mr. Ghosn, a Lebanese-Brazilian Frenchman who took the helm in 1999 and brought the automaker back from the brink of bankruptcy.
Mr. Ghosn cites moves by his rivals to step up their electric vehicle development as evidence that his is the right strategy. While Toyota is careful to play down the prospects of the electric car in favor of its prized hybrid technology, it has slowly broadened its electric vehicle plans, saying last month that it would expand the 2012 rollout of the electric version of its ultracompact, the iQ.
But perhaps the biggest battle is the one about to begin between the Leaf and the Volt plug-in hybrid from General Motors. The Volt went on sale this month, for $41,000 before government subsidies.
Mr. Ghosn said the Volt was not a direct competitor because it would carry a gasoline engine to kick in after 50 miles on batteries.
The biggest constraint on Leaf sales, Mr. Ghosn said, will be how many electric cars Nissan's factories can make. Over the next two years, the company, which now makes the Leaf only in Japan, plans to open assembly and battery factories in Europe, North America and Asia that will give it the capacity to make 500,000 electric vehicles a year.
But Nissan also appears to be hedging its bets. In November, it officially introduced the Infiniti M hybrid, its first mass-produced hybrid model besides the hybrid Altima sedan, which uses Toyota's technology. Analysts have warned that developing multiple powertrains could weigh on Nissan's finances.
But for this, too, Mr. Ghosn has a counterargument.
''There's demand for other types of cars -- it's not simply either-or,'' he said. ''But people who buy electric cars,'' he said, leaning forward in his chair, ''they will never ever buy another type of car again.''

HEADLINE: Insider to Fill No. 2. Job In Editorial At Time Inc.

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Time Inc. has filled its long-vacant No. 2 editorial position in a major reorganization that centralizes the management of a far-flung media empire.
The move, which will give the longtime Time Inc. editor Martha Nelson oversight of the company's fashion, entertainment and lifestyle magazines, also signals a clear line of succession should the editor in chief, John Huey, choose to retire. 
Ms. Nelson, whose title will be editorial director, will assume responsibility for a stable of magazines that have operated outside of Time Inc.'s traditional structure. Those include shelter magazines like Coastal Living, based in Birmingham, Ala., and Sunset magazine, about living in the West, based in Menlo Park, Calif.
Her appointment begins immediately. It is the most significant management change since Time Inc.'s new chief executive, Jack Griffin, took over in September from Ann S. Moore, who held the job for eight years. Ms. Moore's departure left a void of female leadership at the company's highest levels. It has never had a female editor in chief.
Ms. Nelson, 58, had been given editorial responsibility two years ago for the Time Inc. division that includes People, InStyle, Entertainment Weekly and Essence. Her enhanced portfolio represents a return to the traditional top-heavy hierarchy of editors at Time Inc., which has preferred that the editors of its magazines report to other editors and not to the company's business side.
Until now, the magazines Ms. Nelson will lead were under the oversight of Time Inc.'s business operations.
In an interview, Ms. Nelson said she felt the changes would be healthy for Time Inc.'s editors. ''Reporting to another editor is something they're all comfortable with and something that they honestly welcome because it is really the dominant culture at Time Inc.''
Ms. Nelson will report to Mr. Huey, who will retain his oversight of Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune. Ms. Nelson will not have a role managing those magazines.
The position of editorial director existed at Time Inc. as recently as three years ago, before the company reorganized its magazines around similar subject groups and gave each of those groups new management. Then the recession hit, forcing Time Inc. to initiate two rounds of layoffs and to delay revamping.
Adding a high-level -- and high-salaried -- position as the company was undergoing a significant downsizing was not an option. But now with the recession over, Mr. Huey said Time Inc. could make the move.
''Now that we're stable and growing again, it's time to return to a more traditional editorial structure where I have some help at the executive level,'' he said. ''It's a return to a postcrisis management structure.''

HEADLINE: PepsiCo Raises Its Bet on Russia

BYLINE: By JASON BUSH, CHRISTOPHER HUGHES and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
At last, some refreshing news about the movement of overseas capital to Russia. PepsiCo has agreed to buy a two-thirds stake in the juice and dairy group Wimm-Bill-Dann and is making an offer for the rest, valuing the enterprise at $5.4 billion. It's one of the largest ever foreign investments in Russia. Despite the country's notoriously tricky climate for outsiders -- consider the private equity firm TPG's travails with its investment in Lenta supermarkets -- Russia's nascent consumer market still holds attractions for acquisitive global companies.
Pepsi is familiar with the local risks. In the 1970s, it became the first Western multinational licensed to produce in the Soviet Union, and in 2008 it paid $2 billion to buy Russia's largest juice maker, Lebedyansky. The economy has struggled of late, dragging down Wimm-Bill-Dann's sales. But things have started to turn and the company's revenue is now expected to climb 20 percent in dollar terms in the current year. 
Even if the timing looks opportunistic, the deal still isn't cheap. The 32 percent premium being offered over Wimm-Bill-Dann's prebid market value is not out of line for an M.& A. deal. But taking Wimm-Bill-Dann's own forecast of $334 million of Ebitda in 2010, the acquisition values the enterprise at a lofty 16 times that figure. The return on investment in year one would be only about 3 percent, assuming the group reaches its expected $2.6 billion of revenue and holds operating margins at last year's level.
The longer-term opportunities may justify the outlay. Russia's consumer market is benefiting from changing tastes and lifestyles, not simply rising disposable incomes. Wimm-Bill-Dann originally focused on fruit juice, where its runaway success in the 1990s was an early illustration of the huge potential for Western-style consumer brands.
More recently, the company has diversified into dairy products and become a market leader. Yogurt was virtually unheard-of in Soviet days, but as Russians emulate Western lifestyles, demand has taken off. Even so, the average Russian still consumes less than half as much yogurt and fruit juice as an average American or Pole. With Pepsi's marketing might, the costly deal could pay off.
(In)efficient Markets
One lesson from recent fat data dumps relates to fat tails. Both the Federal Reserve's publication of data on its emergency credit facilities and the WikiLeaks releases of State Department messages could have caused market turmoil if they had been made public in real time. But some financial and political insiders were at least partly informed. It is a reminder that even supposedly efficient markets can't reflect unknowns -- and that information is always unevenly distributed.
The efficient market hypothesis and the formulas that are derived from it and used in Wall Street's risk management systems make the assumption that information is equally available to market participants. In the case of the Fed data, that was not the case. For instance, while Morgan Stanley's borrowing under the primary dealer credit facility totaled $61.2 billion at the peak, Citigroup's topped out at $18.6 billion. Such information on the relative illiquidity of major market participants during the crisis was valuable, yet it was available, presumably, only to the Fed and the institution concerned.
Similarly in the WikiLeaks case, the information that Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah wanted the United States to bomb Iran to eliminate its nuclear weapons program could have shocked markets if public. Yet it must have been known to senior officials in Saudi Arabia, some of whom may have had influence over substantial asset pools.
Complete openness is not the solution. There's a rationale for not immediately disclosing details of emergency lending by the Fed, since doing so might create volatility in the markets it was intended to stabilize. In any event, this is an impractical goal. Market participants would find ways to avoid disclosure in delicate cases.
Instead, market theory and risk management techniques should be adapted to reflect that not all information is public and that private information in particular is unevenly spread around. The immediate implication is that some ''market'' prices are false because not all relevant facts are widely known. It also implies that extreme events and market swings are far more likely than efficient market theory indicates. In the jargon, the tails of the distribution are fatter than conventional theory admits.

HEADLINE: British Tell How Rescue By G.I.'s Broke Down

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British government revealed details on Thursday of a harrowing attempt by American Special Forces troops to mount a nighttime rescue of a British aid worker kidnapped by the Taliban in the highlands of eastern Afghanistan, and of the woman's death when an American soldier threw a hand grenade into a gully where she was being held.
Foreign Secretary William Hague said the operation on Oct. 8 involved two American helicopters' landing in the pitch dark on ''a near-vertical incline'' at 8,000 feet. At that point, the hostage, Linda Norgrove, the regional director for a jobs program financed by the United States Agency for International Development, had been a captive for two weeks. She had been seized while on a road trip in the area. 
Mr. Hague said that the rescue plan, which had been approved by the British government, had hinged on the American troops' assaulting a series of buildings set on the mountainside, and that one of two teams was approaching a lower series of buildings ''on a narrow ledge'' when it came under Taliban fire.
''A grenade was then thrown by a member of the rescue team who feared for his own life and for those of his team,'' Mr. Hague said. At that point, he said, less than a minute had elapsed since the helicopters had landed.
It was only later, Mr. Hague said, after the team searched a group of buildings higher on the mountainside, that the soldiers returned to the scene of the first exchange of fire. There, in a gully, they found Ms. Norgrove's body, which was examined immediately by American medics.
He said a British post-mortem showed that she had died from ''fragmentation'' injuries to her head and chest caused by the grenade.
The account was notable for the unusual detail it gave of a Special Forces operation, and for the care Mr. Hague took to praise the Americans for what he described as ''an incredibly difficult operation that was carried out with the utmost courage by elite U.S. forces.'' He appeared at pains to bring closure to the episode, which appeared at its outset to have the potential for seriously jarring ties between Britain and the United States.
Prime Minister David Cameron's initial statement on Oct. 9 about Ms. Norgrove's death said she appeared to have died when one of her Taliban captors detonated a suicide vest, an account relayed to Britain by the United States command in Kabul. But within 48 hours, Mr. Cameron learned from Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, that Ms. Norgrove might have been killed by an American grenade.
Mr. Hague said his report was based on an American and British military investigation initiated by the United States Central Command at General Petraeus's request. While noting that it was ''a matter of concern that the facts of how Linda Norgrove died were not immediately made clear,'' he said the initial account was the result of the wounds to the dead Taliban fighter found beside her, which the American troops saw as similar to those sustained by suicide bombers.
Mr. Hague said the inquiry showed that the American troops reported after the operation that they had used a grenade, but that this had not been passed ''up the military chain of command,'' which discovered what happened from examining combat video images that showed a flash from the grenade. As a result, Mr. Hague said, members of the rescue team had been disciplined ''for failing to provide a complete and full account of their actions,'' a step he applauded.
John and Lorna Norgrove, Ms. Norgrove's parents, said in a statement after Mr. Hague spoke in the House of Commons that they had been briefed in detail by British and American officers involved in the military investigation and that they would withhold further comment until next week. ''We would like some time to digest this,'' they said.

BHUTTO
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
Directed by Duane Baughman and Johnny O'Hara
1 hour 51 minutes; not rated
''Bhutto,'' a documentary about Benazir Bhutto, the two-time prime minister of Pakistan who was killed while campaigning in 2007, packs an impressive amount of information about Bhutto, her family and Pakistani history into its 111 minutes. If nothing else, the directors, Duane Baughman and Johnny O'Hara, deserve praise for devoting this kind of attention to a foreign leader and to the internal politics of another country (as opposed to how those politics affect the United States).
The film's style can make the acquisition of all that data a slightly exhausting experience. Mr. Baughman is a political consultant who owns a direct-mail marketing company, and it feels as if the techniques of his day job are at work in ''Bhutto.'' Explanatory graphics and titles move by a little too quickly, and the film never stops talking: the voices of interview subjects, newscasts and Bhutto herself are woven into a nearly nonstop audioscape. 
Mr. Baughman is an admirer of his subject -- in his director's note he calls her ''so brave that she made the world take notice'' -- but the film is not a hagiography. He gives ample screen time to critics like the journalist and all-around celebrity Fatima Bhutto, the daughter of Benazir Bhutto's brother Murtaza, who has accused her aunt of complicity in the murder of Fatima's father in 1996.
The emotions that ''Bhutto'' arouses -- admiration, anger, sorrow -- are blunted by a perhaps inevitable frustration. While the film gives us a strong sense of Bhutto's personality and strength, largely through interviews with her Western friends and colleagues, it can only suggest the daily family and political machinations that were her reality, and it leaves us with no clear sense of the truth of the corruption charges that dogged her.
What it does show, with little room for doubt, is that she left a comfortable exile to return to Pakistan one last time knowing that she was probably martyring herself -- a demonstration of courage, mixed with single-mindedness, that people in the first world may find hard to comprehend. MIKE HALE
RARE EXPORTS
A Christmas Tale
Opens Friday in Manhattan.
Directed by Jalmari Helander
In Finnish and English, with English subtitles
1 hour 20 minutes; not rated
The Santa at the center of ''Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale'' is not the sort Mommy is likely to be kissing beneath the mistletoe (or anywhere else) this year. Rather, the focus of this bizarre Finnish fairy tale -- as black as anything the Brothers Grimm could have dreamed up -- is a sinister old codger who chews off ears and whose demon minion kidnaps innocent children. Ho ho no!
Drawing on ancient Scandinavian mythology, Jalmari Helander's feature debut (spun off from two of his short films) is a thing of frigid beauty and twisted playfulness. The time is just before Christmas, and the setting is northern Finland, where an American drilling operation has unearthed a mysterious block of ice sprouting a gigantic pair of horns.
Soon children from a nearby village begin to disappear, and a group of reindeer hunters finds its annual crop slaughtered in the snow. Only little Pietari (Onni Tommila) knows who's responsible; now he must persuade his gruff father (Jorma Tommila, Onni's father) to help him fight back.
Cocooned in a genuinely goose-pimply atmosphere and awash in marveling music, this Edward Gorey-meets-Joe Dante fable turns Santa (Peeter Jakobi) into a savage troll and his elves into naked, wrinkly graybeards. Kids will love the diminutive, motherless hero and a plot that's completely bonkers; adults will enjoy the exuberantly pagan images and deadpan humor. Tots, on the other hand, will probably never sit on Santa's lap again. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS
QUEEN OF THE LOT
Opens on Friday in New York.
Directed by Henry Jaglom
1 hour 54 minutes
There is something cozy and a little claustrophobic about Henry Jaglom's indulgent Hollywood satires, their characters adrift in a sea of self-involvement. Never mean-spirited or malicious, his tales of striving starlets and broken moguls are designed to amuse rather than mock, and ''Queen of the Lot'' (a sequel to his 2006 film, ''Hollywood Dreams'') is no exception. Filling the roles with friends and family and delivering a few sharp jabs to the industry's solar plexus, he mixes an exceedingly dry cocktail of fevered ambition and congealed disappointment.
Tanna Frederick returns, now with screen name Maggie Chase but still the Iowa farm girl notable for her fame addiction and bulldozer personality. Together these traits have made her the star of a risible kung-fu franchise and the girlfriend of a moronic action hero (Christopher Rydell). Maggie wants the Old Hollywood life with none of the New Hollywood drawbacks -- like house arrest for her latest D.U.I. conviction.
A rabid narcissist who cares only about attaining more Google hits than Angelina Jolie, she appropriates the home of her slavish agent (Zack Norman) and the attention of an entire cast of handlers. ''I can't understand why I'm attracted to someone as superficial as you,'' says a morose writer (a very good Noah Wyle).
Juggling love story, jewel heist, suicide and a hilarious 12-step meeting, Mr. Jaglom displays his usual loosey-goosey style and insider wit. He's not too fussy about where he puts his camera, but who else can persuade Peter Bogdanovich to play a whiny, unemployed director, or require his heroine to flirt while spitting mouthfuls of ice cream? That's one skill even Ms. Jolie might hesitate to acquire. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS
''Queen of the Lot'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Pills, booze, breasts and gambling.
MARS
Opens on Friday in Brooklyn.
Directed by Geoff Marslett
1 hour 22 minutes; not rated
Beginning with accidentally sprayed Russian mucus and ending with deliberately deployed American urine, the plot of ''Mars'' owes at least as much to bodily fluids as it does to science fiction. Low key, low budget and low energy, this animated space odyssey from the writer and director Geoff Marslett accompanies three mismatched astronauts to the red planet and the search for new life forms.
Constantly monitored by Shep (Howe Gelb) at Mission Control and a pair of perky television journalists (Liza Weil and James Kochalka), the astronauts bicker and bond. Charlie (Mark Duplass), a cocky celebrity famous for a long-ago space walk, spends most of his time bedazzling his standard-issue jumpsuit. Casey (Zoe Simpson), a gung-ho New Zealand doctor, dreams of being the first person on Mars. Meanwhile their leader, Hank (Paul Gordon), nursing a perpetually stoned affect, works on developing a personality.
Employing his own version of the rotoscoping technology used in films like ''Waking Life'' and ''A Scanner Darkly,'' Mr. Marslett (who teaches animation at the University of Texas at Austin) keeps the politics to a minimum and aims his best jokes at space-race rivalries. Maintaining an amiable and innocently awed tone, he minds his science more than his fiction, delivering a listless romance upstaged by a cute robot, dancing aliens and Kinky Friedman as a Johnny Cash-style president of the United States. At least in space no one can hear you urinate. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

HEADLINE: Governors Get Promise Of Presidential Cooperation

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
President Obama hosted a luncheon on Thursday for newly elected governors across the street from the White House at Blair House, where he promised to work closely with them to fix the economy and improve education over the next two years. 
But while Ohio's incoming Republican governor, John Kasich, was among the nearly two dozen state chief executives at the lunch, the Democrat he beat in November, Gov. Ted Strickland, was not left out in the cold. In fact, he got a personal visit with the president hours earlier in the Oval Office, the only governor singled out for such special attention.
Mr. Strickland has been an energetic ally for Mr. Obama in an important battleground state and the president campaigned for him repeatedly this fall, albeit in vain. An Oval Office visit may not be much of a consolation prize, but it was a public way for the president to show his appreciation and respect for a political friend who helped him out so much.
At the Blair House lunch, Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed to put aside partisanship and work with the governors through the many issues now confronting them. Many in the audience were, like Mr. Kasich, Republicans who unseated Democrats by running against Mr. Obama and his initiatives, and some have vowed to resist his expansion of federal programs like the new health care law.
''We have just had a very vigorously contested election, but the election is over,'' Mr. Obama told them. ''And now I think it's time for all of us to make sure that we're working together. I am a very proud Democrat, as some of you in the room are - although not as many as I had expected. Some of you are very proud Republicans. But we're all prouder to be Americans.''
Mr. Obama encouraged them to make their states ''laboratories for democracy'' but said there still must be ''basic national standards'' that everyone will have to meet. He encouraged them to tell him what works and what does not. ''Contrary to the mythology, believe it or not, it turns out that I would love to eliminate programs that don't work,'' he said. ''And you guys are the ones oftentimes who are implementing them.''
Four new governors later told White House reporters that they welcomed his promises of cooperation and acknowledged that they do not expect much financial help from Washington in meeting their own budget problems. ''None of the 50 governors are living under the illusion that there's going to be hundreds of millions more dollars coming our way,'' said Governor-elect Peter Shumlin, Democrat of Vermont.
But despite the heated rhetoric during the campaign, the governors said none of them challenged Mr. Obama directly during the closed-door portion of the meeting.
Governor-elect Dan Malloy, Democrat of Connecticut, who criticized the White House after his election last month for doing a ''particularly weak job telling its side of the story,'' told reporters Thursday that the Blair House session was cordial. ''I don't think anyone engaged the president,'' he said. ''None of us are members of the press.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Legislators Support Internet Privacy, but Question How to Do It

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers examining the Federal Trade Commission's recommendation for a ''do not track'' mechanism to restrict the monitoring of Internet users said that they supported stricter safeguards for consumer privacy, but raised questions on how the system would work.
Many also expressed concern that it would undermine one of the main pillars of the Internet's growth -- the development of free, advertising-supported content. 
Even within the F.T.C. itself, there is not unanimous support for a do-not-track effort. William E. Kovacic, a Republican commissioner who was the agency's chairman during the last year of the Bush administration, concurred with the decision to release the F.T.C. report on Wednesday. But he added that he believed the do-not-track recommendation was ''premature,'' and that the commission needed to present ''greater support for the proposition that consumer expectations of privacy are largely going unmet.''
Some Democrats in the House and the Senate, however, have already embraced the idea of a do-not-track mechanism. On Thursday, Representative Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he would introduce a bill that would put in place such a system to prevent the tracking of children using the Internet.
At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Republicans generally expressed caution with varying degrees of support for stricter privacy measures. ''We need to be mindful not to enact legislation that would hurt a recovering economy,'' said Representative Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, the leading Republican on the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection.
''While I agree it is important to have consumers understand what information is being collected and how it is used,'' Mr. Whitfield said, ''we need to seriously discuss the do-not-track model and evaluate whether it accomplishes the appropriate objectives.''
Officials from the trade commission and the Commerce Department, which is preparing its own report about online privacy for release before the end of the year, said that they had not yet seen examples of enhanced privacy measures affecting advertising revenues.
''There are more and more companies that are offering users some kind of opt-out, enhanced-notice mechanism, and I don't believe we've seen dramatic fall-off of advertising revenues as a result,'' said Daniel J. Weitzner, associate administrator for policy at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a bureau in the Commerce Department that is preparing the report.
He acknowledged that caution was required. ''I think that there are mechanisms that could be mandated that could have a dramatic impact on advertising,'' Mr. Weitzner added.
Some companies that sell advertising agreed. Joan Gillman, an executive vice president at Time Warner Cable, said in a statement to the subcommittee that ''do-not-track could hinder job creation within the advertising industry and by Web sites that rely on advertising revenues,'' as well as ''inhibit innovation and the development of new services.''
But Susan Grant, the director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said that the type of all-encompassing surveillance becoming increasingly common online would rarely be tolerated.
''If someone were following you around in the physical world -- tailing you and making note of everywhere you go, what you read, what you eat, who you see, what music you listen to, what you buy, what you watch -- you might find this disturbing,'' she said.
''On the Internet,'' she added, ''even if the tracker doesn't know your name, you are not anonymous.'' She pointed to technology like so-called cookies and other persistent, digital identifiers that ''are essentially personally identifying information.''
Putting in place a do-not- track system would probably require Congressional action. Mr. Whitfield and others also raised questions about whether the government was the best party to devise and put in place a do-not-track system. He also suggested that the collection of information about people who do not want to be followed online would itself create new privacy problems.
David Vladeck, director of the trade commission's bureau of consumer protection, responded to that concern by saying that the government would not need to be involved in managing such a system; it would only enforce its requirements.
''We're not proposing the creation of a list,'' Mr. Vladeck said. ''Nor are we proposing a centralized system managed by the federal government. While the Federal Trade Commission must be able to ensure through enforcement that a do-not-track mechanism effectively implements consumer choice, there is no need for it to be administered by the federal government.''
In addition, a do-not-track feature would be different from the national do-not-call registry in significant ways, Mr. Vladeck said. While the do-not-call registry uses a phone number as a unique identifier, there exists no such identifier for computers. Internet protocol addresses can change frequently, and consumers typically use multiple devices and Internet service providers to access online content.
There have been hints of broader support among House Republicans for stricter privacy measures, including from Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas, currently the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and who is expected to be a strong contender to become chairman of the committee.
''I want the Internet economy to prosper, but it can't unless the people's right to privacy means more than a right only to hear excuses after the damage is done,'' Mr. Barton said in a statement issued after the F.T.C. released its report on Wednesday. ''In the next Congress, the Energy and Commerce Committee and our subcommittees are going to find out if Internet privacy policies really mean anything, and if necessary, how to make them stick.''

 BODY:
Economic growth in the United States, intervention by the European Central Bank and a toning down of antiwealth sentiment from President Obama will help pave the way for a bullish market, Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors told an audience at a hedge fund conference on Thursday. 
Despite some concern about Mr. Obama's stance, Mr. Cooperman said he was confident about equities.
''When I look at financial assets... It's easy. Common stocks win by default,'' he said on a panel with several other prominent figures at the 2010 Bloomberg Hedge Fund Conference held at the Guggenheim Museum.
Seated beside him, Whitney Tilson, founder and managing partner of T2 Partners, shifted slightly in his seat. The men don't agree on the economic outlook for the United States
Mr. Tilson outlined a somewhat dire picture, calling it a ''strange market out there.''
''Looking for historical precedents is dangerous,'' he said. ''The unwinding and de-leveraging that has to take place is going to create a headwind.''
Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, sided with Mr. Cooperman on the state of the economy, taking a historical view. He cited an October 1982 article in The New York Times that covered the gloom and doom of the economy during that period. That was followed by strong performance the next few years, he said.
''I've always been a little concerned when everybody is on one side of the ship,'' he said. ''That was the case in 1982.''

HEADLINE: How Medicare Pays Physicians

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: For all the criticism of the Medicare fee schedule for payments to doctors, no one has proposed a detailed, practical alternative, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Medicare pays physicians for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries according to a fee schedule that was enacted when President George H.W. Bush signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. The schedule took effect on Jan. 1, 1992, and is in force today, after a series of modifications over time.
This fee schedule contains about 7,000 distinct nonsurgical and physician services, classified under a nomenclature based on the Current Procedural Terminology to which the American Medical Association holds jealously guarded intellectual property rights.
Readers may find it a bit odd, as do I, that the nomenclature of a government fee schedule for physicians is privately owned, which may restrict its use for research outside government and definitely does so for commercial purposes. 
One would have thought that the nomenclature of the government's fee schedule would be a pure public good, freely available to all potential users.

 History of the Fee Schedule 
The introduction of the Medicare fee schedule was a reaction to the horizontal inequities that had resulted from Medicare's previous reliance on the "usual, customary and reasonable" payment method then used by private insurers for all patients and now mainly for services procured from physicians outside the insurer's network.
Such a system naturally leads to different payments for the same service provided by different specialties and to physicians in the same specialty practicing in different geographic areas. These differences were purely haphazard and had no relation to different levels of quality of these services or their value to patients.
While such inequities have been routinely countenanced in the private insurance market, where price discrimination is the norm, they violate the constraint that government payments to providers must, above all, be seen as fair among providers and fully transparent to all.
To own up to these requirements, Medicare, under the Reagan administration, initiated in 1985 the development of a new, horizontally equitable and more easily defensible fully transparent fee schedule.
The first step was financing a large study, jointly conducted by researchers at Harvard University and at the American Medical Association, to estimate the relative amounts of "work" physicians contribute to the services they render. The definition of "physician's work" took into account the physician's time, mental effort, judgment, technical skill, physical effort and psychological stress.
The results of the Harvard-A.M.A. study, published in 1988, laid the groundwork for what is now known as the resource-based relative value scale, or, in common parlance, the R.B.R.V.S.
 How Physician Fees Are Determined 
Basically, the R.B.R.V.S. breaks down the total cost of providing a particular physician service into three components expressed in relative value units, commonly known as R.V.U.'s:
1. the physician's own "work," which accounts on average for 52 percent of the total relative costs for each service;
2. the physician's outlays for any practice resources other than his or her own time (office space, supplies, clinical and administrative staff), which accounts for an average of 44 percent of the total relative cost of a service;
3. professional liability insurance, accounting on average for 4 percent of total relative practice costs.
For a particular market area, each of these three cost components is adjusted by a geographic practice cost index that accounts for variations across market areas in the cost of living, the prices of nonphysician practice resources and malpractice premiums.
The sum of these geographically adjusted R.V.U.'s for a particular service then constitutes the total R.V.U. of that service.
Finally, to convert this schedule into a fee schedule expressed in dollars, the total R.V.U. of a given service is multiplied by a "conversion factor" - a dollar amount per R.V.U. applied to all services in the relative value schedule.
The original conversion factor, in 1992, was $31. The current one for 2010 is $36.0791. In 2001 it was as high as $38.2581 (for details, see here).
The conversion factor is updated annually according to a formula that takes into account growth in the Medicare Economic Index (a price index for medical practice inputs), a projected productivity gain thought to be achievable by all physicians and growth in gross domestic product, thought to represent the nation's ability to pay. The latter linkage is expressed by the "sustainable growth rate" formula, or S.G.R.
A more detailed description of this process - replete with a flow chart - is posted on the Web site of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.
 Criticism of the Fee Schedule 
Just like Medicare's payment system for hospitals, described in last week's post, the Medicare physician fee schedule is frequently criticized for being based on relative costs, rather than on relative values to patients.
It is a fair criticism, but it also is facile.
It is facile, because typically that criticism is not accompanied by a practical - and I stress practical - alternative. After all, no other payer has yet based physician fees on the value of services to patients. If pricing physician services according to their value to patients were easy, why would not private insurers have used that approach long ago?
Indeed, the lack of a workable alternative can explain why, for the most part, private insurers actually use Medicare's cost-based relative value scale as the basis for negotiating fees with physicians in their networks, negotiating a conversion factor relative to Medicare's.
Suppose, however, one tried to base Medicare's fee schedule on the value of services to patients. How would one determine the relative value of each of the 7,000 or so services in the schedule?
Economists might argue that, in principle, every service in a particular market area should be priced at a level that elicits from physicians collectively just the quantity of the service that is demanded collectively by users of that service in that market area. That's how markets work for bananas, haircuts and even some highly elective services produced by physicians - e.g., purely cosmetic surgery or Botox injections. But with day-to-day health care that is problematical.
First, who actually "demands" most of the 7,000 items in the physician fee schedule: patients on their own, or physicians urging often anxious patients to "demand" the services in question - e.g., diagnostic tests, imaging or surgical interventions?
In economic theory, demand for a particular good or service depends on the potential buyers' willingness to pay for it, given their budgets and ability to pay. But whose willingness to pay should we use for Medicare? Should we use an estimate of what Medicare beneficiaries would be willing to pay for physician services in the absence of Medicare coverage? Or should it be the taxpayers' willingness to pay, as expressed by their political representatives? Should it perhaps emerge from a consensus of some panel of experts convened by Medicare to represent patients or taxpayers?
While no one likes the cost-based Medicare fee schedule, its critics should be challenged to suggest a workable alternative based on "value to patients." For starters, the critics should explain concretely how they would define and measure value in this context, in monetary terms, keeping in mind the administrative cost of any such system.
In future posts I shall comment on the highly controversial role the American Medical Association and intra-physician politics play in the periodic recalibration of Medicare's fee schedule - a process that appears to have contributed to the current shortage of primary care physicians.
I shall also describe how the "sustainable growth rate" formula for updating the conversion factor for Medicare's physician fee schedule has created, since 2002, an annual Washington ritual that can best be described as theater - with much drama in between, but with a predictable outcome.

HEADLINE: Mounting Bills And Pessimism

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
FAIRBURN, Ga. -- Frank Sanders can visualize how his tidy, green-shuttered mobile home will deteriorate if he does not regain unemployment benefits.
His living room furniture? It is scheduled to be repossessed. The kitchen? He is already stockpiling canned food donated by churches. The mobile home itself? By next month, he will have spent his last rent money, and then Mr. Sanders, a 64-year-old Vietnam veteran who lost his job as a welder last year, is bracing for the possibility of homelessness. 
''We're running low on time,'' said Mr. Sanders, a bulky former Air Force parachutist who lives with his disabled wife, Ruth, in this small Atlanta suburb. Their monthly income of $948 in Social Security benefits does not cover her medical expenses, let alone their car, phone, rent, food or electrical costs, he said. ''The bills just keep piling up.''
Add to that grim outlook a new concern: This week is the first since Mr. Sanders lost his job in May 2009 that they will not receive $323 in government unemployment benefits. Unless Congress approves a measure extending federal assistance for the long-term unemployed, they will be among more than two million jobless Americans who will lose their benefits by the end of this month. So there is a special urgency to Mr. Sanders's daily trips around town in his Chevy Trailblazer, applying for jobs at fast-food restaurants, construction sites and retail stores. An artist by hobby, he also paints landscapes on common items -- milk jugs, vinyl records, buzz saws -- and sells them for $15.
Such hardship is humbling. Raised in a working-class family and employed all of his life until last year, Mr. Sanders went to a food bank for a donated Thanksgiving turkey. ''I'm supposed to be the provider, I'm supposed to be taking care of the situation,'' he said. ''There I am begging for food.''
He lost his job at a factory that welds equipment for bulldozers in Lafayette, Ind., amid a companywide downsizing. His wife's daughter lives in Georgia, so they moved here this year, hoping he could find work as a carpenter or construction worker, but so far he has not received any offers. For ''good luck,'' he recently placed a large golden Buddha statue in his living room. But he admits that he is pessimistic. The state unemployment rate is 10 percent. Every evening, he watches C-Span, hoping for news that Congress has passed the extensions, and ends up yelling at the television.
''I'm wondering where the next dollar is going to come from, or the next meal,'' he said. ''When I'm not looking for work, my day is filled with a lot of pacing back and forth.''

HEADLINE: Value Sinking Fastest at Homes Priced Low to Start

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
DURING the great housing bubble, it was the least expensive homes whose prices went up the most. And now it is those homes that are suffering the most.
''That is where the most creative lending was,'' said David Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor's, arguing that the lax lending standards played a significant role in the inflation of prices. 
The S.&P./Case-Shiller indexes released this week showed widespread declines in home prices in the third quarter of this year as the market suffered from the removal of temporary tax credits that had led to a small rally in home prices earlier in the year. No region had lost more than 5 percent in a quarter since mid-2009, but that happened to Phoenix in the third quarter.
For 16 major regional areas, S.& P. publishes separate indexes for the top, middle and bottom thirds of homes in the area, as measured by price. Those figures show that from the beginning of the decade through each area's peak, prices of lower-value homes rose faster than either of the other groups in each of the markets except one, Denver, where the rises were virtually identical for all groups.
The latest figures show that prices of lower-cost homes have fallen further from the peak in each of the 16 areas.
As a result, the pain of lower prices is being felt most strongly by homeowners who are most vulnerable, both because they may have taken out mortgages whose interest rates rose after initial teaser periods ended and because those owners are more likely to be facing prolonged unemployment.
While mortgage interest rates are low now, underwriting standards are tougher than they were during the bubble, and would-be buyers of lower-priced homes are likely to face more difficulty in getting mortgages than prospective purchasers of more expensive homes.
The accompanying charts show price performance in eight regional markets, and indicate how far down prices were from peak levels in September. The charts also show just how expensive a home needed to be in September to qualify for each tier.
Those prices vary widely. In the San Francisco area, which includes homes from the very expensive Silicon Valley region to the much less expensive areas east of San Francisco Bay, a home costing less than $335,000 was in the least expensive group. By contrast, in Phoenix, where low-price homes now cost only one-third what they did at the peak, a home costing just $177,000 qualifies for the top third.
Las Vegas, another area that suffered greatly because of overbuilding and speculative excesses, also has homes that are relatively cheap. It is possible that those relative bargains will again begin to draw retirees from other parts of the country at some point, providing support for depressed markets.
The Las Vegas and Phoenix markets had the sharpest increases during the boom, each rising about 50 percent during the peak 12-month period. But from the beginning of the decade through the peak, other areas had larger total increases. Lower-priced homes in the Miami and Los Angeles regions showed the largest gains, each about 240 percent, about 100 percentage points more than the rises in Las Vegas and Phoenix.

HEADLINE: Point (Phone) and Shoot

BYLINE: By SAM GROBART

 BODY:
Ariel Dunitz-Johnson, a 30-year-old illustrator in San Francisco, bought a point-and-shoot camera in May. But in July, she bought a smartphone, with a camera built in.
Soon, whenever she wanted to take a picture, she found herself reaching for the smartphone, a Droid Incredible. She barely uses her point-and-shoot, a Panasonic DMC-LX3.
''It's much easier to share those pictures with my friends,'' she explained, through social networks or e-mail. ''With my point-and-shoot, I have to plug it into my computer and upload the photos. It's just a few more steps than I want to take.''
The point-and-shoot camera, which has been a part of American households since 1900, when George Eastman introduced the Kodak Brownie, is endangered. Like other single-use devices -- the answering machine, the desktop calculator, the Rolodex -- it is being shoved aside by a multipurpose device: the smartphone and its camera, which takes better snapshots with each new model. 
Cameras, mostly point-and-shoots, are still found in 82 percent of American households, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. But for many consumers, the point-and-shoot they have now may be the last they ever own as they favor the camera in their smartphone. It's close at hand whenever a photo opportunity arises, and can be used to instantly e-mail and share pictures. And it has an expanding menu of photo apps, well beyond the landscape and panoramic settings on a point-and-shoot, that can be used to easily manipulate the images.
Point-and-shoots do have certain advantages over smartphone cameras, including features like image stabilization and larger lenses and sensors. That does not matter to consumers like Emily Peterson, a 28-year-old graphic designer who lives in Brooklyn and who bought an iPhone 4 in July. ''One day I just thought, 'Wow, I never have my camera with me, when I used to carry it around all the time,' '' she said. ''It's just one less thing for me to remember, one less thing to carry.''
Geoffe Haney, a 44-year-old collections manager at a museum in Bay City, Mich., who also owns an iPhone 4, said the device was ''my camera first, my phone second.'' He added, ''I have 40 photo apps on my iPhone -- it's like having 40 different cameras with you all the time.''
The sales figures tell the story. While smartphone sales in the United States continue to skyrocket, unit sales of point-and-shoot cameras fell nearly 16 percent from 2008, according to the market research firm NPD Group. That corresponds to a decline of 24 percent in dollars, to $1.9 billion, from $2.4 billion.
Even when the recession eased over the last year, sales of point-and-shoots fell. At the same time, sales of more powerful cameras like S.L.R.'s, with advanced features like interchangeable lenses and manual settings, have increased, by nearly 29 percent in dollars since 2009, according to NPD.
Analysts say this suggests a split in the market, as casual shooters remain happy with the convenience of their smartphones, and dedicated enthusiasts seek out the more advanced cameras. And they predict that the point-and-shoot market will drop further over all.
''The compact camera market is pretty stagnant,'' said Christopher Chute, an analyst at the market researcher IDC. ''The ubiquity of a 5- or 10-megapixel camera phone in your pocket is hard to overcome.''
David C. Lee, the senior vice president at Nikon, acknowledged, ''The market's peaked a little.'' Still, he said he was not worried. ''It's going to go up and down, but it will stay solid,'' he said. Echoing other camera makers, he said the smartphone camera would encourage more picture-taking generally, leading to more demand for traditional cameras.
But the smartphone has proved irresistibly easy to use, especially for people who exchange vast numbers of photos online.
Facebook says that since the site was founded in 2004, its users have uploaded more than 50 billion photos, making that feature one of its most popular. Flickr, the photo-sharing site, says users add more than three million photos to its inventory every day. Yet Flickr's data shows that the most popular camera among its 55 million users is a smartphone, Apple's iPhone 3G. Not a single point-and-shoot makes it into its top five. The remaining spots are occupied by S.L.R.'s from Canon and Nikon.
Cameras began showing up in phones almost a decade ago. For much of that time, image quality was akin to grainy shots of U.F.O.'s or Sasquatch. In the last few years, though, more powerful processors and better sensors have improved image quality to levels many consumers find acceptable.
According to a February report from the camera industry group PMA, film cameras were not quite extinct until 2004, when most digital models took pictures with resolutions greater than four megapixels -- allowing users to print high-quality images in conventional sizes. The report predicted that camera-phone use would ''increase significantly'' once those devices achieved a similar resolution.
The iPhone, various Android models and phones on Microsoft's new Windows Phone 7 operating system have already crossed that threshold.
Even some professionals are advocates of picture-taking with smartphones.
And while dedicated cameras have long had settings and modes to adjust the quality of the picture taken, smartphones have apps like Hipstamatic, Camera Bag and OldCamera that allow users to apply filters -- black and white, sepia, vintage -- to images, often just by poking a finger.
''The apps make things look so professional,'' said Ms. Peterson, the graphic designer. ''I just came back from a trip and my pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge look like a postcard. I don't think my old camera could even have done something like that.''
Glyn Evans, 42, from Yeovil, England, said, ''The apps were a turning point for me.'' Mr. Evans, who works in information technology and founded the Web site Iphoneography.com, dedicated to photography taken with Apple's iPhone, added, ''I have a camera, but it's gathering dust.''
Mark Romanek, director of the coming film ''Never Let Me Go'' and an avid photographer, has also abandoned his point-and-shoot.
His Web site, markromanek.posterous.com, features his photography, all of which was taken with an iPhone and using camera apps like OldCamera. He likes the ''lo-fi'' quality to the images, but also likes always having his camera at hand.
''When a camera of this type is always in your pocket,'' he wrote via e-mail, ''every moment seems like a potential photo-op.''

HEADLINE: Beijing Looks to Tighten Policy to Cool Economy

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China will tighten its monetary policy next year, the country's leaders said Friday, a sign that they are increasingly concerned about inflation and an overheated economy.
The move, announced in an article by Xinhua, China's official news agency, comes as other nations, including the United States, continue to grapple with a global recession.
Xinhua reported that the Politburo, the elite team led by nine members at the top of the Communist Party hierarchy, had decided that China's monetary policy should shift ''from relatively loose to prudent next year.'' The article also said China ''will continue its proactive fiscal policy,'' meaning that investment spending would not be severely curbed. 
China's economy has continued to grow rapidly, bolstered in part by an enormous government stimulus package and liberal lending by state banks after the global financial crisis began in late 2008. The move to rein in liquidity and bank lending, presumably through interest rate increases and other means, indicates that Chinese leaders feel confident enough in prospects for future growth that they can afford to cool down the economy.
The Xinhua article did not discuss the implications of a tighter monetary policy for the value of the renminbi. But one reason China has kept its monetary policy loose for the last several years has been to issue more renminbi and buy United States dollars.
That currency market intervention has kept the renminbi weak and has made Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets while making foreign goods more expensive in China. The United States, Europe and some developing countries have become increasingly concerned; they say the relative weakness of the renminbi has caused the transfer of jobs and economic growth to China. And the Obama administration in particular has been putting pressure on China to let the renminbi appreciate.
Tightening the money supply might mean China's central bank would buy fewer dollars and might strengthen the renminbi against the dollar and other major currencies -- the effect critics of China's monetary policy have been seeking. But analysts do not expect the shift in policy to lead to significant currency appreciation.
The government reported that the consumer price index, an indicator of inflation, rose 4.4 percent in October from the same month in 2009. The increase was the largest in 25 months and higher than the rate policy makers in Beijing are comfortable with. The government wants the average throughout all of 2010 to be no higher than 3 percent; in May, the index nudged up to 3.1 percent over May 2009 and has been gradually rising since.
Some analysts say the government will raise interest rates throughout 2011 to curb spending.
In October, the government slightly raised a benchmark lending rate, apparently to slow real estate speculation. The property market in China has been booming. Rising property prices, along with the government stimulus money and loose bank lending, have spurred new developments across the country, from the windswept plains of Inner Mongolia to the tropical southern island of Hainan. Some analysts say this has resulted in a dangerous bubble in the real estate market, while others argue that the capacity will be put to good use.
A record $560 billion of residential property was sold in 2009, an increase of 80 percent over 2008, according to government statistics.
Some officials in the central government have indicated they recognize there is a risk to loose bank lending and presumably want to slow it. Victor C. Shih, an associate professor at Northwestern University, has estimated that state banks have lent $1.6 trillion to companies owned by local governments, and that a significant portion of that is likely to pile up as bad loans, posing a risk to state banks.
Low wages have helped to hold down inflation. But those wages, coupled with the hot property market, mean that migrant workers from the interior of China are less tolerant of poor work conditions on the coasts, where many of China's export manufacturing factories are located. Many workers are now choosing to stay closer to home in the interior provinces.
China Daily, an official English-language newspaper, reported on Monday that two large manufacturing hubs, the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta, are experiencing severe worker shortages. The Pearl River Delta could be short by as many as 900,000 workers, the newspaper reported, citing a recent survey by the human resources department of Guangdong Province.

HEADLINE: Tenor Uncorks His 'Christmas' Tour

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
Champagne flowed at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night, poured into plastic stemware at tables lining the hallways and tipped by well-dressed patrons. Taking in the festive bustle, you could imagine that you were at a gala opening, were it not for a dull stale-beer aroma that never entirely goes away. Still, for the latest appearance of the superstar Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, the Garden put on airs.
The occasion was the start of Mr. Bocelli's latest American tour, ''My Christmas,'' a six-stop excursion celebrating his best-selling 2009 CD of sacred and secular Christmas fare. But inside the arena, you noticed wide patches of empty seats among the thousands of eager fans present. 
Has Mr. Bocelli's star dipped? Unlikely. ''My Christmas'' has sold more than two million copies in the United States. Is the economy too soft to support a tour with prime seats priced at nearly $380? Possibly. Before the show started, I thumbed through Twitter to gauge the buzz. There was plenty, most of it about Mr. Bocelli's new PBS television special, also called ''My Christmas,'' which was showing in a rerun at that very minute.
Mr. Bocelli, you were reminded, is ubiquitous.
Home viewers were treated to the sight of Mr. Bocelli singing with Mary J. Blige and the Muppets. Alas, those guests were missing here; instead, Mr. Bocelli was joined by a large, unnamed orchestra and chorus, efficiently conducted by Eugene Kohn.
The first half of Mr. Bocelli's program was devoted to straightforward classical and opera selections. As Mr. Bocelli sang ''Where'er You Walk'' from Handel's ''Semele,'' on a huge screen overhead he rode a horse across a grassy plain, and walked hand in hand with his wife down a tree-lined path.
Mr. Bocelli was in his element: his voice comfortably upholstered with amplification, his audience made up of devotees. Yet curiously, his set lurched in fits and starts, each rousing Verdi or Puccini aria dispatched with evident concentration and sincerity, followed by awkward inertia until the next selection commenced.
Repeatedly he ceded the stage to guests, who were met with polite applause. Anna Tifu, a Sardinian violinist, made fleet, scrappy work of a fantasy on themes from Bizet's ''Carmen.'' Alexia Voulgaridou, a commendable Greek soprano, sang the ''Jewel Song'' from Gounod's ''Faust'' expressively and played a touching foil to Mr. Bocelli in an extended sequence from Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' (with snippets from a staged ''Butterfly,'' starring Mr. Bocelli, projected overhead).
Mr. Bocelli seemed to relax during the second set, singing with greater ease and expressiveness in sentimental Neapolitan songs and selections from ''My Christmas.'' Guests fared better as well. Heather Headley's megawatt smile warmed and lubricated her pliant tone in a duet version of ''Blue Christmas.'' And student singers from the Adderley School of the Performing Arts in Santa Barbara, Calif., were irresistible in ''Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.''
Santa failed to appear, but no matter: Mr. Bocelli had roused his admirers to a fever pitch by the end of his show, and he sustained that momentum through three standard encores: ''My Prayer,'' with Ms. Headley; ''Time to Say Goodbye,'' with Ms. Voulgaridou and Ms. Tifu; and a heartfelt ''Nessun Dorma'' from Puccini's ''Turandot.''

HEADLINE: Millions Bracing for Cutoff of Unemployment Checks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO, KIM SEVERSON, DAVID HERSZENHORN and ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
More than two million jobless Americans are entering the holiday season seized with varying levels of foreboding, worry or even panic over what lies ahead as they cope with the expected cutoff of their unemployment benefits.
Their economic fates are now connected on a taut string to skirmishing between Democrats and Republicans in Washington over whether to extend federal financing for unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.
Tuesday marked the expiration of a pair of federal programs that had extended unemployment benefits anywhere from 34 to 73 weeks on top of the 26 weeks already provided by the states.
The federal extensions have been customary in past recessions and their aftermath, but they have become ensnared lately in political jousting over the soaring budget deficit. 
Some recipients have already received their final checks. If the impasse remains unresolved, others will see their payments lapse in the coming days or weeks, depending on how long they have been receiving benefits.
By the end of December, more than two million are set to lose their extended benefits, according to estimates by the National Employment Law Project, and about a million more by the end of January.
While benefits have lapsed twice before in this downturn because of Congressional bickering -- the last time, in June and July, payments were interrupted for 51 days-- advocates for the unemployed are worried that if the issue is not resolved by the current lame-duck session of Congress, prospects in the next, with Republicans ascendant, are even slimmer.
That would mean a new reality facing legions of people across the country: a cutoff after six months of benefits for anyone out of work.
MICHAEL LUO
In Washington, Partisan Gridlock
WASHINGTON -- With jobless benefits starting to run out for up two million of the long-term unemployed, Senate Democrats this week repeatedly tried to bring up a bill that would prolong aid for a year, only to hear Republicans object and block the legislation. Democrats, in turn, rejected Republican counterproposals.
In both the Senate and House, Democrats are pressing the case for jobless aid on two fronts, arguing that it is both the moral and humanitarian thing to do -- especially during the holiday season -- and that it is also an effective policy mechanism to help stimulate the economy.
''Unemployment insurance, the economists tell us, returns $2 for every dollar that is put out there,'' the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said in a floor speech on Thursday. ''People need the money. They spend it immediately for necessities. It injects demand into the economy. It helps reduce the deficit.''
Republicans said they would be willing to extend benefits provided that Democrats agree to cut spending elsewhere to cover the cost, sparking indignation among Democrats who noted that the Republicans never insist on offsetting the revenue lost through tax cuts.
A deal to extend the aid is likely, but only as part of a wider agreement on the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, and it is unclear how long that will take.
One exchange on the Senate floor, between Senators Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, was emblematic of the debate.
''In my state of Rhode Island, people are in a very serious situation,'' Mr. Reed said. ''They are struggling to stay in their homes, to educate their children, to deal with the challenges of everyday life. They have worked hard and long all their lives, and now they are finding it difficult to get a job.''
Mr. Reed noted that Congress has always extended jobless benefits in times of high unemployment.
''We have always done it on an emergency basis because it truly is an emergency,'' he said. ''We have always determined that it was necessary to get the money to the people who could use it, who needed it desperately, and we should do that again.''
Moments later, when Mr. Reed asked for the Senate's unanimous agreement to consider his bill, Mr. Brown was waiting. ''I object,'' Mr. Brown said. ''And I have a pay-for alternative on which I would like to speak.''
Mr. Brown proposed that money previously appropriated but not yet spent be redirected for the jobless aid. ''The recent job numbers in Massachusetts reflect over 280,000 people unemployed in my state alone -- over 8 percent of the Massachusetts work force. As the senator from Rhode Island mentioned -- and I know Rhode Island well; I eat in Federal Hill regularly -- the unemployment is much higher there.''
Mr. Brown noted that within just six and a half hours benefits would start to run out. ''I don't want this to happen,'' he said. ''If we fail to act today, 60,000 Bay Staters will see their unemployment checks evaporate at the end of the week.''
Mr. Brown then asked unanimous consent for the Senate to take up his proposal. Mr. Reed, however, was waiting. ''I object,'' he said.

Lessons in Making Do With Less and Less
ORLANDO, Fla. -- People used to living on little learn a lot of tricks to get by.
How long to ignore the notices before the power really gets shut off, for example. Or how many days past the freshness date stamped on a package of bologna is one day too many.
But the people walking into the Community Food and Outreach Center here have often run out of options. And now they may soon have to learn to be even poorer.
It is the responsibility of the center's staff to try to help them deal with this new level of doing without.
''We already turn off the AC and pretty much eat those dollar noodles with the seasoning packet,'' said Jacynth Allen, who at 47 finds herself for the first time among the long-term unemployed.
Workers here are preparing to increase by about 30 percent the amount of food they have available, just one example of preparations occurring across the country as social service providers brace for what they expect to be a surge of people in need.
With the memory of the onslaught that occurred when unemployment benefits lapsed over the summer, the center is planning one of its most aggressive food drives ever, along with a campaign to drum up donations and volunteers, said Andrae Bailey, the executive director.
The organization is also planning to invite governmental agencies and other nonprofits to set up on campus to offer assistance.
''These families don't know how to navigate through an economic crisis,'' he said. ''Their support system is already depleted. They have nothing left to sell and no one left to ask. And now they are going to lose the $250 they use for housing and food.''
It is among the center's aisles of free bread and deeply discounted packaged food that the simple daily challenge of being newly poor shows itself. Trying to put together a meal when even a dime makes a difference is bewildering for someone who used to stroll down the aisle at the grocery store with only a casual interest in coupons.
How do you plan a menu around a random collection that might include a tube of anchovy paste, a can of mandarin orange slices and a slightly crushed box of Ritz crackers?
The relative value of the little things a household takes for granted -- plastic garbage bags, toothpaste -- must be weighed against an extra box of cereal or a package of off-brand cookies that might soften the situation, if only for a few bites.
Troy O'Dell, 42, rejected a dented family-size can of tomato soup the food bank had marked at $1.29. He knew he could get it at a grocery outlet for 89 cents.
Mr. O'Dell resents having to even think about the price of a can of soup. He's a dry waller who was never out of work until a couple of years ago. He figures he has one unemployment check left.
He says he will have to get even smarter about stretching his food bank supplies to feed him and his 14-year-old daughter.
The deer he shot a few days ago will help. With his last unemployment check, he plans to buy an $8 seasoning packet so he can make 40 pounds of venison jerky.
''That way, it'll last longer,'' he said.

Mounting Bills And Pessimism
FAIRBURN, Ga. -- Frank Sanders can visualize how his tidy, green-shuttered mobile home will deteriorate if he does not regain unemployment benefits.
His living room furniture? It is scheduled to be repossessed. The kitchen? He is already stockpiling canned food donated by churches. The mobile home itself? By next month, he will have spent his last rent money, and then Mr. Sanders, a 64-year-old Vietnam veteran who lost his job as a welder last year, is bracing for the possibility of homelessness.
''We're running low on time,'' said Mr. Sanders, a bulky former Air Force parachutist who lives with his disabled wife, Ruth, in this small Atlanta suburb. Their monthly income of $948 in Social Security benefits does not cover her medical expenses, let alone their car, phone, rent, food or electrical costs, he said. ''The bills just keep piling up.''
Add to that grim outlook a new concern: This week is the first since Mr. Sanders lost his job in May 2009 that they will not receive $323 in government unemployment benefits. Unless Congress approves a measure extending federal assistance for the long-term unemployed, they will be among more than two million jobless Americans who will lose their benefits by the end of this month. So there is a special urgency to Mr. Sanders's daily trips around town in his Chevy Trailblazer, applying for jobs at fast-food restaurants, construction sites and retail stores. An artist by hobby, he also paints landscapes on common items -- milk jugs, vinyl records, buzz saws -- and sells them for $15.
Such hardship is humbling. Raised in a working-class family and employed all of his life until last year, Mr. Sanders went to a food bank for a donated Thanksgiving turkey. ''I'm supposed to be the provider, I'm supposed to be taking care of the situation,'' he said. ''There I am begging for food.''
He lost his job at a factory that welds equipment for bulldozers in Lafayette, Ind., amid a companywide downsizing. His wife's daughter lives in Georgia, so they moved here this year, hoping he could find work as a carpenter or construction worker, but so far he has not received any offers. For ''good luck,'' he recently placed a large golden Buddha statue in his living room. But he admits that he is pessimistic. The state unemployment rate is 10 percent. Every evening, he watches C-Span, hoping for news that Congress has passed the extensions, and ends up yelling at the television.
''I'm wondering where the next dollar is going to come from, or the next meal,'' he said. ''When I'm not looking for work, my day is filled with a lot of pacing back and forth.''

HEADLINE: Angry at U.S., Libya Delayed Deal for the Disposal of Nuclear Fuel, Cables Say

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the early morning of Nov. 25, 2009, a large Russian cargo plane left the Libyan capital, Tripoli, on a secret mission without its intended cargo.
A small stockpile of spent nuclear fuel destined for disposal in Russia remained behind in a lightly guarded research center, apparently because of a fit of pique by Libya's mercurial leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. In a frantic cable back to Washington, American officials in Tripoli warned of dire consequences unless the carefully brokered deal to remove the 5.2 kilograms (11.4 pounds) of highly enriched uranium stored in seven five-ton casks was quickly resurrected.
If the enriched uranium ''is not removed from the casks within three months, its rising temperature could cause the casks to crack and to release radioactive nuclear material,'' the American Embassy in Tripoli reported, according to cables made public by WikiLeaks. ''Security concerns alone dictate that we must employ all of our resources to find a timely solution to this problem, and to keep any mention of it out of the press.'' 
The seeds of what appeared to be the demise of the secret deal were planted weeks earlier in New York, when Colonel Qaddafi expressed unhappiness that he was not permitted to set up his tent in Manhattan or to visit ground zero during a United Nations session.
But the scope of the colonel's anger was not fully realized until Nov. 20, 2009, when the Libyan government unexpectedly ordered a team of visiting American and Russian scientists to halt preparations to ship the spent nuclear fuel to Russia, despite separate agreements Libya had reached with the United States and Russia.
The Libyans, in fact, had already agreed to pay $30,000 to have the Russians remove the material and bury it in a secure location. The episode was first reported by The Atlantic on Nov. 27, before WikiLeaks posted the cables.
Colonel Qaddafi's son Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi told the American ambassador on Nov. 27 that Libya balked at its promise to ship its final enriched uranium stockpile because it was ''fed up'' with the slow pace of improved relations with Washington. Libya had agreed in 2003 to dismantle its unconventional weapons program in exchange for greater military, security and economic cooperation.
''The Libyan Government has chosen a very dangerous issue on which to express its apparent pique about perceived problems in the bilateral relationship,'' the American ambassador, Gene A. Cretz, wrote to Washington.
Diplomats warned that if the enriched uranium was not sent to Russia soon, Russian scientists would be required to develop entirely new and risky technology to remove the spent fuel from the casks in Libya itself.
In the next few weeks, the cables revealed, American and Russian officials prevailed upon the Libyans to disengage the research center's loading crane to prevent an intruder from moving the casks. Extra security guards were sent to the site. (Before that, diplomats noted that they had seen only one guard with a gun and they raised doubts whether that was even loaded.)
American and Russian officials successfully smoothed Colonel Qaddafi's ruffled feathers.
By late December, the Russian aircraft was back on the tarmac in Tripoli. Visiting United States Energy Department officials reported that the loading of the casks overnight on Dec. 20-21 was carried out without a hitch. Libyan officials at the Tajoura Nuclear Center offered no insights into the reasons behind the government's about-face.
At 5:15 a.m. on Dec. 21, the Russian-chartered plane took off. Energy Department officials confirmed several hours later that the flight -- and its secret cargo -- had arrived in Russia.

HEADLINE: Panel Votes to Expand Surgery for Less Obese

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
A federal advisory panel Friday endorsed an expansion of the use of Allergan's Lap-Band stomach-restricting device to patients who are less than severely obese.
The vote could pave the way to double the number of Americans who qualify for weight-loss surgery. And it could eventually lead to making other types of weight-loss surgery available to those who are not quite as heavy.
''I see this as the first step in the march toward changing the standard of care,'' E. Francine Stokes McElveen, the consumer representative on the committee, said during the meeting in Gaithersburg, Md. 
The advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted 8 to 2 that the benefits of Lap-Band surgery exceeded the risks for patients in the lower range of obesity. It voted 8 to 2 that the device was safe, and 8 to 1, with one abstention, that the device was effective.
The F.D.A. usually agrees with its advisory committees, but it was not clear when a decision would be made.
Current guidelines say weight-loss surgery is appropriate for people who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise and have a body mass index of 40 and above -- or 35 and above if they have diabetes, hypertension or another severe health problem associated with diabetes.
Allergan wants to lower the threshold to a B.M.I. of 35 for people without health complications, and to 30 for people with health problems, which also would no longer have to be severe.
A person who is 5 feet, 5 inches with hypertension must weigh at least 210 pounds to qualify for surgery now. Under the proposal endorsed by the committee, that person would have to weigh only 180 pounds.
An Allergan executive said at the meeting that 27 million Americans had a B.M.I. between 30 and 35 and at least one associated health condition.
The panel's endorsement coincided with the release of a new report by F.D.A. staff members on a diet pill, Contrave, that another panel plans to consider next week. The report said the drug seemed to be effective, but might pose potential cardiovascular risks.
Other new diet pills have been rejected by the F.D.A. in recent months, leaving few options for overweight Americans.
About one-third of American adults are obese, defined as a B.M.I. of 30 or more. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine this week showed that women with a B.M.I. of 30 to 35 had a 44 percent higher risk of death than women of normal weight, which is a B.M.I. under 25.
The Lap-Band is an inflatable silicone ring that is placed around the upper part of the stomach. It restricts how much a person can eat and makes one feel full more quickly.
Allergan submitted a study to the F.D.A. in which 149 people in the new proposed weight range received the device. Those patients lost an average of about 18 percent of their weight after a year, an amount considered enough to have positive effects on their health.
But some committee members said the study was too small and too short, especially since people might have the band inside them for decades. Some wanted more evidence that the operation resolved diabetes or other health problems. Most panel members said the study included too few men, blacks and Hispanics.
Still, most of the committee, which included several bariatric surgeons, said that Allergan could do longer, larger studies after approval and there was enough evidence, including from other studies in the literature, that the band was safe and effective.
Two participants in Allergan's study, whose transportation to the meeting was paid for by the company, testified that the surgery had changed their lives.
''I couldn't walk up a flight of stairs or even take a shower without taking a rest,'' said one of them, Brandi Jirka of Nashville, who did not specify how much weight she lost. ''Now I can run and play with my children, I do yoga and can shop at regular stores in the mall. I've even been snorkeling while wearing a bikini.''
In her testimony, Diana Zuckerman of the National Research Center for Women and Families urged the committee to vote against approval, saying there was not enough long-term data. ''We need that information before approval is expanded to include such a very large number of adults,'' she said.
Some forms of weight-loss surgery, like gastric bypass, are considered medical procedures, not devices, so are not regulated by the F.D.A. But all types of bariatric surgery are covered by federal guidelines from 1991, 10 years before the Lap-Band was approved.
There are now efforts to revise those guidelines to lower the weight threshold. Some members of the committee said that the advent of minimally invasive surgery had made bariatric surgery much safer than it was in 1991. Some also said that B.M.I. was too crude a measure of how much a person needs surgery.
''The B.M.I. criterion is so seriously flawed,'' said Dr. John G. Kral, professor of surgery and medicine at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. ''Removing this barrier of this idiotic number in itself would be an important step.''
Allergan, which is known mostly for Botox, hopes that expanding use of the Lap-Band to less obese adults -- and also eventually to teenagers -- will spur sales. Sales of its obesity products, mostly Lap-Band, fell 4 percent to $182.4 million in the first nine months of this year, a decline the company attributed to the weak economy. But obesity products make up only 5 percent of Allergan's overall product sales.
Shares of Allergan rose 52 cents, to $68.80 in regular trading Friday. The shares rose 3 percent, to $70.89 in after-hours trading, following the panel's vote.

HEADLINE: Blue Skies and Blue-Chip Sales at Art Basel Miami

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
MIAMI BEACH -- Wind, rain and even snow left some collectors making the pilgrimage to Art Basel Miami Beach stranded for hours at airports in New York and Europe. But here, except for a few showers on Wednesday afternoon, the sun shone brightly, as if to demonstrate how much the little strip of South Beach, which each December becomes the setting for an art-world bacchanalia of buying, selling and socializing, is a place apart from the rest of the country, where unemployment and financial anxiety linger.
''The art market is back!'' was the chorus this week among most of the major dealers at the fair, even though some combination of canceled flights and the new economic reality kept the number of attendees down from prefinancial crisis years. Many dealers had come feeling cautiously optimistic after November's successful auctions, but they were thrilled to see the new buoyancy playing out in the fair, and, in many cases, were eager to boast about it. 
''I could have sold almost everything twice,'' said an elated if slightly exhausted-looking Marc Glimcher, of Pace Gallery, on Wednesday, a few hours into the fair, which runs through Sunday. ''Everyone's fighting over the de Kooning,'' he added with a grin, referring to a bronze sculpture, identical to one owned by the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, on display at the Pace booth at the convention center here, where the fair is taking place. He predicted that several prospective buyers would be disappointed and that he would have to take the blame, a possibility he seemed to relish more than dread. After all, a tug-of-war could not be more gratifying to the gallery, which just signed de Kooning's estate in September.
Mr. Glimcher chatted on about the gallery's bright prospects, volunteering, without being asked, that he couldn't ''confirm or deny'' rumors that Pace would open a space in London soon, in addition to another possible one in Shanghai. (Pace currently has galleries in New York and Beijing.)
Other galleries, including David Zwirner, Gagosian, Andrea Rosen, and Gladstone, also reported strong sales, and works were swapped out of booths with regularity.
The general sense seemed to be that while many people in the United States and Europe were struggling financially, some were doing very well, and a good number of them went to the fair with their wallets open. As one dealer put it, ''Money is being made, and it wants to be spent.''
Several collectors voiced the same view. ''The traffic is not overwhelming, but I think the quality of the people is good,'' said William L. Mack, the chairman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, before turning away to greet the former Guggenheim trustee Peter M. Brant.
In some areas of the fair, other perspectives could be heard. Martin Klosterfelde, of Klosterfelde Gallery in Berlin, sat in a quiet booth on Thursday afternoon. He said that he had sold some pieces, but that the weather and flight cancellations had made for a slow first day. In any case, he added, ''It's a buyer's market now, so people have time to think,'' meaning that business is spread out over the four days of the fair rather than just the first two hours, which used to be a mad rush of speculation.
Vladimir Ovcharenko, of Regina Gallery in Moscow, in his third year at the fair, said that while business had improved each year, the Miami fair was still a challenge for a Russian gallery.
''For us, it's tough,'' he said. He mimed a fairgoer glancing up at the sign on his booth. ''People see Moscow gallery, they think, 'Eh, it's a bad country,' '' he said.
''It's not so big business,'' he continued, explaining that for him Art Basel was more about meeting collectors and introducing the Russian art scene. For that same purpose, Mr. Ovcharenko is among the dealers behind a new art fair that will open in Moscow on Dec. 17, called Cosmoscow.
Latin American galleries, on the other hand, seemed to be thriving. That's not unusual, given Miami's geographical proximity and the fact that many Latin American collectors have homes here, but what was new this year was the level of interest in Latin American art from museums.
Anne Strauss, an associate curator in the 19th century, Modern and contemporary department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was at the fair on Wednesday specifically to look at Latin American art, and she was apparently not the only museum representative doing so. The Mexican gallery kurimanzutto sold a Jonathan Hernandez collage to the Miami Art Museum, and a sculpture by Abraham Cruzvillegas was reserved for another American institution, according to the gallery owners.
The booth of the Brazilian gallery Fortes Vilaca was dominated by a large installation by the artist Ernesto Neto. A rounded wooden structure raised slightly off the ground, wrapped in red nylon, it looked a little like Cinderella's carriage after midnight, if it had turned into a strawberry instead of a pumpkin. Inside the sculpture, titled ''Circleprototemple ...!,'' a bench encircled a large drum, over which dangled a hefty drumstick. The work was first exhibited at the Hayward Gallery in London this year. Alessandra Ragazzo d'Aloia, one of the gallery's owners, said she hoped it would go to a Brazilian museum.
In the meantime, however, the sculpture made an attractive resting place for tired fairgoers and, over the course of the fair, it hosted a shifting party of people chatting in English, Spanish and Portuguese. On Thursday evening the artist himself arrived, straight off a long flight from Sao Paolo but still in impish spirits, and held court inside his ''temple,'' where he played the drum vigorously in between otherwise uninterrupted streams of conversation.
Mr. Neto explained that the work was inspired by a Jorge Luis Borges short story, ''The Circular Ruins,'' and that the red structure was meant to be a heart, with the drum providing the heartbeat. Then (prodded by a reporter's questions) he went into a long and hilariously animated discussion of his next project in Rio de Janeiro -- a series of projections of photographs he has taken, many of them of his friends -- and of the difficult logistics of planning the accompanying late-night beach party.
Apart from encounters like these, artists often seem marginal to the social scene at a blue-chip fair like Art Basel Miami Beach, which is dominated by dealers, collectors and museum trustees, who use these four days to reinforce their business and personal relationships at often opulent dinners and parties. (Artists are a bigger presence at the satellite fairs.)
A ''family reunion where you get to pick all your relatives'' is how one collector described the fair -- an accurate enough statement, except that it ignores the millions of dollars changing hands within the family.
One family member who had changed roles was Jeffrey Deitch, the former New York art dealer who this year made the unusual transition from art dealer to museum director. As usual, on the opening night of the fair he gave a party on the beach at the Raleigh Hotel, where he danced to the band LCD Soundsystem.
''I was always central to Miami,'' Mr. Deitch, who now runs the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, had said earlier in the day, confessing that he was ''nostalgic'' for his years as a dealer there. ''They didn't even replace my booth -- it's a group of benches now.''

HEADLINE: South Korea And U.S. Reach Deal On Trade

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American negotiators have completed a free-trade agreement with South Korea that will eliminate most tariffs on exports and solidify one of the nation's most significant alliances in Asia, the Obama administration said on Friday.
The agreement, which requires approval by the legislatures in both countries, is a first for the administration and would be the largest trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994.
South Korea is America's seventh-largest trading partner.
The deal comes three weeks after a negotiating team visiting South Korea failed to nail down the deal. The breakthrough, which occurred the same day the government announced an increase in the unemployment rate to 9.8 percent, will expand American exports of goods by at least $10 billion a year and ''support tens of thousands of jobs,'' the Obama administration predicted. 
Trade has been a crucial test of the White House's ability to find common ground with Republicans after the drubbing Democrats took in the midterm elections. Friday's announcement got important backing on Capitol Hill, where the prospects for the agreement seem good.
''This is a big win for American employers and workers,'' said Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who will become chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which sets tariffs.
But Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was ''deeply disappointed'' that the deal did not further reduce barriers to American beef exports, which have been a particularly volatile issue in South Korea.
The deal is technically a supplement to an agreement negotiated by the Bush administration in 2007 but never finished. It was completed Friday morning, after three days of negotiations outside Washington that ended when both sides agreed in essence to give themselves more time to eliminate their tariffs on autos.
The United States will phase out its 2.5 percent tariff on imported Korean autos over five years. The 2007 version would have eliminated the tariff right away on 90 percent of Korean autos, with the remaining tariffs, on larger vehicles, phased out over three years.
Of the Detroit automakers, Ford was the most vociferous in opposing the 2007 agreement; Chrysler expressed reservations and General Motors, which owns Daewoo, the third-largest Korean automaker, stayed out of the fray. Hyundai-Kia is the No. 1 automaker in South Korea and Samsung is No. 2.
The transition period will allow the Americans to ensure that South Korea is holding up its end of the deal with regard to nontariff barriers.
''This development provides leverage to assure that Korea opens its market and provides time for our industry to root itself in the Korean marketplace,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat and the current Ways and Means chairman, whose support is seen as crucial in swaying liberals in Congress.
The United States Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby that poured tens of millions of dollars into defeating Democrats in last month's elections, offered rare praise Friday for Mr. Obama. ''This agreement will create thousands of new jobs, advance our national goal of doubling exports in five years, and demonstrates that America is once again ready to lead on trade,'' its president, Thomas J. Donohue, said in a statement.
''We will do everything in our power to round up the votes,'' he added.
The Ford Motor Company, which had placed full-page newspaper ads noting that the United States exported fewer than 6,000 vehicles to South Korea last year compared with nearly 500,000 that it imported, threw its support behind the agreement.
''These new provisions provide Ford greater confidence that we will be able to better serve our Korean customers,'' its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said.
The latest round of talks was scheduled before North Korea's recent shelling of a South Korean island, an episode that drew the two countries together and added momentum on both sides to bolster the alliance between Washington and Seoul.
''Strengthening ties with our democratic ally South Korea will not only grow the American economy, but it will also serve as a strong counterweight to China's growing influence and aggression in the region,'' said Representative Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican and co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who have monitored the talks.
In June, Mr. Obama announced at a meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers that he would try to complete modifications to the agreement by November and then submit the deal to Congress. But that deadline passed three weeks ago, casting a pall over Mr. Obama's attendance at the G-20 summit meeting in Seoul last month.
The United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, and his Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-hoon, met Tuesday in Columbia, Md., for a two-day round of talks that extended into Thursday.
After a final meeting on Friday morning, both sides finally said an agreement was close. ''It's time now for the leaders to review this progress before we move forward,'' Mr. Kirk said as the Korean negotiators returned home to brief their president, Lee Myung-bak.
In the agreement, both sides are getting more time to remove their auto tariffs.
South Korea will immediately cut its tariff on American autos to 4 percent from 8 percent, with the remainder ending over five years. Under the 2007 deal, the tariff was to end immediately.
The new agreement, the administration said, also contains other significant terms related to the auto industry:
It exempts 25,000 American-made vehicles a year from each manufacturer, from costly South Korean safety regulations that critics said were intended solely to discriminate against imports.
It gives American automakers that now have only a toehold in South Korea more leeway to comply with regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy as they expand their market share.
It gives the United States more time to phase out a 25 percent tariff on trucks and requires Korea to more quickly reduce its tariff on electric cars.
It includes a safeguard, specific to the auto industry, that would allow tariffs to be reimposed if there were a sudden, unanticipated surge in South Korean auto imports as a consequence of the agreement.
In focusing so much on autos, the Obama administration did not press as hard as Mr. Baucus, and other lawmakers from agricultural states, would have liked on access to American beef.
South Korea banned American beef imports in 2003 after an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad-cow disease, in Washington State.
Shortly after taking office in 2008, the South Korean president moved to open the country's market to American beef, but he was confronted with major antigovernment protests and riots that threatened to bring down his government. South Korea continues to limit American imports to beef from cattle under 30 months old, a restriction that Mr. Baucus and other American officials consider unreasonable because no mad-cow disease in humans has been attributed to American beef.
The beef issue is still volatile for the South Koreans -- it prompted a walkout during last month's talks -- but the economic impact of the 30-month limit is slight since consumers tend to prefer cuts from younger cattle.
Mr. Baucus's office said he would oppose the agreement unless his concerns were addressed. Other Democrats were skeptical of the deal.
The leader of a group of lawmakers who want protections against jobs moving abroad, Representative Michael Michaud, a Maine Democrat, said, ''The deal reached today, while beneficial to the auto industry, falls far short of that goal.''
The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, called the South Korea deal ''a positive development'' but urged progress on trade deals with Colombia and Panama negotiated by the Bush administration that have languished in Congress.

HEADLINE: From a Ski Resort, A Tennis Natural

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
KOPAONIK, Serbia -- To begin to understand how a small, struggling nation like Serbia managed to reach its first Davis Cup final this weekend, you could interview Slobodan Zivojinovic, a big-serving Serbian trailblazer at Wimbledon and elsewhere before he became a portly tennis administrator and car salesman.
You could delve into tomes that explain the resilient character of the Serbs, whose territory and autonomy have been overrun repeatedly but whose identity and sense of mission endure. You could spend an afternoon in Belgrade's tennis clubs, where members once played on when NATO bombs were falling in 1999.
But if you have to pick just one essential starting point, perhaps it is best to drive south from the capital toward the still-disputed border with Kosovo and follow the serpentine mountain road to Kopaonik, Serbia's leading ski resort. Like so much of this diminished nation, Kopaonik has seen better days and is preparing to see them again. 
It was here that Novak Djokovic's family, much more familiar with schussing down slopes than hitting balls over nets, once operated several small businesses -- including a pizzeria, a sports equipment shop and an art gallery -- on the ground floor of a large complex during the winter and summer. And it was here that the state-owned Yugoslav company Genex, which developed much of Kopaonik, chose to build three tennis courts just across the parking lot from where the Djokovics opened their Red Bull restaurant in the late 1980s.
Now full of cracks, holes and undulations, the green hardcourts are hardly a playground for the elite. It is hard to believe that the world's third-best player, the man who held off Roger Federer at the United States Open in September, emerged from this.
If some planner had chosen a different recreational destiny for this plot of land, perhaps young Novak would have become a competitive skier, like his father, Srdjan, and uncle Goran, and the French Davis Cup team would not be bracing to compete in the din of a sold-out final in Belgrade Arena this weekend.
But even with those three courts in plain view in Kopaonik, Novak needed a mentor, someone with the requisite charisma and clout to show him that however isolated this place, however unlikely the prospect, these courts could be the path to something much grander.
''It was the first day of my first year in Kopaonik, and I was doing a tennis camp,'' said Jelena Gencic, a leading tennis coach and former professional player. ''And he was just standing outside the tennis courts and watching all morning, and I said: 'Hey, little boy, do you like it? Do you know what this is?' ''
That summer afternoon in 1993, Novak, just 6, accepted Gencic's invitation and returned to take part in the clinic. He arrived carrying a gym bag with his belongings well in order, just like the professionals he admired via satellite television.
''One racket, towel, bottle with water, one banana, a dry extra T-shirt, wrist band and the cap,'' Gencic, 74, said recently. ''And I said: 'O.K., who prepared your bag? Your mother?' And oh, he was very angry. He said, 'No, I am playing tennis.' ''
He began playing in earnest, aided enormously and at just the critical moment by Gencic, the same cultivated and intuitive coach who had helped shape the games of the future Grand Slam champions Monica Seles and Goran Ivanisevic.
''Pretty much what I know on court, I owe to her,'' Djokovic said of Gencic, a former leading tennis player and a member of Yugoslavia's team handball squad.
It was Gencic who taught him the grips and fundamentals; Gencic who provided him inspiration with Pushkin poems and classical music; Gencic who helped him arrive at the conclusion that he preferred to hit his backhand with two hands instead of the single hand used by his American idol, Pete Sampras. Just as important, it was Gencic who gave Djokovic's parents, Srdjan and Dijana, the assurance that the boy had what it took to be something exceptional in a game whose subtleties they did not yet grasp.
''The third day, I called to see the father and mother for the first time, and I said, 'You have a golden child,' '' Gencic said. ''I said the same thing about Monica Seles when she was 8.''
The Djokovics were stunned but inspired. They would need all the inspiration they could muster in the years ahead as they sacrificed security and scrambled for money in a disintegrating economy.
''Let's say that Jelena Gencic gave us strength; she's a serious woman,'' said Goran Djokovic, who at 46 is four years younger than Srdjan. ''We were all together as a family, and we had our project. It was not good times, there were sanctions and the war was starting. It was not an easy time for Serbia, for Yugoslavia, but all the money we had we invest in Novak. He had to be the one in front of the family who had to have everything he need -- the new racket, the good food and everything. Of course we can live very easy if he didn't play tennis, but we have a vision.''
The vision would require Novak to leave home at age 12 for the Munich academy run by the former top Yugoslav player Niki Pilic, a friend of Gencic's. It would require loans, tight communal living quarters, tears and angst.
Novak is certainly something now: a 2008 Australian Open champion and a two-time United States Open finalist who, at 23, has won nearly $20 million in prize money and was recently named Serbia's most eligible bachelor in an online newspaper poll.
Now he is trying to lead Serbia to its most prestigious sports title since the breakup of Yugoslavia. On Friday, he beat Gilles Simon of France, 6-3, 6-1, 7-5, after his teammate Janko Tipsarevic was beaten by Gael Monfils, 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-0, in the opening matches of the final.
In New Belgrade, below the offices of the Djokovics' four-year-old company, Family Sport, sits Novak Restaurant, an upscale eatery filled with well-dressed patrons and television screens showing highlights from Novak's matches. A display case is filled with Novak lighters, key chains, pens.
The branding of Novak Djokovic takes on a more solemn air upstairs in Srdjan's office, where a religious painting shows the late Patriarch Pavle, head of the Serbian Orthodox church, with Novak's face painted in luminous tones below him. Goran played down its implications.
''We don't want to make an icon of Novak, but people are always trying to put him up there,'' he said. ''It's a fight to keep normal.''
Back in the older part of the city is the most concrete evidence of Djokovic's impact. There, at the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers, sits the club that he and his family and other investors built. It is the site of a two-year-old ATP event, the Serbian Open, which is owned and operated by the family. It is also the prospective site of Novak's tennis academy, potentially a cooperative effort with the IMG Bollettieri Academy in Florida, where one of Djokovic's younger brothers, Djordje, 15, now trains.
''We don't want to just be Novak's uncle, Novak's father, Novak's aunt,'' Goran said. ''Novak has his business. His business is to play tennis. Our business is to run all this. We could put on the sunglasses and relax. But all of our lives we were in private business, even in the Communist time. So we try to build something for the future, for Novak and for Serbia.''
Total investment here so far? About $13 million, according to Goran, who is also the Serbian Open's tournament director.
''Serbian history tells that the family is the most important thing, and you have to stick with the family,'' Novak said.
Djokovic's talent has served a bruised nation, one that has seen its territory shrink in the last 20 years as Yugoslavia cracked apart and Serbia was left with Montenegro and Kosovo and then left with nothing but itself and a reputation in as much need of repair as the war-damaged buildings in Belgrade.
But as the country has grown smaller, its tennis has grown bigger, with Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic both reaching No. 1 in the women's game and with Djokovic shining brightest for the men but hardly shining alone, with his Cup teammates Tipsarevic, Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjic part of the surge. Tipsarevic and Troicki are in the top 50 in singles; Zimonjic, the group elder at 34, is a former No. 1 player in doubles now No. 3.
The bandwagon is getting heavier, and there are plans for the Serbian government, no major player until now, to fund a new national tennis center next year with at least 5 indoor courts, 15 outdoor courts and a residential complex.
The paradox of shrinking Serbia and its tennis growth is not lost on Djokovic, for whom the Davis Cup final represents renewal.
''I think it is very symbolic, and I think it's very much deserved -- for the tennis team, for the country, for the sport -- because we put a lot of effort into improving the image of our country in the recent years,'' he said. ''The history of our country is cruel. We have to face those issues or, should I say, we had to. Not anymore I hope, because we are going in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: Teacher Ratings Get New Look, Pushed by a Very Rich Observer

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
PRINCETON, N.J. -- In most American schools, teachers are evaluated by principals or other administrators who drop in for occasional classroom visits and fill out forms to rate their performance.
The result? More than 9 out of 10 teachers get top marks, according to a prominent study last year by the New Teacher Project, a nonprofit group focusing on improving teacher quality.
Now Bill Gates, who in recent years has turned his attention and considerable fortune to improving American education, is investing $335 million through his foundation to overhaul the personnel departments of several big school systems. A big chunk of that money is financing research by dozens of social scientists and thousands of teachers to develop a better system for evaluating classroom instruction.
The effort will have enormous consequences for the movement to hold schools and educators more accountable for student achievement. 
Twenty states are overhauling their teacher-evaluation systems, partly to fulfill plans set in motion by a $4 billion federal grant competition, and they are eagerly awaiting the research results.
For teachers, the findings could mean more scrutiny. But they may also provide more specific guidance about what is expected of the teachers in the classroom if new experiments with other measures are adopted -- including tests that gauge teachers' mastery of their subjects, surveys that ask students about the learning environments in their classes and digital videos of teachers' lessons, scored by experts.
''It's huge,'' said Deborah Loewenberg Ball, dean of the University of Michigan School of Education. ''They're trying to do something nobody's done before, and do it very quickly.''
The Gates research is by no means the first effort of its kind. Economists have already developed a statistical method called value-added modeling that calculates how much teachers help their students learn, based on changes in test scores from year to year. The method allows districts to rank teachers from best to worst.
Value-added modeling is used in hundreds of districts. But teachers complain that boiling down all they do into a single statistic offers an incomplete picture; they want more measures of their performance taken into account.
The Gates research uses value added as a starting point, but aims to develop other measures that can not only rate teachers but also help educators understand why one is more successful than another.
Researchers and educators involved in the project described it as maddeningly complex in its effort to separate the attributes of good teaching from the idiosyncrasies of individual teachers.
Mr. Gates is tracking the research closely. The use of digital video in particular has caught his attention. In an interview, he cited its potential for evaluating teachers and for helping them learn from talented colleagues.
''Some teachers are extremely good,'' Mr. Gates said. ''And one of the goals is to say, you know, 'Let's go look at those teachers.' What's unbelievable is how little the exemplars have been studied. And then saying, 'O.K., How do you take a math teacher who's in the third quartile and teach them how to get kids interested -- get the kid who's smart to pay attention, a kid who's behind to pay attention?' Teaching a teacher to do that -- you have to follow the exemplars.''
The meticulous scoring of videotaped lessons for this project is unfolding on a scale never undertaken in educational research, said Catherine A. McClellan, a director for the Educational Testing Service who is overseeing the process.
By next June, researchers will have about 24,000 videotaped lessons. Because some must be scored using more than one protocol, the research will eventually involve reviewing some 64,000 hours of classroom video. Early next year, Dr. McClellan expects to recruit hundreds of educators and train them to score lessons.
The goal is to help researchers look for possible correlations between certain teaching practices and high student achievement, measured by value-added scores. Thomas J. Kane, a Harvard economist who is leading the research, is scheduled to announce some preliminary results in Washington next Friday. More definitive conclusions are expected in about a year.
The effort has also become a large-scale field trial of using classroom video, to help teachers improve and to evaluate them remotely.
''Video lasts,'' Dr. McClellan said, creating possibilities for dialogue among teachers about improving classroom techniques. ''Colleagues can watch your video and say, 'Right here -- where you did that -- try this next time.' So the teacher learns a new skill.''
There are advantages for teacher evaluations, too, Dr. Kane said.
With videos, for instance, several professionals, rather than just one principal, could rate the same classroom performance, making ratings less subjective, he said.
''It potentially creates a cottage industry for retired principals, or even expert teachers, to moonlight on weekends scoring classroom observations,'' he said.
An Internet-based approach to teacher evaluation could also alleviate some pressures on school districts. New laws in many states, after all, are requiring more frequent observations of teachers.
A new evaluation system in Washington, D.C., for example, requires five observations each year, compared with the previous systems that required one or two at most, and in many cases none at all. Starting next fall, a Tennessee law will require at least four observations a year, rather than one every five years.
In some districts, the increased pace is straining the workload of administrators. Memphis officials realized that under the new rules, their district would need to conduct more than 28,000 classroom observations annually, a task that could overwhelm the city's school principals.
''This technology can help us face the logistical challenge of being in so many places at the same time,'' said John Barker, who leads the district's research and evaluation office.
The district still intends to have principals visit classrooms, but in January will start a pilot program to use videotaped observations, he said.
Dr. Kane said the foundation hoped more school districts would start using classroom videos, for training and for evaluations, and has worked to keep costs down.
Teachscape, a contractor providing cameras, software, and other services for the research, estimated first-year startup costs of about $1.5 million for a district with 140 schools and 7,000 teachers to buy one camera per school and lease the software to carry out classroom observations using digital video. After that, annual costs would drop to about $800,000, said Mark Atkinson, the chief executive of Teachscape, which is based in San Francisco.
In addition to the cost -- which many struggling districts may consider too high -- another barrier could be teacher opposition. The Memphis teachers union, an affiliate of the National Education Association, has partnered with the foundation for the project. But Keith Harris, its president, said the use of videotaped observations in evaluations raised troubling questions.
''Whose eyes would see these videos?'' Mr. Harris asked. ''Who would own them? This seems like an 'I gotcha' kind of thing. We think these observations deserve a human being.''
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which has several affiliates participating in the research, also expressed reservations. ''Videotaped observations have their role but shouldn't be used to substitute for in-person observations to evaluate teachers,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''It would be hard to justify ratings by outsiders watching videotapes at a remote location who never visited the classroom and couldn't see for themselves a teacher's interaction and relationship with students.''
Dr. Kane said doubts may disappear with time. ''We're not naive,'' he said. ''We realize that most principals and teachers imagine an in-person visit from a human being when they think of classroom observations. But that could rapidly change. It's not out of the realm of possibility that millions of classrooms could be using this technology within four or five years.''

HEADLINE: Senators Vie for Last Word on Tax Breaks as Expiration Nears

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats on Friday denounced Republicans for insisting on continued tax breaks for ''millionaires and billionaires,'' even as they braced for the White House to make concessions that would allow an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts at all income levels.
In a last-ditch effort to control the political messaging in the tax fight, Democrats accused the Republicans of favoring the rich over the middle class, of cruelly holding up an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, and of pursuing bad economic policies that contributed to the recent recession. 
''They can pretend giving the rich tax breaks creates jobs, but we know it doesn't,'' the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said in a floor speech. ''If that were the case,'' he added, ''the economy would be booming.''
Republicans, however, remained firm in their position that taxes should not be allowed to rise for anyone, given the continued weakness in the economy. And they accused Democrats of political showboating rather than focusing on advancing a tax package that has any chance of becoming law.
''We have heard a lot from our friends on the other side of the aisle this week about the middle class,'' the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said. ''That's because their policies have been so ineffective in helping the middle class. They try to distract the American people from their record.''
''Even higher than last month,'' Mr. McConnell said, citing the latest unemployment numbers, at 9.8 percent nationally. ''Millions of out-of-work Americans don't want showboats or finger-pointing contests.''
After making big gains in the midterm elections, and with the tax cuts set to expire for everyone by the end of the month if Congress fails to act, Republicans are feeling confident that they have the upper hand in the debate.
Meanwhile, the frustration among Congressional Democrats seemed to boil over on Friday.
At a news conference, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, suggested that dealing with the Republicans was akin to dealing with terrorists. Mr. Menendez, responding to a question, said that while Democrats held the majority, they should not capitulate to Republican demands if those demands represented bad policy.
''Do you allow yourself to be held hostage and get something done for the sake of getting something done, when in fact it might be perverse in its ultimate result?'' Mr. Menendez asked. ''It's almost like the question of do you negotiate with terrorists.''
To illustrate their desire to end the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, the Democrats have scheduled two votes on Saturday. The first is on the bill approved by the House on Thursday to extend the Bush-era tax rates only on income up to $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals while allowing the lowered rates to expire on income above those amounts.
No Republican has expressed a willingness to support that bill, and even some Democrats have said they favor extending the rates at all income levels, at least temporarily -- meaning the bill has no chance of winning the 60 votes needed to advance.
The second vote is on a proposal championed by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York to raise the threshold at which the lowered rates expire to $1 million -- essentially imposing what Democrats are calling a ''millionaires' tax'' at a time when there is growing public concern about the federal budget deficit.
That bill, too, is expected to fall short.
In the latest sign of how the tax issue continues to rankle and divide Democrats, White House officials said the administration opposes raising the threshold to $1 million.
At the same time, Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, who supports a temporary extension of the tax rates at all income levels, criticized his own party's leaders for dithering.
''The truth is, it's widely believed that neither has the votes to pass,'' Mr. Nelson said of the two proposals Democrats are bringing to a vote.
''When the dust settles Saturday we'll probably see no tax cuts for any Americans.'' he said. ''Once that reality sinks in, Nebraskans will want both Republicans and Democrats to get serious and work out a tax-cut bill that can pass soon.''
Behind the scenes, Congressional and White House negotiators continued to work toward what is expected to be the ultimate resolution. But lawmakers on both sides conceded that there was still a chance of an impasse, and as a result the tax rates could expire for everyone at the end of the month.
Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said that Republican supporters in the Tea Party groups should look closely at the Republicans' tax policies.
''If they think it's O.K. to raise taxes for the embattled middle class because they're going to pout if we don't give more money to millionaires, it really is time for the people of America to take up pitchforks,'' Mrs. McCaskill said. ''And all those people out there in the Tea Party that are angry about the economics of Washington, they really need to look at this.''
She continued: ''They need to pull back the curtain and realize that you've got a Republican Party that's not worried about the people in the Tea Party. They're worried about people that can't decide which home to go to over the Christmas holidays. They're worried about the people who think they may take a jaunt to Europe for the New Year. They're not worried about those people that are packing those town halls, because those folks are the middle class.''
But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said Republicans wanted to keep the lower tax rates for the middle class and for the rich. ''The only difference is Senate Republicans want to do more,'' Mr. Hatch said in a floor speech. ''In this slow-growth environment, we don't want to raise taxes on anyone right now.''

HEADLINE: Massey Energy's Chief Is Quitting, Renewing Talk of a Takeover

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Don L. Blankenship, the embattled chief executive of Massey Energy, resigned Friday in a move that might enable the company to improve relations with federal regulators but might also hasten a takeover.
Mr. Blankenship, 60, and Massey, one of the country's largest coal producers, have been under fire since an explosion in April at a mine in West Virginia in which 29 workers were killed. The explosion, at the Upper Big Branch mine, was the nation's worst coal mining accident in 40 years.
Since then, the company has been hit by civil and criminal investigations and damage suits, and regulators have stepped up investigations of several more company mines for possible safety infractions. 
''After almost three decades at Massey, it is time for me to move on,'' Mr. Blankenship said in a statement. His resignation will be effective Dec. 31.
He will be succeeded by Baxter F. Phillips Jr., president of Massey, as chief executive and by retired Adm. Bobby Inman, a former senior Central Intelligence Agency official and the lead independent director on the Massey board, as nonexecutive chairman.
Reports of possible takeover bids have been swirling for more than a month. The leading contender has been Alpha Natural Resources, which has already made a bid. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel company, and Arch Coal have also expressed interest.
Several Indian coal companies are thought to be interested in buying assets from Massey. Such a deal would enable Massey to meet rising liabilities that have resulted from the accident and still remain independent.
It was not immediately clear what effect Mr. Blankenship's surprise resignation would have on the future of the company. Investment bankers with an interest in coal companies have said that Mr. Blankenship personally has opposed a takeover.
However, his resignation may help soothe the harsh relations between Massey and regulators, which have been stoked by his public and frequent claims that the company's safety measures were more than adequate.
He argued that the Upper Big Branch accident was probably caused by leakage of natural gas from a crack in the mine rather than from unsafe mining practices like excess coal dust and impaired monitoring devices.
''The resignation could make the relationship on the federal side improve because it may be perceived as an attempt to clean house at the top,'' said Chris Ruppel, managing director and group head of renewables at Execution Noble, an international investment firm. But Mr. Ruppel added, ''I think it will help a takeover. When you have a transition, it makes a company more vulnerable. You don't have a steady hand. The whole court is now changed.''
Massey directors have said they are open to a buyout.
A company news release gave no hint that Mr. Blankenship, who was chairman as well as chief executive, was forced to resign. Mr. Phillips thanked Mr. Blankenship for his service and said in the statement, ''This is a strong and successful coal company, and I will work hard to match and surpass its success in the future.'' Mr. Phillips has been president since November 2008.
Massey has the largest reserves of metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, of any American mining company. It stands to grow with the large increase in exports to countries like India and Brazil that rely heavily on coal for steel production. Since the Upper Big Branch accident, however, the company has spent $150 million in related expenses. And last quarter it reported a loss of more than $41 million, in large part because of a slowdown in production mostly caused by tightened regulatory oversight.
A merger with Alpha Natural Resources would create a global coal behemoth. The two already are the largest metallurgical coal producers and have the largest reserves of any American mining companies.
The United States is the only major producer with the rail and port infrastructure to ramp up exports quickly in the next several years. For ArcelorMittal, Massey's coal assets would provide ready access to coal at any market price and protection from natural disasters like floods in other coal-producing countries.
Mr. Blankenship is known as an outspoken skeptic of global warming theories, which he has characterized as a hoax that endangers the American economy. He came into prominence during a bitter mining strike in the 1980s, when as a manager he fiercely resisted making concessions to unions. The unions ended up making concessions, and Massey eventually became nearly union-free. Over the years, he has used his wealth and company power to become a force in West Virginia politics, chiefly to reduce environmental and safety regulations.

HEADLINE: New Edict in Ivory Coast Sets Up Standoff With 2 Presidents

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- Defying international observers and the country's own electoral commission, officials tied to President Laurent Gbagbo on Friday declared him the winner of a landmark election in this troubled West African nation, potentially setting the stage for the kind of violence and division that the long-awaited voting was supposed to prevent.
The announcement, made by the Constitutional Council, came only a day after the country's top election official said Mr. Gbagbo's challenger had won the election by a solid margin, 54.1 to 45.9 percent -- a result the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, also endorsed on Friday. The United Nations has a role in certifying the elections, and both Mr. Ban and his longtime special representative here made it clear there was only one winner of last Sunday's vote: the opposition candidate, Alassane Ouattara. 
The conflicting declarations left the country in a strange limbo, with two men declared president, and on Friday Mr. Gbagbo's government found itself under increasing isolation, some of it self-imposed. It has ordered the country's borders sealed, blocked all foreign television and radio broadcasts -- much of the population gets its news from French broadcasters -- and imposed a strict dusk-to-dawn curfew.
President Obama issued a statement congratulating Mr. Ouattara. He urged ''all parties, including incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo, to acknowledge and respect this result, and to allow Cote d'Ivoire to move forward toward a peaceful, democratic future, leaving long years of conflict and missed opportunities in the past.''
The streets of this economic capital were largely deserted except for troops, police officers and occasional bands of chanting youth, some of them Gbagbo supporters. Shops were shut tight, anticipating the street violence -- often mobilized by Mr. Gbagbo's camp, political scientists say -- that sometimes accompanies political tension here.
Calls from Washington and other foreign capitals to respect last Sunday's vote, which was characterized as largely fair by the European Union and the United Nations, have multiplied. But Mr. Gbagbo showed no signs of backing down. State television announced that he would be sworn in Saturday as president.
For years, he ignored calls from abroad to hold elections, staying in office five years after his legal term expired by postponing the vote. On Friday, Mr. Gbagbo, a former professor and historian, appeared set to continue in that vein, with legal justifications for his continued tenure fully mobilized.
Paul Yao N'Dre, the head of the Constitutional Council and a close ally of the president, announced Friday afternoon on national television that he was throwing out vote totals from the nine departments in the country's northern tier -- the stronghold of Mr. Ouattara -- because of what Mr. N'Dre called ''flagrant irregularities.'' At the end of it, Mr. N'Dre said, ''Laurent Gbagbo is declared president of the republic.''
Earlier, Mr. Ouattara's camp had drawn its own line in the sand. ''Maybe Laurent Gbagbo thinks he can stage a new putsch in 2010,'' a spokesman for Mr. Ouattara, Amadou Gon Coulibaly, told a roomful of reporters here at the fading luxury hotel that is their headquarters. ''But this doesn't change anything. The people of Cote d'Ivoire have spoken. Laurent Gbagbo is beaten.''
Later, Mr. Ouattara declared himself the ''elected president.''
Years of political confrontation here, with its coups and countercoups, civil war, street violence and postponed elections, seemed poised to repeat itself. The country has been divided between north and south since a 2002 civil war, and it had been hoped that the election would unify it.
A front-page headline in a newspaper close to Mr. Gbagbo translated as ''France's Coup d'Etat Has Once Again Failed,'' singling out the former colonial power that has been the target of the president's crowd-stirring orations in the past.
Late Friday, the few pedestrians out as curfew approached spoke anxiously, and sometimes angrily, about the standoff that was repeating itself in a country that was once a magnet for the region's immigrants but that now has steadily rising rates of poverty and unemployment.
The announcement that Mr. Gbagbo was the winner ''is going to bring on lots of bad things in this country,'' said Charles Adou, 36 and unemployed. ''Mr. Gbagbo doesn't want us to go forward.
Referring to Mr. N'Dre, who declared Mr. Gbagbo's victory, Michel Koffi, 28 and unemployed, said, ''You put your friend at the head of an institution, you know what the result is going to be.''
Analysts foresaw no quick resolution to the standoff. One unknown factor is which way the army, currently under Mr. Gbagbo's control, will turn.
''He's playing his all,'' said Richard Banegas, a political scientist at the Sorbonne in Paris. ''He is extremely pugnacious, and he controls a lot of the street forces. He's gone into a Plan B, a strategy of tension, a kind of Mugabe plan.''

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Showing Signs Of New Bubble

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM and EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
In a memorable scene in the movie ''The Social Network,'' Sean Parker, the investor played by Justin Timberlake, leans over the table and tells the founders of Facebook in a conspiratorial tone: ''A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion dollars.''
These days in Silicon Valley, a billion dollars seems downright quaint. The enthusiasm for social networking and mobile apps has venture capitalists clamoring to give money to young companies.
The exuberance has given rise to an elite club of start-ups - all younger than seven years and all worth billions. Successive investments in Twitter have reportedly increased its value 33 percent, to $4 billion, while Zynga, creator of the popular Facebook game FarmVille, is worth more than $5 billion. 
Google was willing to pay $6 billon for Groupon, an online coupon company that was valued at $1.35 billion only eight months ago. And Groupon was willing to reject the bid on Friday evening, presumably because it could sell for even more money later.
Less than a decade after the dot-com bust taught Wall Street and Silicon Valley investors that what goes up does not keep going up forever, a growing number of entrepreneurs and a few venture capitalists are beginning to wonder if investments in tech start-ups are headed toward another big bust.
The chief evidence, according to industry experts and analysts, is the way venture capitalists and established companies are clamoring to give money to young companies, including those with only a shred of an idea. They are piling into me-too start-ups that imitate popular Web companies that already received financing. Companies that involve social shopping, mobile photo sharing and new social networking are finding it easy to attract investors because no one wants to miss the next big thing.
Yammer, a system for sending Twitter-like messages inside businesses, recently raised $25 million, while investors reportedly signed a check for close to $30 million for a niche blogging site called Tumblr. GroupMe, a new group messaging app for cellphones, raised $9 million. Path, an iPhone app for sharing only photos on a social network limited to just 50 people, received $2.5 million. Its competitor, Picplz, scored $5 million. And those are just within the last few weeks.
It has some venture capitalists scratching their heads.
''I'm not saying Quora, Foursquare, Square aren't eventually worth a lot of money, but the price to pay to get into those games is kind of amazing - $50 to $80 million?'' said Dave McClure, founding partner of 500 Startups, a technology incubator in Silicon Valley. ''These companies are in big markets with proven founders, so maybe not absolutely crazy but certainly eyebrow-raising.''
Fred Wilson, a prominent venture capitalist, said he had watched the trend accelerate over the last six to nine months. ''I am seeing many more unnatural acts from investors happening,'' he said in a recent blog post. He attributes it to competition among investors eager to participate in popular young start-ups. And he notes, ''I have never seen phases like this end nicely.''
No one really knows if there is a bubble until after one pops. Nevertheless, there are many signs of froth. For example, enthusiasm for closely held Facebook shares has run so high that private investors are trading derivatives of it.
''I always get a little nervous about bubbles when five different angel investors ask me to join their brand new angel funds'' in one week, said Alex Gould, Leadership Scholar of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. And although the rapid-fire pace of investment in popular Web companies feels reminiscent of the investing craze that led to the dot-com bust a decade ago, there are a few significant differences.
For starters, this is not a stock market bubble. None of the companies are publicly traded.
Mr. Gould said that while ''bubble behavior doesn't change,'' the culture of high-flying start-ups like Flooz.com, Pets.com and theGlobe.com making initial public offerings is largely nonexistent. Those did not fare well, though companies like Amazon have continued to prosper.
Instead, entrepreneurs are increasingly looking to large technology companies like Microsoft, Apple or Google with mountains of cash, not the stock market.
Those three companies have about $90 billion in cash on their books. McKinsey & Company calculates that the largest software and hardware companies have enough excess cash on hand to buy nearly all of the tech industry's medium-sized companies.
Although the volume of deals is expected to swell, financiers are much more conservative in the amounts they are investing in each company. ''Back in the '90s, companies got funded for five times the amount that Tumblr raised and didn't have anything close to a business model,'' said Roger Ehrenberg, founder and manager partner of IA Ventures. ''People were getting $50 to $200 million a pop and it brought down an entire industry.''
The frenzy is as much the result of simple laws of supply and demand as the herd mentality. Thanks to the constantly falling cost of computing power, a start-up needs less money to get off the ground.
Meanwhile, more wealthy people are viewing investing in tech as a hobby, which has increased the competition.
''Investing in technology has become fashionable,'' Mr. Ehrenberg said. ''It used to be that angel investing was the province of wealthy men. Now its become the province of everyone.''
Some venture capitalists, hungry for growth and troubled by weak returns, have moved toward smaller investments, hoping to catch the next Facebook in its infancy.
''I think at the high end, it's not that frothy, but there's a lot of exuberance in the early-stage stuff,'' said Chris Sacca, an angel investor who has decided to temporarily hold off on new investments until valuations drift lower. ''A lot of the valuations there don't make a lot of sense.''
Most Silicon Valley investors still see no signs of gloom and doom. Ron Conway, a San Francisco financier who has invested in more than 500 companies, including Facebook, Zappos, Google and Twitter, says he does not think there is any bubble.
''All the start-ups today have business models and business cases that make them viable,'' he said in an e-mail. ''In 1999 when the bubble happened many companies did not have business models and advertising on the Web was very immature.''
Jeff Clavier, managing partner at SoftTech VC and a well-known Silicon Valley angel investor who has financed companies like Mint and Ustream, said that over the next 12 to 18 months the real challenge for start-ups flush with venture cash would be proving they were worth the investment or risk having to fold their companies.
''There may not be a big implosion, but down the road there will be a bunch of blood and tears,'' he said.
''The music is going to stop and people will realize there aren't enough chairs for companies to get the next round of financing.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Inside the Beltway: A Deficit of Purpose

 BODY:
A sense of resolve and a clear purpose should not be partisan commodities, yet, in Washington, only the Republicans seem to have them. They know exactly what they want and pursue it with ruthless efficiency: preserve all the Bush-era tax cuts, no matter the cost, and make sure President Obama gets nothing done. 
In the last few weeks, Republicans have blocked or vowed to kill: an extension of jobless benefits; the first real arms reduction treaty with the Russians in nearly a decade; the repeal of ''don't ask, don't tell''; and, most significantly for the nation's financial future, the expiration of unnecessary and expensive tax cuts for the rich.
Where has the president been through all this, as the sand runs out on a Congress with two Democratic majorities? He has issued a few mild statements and urged everyone to work together, when everyone knows the Republicans will refuse.
He met with Republican leaders on Tuesday, calmly noted some ''differences'' on the budget, and named negotiators to find ''sensible common ground.'' On Friday, while a dark jobs report dominated the news, Mr. Obama greeted the troops in Afghanistan. Republicans greeted his outstretched hand on domestic issues with the back of theirs.
Mr. Obama still seems coolly unperturbed about Republican intransigence, and his negotiators are apparently willing to consider trading an extension of the tax cuts for votes on the treaty and the unemployment benefits, now more vital than ever. But imagine if he had taken to the airwaves, raised his voice and said he would not allow tax cuts for the top 2 percent of households when the money could better be spent on creating jobs?
There are limits to this kind of jawboning, of course, and he might still have lost the battle. But at least the public would know the president has core positions. Unlike the complexities of health care reform, a tax cut for the rich is easy to understand at a time of high unemployment. A new CBS News poll shows that only 26 percent of Americans support continuing the high-end tax break, which in the 2008 campaign Mr. Obama unambiguously vowed to end.
In the absence of presidential leadership, the Republicans have a much stronger hand. The dismal November jobs report, which showed that average wages grew by a Scrooge-like penny an hour and unemployment rose to 9.8 percent from 9.6 percent, made unemployment benefits a more valuable hostage.
This need not have happened if Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats had forcefully asserted their agenda before the midterm election and held a vote on the tax cuts. Now, if Democratic negotiators are going to trade the jobless benefits and the New Start treaty for the high-end tax cuts, they should at least ensure that expiring tax credits for low- and middle-income working Americans from the stimulus program also be extended.
It may be that Mr. Obama still believes that bipartisan gestures can overcome extreme policy differences. But the rest of Washington woke up from that dream long ago. It has become a snare. Mr. Obama will have to spend the next two years contesting an implacable opposition. It would be a terrible mistake to begin by offering up core principles.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Rises to 9.8% In Blow to Recovery Hopes

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
After several months of improvement, hiring by businesses slowed to a crawl in November, a development that is sure to intensify the debate over what can and should be done to reignite the economy.
The United States added a total of just 39,000 jobs last month, down from an upwardly revised gain of 172,000 in October, the Labor Department reported on Friday. With local governments shedding jobs, the additions in the private sector were too small to reduce the ranks of the unemployed or even to keep pace with people entering the work force.
The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey of households, rose to 9.8 percent in November. It was the highest jobless rate since April and up from 9.6 percent in October.
The outlook remains bleak. More than 15 million people are out of work, among them 6.3 million who have been jobless for six months or longer. Many are about to exhaust their unemployment benefits, which have been extended repeatedly by the government because of the severity of the downturn. 
The latest snapshot of the labor market cast a pall over what had been a brightening picture of a steadying economy. In recent weeks, the average number of people applying for unemployment benefits has generally declined. Pending home sales topped forecasts in October, while last month retail sales posted one of the biggest increases in years.
The anemic job figures could lend support to the Obama administration's call to extend unemployment benefits as well as to recent efforts by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to continue to stimulate the economy.
Plodding economic growth, however, seems insufficient to persuade businesses to hire.
''Obviously this is a disappointing report, to say the least,'' James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global, said of the monthly jobs data. But given other promising signs, he said, he did not believe the recovery had been derailed. ''Certainly the weight of evidence is that the economy is improving.''
Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said, ''This highlights that the recovery is fragile.'' In addition to pressing for an extension of unemployment benefits, he called for a continuation of what are known as the Bush tax cuts for the middle class as well as a collection of proposals that the White House is now referring to as the Obama tax cuts.
''To have taxes go up on 98 percent of Americans,'' Mr. Goolsbee said, ''would pose a risk to the aggregate economic performance.''
The weak November job numbers will also feed the politically charged debate over whether the government should seek to aggressively reduce the deficit or be willing to spend more until the economy returns to better health.
The stock markets shrugged off the report, which was well shy of the forecast for a gain of 150,000 jobs, as all the major indexes rose slightly on Friday.
Part of the surprise in the November report was that layoffs, which had subsided earlier this year, picked up again. The number of people who were unemployed because they had been laid off or had concluded a temporary assignment increased by 390,000.
Private companies, which have been hiring since the beginning of the year, added 50,000 jobs in November. Most of those increases came in the temporary help and health care sectors. Manufacturers, which had demonstrated some strength earlier in the year, eliminated 13,000 jobs, and despite recent sales increases, the retail sector shed more than 28,000 jobs. One sign of continued insecurity among employers was that temporary workers accounted for 40,000 of the jobs added in the private sector. Staffing firms said companies were continuing to use contract workers to fill gaps rather than binding themselves to permanent employees.
Employers are ''still in the position of saying, 'Hey, we need help, but only when we absolutely have to do we commit to permanent hiring,' '' said Tig Gilliam, chief executive of Adecco North America. ''That uncertainty takes time to overcome.''
Included in the latest report were revisions for previous months. The agency said that the economy added 172,000 jobs in October, more than the 151,000 it originally reported.
Many risks remain for the economy. The latest report showed 14,000 jobs were cut by local governments, a decline that could accelerate if states and towns were required to prune further to deal with shrinking budgets and larger deficits.
With President Obama's deficit commissionexamining long-term spending cuts, unemployment benefits expiring and a Congressional fight looming over tax cuts, consumers could become more reluctant to spend despite some recent signs of renewed vigor. That, in turn, could cause businesses to reconsider hiring plans.
Advocates for the unemployed expressed dismay over the latest jobs report. ''I'm still trying to get my jaw off the floor,'' said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project. ''What it does is it kills the story that maybe I thought we could start telling, which was steady improvement. If we had four months in a row of improving jobs numbers, we would still need a lot of work to get back to full employment, but now it's not even moving in the right direction.''
The absence of robust hiring has puzzled some because companies are enjoying strong earnings and building large cash reserves.
''A lot of this profit increase has come about from cost-cutting,'' said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist in HSBC's global banking and markets unit. ''And I think a lot of businesses are saying they don't have the pricing power they'd like, and they're cautious about growth in final demand, and that may be reflected back to decisions about investment and job creation.''
Analysts generally estimate that the economy needs to add 100,000 to 125,000 jobs a month simply to keep up with new entrants to the labor force. So if employers keep hiring at the pace of recent months, it will do little to help reduce the unemployment rate for some time. At November's pace, the unemployment rate could actually rise further. Some have predicted an unemployment rate of 10 percent next year.
There was little sign that companies were straining to meet demand by pushing existing workers. The average workweek held steady at 34.3 hours, while average hourly earnings increased by just 1 percent, to $22.75. Usually, growth in wages and the number of hours worked point to more hiring.
The median length of time the unemployed had been out of work rose to 21.6 weeks, the third consecutive monthly increase. For those who have been searching for work for more than six months, this is a particularly discouraging prospect.
''I have looked high and low,'' said Melissa Barone, who was laid off from a job in technical support 14 months ago. ''I have a college degree and a ton of technical skills, but I can't find a job.'' Ms. Barone, 42, lives in St. Clair Shores, Mich., near Detroit. She has applied for hundreds of jobs but has yet to receive an offer.
If the economy is improving, that is news to Ms. Barone. ''It doesn't seem that way here,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Trichet Defends Euro and European Economic Vigor

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, tried on Friday to bolster confidence in the outlook for the euro zone and to remind investors that budgetary problems were not confined to Europe alone.
Mr. Trichet made the comments a day after the central bank announced its continued support for struggling banks and entered the market to buy the bonds of debt-ridden countries. 
''Since the start of the recovery, which in Europe was the third quarter of last year, the economy is going a little better quarter after quarter,'' Mr. Trichet said in Paris.
A continued recovery hinges on the ability of countries to consolidate their budgets and to a restructuring of the real economy, he said.
''The euro is a credible currency,'' he added. ''The euro is a currency that is considered just as credible for the next 10 years as for the last 12 years.''
''I don't say we should be complacent -- things are still very difficult,'' he added.
Mr. Trichet studiously avoided singling out specific countries to blame for the sovereign debt crisis, which emerged because of creeping indebtedness. Instead, he said, a ''quantum leap'' was needed in the zone's fiscal and economic governance.
Specifically, he called for a ''quasi-federation -- not a political federation'' to better coordinate ''the budgetary surveillance processes and rules that we have.''
''We need to see equivalent economic behavior,'' he said, adding there was a need for ''quasi-automaticity of sanctions'' against countries that allow budget consolidation to slip.
And Mr. Trichet tried to remind investors that while euro countries had suffered the most, budgetary problems ran far beyond this region.
''We are all, in the industrialized countries, facing a common problem,'' he said.
The euro zone's overall budget deficit is expected to stand at 6.3 percent of gross domestic product at the end of the year, Mr. Trichet said, compared with 11.3 percent in the United States and 9.6 percent in Japan.
He noted that unemployment rates on the two sides of the Atlantic were not dissimilar, suggesting that the central bank had no need to change its mandate, which hinges on price stability.
Mr. Trichet appeared to nudge euro zone governments -- which already have stepped in to create huge financial guarantee facilities, so far used only by Ireland and Greece -- into playing a more active role.
''All authorities, all institutions have to be up to their responsibilities,'' he said.
Among the suggestions to deal with the debt crisis is one that would expand the European Financial Stability Facility, or E.F.S.F., which can now issue up to 440 billion euros in bonds guaranteed by euro zone members.
''The E.F.S.F. is not enough,'' said Christoph Rieger, head of interest rate strategy at Commerzbank. ''Before long, policy makers will be forced to explore the 'nuclear' option: genuine common issuance.''
On Thursday, the central bank conceded that an extraordinary loan program to banks was still needed into next year. Months earlier, the central bank had indicated that it would be wound down.
Traders said the central bank was also buying Irish and Portuguese debt on open markets on Thursday and Friday, continuing a program begun this year and pushing up bond prices and lowering the cost of borrowing for these countries. Mr. Trichet declined to comment on the bank's bond-buying policy, except to say that the latest data on purchases would be published next week.
The steps taken by the bank appear to have calmed market tensions for now.
Further out, it remains to be seen whether other countries, like Portugal and -- more worrying, because of its size -- Spain, will be driven by investors to accepting financial aid from their neighbors and the International Monetary Fund.
As a result of the recent tensions in bond markets and the central bank's resolve to tackle them, economists at Goldman Sachs said that the bank was now unlikely to raise its ultralow interest rates until the last quarter of 2011; previously the bank had forecast an increase during the third quarter.
''While we think that the recovery is progressing nicely for the euro zone as a whole, the E.C.B., given the experience of the last four weeks, wants to buy additional insurance that a tightening in the monetary stance does not endanger the recovery or the stability of the financial system,'' the economists wrote in a research note.
Mr. Trichet said the seeds of the current turmoil in the markets were sown by government moves, led by France and Germany, to weaken the zone's fiscal rules in 2004 and 2005. That episode appears ''surreal now,'' he said. ''We were beaten when we tried to defend it,'' he said, referring to the stability and growth pact.

HEADLINE: After 30 Years, a Rebirth Is Complete

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Next month, 11 Times Square, a new, glassy 40-story office tower at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, will formally open with its first tenant. Compared with the metamorphosis that has occurred around it, there is nothing extraordinary about the building except for this: Its completion officially marks the end of the long and tortuous redevelopment of Times Square, an effort that began 30 years ago.
The plan, to radically make over 13 acres, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, primarily fronting 42nd Street, outlived three mayors, four governors, two real estate booms and two recessions. It faced widespread derision in the beginning from jaded New Yorkers who were wise to grand plans. It faces occasional derision today from New Yorkers who speak of the old Times Square with newfound fondness.
It embodied both the hubris of urban master planning and its possibilities, and showed the value of ripping up blueprints and starting over in midstream. And it has been a touchstone experience for a city that is now building, or trying to build, several multibillion-dollar projects, including ground zero, the Atlantic Yards, Willets Point and the Hudson Yards. 
''So often, people say New York can't build large-scale projects anymore,'' said Lynne B. Sagalyn, a professor of real estate finance at Columbia University and the author of ''Times Square Roulette: Remaking the City Icon.''
But, Professor Sagalyn said, ''Times Square is an example of how a city was able to think on a grand scale and carry it out.''
''It can take a decade or two for the complete vision to become a reality,'' she continued. ''But it happened here.''
Success is evident. Crime is down significantly from the days when pimps, prostitutes, drug addicts and dope pushers prowled Times Square and the Deuce, as that stretch of 42nd Street was known. The number of tourists is up 74 percent since 1993, to an estimated 36.5 million last year, and attendance at Broadway shows has soared to nearly 12 million.
Morgan Stanley, Allianz Global Investors, Viacom and Conde Nast now make their corporate homes there. Retailers are paying rents as high as $1,400 a square foot, second only to those on chic stretches of Fifth and Madison Avenues.
And while many billboards in Times Square were blank in 1979, today the area is a kaleidoscope of moving images depicting financial institutions, automakers and fashion houses, with the best spots on 1 Times Square's facade commanding as much as $4 million a year in rent.
''The irony is that this place represents in many ways the epitome of free-market capitalism,'' said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance. ''But its transformation is due more to government intervention than just about any other development in the country.''
Times Square, of course, has certain unique qualities that none of the city's current projects enjoy: it sits in the middle of Manhattan, has a rich, century-long history and is recognized internationally as the crossroads of the world. Even at the worst of times, tourists from England to Italy, Algeria to Japan came to New York to have their pictures taken in Times Square.
But the often painful rebirth also took perseverance and a long-term approach, rare characteristics in a city obsessed with making things happen in a New York minute.
The concerted effort began in 1980, when after years of complaints and false starts, Mayor Edward I. Koch and state officials announced the coming rejuvenation of Times Square.
The developer George Klein, who later formed a joint venture with Prudential, was selected to build four sedate skyscrapers at the famous intersection of 42nd Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue. The state would take over the decrepit theaters, evict the peep shows and X-rated movie houses and restore the former dignity. The subway stations would be refurbished, and a huge merchandise mart would be built on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 42nd Streets, across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
The plan envisioned the use of eminent domain, and the owners of the theaters and nearby office towers, like the Durst family, resisted.
There also was criticism of the large tax breaks showered upon developers and tenants in the new Times Square; the Municipal Art Society, a private planning and preservation group, once estimated that the redevelopment would entail more than $1 billion in ''unnecessary'' property tax abatements and other benefits like zoning changes that allowed for taller towers than would otherwise be permitted.
By the time the state had fended off 47 lawsuits brought against the project, a severe recession in 1991 brought the city to its knees. The next year, for the first time, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo failed to mention Times Square in his State of the State address.
Rebecca Robertson, who was then president of the state's 42nd Street Development Project, worried that the whole plan was unraveling. Prudential, which had already put up $241 million for the land, threatened to pull out if it was forced to build towers at a time when it would be hard to fill them with tenants. It was given more time.
But this gloomy period, Ms. Robertson said, also proved to be an opportunity to overhaul the much-criticized development plan, whose four huge skyscrapers were designed more to bury Times Square's sordid past than to celebrate its connection to popular culture.
Ms. Robertson, together with the architect Robert A. M. Stern and the graphic designer Tibor Kalman, devised an interim plan that reconnected with the ''razzmatazz'' of Times Square's past by emphasizing entertainment, big garish signs, an eclectic mix of tenants and glassier, flashier office towers, with lobbies that seemed to flow onto the sidewalk rather than wall it off.
''To me, the market crash was a wonderful time to rethink the whole thing,'' Ms. Robertson said, referring to a stock market crash in 1987. ''We couldn't have gotten our plan through in a hot market. The development pressures would've been way too strong. Everyone would've been talking about what big tenant can we get, and not about restoring popular culture and entertainment.''
The oft-heard complaint about the Disneyfication of Times Square sometimes loses sight of the fact that it was the Walt Disney Company, perhaps more than any other, that helped start the turnaround.
Disney wanted its own Broadway theater, but feared being a lonely outpost on a hostile block. A fierce negotiator despite its Mickey Mouse image, Disney reached an agreement to take over the New Amsterdam theater in the last days of Mayor David N. Dinkins's tenure, got a low-interest loan from the state and prodded officials to sign deals with Madame Tussauds wax museum and the AMC Theaters, which moved in down the block. The restored theater has now been home to two wildly successful Disney plays, the Lion King, which later moved a few blocks away to the Minskoff Theater, and now Mary Poppins.
The economy recovered and then some, and the multicolored Westin Hotel, more movie theaters and the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill soon followed on the north side of 42nd Street. Douglas Durst, an early opponent, built 4 Times Square, the Conde Nast building, on land he acquired from Prudential. Then followed the Reuters building, the Ernst & Young tower and a fourth skyscraper as the wrecking ball demolished hot-dog stands and pornography shops.
One Times Square, the building atop which the ball drops every New Year's Eve, and now the most expensive advertising space in the world, sold for $110 million in 1997, four times what it had fetched just two years earlier after a foreclosure.
The New 42nd Street, the nonprofit group that oversees the redevelopment of seven historic theaters, created the New Victory children's theater with low prices and an award-winning educational program.
Instead of a merchandise mart on Eighth Avenue, there is the New York Times's new headquarters. Over objections from landowners, the state condemned a parcel that was home to 55 businesses, including a technical school, a hat store and sex shops, to build The Times's third headquarters in the neighborhood in a century.
And there is 11 Times Square, on the last parcel to be redeveloped, and a sign of Times Square's progress but also its challenges ahead. It was built speculatively, without tenants already lined up, and is now seeking to fill its floors amid competition from other buildings, including those going up at ground zero. Proskauer Rose, a major law firm and its first occupant, is scheduled to move in next month.
The adoption of a revised redevelopment plan was a critical moment, said Mary Ann Tighe, a real estate executive. ''They recognized that this wasn't going to be Rockefeller Center West,'' she said. ''Each part of the city is unique and demands its own solution.''
One of the last remnants of the old Times Square is Jimmy Glenn, the owner of Jimmy's Corner, a bar on West 44th Street east of Seventh Avenue. A boxing trainer, Mr. Glenn was the owner of the late Times Square Gym, located one floor above 42nd Street; boxers with names like Ali, Frazier and Tyson used to mount the long stairwell to his ring.
Now, he said, ''it's like a pinball machine out there.''
But Mr. Glenn, now 80, does not miss the drug addicts, pornography shops and criminals. ''Everybody loves Times Square now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Which Way for Obama and the G.O.P.?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Tax Reform Vision'' (column, Dec. 3):
David Brooks's vision of tax reform, like classical economics, is based on the illusion that our politicians are rational actors with the best interests of the country at heart. 
That is plausibly true of President Obama, but not of the Republican Party, which long ago decided that this administration's failure was its only worthy goal.
No matter how many Americans remain jobless, or lose their homes, or die of curable illnesses or choke on the dust of the World Trade Center caught in their lungs, Republicans remain dedicated to obstructing anything that might actually help the country, and therefore be claimed by the Obama administration as a success.
Democrats have hardly covered themselves in glory, but the Republican response to Mr. Obama's election is shockingly unpatriotic, and true conservatives should reject it for the nihilism that it is.
David Berman New York, Dec. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
As a social liberal, I was fired up by Paul Krugman's reminder that President Obama continues to lose the media battle with the Republicans by repeatedly making concessions before the start of negotiations instead of taking strong stands (''Freezing Out Hope,'' column, Dec. 3).
As an economic and fiscal centrist, I like David Brooks's call for Mr. Obama to extend tax cuts for all Americans for one year in exchange for extending unemployment benefits, while using that time to revise our broken tax code.
President Obama, the winning strategy for the American people (and your re-election chances) might very well be to adopt Mr. Brooks's recommendation. You need to take an active role in fixing our tax system so that the richest Americans pay their fair share, providing the money to restore our middle class by creating jobs paying middle-class wages. That would represent the hope and change for which we voted.
David Kuziemko Sterling Heights, Mich., Dec. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman has it infuriatingly right. It was bad enough that President Obama pandered to the Republicans with his comment that he regretted not having reached out more and his cynical decision to freeze wages for government workers.
The fact that the Obama administration has put extending the tax cuts for the wealthy back on the table only confirms Mr. Krugman's suggestion that President Obama seems to be ''trying, systematically, to disappoint his once-fervent supporters.''
For many in that group, including me, caving on his repeated campaign promise to restore pre-Bush tax rates for millionaires will be the last straw. Who does Mr. Obama think will champion him in the next election? Doesn't he get that hell hath no fury like a supporter scorned?

HEADLINE: Wall St. Figure in Line For Economic Post

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
Speculation that Roger C. Altman, a prominent Wall Street investment banker and former Treasury deputy secretary, is a leading candidate to become the next director of President Obama's National Economic Council reignited on Friday when he was seen at the White House for a second time in recent weeks. 
Administration officials said Mr. Altman met with members of the economic team; Mr. Obama was away in Afghanistan on a surprise visit, but Mr. Altman had met with the president at the White House in mid-November.
White House officials said Mr. Obama was far from making a decision, but time is running out for finding a replacement for the current director, Lawrence H. Summers. Mr. Summers had planned to leave as early as next Friday, according to associates, though pending issues and the lack of a successor likely will delay his exit until about Dec. 17.
''The president is considering a number of candidates, but no decisions have been made,'' said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman.
The White House has said that Mr. Obama would like to recruit someone with business experience, in part to repair the administration's strained relations with the corporate community. According to people familiar with the search, one prospect who took himself out of contention is Erskine B. Bowles, a former businessman and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who on Friday completed his work as co-chairman of Mr. Obama's debt-reduction commission.
The administration is said to have been frustrated in finding a business candidate because the job of running the National Economic Council requires an ability to navigate the Washington bureaucracy and Congressional politics to develop policy - an ability that few business leaders have, or care to develop.
As for Mr. Altman, some in the administration question whether selecting a Wall Street figure would send the right message, given the public's antipathy toward financiers since the bailouts in recent years. He is the founder of Evercore Partners, a successful boutique investment bank, and previously had worked at the now-defunct Lehman Brothers and the Blackstone Group.
Mr. Altman was an assistant Treasury secretary in the Carter administration. As the deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, he was forced to resign in 1994 after Congressional Republicans criticized his testimony in the Whitewater scandal hearings as inaccurate. In the 2008 presidential contest, he was an adviser to Mr. Obama's Democratic rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Midterm departures gave Mr. Obama an opening to remold an economic team that was, given the recession he inherited, heavy with academic economists and crisis-tested government officials - notably Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary and president of Harvard University. But Mr. Obama filled two earlier vacancies - for budget director and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers - with officials from within the administration.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Debate Shifts to When to End 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The commandant of the Marine Corps and the chiefs of staff of the Army and Air Force sternly warned a Senate panel on Friday that now was not the time to allow gay men and women to serve openly in the armed forces.
But in a hearing about whether to repeal ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the 17-year-old policy that requires gay or bisexual military men and women to keep their sexual orientation secret or face discharge, all three said the military should, or at least could, repeal the law in the future. 
Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the chief of staff of the Army, appeared to have moved from an earlier position of serious concern about repeal to one of reluctant willingness. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he could not recommend repeal right now because it would add stress and complications for combat units. But, he added, ''Properly implemented, I do not envision that it would keep us from accomplishing our worldwide missions, including combat operations.''
General Casey, whose views carry weight because he commands the largest of the services, concluded that the military could handle repeal with ''moderate risk'' to its ability to do its job. A Pentagon study released this week on the effect of repeal concluded that the risk would be low, an assessment shared by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
As expected, Gen. James F. Amos, the commandant of the Marine Corps, remained the most opposed to repeal among the service chiefs, and he took a hard line. ''If the law is changed, successfully implementing repeal and assimilating openly homosexual Marines into the tightly woven fabric of our combat units has strong potential for disruption at the small unit level,'' he told the panel.
Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the chief of staff of the Air Force, recommended not carrying out any repeal until 2012 because of the strain the military is bearing now. ''I do not agree with the study assessment that the short-term risk to military effectiveness is low,'' he said. He added that his forces in Afghanistan were carrying a heavy load.
The hearing was relatively serene compared with one on Thursday, when Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has been the leading opponent to repeal on Capitol Hill, tensely squared off with Mr. Gates and Admiral Mullen, who both have said it is urgent that Congress change the law. Mr. McCain held back from the service chiefs on Friday, although he made it clear that he remained adamantly opposed and that he considered the debate over gay and bisexual people serving openly in the military as little more than a sideshow.
''Our economy is in the tank and the American people want that issue addressed,'' Mr. McCain told the service chiefs. ''And the military is functioning in the most efficient, most professional, most courageous fashion.'' He concluded that it was wrong ''to somehow believe that this is some kind of compelling issue.''
Nonetheless, there seemed a sense of inevitability among Republicans on the panel that repeal of the law, a campaign promise of President Obama, would eventually occur, although perhaps not in the current Congress. The House has voted to authorize repeal, and there appear to be enough ''yes'' votes in the current Senate, but it is unclear whether there is enough time left before the end of the year for the measure to advance.
One Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, said Friday that he supported repeal, which was a switch from his vote in the spring against changing the policy.
Of the three service chiefs who oppose repeal at present, General Casey appeared to be the one most swayed by the results of the Pentagon study. The review found deep concerns about changing the law among combat forces but concluded that 70 percent of service members over all thought repeal would have little effect on the ability of their units to work together.
As General Casey explained it, the presumption underpinning ''don't ask, don't tell'' is ''that the presence of a gay or lesbian service member in a unit causes an unacceptable risk to good order and discipline.'' He told the panel: ''After reading the report, I don't believe that's true anymore and I don't believe a substantial majority of our soldiers believe that's true.''
When General Schwartz recommended a delay until 2012, the time frame seemed to exasperate Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee and who has long supported repeal. ''Why is 2012 the right time?'' Mr. Levin asked General Schwartz. ''There may be people in combat.''
General Schwartz agreed with that.
''You don't know how many people will be in combat in 2012, and yet, 'Hey, do it then, not now,' '' Mr. Levin said. A short time later he concluded that ''delaying this until 2012 is totally arbitrary.''
Both sides cited comments from active-duty service members to make their cases. General Amos, for example, read aloud comments that a Marine platoon commander made about his unit in an online survey: ''Despite differences, we are so close that we anticipate each other's next move in garrison and in combat. Our ability to do our job is predicated on this kind of relationship. If you were to add any element of sexual competition, intra-unit sexuality or hesitance in trust, it would unquestionably prevent those bonds from forming or immediately destroy them if introduced.''
But a short time later, Mr. Levin looked at General Amos and read aloud a quote in the Pentagon's report from a Special Operations commando: ''We have a gay guy in the unit,'' Mr. Levin read. ''He's big, he's mean and he kills lots of bad guys. No one cared that he was gay.''
Three other military officials at the hearing supported repeal of the law right now: Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Adm. Gary Roughead, the chief of naval operations; and Adm. Robert J. Papp Jr., the commandant of the Coast Guard.

HEADLINE: Obama Offers Hope For Debt Panel's Plan

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama said he would consider adopting some of the recommendations in the provocative debt-reduction plan from his fiscal commission, which wrapped up work on Friday with more of a bipartisan accord than even its members had expected.
Soon after the commission finished -- with 11 of its 18 members backing the package of deep spending cuts and revenue increases -- Mr. Obama issued a statement praising the panel's work. Without embracing any particular ideas, he said he would review them all as he looks for ways to ''correct our fiscal course.''
''The commission's majority report includes a number of specific proposals that I -- along with my economic team -- will study closely in the coming weeks as we develop our budget and our priorities for the coming year,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement distributed by the White House as the president visited troops in Afghanistan.
The plan is an attempt to shave $4 trillion from projected deficits over the coming decade. It reflects the view that chronic deficits and mounting debt, driven by fast-rising health care costs and an aging population, must be addressed aggressively even as the economy requires government help to recover from a deep recession. 
The package would make deep cuts -- most of them starting in 2012, given the economy's fragility -- in both domestic and military spending. It would overhaul the tax code, eliminating or reducing the $1 trillion a year in popular tax breaks for individuals and corporations. The resulting revenues would be used mostly to slash income tax rates, but also to reduce deficits.
To ensure the solvency of Social Security for 75 years, it would raise payroll taxes for the affluent and reduce future benefits, including by slowly raising the retirement age for full benefits to 69 from 67 by 2075.
With the administration at work on Mr. Obama's State of the Union address and the release of his annual budget in late January, officials had said privately that there was interest in borrowing the commission's calls for overhauling the tax code and fixing Social Security -- if the panel could show the way to a bipartisan agreement. But the administration is far from such decisions as it weighs how to proceed now that Congressional Republicans have won control of the House and picked up seats in the Senate, beginning next month.
Several Republicans welcomed the commission's plan, but were vague about the specific elements they might seek to turn into policy. Senator Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, a member of the commission who supported the plan, called for ''immediate and aggressive action.'' And the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, issued a statement saying, ''It is my hope that this effort will serve as a catalyst for achieving the spending and entitlement reform that our country so desperately needs.''
But in a sign of where the political opposition might be most intense, the plan was rejected by the three House Republicans on the panel, all of whom will hold key positions in the new Congress.
Their position exposed a break with Senate Republicans, all three of whom on the commission supported the blueprint. That split in part reflects the different roles the Republicans will have in the House and Senate. While Republicans have picked up seats in the Senate, they remain in the minority there. House Republicans, having won a majority after campaigning as a conservative alternative to the Obama administration, say they are obligated to fulfill their vision rather than compromise. They also face pressure from the Tea Party movement, which has made slashing government spending the centerpiece of its agenda.
The commission did not formally vote because support for the plan written by the co-chairmen -- Erskine B. Bowles, the president of the University of North Carolina system and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican Senate leader from Wyoming -- fell three votes short of the 14-vote supermajority required to send the package to Congress under the terms of Mr. Obama's executive order that established the panel.
The 11 supporters were evenly split between the parties -- five Democrats and five Republicans, along with an independent, Ann M. Fudge, the former chief executive of Young & Rubicam.
Despite that bipartisan majority, the outcome at best sent ambiguous signals about whether the White House and Congress could reach an agreement, given the political pain behind the tax and spending decisions that are required.
Several supporters said that although they backed the thrust of the plan, they would not vote for it as actual legislation given their opposition to various provisions. One such supporter was Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat and Mr. Obama's closest Senate ally. He said the package was not balanced between spending cuts and tax increases and it took ''too much away from programs that support the neediest.''
Yet even the plan's opponents said it should serve as ''a template,'' in the words of Representative Xavier Becerra, a Democrat from California.
Another opponent on the panel, Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union, said, ''This plan deserves a vote, and this president needs to make sure that by the State of the Union he also has his own plan and his own leadership because this is the issue of our time that must be solved.''
While the committee's deliberations underscored the deep divisions over how to address the nation's fiscal imbalances, they also suggested opportunities for agreement between Democrats who generally oppose reductions in domestic spending, especially for Social Security and Medicare, and Republicans who oppose tax increases.
Members of both parties, for example, hailed the proposed tax overhaul because it would simplify the code, rid it of costly and confusing tax breaks and allow for lower rates. Republicans as well as Democrats supported cuts from military programs. And some Democrats endorsed the Social Security changes, with Mr. Durbin acknowledging that he had shocked his liberal allies by endorsing a slow increase in the retirement age for full benefits.
While the package will not get a vote in Congress, groups from the left and right and from business and labor mobilized as a precaution in opposition. And there were signs that the panel's work had encouraged lawmakers who favored tough steps to reduce deficits. Fourteen moderate Senate Democrats, led by Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, wrote to Congressional leaders on Friday urging comprehensive action on a similar package.
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and a commission member who supported the plan, said, ''I never thought there was much prospect of getting 14 votes'' to meet the threshold for a vote in Congress. But even with 11 votes, he added, ''We have provided, I believe, a strong message to our colleagues and to the country of what has to be done.''

HEADLINE: Obama Drops In on Troops in Afghanistan, but Weather Has Its Own Surprise

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama swept into a dark and windy Afghanistan on Friday for a surprise holiday season visit with troops as the nine-year American-led war heads into a new phase intended to finally begin transferring control of the country to Afghan forces.
Wrapped in a tight cocoon of secrecy and security, Mr. Obama landed at Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul, on a pitch-black evening and told thousands of American service members who greeted him that they had begun to turn the tide in a war that has frustrated commanders and soldiers alike for nearly a decade.
But Afghanistan confounded the president's plans, just as it has foreign forces over the centuries. Its notoriously gusty winds whipped around him at 45 m.p.h. and dust clouds limited visibility, grounding the helicopter that was to take him to Kabul to meet with President Hamid Karzai. 
A backup plan to confer via video teleconference then was scrapped due to technical problems. The two leaders talked by telephone for 15 minutes, never laying eyes on each other, even though they were just 35 miles apart.
White House officials played down the glitches, saying Mr. Obama's main mission during his three-and-a-half-hour stay was to show support for the troops heading into another holiday season far from home. The president had met with Mr. Karzai just two weeks ago at a NATO meeting in Lisbon, where they set forth a plan to gradually start turning over the lead role in the war to Afghan forces next year, with the aim of ending the foreign combat mission by 2014.
''Thanks to your service, we are making important progress,'' Mr. Obama, wearing a bomber jacket and dark slacks, told more than 3,800 troops at Bagram. ''We said we were going to break the Taliban's momentum, and that's what you're doing. You're going on the offense, tired of playing defense, targeting their leaders, pushing them out of their strongholds.
''Today,'' he continued, ''we can be proud that there are fewer areas under Taliban control and more Afghans have a chance to build a more hopeful future.''
He added, ''Because of the service of the men and women of the United States military, because of the progress you're making, we look forward to a new phase next year, the beginning of a transition to Afghan responsibility.''
The president's remarks offered a more positive assessment of the situation on the ground than he has in some time, influenced perhaps by the optimism expressed in recent weeks by his commanding general, Gen. David H. Petraeus. American military forces have tripled, to 100,000, on Mr. Obama's watch, and he has vowed to begin reducing the number of troops next July.
But others in Washington and Kabul have been more skeptical of the claims of progress, noting the unabated and pervasive corruption of Mr. Karzai's government, the resilience of the insurgency despite escalated attacks and the debacle of recent peace talks that turned out to be held not with a senior Taliban leader but an impostor.
Mr. Obama, too, dwelled on the continuing cost of the war, noting the platoon he met that had lost six members, the five Purple Hearts he awarded in the base hospital and the Medal of Honor he presented recently to an American soldier at the White House.
The atmosphere appeared more subdued than in past presidential visits, as Mr. Obama noted that ''many of you have stood before the solemn battle cross, display of boots, a rifle, a helmet, and said goodbye to a fallen comrade.''
Mr. Obama's visit came at a pivotal moment in the war on both sides. In Washington, the administration is completing a review of the surge and counterinsurgency strategy that the president approved a year ago, although officials played down its import. ''I don't think you'll see any immediate adjustments,'' Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, the president's top Afghan policy adviser, told reporters on Air Force One.
In Kabul, an election held on Sept. 18 has yet to result in a sitting Parliament, as Mr. Karzai has neither endorsed nor condemned its outcome. And State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks and made public on Friday laid bare the unvarnished and dubious view of American diplomats toward Mr. Karzai and his government. The cables questioned whether Mr. Karzai will ever be ''a responsible partner'' and depicted him as ''erratic'' and ''indecisive and unprepared.''
But unlike his last trip to Afghanistan in March, when Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Karzai about corruption and the frictions were on public display, the president this time was intent on working around the divisions, and aides said the cables did not come up in the call between the presidents.
As has become customary under both Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush, the trip to Afghanistan was carried out in clandestine fashion. Mr. Obama slipped out of the White House without notice on Thursday night after presiding over a Hanukkah celebration, accompanied only by his personal aide, Reggie Love, Secret Service agents and members of his support staff.
At Andrews Air Force Base, he was joined by General Lute; his national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, and other top aides. Air Force One took off in secret at 10 p.m. A small pool of journalists was brought along on condition that they not report on the trip until the president landed in Afghanistan.
Many White House officials, and most of the Afghan government, were not informed. The president's advance schedule for Friday listed him meeting with advisers in the Oval Office and then making a public statement on the latest unemployment report, with the schedule reporting that ''the location of the statement is T.B.D.,'' or to be determined. Aides said Mr. Karzai's government was informed in the last few days.
Mr. Obama's trip was the third time he had left the United States in the month since his party absorbed major losses in midterm elections. He left Washington at a very busy moment, as he struggles with Congress over a host of issues like tax cuts, deficit spending, arms control, gays in the military and immigration.
He landed just after 8:30 p.m. Afghan time and took off from Bagram shortly after midnight. He spent time with General Petraeus and Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry in addition to visiting wounded soldiers. Aides said it was a useful visit even without a meeting with Mr. Karzai.
''Obviously it would be nice to be able to share a meal together, but at the same time they were able to be face-to-face less than two weeks ago,'' Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told reporters traveling with the president. ''I think President Karzai understood the purpose of this was really for the president to spend time with the troops.''

HEADLINE: Defaulting on Second Homes

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
SOME affluent homeowners have been walking away from a second home or investment property that is worth less than what is owed on the mortgage, even though they can still afford to make the payments.
But dumping that beach condo or country cottage, or even a home bought for an adult child -- a practice known in the industry as a ''strategic default'' -- is not the same as discarding a poorly performing stock or bond. Among the lingering effects is wrecked credit that can prevent the homeowner from getting another loan of any kind for 7 to 10 years.
In July, a study by researchers from the European University Institute, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago concluded that the strategic default trend was ''large and rising'' among homeowners with an equity shortfall of $100,000. As of last March, it said, strategic defaults accounted for 35.6 percent of all foreclosures, compared with 23.6 percent a year earlier. 
''I'm increasingly seeing people who are middle class or higher on the pay scale coming to the conclusion that 'I may be able to carry it, but should I?,' '' said David Shaev, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York who assists homeowners in distress.
''But the question is, can the bank come after you, and if so, what is your position? What is your liability?''
The answer depends largely on where the property is.
In ''recourse'' states, a lender can come after you, and usually other assets like a primary residence, for the full mortgage amount. In ''nonrecourse'' states, a lender agrees to accept whatever the property fetches at a short sale, foreclosure sale, or a deed-in-lieu, in which the property is taken back but not formally foreclosed on, and generally can't sue for the full loan amount. Connecticut and Arizona are among the nonrecourse states, while Florida, Colorado, Maine, New Jersey and Hawaii are recourse states.
There is a third category of state, called ''single-action'' or ''one-action,'' which allows the lender either to foreclose on the owner or file a civil lawsuit for the full loan amount. New York, California and Idaho are in that category.
Even in a nonrecourse state, however, those homeowners who opt for a strategic default on a previously refinanced property may not be protected from lenders, because the mortgage in such a case was not accorded for a first purchase, said Philip Faranda, a mortgage broker for J. Philip Real Estate, in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
When home-equity loans are involved, he added, it gets more complicated. In nonrecourse states like Florida and Connecticut, the lender cannot sue to collect any home-equity loan taken out on the property. But in nonrecourse states like Arizona and California, the lender can still sue for repayment of a second mortgage or line of credit.
Filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, in which the homeowner arranges to pay off debts at lowered amounts over a maximum of five years, is typically the only way to avoid being on the hook for the second loan, mortgage experts say. Affluent homeowners who strategically default on a second home often don't qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which leads to liquidation but limits eligibility to those earning no more than state median income levels.
Though not illegal, strategic defaults are controversial, because they are viewed in some circles as unethical. The practice is common among property developers.
For homeowners under water, experts say, it can make economic sense. ''It's a business cash-flow decision,'' Mr. Faranda said, ''but the risk is that you're rolling dice with your future credit.''
A foreclosure from default stays on a homeowner's credit report for 7 years, while filing for bankruptcy stays on the report for 7 to 10 years, he said. A default can lower a credit score by 85 to 160 points, according to FICO, the company that created the scoring method.
Correction: December 19, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Mortgages column on Dec. 5, about defaulting on second homes, described incorrectly the ability of lenders to sue homeowners in Florida for the amount owed on a foreclosed property. Florida is a ''recourse'' state, and lenders may sue homeowners there. It is not a ''nonrecourse'' state, where lenders typically are required to accept whatever a property sells for in a foreclosure sale.

HEADLINE: Cold Weather, Hot Handball

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Handball is New York City's quintessential street game, and for nearly a century, the city has produced many of the best players in the world.
In the summer, the talent is spread out over the roughly 2,000 courts in the city. ''But in the winter,'' said Raymond Soriano, 32, a devoted handballer, ''the best players all run into each other here, so they have to play each other.''
''Here'' is Guz Indoor Sports Club, opened three years ago in what was once a garment-dyeing factory on an industrial street in Ridgewood, Queens. The space has smooth cinder-block walls and fits four regulation-size courts. Players - some come from as far away as Florida - call it ''Ridgewood Indoors.'' 
The club opens at noon every day and closes as late as midnight, depending upon how heated the games are; there are pool tables and Ping-Pong tables, too, separated from the courts by a chain-link fence.Wherever you have handball, you usually have money being wagered. Top players said the going rate used to be $20 a game, but that since the economic downturn, it was often $10.
Juan Guzman, 36, who owns Ridgewood Indoors with his 38-year-old brother, Angel, said that Friday evening was the busiest time. ''Friday is payday,'' he noted, ''and guys will come down with their paychecks and try to double them up.''
Wednesdays, when admission is $5 instead of the usual $10, is busy, too. There were perhaps 100 people filling the bleachers at the club this past Wednesday, many of them playing cards as they cheered or jeered the players. The thwack of blue rubber balls and squeak of sneakers on the gray-painted concrete floor made a constant din.
On Court 2, unofficially the elite one, the play was especially furious, with a waiting list of dozens of names scribbled on a yellow legal pad. The handball at the club is mostly doubles, and its rules are similar to those in doubles tennis or two-on-two volleyball: Teams maintain service by winning the point, and games go to 21.
The players include doctors, police officers, factory workers and high school students. Top performers in handball tournaments are awarded official status as ''A-players'' - there are about 30 active A-players across New York City (and many more B-players). In warm weather, many of these rated players play at Castle Hill Playground in the Bronx, the West Fourth Street courts in Manhattan, the ones at 88th Street and Atlantic Avenue in Queens, or the Seaside Courts on Surf Avenue in Coney Island.
''The reason New York has the world's best players is because you can grow up playing at these spots - it feeds on itself,'' said Eddie Neville, 25, of Ozone Park, an A-player though he began playing only four years ago. ''You can play every day of your life, but if you don't play with A-players, you'll never become one. That's why all these guys are here, for this competition on this one court.''
Everyone here seems to have a nickname - Mr. Neville is known as Warrior, Mr. Soriano is Phat Kat - and everyone talks trash. John Wright, a k a Rookie, who stayed on Court 2 for two hours that Wednesday as he and his partner won game after game, is widely considered the best player in the city - by no less an authority than himself.
''I'm Number One in the world,'' he said after one of the victories. Then he wiped his sweat-drenched face with his T-shirt, and said to the pool of players in the bleachers: ''Next!''
But being that good has its drawbacks. ''His problem is that no one will bet against him,'' Mr. Neville said of Mr. Wright, ''so he has to pick up a player who is not so good, kind of like a handicap.''
Mr. Neville, a semiprofessional hockey goalie, said that becoming an A-player was the worst thing that ever happened to him financially. ''When I was a B, I could support myself with handball,'' he said. ''I could go to a park and everyone would play me for money - I'd walk away with $900 in my pocket. I once won $1,700 in one game.''
As the best in the world beat each other up on Court 2, Abelardo Cervantes, a paramedic who lives in Jamaica, Queens, said playing handball at the club was as much about the people as the competition.
''Look around; you have all walks of life here,'' said Mr. Cervantes, 32. ''Over there you have a Muslim and a Hasidic Jew who are a doubles team. Handball is the great equalizer. All you need is a ball and a wall and a lot of heart.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: No Match for Automobiles

 BODY:
Q. We recently redesigned the Louise Nevelson Plaza at the intersection of Maiden Lane and Liberty and William Streets. What happened to the buildings that were there before the plaza was created? ... Henry Smith-Miller, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson Architects, Manhattan
A. What happened? Well, as my doctor sometimes says, this may hurt just a little bit. There were two magnificent structures there, the fantastical Wolfe Building of 1896, by Henry Hardenbergh, along William Street, and the triangular German-American Insurance Company Building of 1907, by Hill & Stout, at the narrow end of the block. 
The Wolfe Building was put up by the estate of John Wolfe, one of the great hardware merchants of New York. The architect, Henry J. Hardenbergh, was often trusted by estates and family building operations, like that of the Rhinelanders.
Hardenbergh's 12-story building was a tour de force of early skyscraper design, in rich red brick trimmed with light-colored stone and terra cotta in patterns of the Flemish and Dutch Renaissance.
Tall building design was an emerging and controversial field, and in 1896 the critic Montgomery Schuyler said Hardenbergh's design proved that the skyscraper was ''artistically tractable.'' He praised the skyline of the Wolfe Building, particularly the angled facade on Maiden Lane, which gradually diminished, through complicated angles and recessions, into a spectacular gable perhaps 200 feet above the street.
The Wolfe Building was soon hard to see, hemmed in by other structures, but the insurance building went up at the pointy end of the block, its angled bow giving it a shiplike presence, slicing through the chop of the older buildings. Frederick Hill, the architect, discussed it in the journal Architecture in 1908, noting ''the omission of any form of cornice and the use of penetrated vaulting in its place,'' referring to the polychrome terra-cotta elements at the top.
Hill remarked that with the new crop of high buildings, the idea of making a traditional cornice, with intricate architectural patterns, ''appears to us entirely wrong'' and indeed ''part of the problem over which we are all working.'' Architects were rethinking almost every element of design as buildings got higher and higher. The new ''A.I.A. Guide to New York City,'' by Norval White, Elliot Willensky and Fran Leadon, calls the insurance building ''magnificently corniced, wonderfully proportioned.''
Both were demolished in the mid-1970s by Our Fair City to widen the streets and improve traffic flow to the new World Trade Center. Kent Barwick and Brendan Gill, both of the Municipal Art Society, protested, Mr. Barwick calling demolition ''needless'' in The New York Times in 1974.
Although obvious candidates for landmark designation today, at the time such second-tier commercial buildings were considered interesting but not designation-worthy. Thus traffic won out, and the leftover land has for years been a favorite lunch spot, Louise Nevelson Plaza. The plaza does open up the view to the palazzolike 1924 Federal Reserve Bank, at the William Street end of the block, although that is scant consolation.
A Club or a House?
Q. Was 33 West 47th Street originally a private house, or an upscale club? The style reminds me of the Julius Jaros house on West End Avenue. ... Mike Grant, Brooklyn
A. This brownstone row house was built in 1868 as a home for Charles Francis, a dentist. He lived in the house with his family and two other dentists, William Car and James Day, who was listed on census returns as born in India.
Even as tall buildings sprang up around it, 33 West 47th Street remained a private house; the 1900 census listed William B. Wood, a doctor, there with his family and four servants, including Hiroishi Sakamine, his Japanese-born butler.
Into this picture came Burton S. Castles, a real estate investor and art collector. In 1910 he remade an old brownstone at 473 Fifth Avenue in a half-timbered Tudor style for his own residence. Nine years later he tired of that and had Charles E. Birge remodel the old Francis house in the manner of the early French Renaissance, like a Loire Valley chateau, indeed similar to the Jaros house at 266 West End Avenue.
Although the ground floor has been destroyed, the upper three floors have the typical pierced balustrade and a magnificent Francois Premier window surround.
The 1930 census found Mr. Castles, a ''stock speculator,'' there, along with two housekeepers and a butler.
Writing for The New York Times, Walter Storey visited Mr. Castles in 1934 to review his broad collection of tapestries, Georgian silver, paintings by Corot and others, and Chinese jade. Upon Mr. Castle's death in 1936, The Times described him as the ''Beau Brummel of Wall Street.'' Texas-born, he often speculated in cotton.

HEADLINE: Senate Rejects President's Plan On Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Saturday rejected President Obama's proposal to let tax rates rise for the highest-income Americans, as Republicans held firm in their push to continue all of the expiring Bush-era tax cuts.
The White House and Congressional leaders are now discussing a deal to extend the reduced tax rates at all income levels, at least temporarily, perhaps for two years.
But with Senate Democrats and the White House badly splintered, and some lawmakers increasingly angry at the idea of sustaining President George W. Bush's economic policies, the prospects of a compromise remained uncertain.
The floor action on Saturday highlighted the volatility of the issue. Mr. Obama's plan, approved by the House on Thursday, would have extended the lower rates on income up to $250,000 a year for couples and $200,000 for individuals, but Democrats did not have the 60 votes required under Senate rules to muscle it forward. 
Nor could they muster the votes needed for an alternative proposal, championed by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, to end the breaks only on income exceeding $1 million.
Republicans, joined by a handful of Democrats, voted unanimously against both proposals. Most Democrats said that showed them siding with ''millionaires and billionaires'' over the middle class. Republicans said they were refusing to let taxes rise for anyone, given the continuing weakness in the economy.
If Congress does not act, the tax rates expire for everyone on Dec. 31, meaning an increase across the board. The rate in the lowest bracket would rise to 15 percent from 10 percent and in the highest bracket to 39.6 percent from 35 percent.
Some Democrats suggested they were willing to let that happen and extend the fight into next year. Mr. Obama, while pronouncing himself ''very disappointed'' with the outcome, told reporters he would work through the weekend on a compromise.
''With so much at stake, today's votes cannot be the end of the discussion,'' he said.
The administration and Congressional leaders have been discussing a plan that would temporarily extend all of the income tax rates, and also include a one-year extension of jobless aid for the long-term unemployed, which has started to run out.
With some Congressional Democrats fretting that the administration would give in too easily, senior White House officials said Mr. Obama was insisting on the jobless aid and the extension of other tax breaks for middle- and lower-income Americans included in the 2009 stimulus plan as a condition of any deal. Republicans said they were considering those demands.
Many other taxes, including the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax and taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends, were also part of the talks.
The formal negotiations were being conducted by senior lawmakers from both parties, along with the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and the White House budget director, Jacob Lew. But there were also direct talks under way between the West Wing and Republicans, including the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of holding show votes for political reasons but said he was optimistic that a solution would be reached before Congress adjourns. ''I am relatively confident that the end of this process will lead us into, I think, a very sensible decision not to raise taxes on anybody in the middle of a recession,'' he said.
The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he was hopeful an agreement would be reached by Wednesday, allowing the Senate to move forward with a busy end-of-year agenda.
But some Senate Democrats were growing increasingly angry at the administration and wary of a deal. In a sign of the deepening divisions, White House officials had voiced opposition to raising the threshold for the tax breaks to $1 million, saying it would do little to reduce the deficit.
The rejection of that proposal underscored a harsh defeat for Democrats in both the policy debate and on the political messaging front. Some of them lashed out at Republicans in response, accusing them of holding tax cuts for the middle class ''hostage'' to secure tax breaks for the wealthy.
''I feel like I am in the twilight zone,'' said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. ''It's depressing to me that we have gotten to this level of posturing, that they are saying if you do not give people a tax break on their second million, that nobody gets one.''
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said he would benefit personally from a tax cut on income above $1 million. ''I had a good business career, and I would be entitled to a tax cut for those over the million-dollar mark'' he said. ''But I don't want it. I don't need it. What I am looking at today, I think, is a great American travesty.''
Mr. Obama's preferred plan fell 7 votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster and advance to a simple majority vote. The vote was 53 to 36, on a bill adopted by the House on Thursday to end the cuts on income above $250,000 a year for couples and $200,000 for individuals.
Republicans voted unanimously against the House-passed bill, and they were joined by four Democrats -- Senators Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Jim Webb of Virginia -- as well as by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.
''You don't raise taxes if your ultimate goal, if the main thing, is to create jobs,'' said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, echoing an argument made repeatedly by his colleagues during the floor debate.
Mr. Schumer, pressing for his proposal, said: ''It's not that we want to punish wealthy people. We want to praise them. But they're doing fine, and they're not going to spend the money and stimulate the economy.''
At a news conference after the vote, Mr. Schumer said Democrats would keep fighting to end the tax breaks for millionaires. ''We're not giving up in three days, one week, two months, six months,'' he said.
The roll call on the so-called millionaire's tax, which also needed 60 votes to advance, was 53 to 37, with Republicans again unanimously opposed and joined this time by Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lieberman and Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia.
Democrats, including Mr. Obama, have long questioned the economic basis for lower taxes for the wealthiest Americans, particularly at a time of deep concern over rising debt. White House officials said the revenue lost to tax cuts for the rich would be better spent on tax breaks for the middle class and businesses to help promote growth.
Republicans insisted that allowing the tax rates to expire for the top two income brackets would further hamper the already tepid economic recovery.
With the economy teetering, Democrats had not brought the tax issue to the top of the legislative agenda. And by this fall, when Congressional leaders began contemplating bringing up the issue for votes, many Democrats were wary of being accused by campaign opponents of favoring a tax increase.
Some Democrats supported a temporary extension of the Bush-era tax rates at all levels, and it was quickly clear that Senate Democrats could not generate sufficient votes in favor of Mr. Obama's plan -- so the issue was put off until after the election.
The drubbing Democrats took in the elections, as Republicans won a majority in the House and picked up six seats in the Senate, further undermined the Democrats' negotiating position. Republicans have since viewed an extension of the lower income tax rates as a foregone conclusion.

HEADLINE: So That's Where the Money Went

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
HOW the truth shines through when you shed a little light on a subject.
Such is the message from the massive document drop the Federal Reserve made last week. The Dodd-Frank law forced the Fed to disclose the recipients of $3.3 trillion from emergency lending programs put in place during the crisis days of 2008, so the taxpayers who paid for those rescue efforts now know whom they were helping.
Not that we should expect to receive any thank-you notes from these institutions for rescuing them from themselves.
Still, it's good to know who got what at the bailout banquet. This helps us understand how expensive it is to live in a nation where big, politically interconnected financial institutions are not allowed to fail -- even after they mess up in the most catastrophic of ways. 
The Fed data showed that the biggest recipient of taxpayer assistance was, naturally, Citigroup. It was followed closely by Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. Goldman Sachs was also a large beneficiary during the darkest moments of 2008.
Remember that the Wall Street firms were imperiled by their excessive use of borrowed money, which generated huge paydays when the cost of those funds was cheap and the values of the assets they were buying were rising at a steady clip. After the bubble burst and financing evaporated, the firms were able to tap into a lending program created by the Fed in mid-March 2008 after Bear Stearns collapsed. It was called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.
The program allowed firms to borrow at low interest rates -- ranging from 3.25 percent when the program began to 0.5 percent when the last loan was made in May 2009. The firms had to post various securities as collateral when they borrowed, and some of those securities were risky indeed.
Last week, the Fed provided spreadsheets identifying the companies that used the credit facility each day. Changes in these borrowings offer a window onto how quickly panic tore across Wall Street in September 2008.
For example, there were zero borrowings during August and even in early September, when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed. But on Sept. 17, the day after the government rescued the American International Group with an $85 billion infusion, borrowings from the facility neared $60 billion. Lending in the facility peaked at $156 billion on Sept. 29, the day the House of Representatives voted down the Treasury's bank bailout plan.
IT is interesting to review the borrowings of specific companies. Right after Lehman failed, for example, Morgan Stanley began tapping into the credit facility every day; it didn't stop until early March 2009. Morgan Stanley's borrowings peaked at $61.3 billion on Sept. 29.
Between Sept. 15 and Nov. 26 of 2008, Goldman Sachs also tapped the facility each day. The company began by borrowing $2.5 billion; its peak was $24.2 billion on Oct. 15.
By Nov. 10, Goldman's borrowings had fallen to $7 billion; that was the day the New York Fed said it would make Goldman and other A.I.G. trading partners whole on credit insurance they had purchased from A.I.G. on troubled mortgage securities. Under that deal, Goldman received $5.6 billion from the Fed.
All of the emergency lending data released by the Fed are highly revealing, but why weren't they made public much earlier? That's a question that Walker F. Todd, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, is asking.
Mr. Todd, a former assistant general counsel and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said details about the Fed's vast and various programs should have been available before the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law was even written.
''The Fed's current set of powers and the shape of the Dodd-Frank bill over all might have looked quite different if this information had been made public during the debate on the bill,'' he said. ''Had these tables been out there, I think Congress would have either said no to emergency lending authority or if you get it, it's going to be a much lower number -- half a trillion dollars in the aggregate.''
Better late with the data than never, of course. And the release of these figures just ahead of Friday's grim employment data -- the jobless rate rose to 9.8 percent in November -- makes them even more compelling. Clearly, the federal government was much more willing to deliver mountains of money to big banks that made big mistakes than it was to lend a financial hand to rank-and-file Americans struggling through foreclosures.
Federal officials have always argued that plowing money into errant banks and trading shops was the best way to rescue the economy, but to Edward J. Kane, professor of economics at Boston College, details of the Fed's largess are reminiscent of a famous Winston Churchill quotation.
''Never have so few owed so much to so many, and given them so small a return,'' Mr. Kane said. ''We see, for example, how little these institutions have given back to troubled homeowners whose houses are threatened with foreclosure.''
Mr. Kane's point is important. Certainly, the low interest rates the Fed charged to institutional borrowers during the disaster translate into a significant subsidy, indeed a gift, to many of the firms that set the financial collapse in motion.
But the Fed is silent on how big that subsidy actually was.
Estimating its size will be the subject of much work in the coming months and years. For now, here's a quick and dirty estimate of how much the Fed subsidized borrowers in just one program -- the Primary Dealer Credit Facility -- for just two weeks in September 2008.
From Sept. 15 through the end of that month, borrowings averaged around $100 billion a day. The interest rate charged on those loans was 2.25 percent.
Given that markets were frozen at that time, and given the dubious quality of some of the collateral posted to the Fed to back the loans, an interest rate of 10 percent would be a reasonable benchmark for measuring the size of this subsidy.
On the one hand, Citigroup, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and the others paid roughly $75 million in interest over that September fortnight. Had the Fed charged 10 percent, the firms would have paid about $325 million. For just those firms, over only that period, that's a $250 million subsidy.
''The justification was, this was to prevent the markets from exploding and the economy from being ruined,'' Mr. Kane said. ''They always explain their actions against doing nothing: 'If we had done nothing, this would have been a terrible mess.'''
But the Fed has never identified any alternative approaches it might have taken other than the one it chose: simply hurling huge snowballs of cash at Wall Street.
One could argue that the size of the subsidy provided by the Fed to financial institutions during the crisis was a direct result of the fact that the government simply had no plan in place for resolving failing institutions.
''I see this as somewhat of a measure of the panic in which the Fed was operating,'' Mr. Kane said. ''The way I see it, they were mugged. And through them, the taxpayer was mugged.''

HEADLINE: The Bond Vigilantes Have Moved to Dublin

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
DURING the Reagan administration's experiment with supply-side economics, the United States budget deficit swelled and bond buyers were appalled. They punished the government by pushing down the price of Treasuries.
Ed Yardeni, then an economist with Prudential-Bache Securities, dubbed the informal posse of outraged investors ''the bond vigilantes,'' writing in 1983: ''If the fiscal and monetary authorities won't regulate the economy, the bond investor will.''
Now an independent economist and market strategist, Mr. Yardeni says that over the last few years, the American vigilantes have been asleep at the switch -- lulled by the Federal Reserve's seductive monetary policies. While the budget deficit has mushroomed to previously unimaginable, $1 trillion-plus dimensions, bond traders have been buying Treasuries with gusto, keeping prices rich and yields extremely low. 
But in Europe, where a series of credit crises have sent the euro plummeting, the situation is quite different. There, he says, ''the bond vigilantes are very, very active.''
As European banks and governments have staggered under mounting debt loads, bond traders have reacted violently in recent months, often making the euro zone the fulcrum on which the world's stock, bond and currency markets have pivoted. The markets have been pressuring European policy makers to take measures that are painful and, often, politically hazardous.
The euro zone eruption began in Greece early this year, after bond investors began to price Greek sovereign debt as though it were junk. Despite fierce street protests, the Greek government agreed in May to embrace harsh fiscal austerity measures in return for a $150 billion bailout by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
After a period of relative quiet, the euro zone crisis flared up again last month, when the price of Irish sovereign bonds plummeted, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, soared. Ireland has been forced to enact deep cuts in social welfare programs in return for multilateral assistance, which came late last month in the form of a complex 85 billion euro bailout ($112 billion) from individual euro zone governments, the International Monetary Fund and two European Union rescue funds.
Just last week, as fear of contagion spread, Portugal, among the fiscally weaker countries on the euro zone's periphery, was forced to pay unusually high yields on its bonds.
On Thursday, in an effort to relieve heightened uncertainty in the markets, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said that the bank would continue to take extraordinary measures to provide liquidity wherever it was needed. The same day, the bank made new purchases of euro zone bonds, bolstering prices of those troubled Irish and Portuguese securities.
But the bond market clearly does not believe that the euro zone crisis is close to a resolution, said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the world's largest bond manager.
''The policy response has been to kick the can down the road'' rather than come up with a permanent solution, he said in an interview. As evidence that traders are skeptical of the bailouts, he pointed to sovereign Greek debt, which still commands a yield of about 10 percentage points, or 1,000 basis points -- more than benchmark German bonds, despite assurances from European policy makers that the bonds are entirely safe.
''If there were no credit risk involved with the Greek bonds,'' he said, ''the spreads would have come in very sharply,'' and the yield would be much lower.
Mr. El-Erian expects to see continuing volatility emanating from the euro zone for quite some time, with crises possible in other countries with high debt loads, including Belgium and Spain.
Disagreements among national governments have made it difficult to address the core problem, which, he said, is ''not lack of liquidity, but of solvency'' -- that is, not a matter of providing enough cash for short-term operations, but of reducing debt ratios that are simply too high to be managed. Solving the problem anytime soon would require ''haircuts'' -- write-downs or restructurings, in which bondholders would, in the end, have to take some losses.
Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, has, in fact, taken this position, and one of the new European bailout funds may require that future rescues include losses by bondholders starting in 2013. This prospect, in itself, is the source of some tensions in the bond market. ''If there will be losses and haircuts in 2013, there is a legitimate question: might this timetable be changed?'' Mr. El-Erian said.
AARON GURWITZ, chief investment officer of Barclays Wealth, says he expects these issues to unsettle the markets, with sentiment likely to shift frequently. Nonetheless, he says it is important to remember, amid these day-to-day swings, that there are substantial sources of strength underpinning global markets.
Among them, he said, are a robust economic recovery in Germany, high corporate profits in the United States and solid growth in emerging markets, particularly China.
In Europe, though, policy makers are likely to be trying to mollify bond traders for some time to come, Mr. Yardeni said. ''I expect that the European Central Bank will have to engage in full-blown quantitative easing,'' much as the Federal Reserve in the United States did, he said. Such a move would involve larger purchases of bonds to prop up prices and drive down yields.
''We haven't heard the last of the bond vigilantes,'' Mr. Yardeni said.

HEADLINE: State Cuts Put Officers on Front Lines of Mental Care

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Me. -- As community mental health systems fray under the strain of state budget cuts and a weak economy, law enforcement officers across the nation are increasingly having to step in to provide the emergency services that clinics have typically offered the mentally ill.
Police and sheriff's departments that are already grappling with budget and manpower cuts say the situation is further straining their resources and forcing them to divert officers from their regular duties. It has also stoked fears among law enforcement officers of dangerous encounters between the police and people with severe mental illness. 
''I worry that there's going to be a tragedy,'' said James Craig, chief of the Police Department here, where calls involving the mentally ill increased to 1,645 in 2009 from 1,424 in 2007. ''I'm worried that an officer might lose his life dealing with a dangerous person, a person who really needs treatment.''
Improving the department's handling of the mentally ill became one of Chief Craig's biggest priorities last year after an officer was forced to dangle off the Casco Bay Bridge as he pulled a woman to safety during a suicide attempt. She was released from a hospital hours later and tried to jump off the bridge again.
The Portland department hired a full-time mental health coordinator in October.
In many ways, officers are better equipped than ever to handle calls involving the mentally ill. Hundreds of departments across the country, including in Portland, now offer Crisis Intervention Team training, which teaches officers to look for signs of mental illness and to work with doctors, nurses and therapists.
Despite increased awareness, many officers, mental health workers and advocates for the mentally ill say that with fewer hospital beds and reduced outpatient services -- especially at centers that treat the uninsured -- many patients' family members and friends, and even bystanders, are turning to the police as the first choice for help when a crisis occurs. Many states are feeling the brunt of cuts that started years ago but have gotten worse because of the economy.
''A lot of people view calling the police as the only way to get loved ones any kind of treatment, because when the police come they have to do something,'' said Laura Usher, the national Crisis Intervention Team coordinator for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. ''But unfortunately that doesn't necessarily always lead to appropriate treatment.''
''States across the country are cutting their mental health budgets, and people who are serviced by state mental health programs are the poorest, and they're unable to get services any other way,'' she added. ''The community mental health system is broken.''
In Illinois, where mental health services were cut by $35 million this year -- a $90 million cut was proposed -- the state's police departments are ''essentially a 24-hour free service,'' said Chief Robert T. Finney of the Champaign Police Department.
''We're the people who get taxed with dealing with these people,'' said Chief Finney, who is also vice president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police. ''Even if you arrest them and they're released from your jail within hours, they're back on your street doing the same thing.''
In Oklahoma, calls to the police involving mental illness have increased by 50 percent in the past year, said Stacey Puckett, executive director of the Oklahoma Association of Chiefs of Police. The state has cut about $17 million in mental health financing this year.
Ms. Puckett said officers were ''traveling from one end of the state to the other and are out of their departments for 6, 8, 10 hours at a time.''
''It's the bed shortage,'' she said. ''We just do not have enough beds for the numbers.''
Danny Ray of Ardmore, Okla., had to call the police in August after his 30-year-old son, who had been unable to get treatment, threatened him with a loaded gun.
''The police, if I had a problem right now, they are my only source of help,'' said Mr. Ray, 57, whose son's psychiatrist comes to town only once a month. Mr. Ray says he also finds it difficult to secure a bed for his son at the local hospital.
Rural areas are especially affected when mental health services are cut because officers must drive so far to admit mentally ill patients to hospitals.
Amanda Bittle, chief of the Police Department in Forest Park, Okla., an Oklahoma City suburb, started her career in a rural part of the state, and says it is often easier and less expensive for far-flung departments to encourage a mentally ill person to leave town than to drive the person to a hospital.
''It was cheaper for your department to buy a $59 bus ticket and send them as far away as you could,'' Chief Bittle said. ''I know that's disturbing, but that's the reality of what's happening.''
The alternative, she said, is for a department to go ''15 hours of no officer on the street, or an officer that's paid overtime.''
''It's sad,'' she added, ''but it comes down to those budgetary things.''

HEADLINE: Not In My Mirror

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Mark Greif's essay ''The Hipster in the Mirror'' (Nov. 14): I am compelled to emit a piercing scream from my 82-year-old lungs at the jejune folly of the whole ''hipster'' syndrome. 
When I was 17 and a freshman at New York University, the word ''hip'' was very specific. It meant being knowledgeable about jazz, sex and especially drugs. Then, in the 1950s, came the term ''Beat.'' I was one of the ''Rent a Beatniks'' organized by the Village Voice photographer Fred McDarrah. Hippies came next, a sort of watered-down version of the outlaw mentality spawned by the drug and sex culture. Now, I simply don't get the connection between ''hip,'' as anatomized by Anatole Broyard and others like Mailer, and new arrivals on the scene (Lower East Side, Williamsburg, Greenpoint) who are, as far as I can tell, simple poseurs looking for a more interesting identity. As an old bohemian, I resent this borrowed term which conceals its true yuppie identity.
HARRIET SOHMERS ZWERLING New York
To the Editor:
There is always some cruelty in social critique, and perhaps there should be, but I find this anti-hipster hysteria dehumanizing. I wonder if Mark Greif's essay on countercultural consumerism tells us anything about his own class interests, or perhaps about the status anxieties of the contemporary intellectual class. And when all this derision that suffocates us with its self-entitled superiority is lifted, what objective social, economic, psychological categories of hipsterism are we left with? Who are these people that we seem to hate so deeply? And what would we want them to do if they weren't acting like hipsters?

HEADLINE: After a Rough Night, Hotel Investors Are Waking Up

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
IS this as bad as it gets? For two years, big investors watched the implosion of the lodging industry as hotel values plummeted more than 50 percent. Now as private equity giants like the Blackstone Group and entrepreneurs like Richard Branson are diving into the sector, others are starting to think it has finally hit bottom and may be bouncing back.
Blackstone teamed up with two other private equity players in May to acquire the Extended Stay hotel chain out of bankruptcy court, and in September, Mr. Branson announced plans to create a Virgin Hotel empire. And when big names reach for their checkbooks, other investors usually aren't far behind.
So far in 2010, there have been 77 lodging deals in the United States valued at $8.5 billion, according to the research firm Dealogic, up from 30 deals valued at $1.2 billion in that period in 2009. (This is still far short of the 2007 peak, when there were 141 deals valued at $42.3 billion -- including the biggest leveraged buyout of a hotel ever, Blackstone's troubled $26 billion purchase of Hilton Hotels.) 
For the most part, private equity firms haven't even cracked their piggy banks yet. ''I have never in my entire career seen so much equity on the sidelines ready to pounce,'' says Jim Butler, chairman of the global hospitality group at the law firm Jeffer, Mangels, Butler & Mitchell.
More than 40 private equity funds are hunting for deals in the hotel sector now, and many are under the gun to buy earlier rather than later, says Bjorn Hanson, dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. About half had cash in hand for lodging investments in 2007 and early 2008 before the sector fell apart and have been sitting on the sidelines, while others have raised money in the last year.
All are under pressure to invest, lest they miss the opportunity to jump in before the sector goes into full rebound mode, when ''everybody else gets in and prices get bid up,'' says Mr. Hanson.
Private equity firms and real estate investment trusts have been building huge war chests over the last year as they seek distressed deals, in the hopes of picking up properties at pennies on the dollar, as many did in the early 1990s recession. Mr. Butler recalls that Colony Capital bought the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa in 1993 in Hawaii for about 12 cents on the dollar. Colony paid $56 million for a property that cost $465 million to build and then sold the property in 2002 for $180 million.
In the current downturn, many investors have been waiting for similarly troubled targets, which have yet to materialize. ''I think opportunistic investors had those visions dancing in their head of assets that you buy at 10 cents on the dollar,'' Mr. Butler says. But now many realize they may get distressed assets at only 60 to 80 cents on the dollar, and are afraid they'll miss the rebound if they don't jump in soon.
''Things will begin drifting up, if not shooting up,'' Mr. Butler says.
Hotel deals began revving up after the lodging sector showed signs that it had finally turned a corner in the first quarter. Hotels posted year-over-year growth in occupancy in February for the first time since October 2007, and revenue per available room -- a closely watched measurement of room-rate and occupancy growth -- turned positive in March for the first time since July 2008, according to Smith Travel Research.
In July 2010, American hotels ''sold 102 million room nights, which is the most room nights ever sold in one month,'' noted Jan Freitag, vice president for global development at Smith Travel. ''The worst is behind us.''
Some hotels have even begun selectively raising room rates in recent months, usually a surefire sign that the sector is on the rebound, and experts expect this to escalate in the next two years. At the same time, there's little new construction because financing remains scarce, which will limit the number of new hotel rooms being dumped on the market in the next few years.
''We know we've reached bottom, and we know a recovery has started,'' says Mr. Hanson of N.Y.U. ''Now is the time to start to look seriously at acquisitions.''
THERE certainly isn't a shortage of potential targets in the hotel industry. Many lodging companies are struggling to restructure their expiring debt amid dwindling profits, and their lenders -- including almost all the big banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America -- are groaning under the weight of big loans. Investors abandoned the sector in droves during the downturn, and hotel values plummeted 27 percent in 2008 and a further 40 percent in 2009, according to Colliers PKF Hospitality Research.
''The domestic lodging industry came off of its worst year in history in 2009,'' says Mark Woodworth, president of Colliers, which has been tracking the data since the mid-1930s. Profits tumbled 35.4 percent on average at American hotels last year, a record slide. The previous low-water mark, he says, was a 22.5 percent decline in 1938.
Shrinking revenue from falling room rates and occupancy over the last two years sent a flurry of hotel companies, including Extended Stay, Innkeepers USA Trust, Highland Hospitality, Red Roof Inn and Consolidated Resorts, scrambling for ways to get out from beneath the piles of short-term loans that were suffocating them.
Many companies had been taken private in debt-heavy deals during the boom years of 2005 to 2007 and are now ''underwater'' -- meaning they are worth less than the debt on their properties, and cash flow from the hotels no longer covers the debt payments, a malady shared by many owners of homes swept up in the foreclosure crisis.
''The level of delinquencies and defaults has been escalating dramatically over the past year or so'' in the lodging industry, Mr. Woodworth says. ''Maybe a third of the problem loan situations have been dealt with at this point, so there's still another two-thirds left to go.''
So this year might just be a turning point for the hotel industry. Smelling blood, private equity firms like Blackstone have swooped into the sector this year, and bitter bidding wars have erupted over properties.
Take Extended Stay, a national chain of more than 600 hotels that cater to people seeking longer-term lodging. The company, once valued at more than $8 billion, collapsed under a mountain of debt and dwindling revenue, forcing it to seek bankruptcy protection in June 2009.
The bottom fell out of the industry before the ink was dry, leaving the owner, the Lightstone Group, searching for ways to restructure $7.4 billion in debt. But Lightstone's problems were made worse by the fact that the firm's four lenders had sold the debt in the secondary market to more than 50 creditors, who would have had to agree on any restructuring of the loans.
''We tried for the better part of a year to get them to either reach an agreement or take the keys back, and we just couldn't get them to agree on anything,'' David Lichtenstein, chief executive of the Lightstone Group, says of the creditors. ''Imagine trying to get 50 people to agree with total unanimity on something.'' Instead, creditors were fighting among themselves, with some wanting to change terms and others wanting to take over the hotels.
Mr. Lichtenstein says he never anticipated such problems. ''We were always told we would be able to give the keys back, but nobody had ever played it out in a real-life situation of what would happen when a loan that was held by this many parties needs a bank to work with or give the keys back to,'' he says. The matter wound up in bankruptcy court.
Two private equity firms, Centerbridge Partners and Paulson & Company, teamed up in March 2010 to acquire the company out of bankruptcy. The firms' initial bid got the nod from Extended Stay's board, and they appeared to have it in the bag.
But all that changed when Barry Sternlicht, the man behind the W brand and former chairman of the hotel giant Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, jumped into the fray later that month with a counterbid, setting off a vicious bidding war.
The battle was decided when the Centerbridge team got a third partner, the Blackstone Group, and ultimately clinched the auction with a bid of $3.93 billion in cash and debt.
For Blackstone, the deal was particularly sweet, as the firm had owned Extended Stay and sold it to Lightstone for $8 billion at the top of the market in 2007.
One principal involved in the Extended Stay acquisition, whose firm did not want to discuss the deal publicly, said the price was a deep bargain compared with a common benchmark known as replacement cost, which is the theoretical price to build a similar hotel in the same location today.
''We're seeing discounts to replacement costs of 30 percent to 50 percent,'' he says. He says he expects more deals at similar discounts in the next year or two.
IN a September research note, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst, Shaun Kelley, said some companies -- like Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Host Hotels and Hersha Hospitality Trust -- would probably be buyers as deals emerged. Several REITs and real estate operating companies, like DiamondRock, Sunstone and Host, have already jumped in by snapping up debt positions in properties that were in default -- the so-called loan-to-own strategy, in which a lender hopes to take over a property if the owner can't meet the debt obligations.
Some struggling chains have avoided bankruptcy and 1990s-type fire sales because banks and other lenders have been hoping for a rebound. Lenders have taken an ''extend and pretend'' tactic, in which they extend the loan terms and pretend everything is peachy in the hopes that the underwater loans will be salvageable once the economy bounces back.
Alvin Wade, a national managing partner at the consulting firm Grant Thornton, who has been advising clients on accounting issues in lodging and real estate for more than 30 years, says most lenders are loath to foreclose on a property because this would require writing down the value of the asset on their books, which could force them to raise additional capital to meet regulatory capital requirements. Also, they don't want to take over the companies and become landlords because, Mr. Wade says, ''the last thing they want to do is be in the real estate business.''
However, he says this practice can't go on indefinitely. When ''extend and pretend'' ends, many property owners will be forced to sell or hand the keys back to the lender, and the flow of distressed properties in the market will increase, he says.
Mr. Butler, of Jeffer Mangels's global hospitality group, predicts that a wave of hotels and lodging companies could face bankruptcy as Extended Stay did. ''There's still huge amounts of debt coming due in the last half of this year, 2011 and 2012 that will be very difficult to refinance,'' he says.
Indeed, Ted Mandigo, a hospitality consultant, says many targets look ripe. ''It's a matter of getting in there early and trying to beat the bidding war,'' he says.
If those forecasts come true, Mr. Branson, the flamboyant British billionaire who owns an eclectic mix of businesses like airlines and music stores, will have some competition as he buys up hotels to turn into a Virgin chain. He announced plans last month to introduce about 25 Virgin hotels in major cities. He hopes the boutique-style hotel chain will cater to ''high-income, well-educated, metropolitan, creative class'' customers.
''When you think about Virgin and travel and lifestyle and what we do -- hotels isn't a stretch; it's a natural fit,'' says Anthony Marino, managing partner of the Virgin Group's leisure and hospitality sector.
Mr. Branson had been considering such an expansion for more than two years, just waiting for the right time to jump in, Mr. Marino says. The company will probably buy, rather than build, hotels and convert them to the Virgin brand, he says, with the first location slated to open in 12 to 18 months.
''There is a lot of volatility in real estate, and these gateway cities are hard to penetrate -- and this might be an opportunity to really get into these markets,'' he says. ''You take advantage of volatility and make it an opportunity.''
Indeed, luxury hotels in major metro markets like New York, San Francisco and Boston seem to offer the biggest windfalls, analysts say. They took the hardest hit during the recession, and investors hope they'll bounce back just as steeply. Valuations for luxury hotels plunged 30 percent in 2008 and 45 percent in 2009, according to Mr. Woodworth, as profits slid 7.3 percent and 47.5 percent respectively.
But high-end hoteliers weren't suffering alone. Across the country and at every price point, the industry has been slammed since the economy's downturn in 2008.
Revenue per available room, known in the industry as revpar, plunged 17 percent in 2009, according to Smith Travel Research, the biggest annual decline since the firm began tracking the data in 1987.
Colliers, the research firm, expects revpar to climb 5.9 percent in 2011 and 10.6 percent in 2012, and rates to rise 3.8 percent in 2011 and 6.3 percent in 2012. ''There are many investors looking to play the recovery,'' says David Loeb, a managing director at Robert W. Baird & Company.
WALTER ISENBERG, president and chief executive of Sage Hospitality, a hotel development and management company, says he's seen a surge in the number of REITs acquiring hotel properties in major American markets. ''The general feeling is, those markets have recovered faster than the suburban markets,'' he says, ''and the buyers believe there will be a sustained recovery.''
Mr. Isenberg expects the most distressed assets -- and potentially the most profitable deals -- to come in 2011 and 2012 when large, highly leveraged loans come due.
Initial public offerings are likely to escalate as well, analysts say; Mr. Hanson says he expects lodging I.P.O.'s to approach record levels in late 2011 or early 2012. The success of Hyatt's I.P.O. last year -- at the peak of the recession -- may encourage a number of private equity firms to use public offerings as exit strategies, especially for larger companies, like Hilton and Four Seasons Hotels, that were taken private before the recession.
Blackstone acquired Hilton in a $26 billion deal at the height of the real estate bubble in 2007 and has since been forced to renegotiate the terms of its debt, like many of its peers in the industry.
Blackstone financed the leveraged buyout with only $5.7 billion in Blackstone equity and $20.6 billion in mortgage and mezzanine debt, or junior debt that has a higher risk of being unpaid. Various banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, hold pieces of the debt. Even the Federal Reserve holds a $4 billion chunk of Hilton debt, which it inherited as it facilitated the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase in 2008.
Although the deal was initially seen as a touchdown for Blackstone, the applause died down as the hotel sector imploded, causing property values to tumble and the debt markets to freeze up. At one point, Blackstone wrote down the value of its investment by more than 60 percent, a paper loss of more than $3.5 billion. And because the debt markets had all but frozen, the banks were unable to sell the loans to investors. As a result, Blackstone had to renegotiate the loan terms with lenders to keep its investment afloat.
In April, the firm succeeded in hammering out a restructuring agreement, in which it put up $800 million in additional equity in a deal that cut its $20 billion debt load by about $4 billion. (The deal involved buying back $1.8 billion in mezzanine debt, converting $2.1 billion of other debt to preferred equity and extending other loan maturities to 2015.)
''Hilton is a great company with an almost boundless future,'' says Peter Rose, a spokesman for Blackstone. ''Its debt restructuring was an important step in its continued growth and expansion.''
Industry experts gave Blackstone a proverbial pat on the back for being able to complete such a large restructuring when the economy was still shaky. Many saw the transaction as a sign that the sector was thawing out.
In a further sign of a rebound, Bank of America recently began unloading its share of the debt through a commercial mortgage bond offering -- something it had not been able to do since the market collapsed.
Hotel stocks have been rallying in anticipation of the industry's recovery. Hotel REITs posted total returns, including dividends, of 67 percent in 2009 and are up a further 35 percent so far in 2010, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Some of the biggest gainers have been Strategic Hotels and Resorts, Ashford Hospitality Trust and Hersha Hospitality Trust, whose year-to-date returns, through Thursday, including dividends, are 163 percent, 119 percent and 109 percent, respectively.
However, as Mr. Kelley, the Merrill Lynch analyst, said in a research note, lodging REITs and companies are still trading 21 percent below their peak values.
INVESTORS may have to wait for the big paybacks, Mr. Mandigo said, noting that after the 2002 downturn, it took four years for hotel rates to recover.
The numbers have evidently not daunted Mr. Branson and others who are jumping into the industry. Mr. Butler of Jeffer Mangels sees great opportunity for them, along with great risk.
''I would never bet against Mr. Branson, but it will, at the very least, be challenging,'' Mr. Butler says. ''He certainly has some terrific name recognition from his other ventures, but it takes years to build and establish a brand and a place in the market. He may well do it, but I think it's gutsy.''

HEADLINE: Charity Fixer To the Stars

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
LAST month, the actress Demi Moore and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, appeared at the United Nations on a panel announcing a United Nations-sponsored fund for victims of human trafficking. In January, they had founded the DNA Foundation, a charity to stop the brokering of young girls for sex. ''The truth is, slavery, globally, is a dirty little secret,'' Mr. Kutcher told an audience of 500, his voice wavering as he pointed out the average age of a sex slave is 13. ''It is happening everywhere right in front of our eyes and we ignore it.''
Wearing a thigh-high crimson dress, Ms. Moore told the story of a child prostitute she met in Los Angeles who was forced to sit in a tub of ice if she did not earn $1,500 a night. ''I was pained to know her options were so limited,'' she said.
As the two celebrities answered the moderator's questions, paparazzi snapping photographs mid-aisle, a dark-haired man seated behind them watched with interest: occasionally nodding in agreement, whispering in Ms. Moore's ear, surveying the crowd. He was Trevor Neilson, the couple's philanthropic adviser, who had arranged their appearance that day. 
Movie stars and musicians have long employed managers, agents and publicists to manage their business affairs. Low-key charity and political consultants, like Margery Tabankin, who works with Barbra Streisand; and Andy Spahn, a former president of the David Geffen Foundation, who has advised Steven Spielberg, are also occasionally part of the entourage.
But few philanthropic advisers have a celebrity Rolodex as full as Mr. Neilson's. With his wife, Maggie, a former technology executive, and Ann Kelly, a management consultant, Mr. Neilson runs a business called Global Philanthropy Group. A former staffer of the Clinton White House's travel office in 1993, he was an early supporter of Bono and his Africa initiative while working at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in the early 2000s. Mr. Neilson has helped steer the charitable endeavors of Angelina Jolie, the Hollywood-bad-girl-turned-human-rights-activist, whom he said he met in 2004 at a bar at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. And when Brad Pitt helped found his Make It Right Foundation in 2007, Mr. Neilson helped him devise a strategy to raise money to rebuild homes in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
''Trevor was kind of the first person to say to me, 'You have enormous reach, you should use it,' '' said Olivia Wilde, the 26-year-old star of the coming movie ''Tron: Legacy,'' who has been talking with Mr. Neilson about starting a club for members of young Hollywood interested in learning about global issues. Indeed, Mr. Neilson's project-client roster is broad: schools in Colombia (Shakira) and Haiti (Ben Stiller), domestic education (John Legend), microfinance (Tory Burch). ''He is using existing global brands for social change,'' said Bobby Shriver, a Kennedy family member who is a partner with Bono on his Africa initiatives.
Of course, outspoken devotion to a charity can also enhance or rehabilitate one's public relations profile (hence the general eye-rolling when Lindsay Lohan, who is not a client of Mr. Neilson's, announced that she was going to Africa in 2007 after being arrested for drunken driving). But Mr. Neilson insists that is beside the point.
''For some reason, cynicism is cool,'' he said on a recent morning at his office in Santa Monica, Calif. ''But in my view any dollar that can be brought into an issue, any visibility that can be brought, is something that wasn't there before. Bono didn't start off as Bono. He was just this Irish rock dude who went to Ethiopia, experienced the famine, and became who he is today. So this judgment that everyone so enjoys is of no interest to me.''
MR. NEILSON, 38, graduated from Washington State University in 1994 with a degree in literature. He is the eldest of five children, four of whom were adopted from Korea (from 1983 to 2003 his mother, Janice, was executive director of one of the top adoption agencies in the United States; his father, Scott, worked as a juvenile court commissioner). After dropping out of law school and briefly working in public relations, Mr. Neilson got a series of jobs at foundations and nonprofit organizations, working with well-connected philanthropists and policy makers, including the billionaire Richard Branson and Richard C. Holbrooke, a former American ambassador to the United Nations who helped broker peace in Bosnia in 1995.
Mr. Neilson's first significant brush with Hollywood celebrity came in 2001, when, as the director of special projects at the Gates Foundation in Seattle, he was approached by Bono and Mr. Shriver about a $1 million donation for a media campaign to expose the extreme poverty and AIDS crisis in Africa.
Mr. Neilson, a fan of U2 since college, was gung-ho. His bosses were warier and agreed to give Bono the money only if the musician could raise an additional $2 million. Mr. Neilson went further: He arranged a meeting between Mr. Gates and Bono at the Microsoft chairman's suite at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York during the World Economic Forum in early 2002. ''I did not have full authority to do so,'' Mr. Neilson recalled. ''I was terrified.''
But the meeting went well. Mr. Gates sent an e-mail to staff members saying so. The news was greeted coolly, though, by Mr. Neilson's colleagues in Seattle.
''A lot of people were like, 'Why is Bill Gates meeting this rock star?' '' said Joe Cerrell, the director of the European office for the Gates Foundation.
Mr. Neilson was reprimanded, he said. He left the Gates Foundation in late 2002 and moved to New York to become executive director of the Global Business Coalition, a consortium of more than 200 businesses overseen at the time by Mr. Holbrooke. He also worked briefly at the Endeavor Group, a legal and philanthropic consultancy in Washington, but that gig ended in a bitter dispute, the details of which Mr. Neilson refused to elaborate.
''I don't do well with bureaucracy,'' he said, speaking generally.
He and his wife formed the Global Philanthropy Group in 2007. ''I had to create the company,'' he said, with a laugh. ''Where else was I going to work?'' He provided the vision; she the spreadsheets and action plans. ''She is the pragmatic side of Trevor,'' said Kris Engskov, a close friend who worked with Mr. Neilson at the White House. ''He can sketch out for you a good idea. She is the one who makes it happen.''
The Neilsons moved their venture to the West Coast in 2008, a year after the stock market collapsed. Then celebrities like George Clooney and Don Cheadle, who were getting plaudits for their work in Darfur, were emerging as the new model for the actor/activist. ''Trevor saw the power of personality and saw how to leverage it to do good,'' Mr. Engskov said.
The Global Philanthropy Group employs seven analysts who conduct research that becomes part of a program the Neilsons design for each client, including weekly briefings (so clients know the difference between IMDb and an NGO), meetings with policy makers and events like the one at the United Nations. ''Trevor's clients are better prepared as advocates,'' said Robert C. Orr, the assistant secretary general for policy coordination and strategic planning at the United Nations, who first met Mr. Neilson when the adviser was at the Global Business Coalition. ''He is not just taking their quirky view of the world and giving them a platform.''
Perhaps the hardest part of the process, though, is figuring out which cause a celebrity should champion.
Three weeks ago, a representative from the Natural Resources Defense Council met Mr. Neilson at the Santa Monica office to discuss the singer Lenny Kravitz's new foundation. For three months Mr. Neilson had been exploring various possibilities. Early on, the staff had prepared an analysis of war and its relationship to oil dependence. That idea was nixed by Mr. Kravitz. The star was, however, interested in effects of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, so today the Natural Resources Defense Council was proposing a partnership that would focus attention on the connection between energy consumption, the ocean's rising temperature and their effect on sea life.
''If Lenny's open to that, that's great,'' the council representative said eagerly.
Mr. Neilson was hopeful. But Gary Gersh, Mr. Kravitz's manager, who also represents Mr. Legend, another Global Philanthropy client, proved cool to the idea.
''Sure, I want to make sure we are taking care of the oceans,'' Mr. Gersh said at a meeting at his office in nearby Venice, several hours later. ''Our thing is how do we hone in on that?''
Mr. Neilson was back to square one. He and Mr. Gersh agreed to meet with Mr. Kravitz in the Bahamas this month.
''Artists have to be very careful that when they speak that they know what they are speaking about,'' Mr. Gersh said.
MOST mornings Mr. Neilson, who is 6-foot-2 , his head large in proportion to his shoulders, can be found on his paddle board in the surf near Malibu. Afterward, he hangs it on a fence outside the kitchen window of his cottage in the Pacific Palisades, which has a porch overflowing with pink roses.
He showed a guest the view of the ocean, a block from his house, stopping to marvel at the horizon from three different spots. ''I like my life,'' he said.
But after two years in Los Angeles, Hollywood culture is still something of an enigma to him.
A few weeks ago, he met with Diana Bianchini, an event planner at Di Moda Public Relations, in his office. She offered, as part of a suite of services, to tint the window of a celebrity's car. ''We aren't so concerned about window tint,'' Mr. Neilson said.
Ms. Bianchini, a former runway model, boasted that she was part of a network of socialites who are on the same museum boards. ''Is this a real network?'' Mr. Neilson blurted.
He asked if she could organize a charity fashion show for the pop star Rihanna.
''That's for the ladies who lunch at the Beverly Wilshire,'' Ms. Bianchini sniffed. ''Can I just tell you? That's boorrring.''
Mr. Neilson had a more significant clash with Ms. Jolie (whom he said he nominated to be a member of the Council on Foreign Relations) in part because he was repeatedly quoted speaking on her behalf regarding humanitarian aid. In a March 2007 piece on The Huffington Post, Mr. Neilson was identified as her ''publicist'' (Ms. Jolie does not have a publicist). Mr. Neilson contends that Ms. Jolie ''outgrew'' him -- she maintains her own relationships with diplomats -- and they split in 2008. He was replaced as her philanthropic adviser by Mr. Neilson's former employer, the Endeavor Group, in Washington. The Neilsons both acknowledged there was tension with Geyer Kosinski, the actress's manager, who declined to comment.
But the Global Philanthropy Group is experiencing robust growth without Ms. Jolie. It currently advises 20 clients, some who pay $150,000 to $200,000 a year for the consulting work offered by the Neilsons and their staff. Mr. Neilson said that he is talking to two possible new clients, professional basketball players, and that he wants to create an organization in Los Angeles modeled after the Robin Hood Foundation in New York.
His wife, though, worries about serving current clients, perhaps with justification. ''Because they are doing so much their time gets spread thin,'' their client Ms. Moore said of the Neilsons in a recent interview. ''You need someone staying up on everything.''
It was Mr. Kutcher, she said, who came up with the idea for their ''Real Men Don't Buy Girls'' campaign. But when the couple spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative, they were coached by Mr. Neilson about what to expect.
''It was really helpful to have someone buffering, guiding us,'' she said.
Asked about the Neilsons' impact on the philanthropic strategy she has formed with her husband, Ms. Moore replied, ''I think we have a true democracy.''

HEADLINE: Budget-Cutting Colleges Bid Some Languages Adieu

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Albany
THE bad news was not unexpected: sweeping cutbacks at the State University of New York at Albany, prompted by sweeping cutbacks in state aid. The reactions, too, had a whiff of the familiar: student rallies, faculty resolutions, an online petition.
But then came an op-ed article in the French newspaper Le Monde, calling the cuts Orwellian. And an open letter from the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, sarcastically suggesting that universities give up teaching the humanities altogether.
If the cuts have struck a nerve far from this upstate campus and in more than one language, it is in large part because they involve language itself, and some cherished staples of the curriculum. The university announced this fall that it would stop letting new students major in French, Italian, Russian and the classics.
The move mirrors similar prunings around the country at other public colleges and universities that are reeling from steep drops in state aid. After a generation of expansion, academic officials are being forced to lop entire majors. More often than not, foreign languages -- European ones in particular -- are on the chopping block. 
The reasons for their plight are many. Some languages may seem less vital in a world increasingly dominated by English. Web sites and new technologies offer instant translations. The small, interactive classes typical of foreign language instruction are costly for universities.
But the paradox, some experts in higher education say, is that many schools are eliminating language degrees and graduate programs just as they begin to embrace an international mission: opening campuses abroad, recruiting students from overseas and talking about graduating citizens of the world. The University at Albany's motto is ''The World Within Reach.''
''There's no way on earth we should be cutting these languages,'' said John M. Hamilton, executive vice chancellor and provost at Louisiana State University, where officials this year decided to phase out majors in German and Latin, as well as basic instruction in Portuguese, Russian, Swahili and Japanese, after losing $42 million in public financing over the last two years.
''We should be adding languages and urging more students to take them,'' Dr. Hamilton added. ''I'm being asked to prepare students for the global economy, but this is almost like asking them to use the abacus instead of computers.''
Most public colleges still teach languages, but fewer are allowing students to make them a specialty. The University of Maine's president, Robert A. Kennedy, has recommended suspending undergraduate degree programs in German and Latin. This fall at the University of Nevada, Reno, students can no longer declare majors in German Studies or minors in Italian. At Winona State University in Minnesota, officials have placed a moratorium on new majors in French and German while it challenges the faculty to make those disciplines more relevant to the contemporary world.
Other schools, public and private, have recently eliminated or diluted the foreign-language component of their core curriculums. Starting next fall at the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences at the George Washington University, students will no longer have to take a foreign language to graduate, although they may use language courses to help fulfill a broader humanities requirement.
Bob Peckham, a professor of French at the University of Tennessee at Martin whose own program came under threat, has made it his mission to fight the retrenchments nationwide. As chairman of the Commission on Advocacy of the American Association of Teachers of French, he monitors cutback proposals and provides research that helps campuses tailor their protests.
''There are at least 54 foreign-language majors that have been either threatened or eliminated,'' Dr. Peckham said. ''People don't realize that this is happening in a lot of places.''
Still, languages are holding their own on campus. A report due Wednesday from the Modern Language Association, which advocates for language programs nationwide, will show that overall enrollments in college language classes are actually up over 2006, when the last survey was conducted, and are at their highest level since 1960.
One reason is a surge of interest in languages like Arabic and Spanish, which is thriving on campus in response to the nation's growing Latino population. China's rising importance has prompted more college programs in Mandarin, and the Chinese government has been generous in financing them.
Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, caused a stir with a speech last month to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in which he questioned the prominence of European language instruction, given the shift of power centers and political hot spots from Europe to Asia and the Middle East.
''My argument wasn't so much against this or that language,'' Dr. Haass, a former State Department official, said in an interview. ''But if we're going to remain economically competitive and provide the skill and manpower for government, I think we need more Americans to learn Chinese or Hindi or Farsi or Portuguese or Korean or Arabic. In an ideal world, that wouldn't mean fewer people would know Spanish, French, German and Italian. But in a real world, it might.''
Rosemary G. Feal, executive director of the Modern Language Association, rejected the notion of languages as ''a zero-sum game,'' and said the field had become too responsive to fads.
''We always do these things in fits and starts,'' said Dr. Feal, who is a Spanish professor at the University at Buffalo. ''We pick targets of opportunity as the geopolitical circumstances change, and we don't create a steady infrastructure so that language learning at a deep level is possible.''
She said the program cuts also revealed an ''Anglocentric perspective'' that fluency in English was enough to understand the world.
''How can you be a comprehensive university center,'' Dr. Feal said, ''and not offer students even the chance to take advanced courses in French, German, Russian and Italian, to read Goethe in the original?''
It is a tough choice, but a necessary one as publicly funded universities can no longer rely on piecemeal, one-time cuts to balance budgets, said Terry W. Hartle, a senior vice president of the American Council on Education. Across the country, he said, foreign language programs ''are being looked at carefully with an eye toward measuring student demand versus expenses.''
At SUNY Albany, which has lost tens of millions of dollars in state aid in the past few years and faces another $13 million loss this year, the situation has ''reached a breaking point,'' said its provost, Susan D. Phillips.
The French department has seven full-time faculty members and 40 majors, while 15 doctoral students do ''a great deal of the undergraduate instruction,'' Dr. Phillips said. In Russian, there are three full-time faculty members for 19 majors. By contrast, the communications department employs six full-time faculty members for 520 majors.
The university, which has also stopped accepting new majors in theater, has suspended degree programs in French, Italian and Russian. Making the change permanent would require State Department of Education approval.
Dr. Phillips said she hoped some instruction would continue in those languages. Currently, classes are offered in 13 languages, including Arabic, Dutch, Hebrew and Korean; students can earn undergraduate degrees in Spanish, Chinese and Japanese, and in East Asian Studies.
Meanwhile, those who have declared French, Russian or Italian as a major or minor say they worry that their diplomas could lose value if the degree programs vanish.
Jessica Stapf, a freshman, arrived on campus planning to pursue a double major in French and political science, followed by a master's in French, the only language aside from Spanish in which the university offered advanced degrees. She hopes to land a job someday with the United Nations in Africa, where French is widely spoken.
Though the university made an exception and allowed her to declare a French major anyway, she was advised that she would need to cram 11 upper-level courses into the next three semesters. The master's, she said, appears to be out of the question.
''It's extraordinarily inconvenient for me,'' Ms. Stapf said. ''If the university wants to provide that 'world within reach' they've been sloganeering about, then they have to provide the languages that bring the world within reach.''
Correction: December 12, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about cuts in language programs at public colleges and universities omitted a language program in which SUNY Albany offers advanced degrees. Besides French, the university also offers such degrees in Spanish.

 BODY:
An Accident in a Co-op Lobby
QI am a shareholder in a Brooklyn co-op. A board member fell in the lobby a year or so ago. The management company failed to notify the insurance company, assuming the woman probably wasn't badly hurt and would not sue. It assumed wrongly; this person is now suing the co-op, and the shareholders stand to lose a lot of money because of her lawsuit. Is there any way to hold the management company responsible for this?
A Ira S. Goldenberg, a co-op and condominium lawyer in White Plains, says that the co-op should explore suing the managing agent, who may have been contractually obligated to promptly report the claim to the co-op's insurance carrier. In fact, even if the management agreement did not impose that duty, the managing agent may still be liable for the negligent manner in which the claim was handled. 
''The managing agent's defense of the claim against it, in turn, may be provided by its own or the co-op's liability insurance carrier,'' Mr. Goldenberg said. Whether or not a suit is brought against the managing agent, the co-op should report the claim to its own carrier and request that a defense be provided.
Raising Rents in 'Hardship' Cases
QA number of rent-regulated apartments are for sale in a New York City condominium building. Several of the tenants pay less in rent than the combined common charge and real estate tax on their apartments, creating a negative cash flow. What are the chances that a new owner could get a hardship rent increase for those tenants?
A Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said it was extremely rare for the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the agency that enforces the rent laws, to grant owners of any kind of regulated apartment a so-called hardship increase. ''Anyone who buys any regulated housing hoping to turn a profit by getting a hardship increase is betting on the longest of shots at best,'' Mr. Bailey said.
Setting a Quorum for Board Meetings
QWe are an eight-apartment co-op that has eight board members. One of the members is never present at meetings and does not respond to correspondence or take part in maintaining the building. Our bylaws require a quorum of five members for the board to take any action. Can we reduce that requirement to four?
A Sandor Krauss, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer, says the state's Business Corporation Law provides that a majority of the entire board normally constitutes a quorum. However, the law also allows a corporation to set the quorum below a majority of the board members -- but not below one-third -- by amending its bylaws, either by a vote of the board or the shareholders.
''The board does not need that absent member to get the five-member quorum to pass the amendment,'' Mr. Krauss said, ''as any five board members would constitute a quorum.'' If the bylaws can be amended only by a shareholder vote, he said, a shareholder meeting must be called.
Most bylaws provide that more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares constitute a quorum, and that amending the bylaws would require either a majority or a supermajority -- typically, two-thirds or three-quarters, Mr. Krauss said.

HEADLINE: Arizona's Medicaid Cuts Are Seen as a Sign of the Financial Times

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
With enrollments exploding, revenues shrinking and the low-hanging fruit plucked long ago, virtually every state has had to make painful cuts to its Medicaid program during the economic downturn.
What distinguishes the reductions recently imposed in Arizona, where coverage was eliminated on Oct. 1 for certain transplants of the heart, liver, lung, pancreas and bone marrow, is the decision to stop paying for treatments urgently needed to ward off death.
The cuts in transplant coverage, which could deny organs to 100 adults currently on the transplant list, are testament to both the severity of fiscal pressures on the states and the particular bloodlessness of budget-cutting in Arizona. 
''It's a real sign of the times,'' said Alan Weil, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. ''And I think this is a precursor to a much larger number of states having this discussion.''
Policy choices with such life-threatening implications are all the more striking given the partisan framing of the health debate.
Republicans have argued that the new health law will lead to rationing, warning even of ''death panels.'' Democrats have responded that care is already rationed, with 50 million people going largely without insurance, and that the law will bring greater equity.
The Arizona case, said Diane Rowland, director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, ''is a classic example of making decisions based not on medical need but based on a budget.'' And, she added, ''it results, potentially, in denial of care to individuals in a life-or-death situation.''
The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services do not monitor which states use Medicaid money for transplants. But health experts said no other state had withdrawn coverage for patients pursuing transplants.
Arizona's decision, by Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, and the Republican-controlled Legislature, was made after state officials assessed success and survival rates for a number of transplant procedures. National transplant groups call the figures misleading.
''It seems inappropriate that life-saving care has the potential to be withheld based solely on budgetary issues and the bureaucratic determination of relative benefits,'' said Dr. Robert S. Gaston, president-elect of the American Society of Transplantation.
There is usually a long-term consequence to short-term cuts in safety-net programs like Medicaid, which insures low-income Americans and is financed by state and federal governments.
When payments to doctors are cut, fewer providers are willing to treat Medicaid patients. When eligibility levels are lowered, more people are left to seek charity care in emergency rooms. When optional benefits like dental services and prescription drugs are eliminated, conditions worsen until they require more expensive care.
But no other state in recent memory has made such a numbers-driven calculation pitting the potential loss of life against modest savings.
Jennifer Carusetta, the legislative liaison for Arizona's Medicaid agency, said the transplant cuts would save a mere $800,000 in the current fiscal year, and only $1.4 million for a full year.
The cuts were imposed in an effort to close a $2.6 billion shortfall in the state's $8.9 billion budget for this year.
The options available to states for cutting Medicaid have been limited because the federal stimulus package and the health care law have required them to maintain eligibility levels. That has left states to cut payments to providers and trim benefits not required by federal regulations.
Many states, including Arizona, have done both. A September report by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 39 states cut provider payments and 20 cut optional benefits in their 2010 fiscal years, with similar numbers planning to do so in 2011.
Arizona reduced Medicaid payments to doctors by 5 percent last year and has frozen payments to hospitals and nursing homes for two years. All providers will undergo another 5 percent cut on April 1, Ms. Carusetta said.
This year, Arizona became the only state to eliminate its Children's Health Insurance Program, which would have affected 47,000 children of working-class parents. Lawmakers reversed course before the effective date only after concluding that the state might run afoul of federal requirements and lose billions of dollars in matching money.
The state has also enacted a wide range of Medicaid cuts, eliminating coverage for emergency dental procedures, insulin pumps and orthotics. ''We realize this has serious impacts on people,'' Ms. Carusetta said. ''Unfortunately, given the fiscal constraints facing our state, the Legislature has limited options at this point.''

HEADLINE: Trying to Ignite Spark of Revival In a Grim Gary

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
kari.lydersen@gmail.com

 BODY:
Anthony Broadnax clambered up the stairs of a vacant brick building in Gary, Ind., on Thursday, stepping through rubble left by thieves who had ransacked the structure for copper. The thick burgundy carpet was littered with trophies, microwave popcorn and plastic flowers.
Mr. Broadnax, 43, hopes to transform the building into the headquarters of a company that oversees revitalization projects. An engineer and Gary native who returned to the area from Houston four years ago eager to help transform his home town, he has big dreams: to turn an old library with a tree growing through its floor into a recycling center; to remake a towering apartment building with holes in its brick walls into a Hilton.
But the view from the building reveals the challenges that must be overcome. To the north are the belching smokestacks of U.S. Steel's Gary Works, one of the few economic engines left in the city, but also a source of air pollution. Vacant lots and slumping abandoned houses line the road outside. The building itself was the headquarters of a company whose director pleaded guilty to 13 felony fraud-related counts, and stands as a symbol of the persistent corruption that is often blamed for failed efforts to revitalize the city. 
Now, two unlikely partners -- the Chicago-based Metropolitan Planning Council and The Times Media Company, publisher of the Northwest Indiana Times -- have taken the lead in a planning process that they hope will ignite lasting changes and save Gary.
They call their endeavor the Gary and Region Investment Project, or GRIP, and believe that the city's fortunes influence the economic well-being of the larger region, and that neighboring municipalities have an interest in helping Gary get back on its feet.
''As Gary goes, so goes the rest,'' said Sister Peg Spindler, executive director of the Sojourner Truth House food pantry in Gary. ''People just can't see beyond the ends of their noses. Until they do, we will sink together.''
Ms. Spindler said she hoped the outside influences involved in GRIP would help overcome the city's divisiveness, which she compares to the United States Congress, ''where everyone's always saying 'no' instead of getting anything done.'' Mayor Rudy Clay did not return calls for comment.
William Nangle, executive editor of The Northwest Indiana Times, said he did not see a conflict of interest in a news media company's playing a lead role in a development initiative by orchestrating redevelopment coverage and seeking investors. Mr. Nangle described the paper as the ''connective tissue'' that was letting the public know about development proposals.
Gary was founded in 1906 by U.S. Steel, and for the next half-century, it was a thriving metropolis of grand buildings, fancy department stores and stately stone churches. Huge job losses in the steel industry began the city's downward economic spiral several decades ago.
The city became a symbol of segregation, with blacks accounting for 84 percent of the population -- the highest percentage of any city with more than 100,000 residents, according to the 2000 census. The city's population is expected to fall below 100,000 in the 2010 census.
The stigma of crime and disinvestment make it hard to attract new residents and even visitors. Gary has often logged the country's highest murder rate. Andy Viano, president and general manager of the Gary South Shore RailCats minor league baseball team, said it was a struggle to persuade people to visit the ballpark.
''They think it's not safe,'' Mr. Viano said, although he added that many fans returned to the stadium after their first visit.
Mr. Viano hopes one of the GRIP proposals, a revitalization of Broadway Avenue downtown, might encourage fans to linger in town after games.
On Oct. 27, GRIP announced six possible redevelopment projects, putting them to an online vote that ends today. Once the most popular projects have been chosen, the Metropolitan Planning Council and The Times Media Company will work with other stakeholders to seek state and federal grants and to pursue private investment to carry them out.
One project, redevelopment of the Marquette Park beachfront, has already secured a $28 million grant from the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority, said Christopher A. Meyers, the Gary planning director. Another, to open up a beachfront in part by burying power lines, is getting about $1.5 million from the regional development authority for studies. The city has also received a federal grant of close to $1 million to develop part of a proposed 30-mile bicycle trail, Mr. Meyers said.
Other GRIP proposals include encouraging development around Indiana University Northwest and increasing traffic at the airport, which lost its only commercial passenger service when Hooters Air pulled out in 2006.
Any one of those projects would cost many millions, and there is no guarantee that financing will materialize. But leaders say they are hopeful, thanks in part to federal encouragement. Ron Sims, deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has called GRIP an example of the regional planning focus favored by the Obama administration.
State Senator Earline S. Rogers grew up in Gary and has lived there most of her life, teaching elementary school for 38 years along with serving in the state legislature. She said she remembered when Gary was ''a hustling, bustling town,'' and watched in dismay as movie theaters and grocery stores closed.
''It has not been a good feeling as these landmarks would disappear,'' Ms. Rogers said. ''There's the sinking sensation as to whether we'd be able to rebound.''
GRIP's regional approach will avoid some of the infighting typical in Gary, Ms. Rogers said.
Some of the city's problems resist quick solutions. The tiny neighborhood of Cowboy Town provides an example.
During the decades when Gary was falling into economic decay and social turmoil, a handful of Latino families lived a separate existence in Cowboy Town, on a piece of land tucked between the I-90 tollway, the Calumet River and a lagoon adjacent to the airport. They kept horses, other livestock and chickens in makeshift coops and pens.
But residents are now under federal orders to move so the Environmental Protection Agency can start a long-delayed cleanup of toxic PCBs in the lagoon, once a sludge dumping ground for the Gary sanitary district, which has spent more than $1 million buying their homes.
By Thursday, Cowboy Town was empty. In one of the last residences to be vacated, kittens roamed amid family photos and dolls. A message scrawled on one wall reminded Javi to come back for the house plants.
Mr. Meyers said Cowboy Town would be razed and the soil remediated and capped. It will remain open space, he said, as the area is too polluted to be redeveloped.

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS.

 BODY:
Labor and business leaders are busy sifting through questionnaire responses from the record crop of would-be aldermen to determine which of the challengers might be friendly to their agendas and could mount viable campaigns. 
More than 350 people turned in nominating petitions last month to run in the Feb. 22 election for the 50 City Council seats. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce has assigned about a dozen staff members and consultants to sort out who's who in each ward, said Jerry Roper, the chamber's president and chief executive.
''A lot of the air is being sucked out of the room by the discussion in the mayor's race,'' Mr. Roper said, ''but we think the big opportunities will be at the City Council level.''
The first challenge is determining which candidates understand the responsibilities. ''The vast majority don't understand the issues,'' Mr. Roper said. ''They just want the job because it pays more than $100,000 a year.''
Political operatives from the Chicago Federation of Labor sent 35 questions to everyone who filed for the election. More than 200 people responded. Union officials plan to begin interviews Monday and make endorsements within weeks.
Labor provided millions of dollars in campaign cash and hundreds of workers for many successful challengers in the last election in 2007. The unions focused on Mayor Richard M. Daley's Council allies.
''Everybody and their mother saw that you could run against an incumbent and win,'' said Jorge Ramirez, the federation's president. ''I don't think folks are looking to do it alone.''
Labor's strong showing in 2007 helped win a 10-year contract agreement that promises wage increases and good benefits to unionized city employees. But the city's gaping budget deficits have already led to contract concessions, including unpaid furlough days.
Now is not the time for the unions to scale back their local activism, Mr. Ramirez said, adding, ''The economy being as bad as it is definitely has amplified things.''

HEADLINE: In East Texas, Piles of Wood Look Like an Electric Opportunity

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Driving his mud-spattered Suburban through a wood storage yard, Danny Vines gestured out the window at piles of lopped-off logs and bushy materials.
''This is our fuel,'' he said. ''And it's a waste product.''
Just down the road from the storage yard, Mr. Vines's company, Aspen Power, is building a first-of-its-kind power plant in Texas: one that will burn the woody debris to make steam, which turns generators to make electricity. The roughly $128 million plant in Lufkin is expected to begin running tests this month and should start full operations in the spring.
Interest in building power plants fueled by wood waste has recently surged in East Texas, which has none of the wind-power potential of West Texas but does have plenty of pine trees. Forty-five miles away from Lufkin, in Northwestern Nacogdoches County, a larger plant with the capacity to power about 75,000 homes is being built by Southern Company, an Atlanta-based utility holding company. That plant, which will sell its power to Austin Energy, broke ground a year ago and should be operational by mid-2012. 
Two other plants, near Woodville and Lindale, received crucial permits from Texas air-pollution regulators this year, though construction has not yet started. A fifth plant, near Greenville, has an application pending.
The case for biomass power is that it derives from a renewable resource: trees. The power plants can produce electricity around the clock, unlike wind turbines and solar panels, which work only when the weather is right. They also create jobs.
The Texas biomass boom comes at a curious time, however. Natural gas prices have fallen to about one-third of their highs from two years ago, which means that the plants may have to sell their electricity for far less than they had originally hoped.
''Low gas prices mean low power prices, and that's tough on any kind of renewable energy,'' said Mike Whiting, president and chief executive of Florida-based Decker Energy, a biomass and natural gas plant operator that is hoping to build the plant near Lindale. ''The financial crisis hasn't exactly been good either.''
The Lindale plant, Mr. Whiting added, has been hampered by these problems and is moving ''very slowly.''
Mr. Vines said the Lufkin plant has received about $1 million in state and local grant money, and will soon apply for a substantial federal grant (available through the stimulus program).
Biomass power made from woody debris represents about 1 percent of the nation's electricity supply. While the amount of power from other renewables like wind and solar has increased in recent years, biomass power production has merely held steady, because few plants have been built. Most existing plants operate in the Northeast and especially California, but Southern states -- eager to get into the renewables business with a homegrown resource -- have shown interest over the past several years.
Across the Southeast, Mr. Whiting estimates that there are roughly 10 stand-alone biomass plants, with four more -- including the two in Texas -- currently under construction.
The plants have run into opposition from several groups, including environmentalists. Neil Carman, the clean air director of the Sierra Club in Texas, said he was skeptical of the claims by biomass plants that they are ''carbon-neutral'' because the calculations would depend on how long it takes for the trees -- the original source of the fuel -- to grow back.
However, other types of pollution are more immediately worrisome, Mr. Carman said. ''They can have a lot of dirty particulate matter from what they're burning,'' he said. ''I would be very concerned about the potential for local air pollution problems.''
Indeed, a few years ago locals raised concerns about pollution from the Lufkin plant, which is co-owned by Mr. Vines. That led to a protracted and rancorous permitting battle in which the Environmental Protection Agency got involved. Eventually, improvements in pollution controls were required, said Aaron Hartsfield, a postal worker who lives about a half-mile from the plant.
The pulp and paper industry also has reservations about potential competition for woody debris. Biomass plant operators insist they will use leftover materials -- the Lufkin plant, for example, plans to use logging debris and limbs remaining in the forests that would otherwise rot or get burned, as well as trees and shrubs cut down by homeowners, and available wood waste from mills.
But sometimes, wood waste gets used for other purposes. Pulp mills, for example, use their debris to generate energy within their plants (as opposed to feeding it into the electric grid). There are 50 to 100 such plants across the Southeast, including in Texas, Mr. Whiting said.
''Potentially, you're driving up the cost of their feedstock,'' said Luke Bellsnyder, executive director of the Texas Association of Manufacturers, whose members include pulp and paper mills.
Landowners, however, will welcome a new market for their product, said Ron Hufford, executive vice president of the Texas Forestry Association, whose members span a range of forest-industry players, including some of the biomass plants.
The biggest question hanging over the Texas biomass industry right now, however, is economics. When many of these plants were conceived, energy prices were much higher, so the plant operators assumed a bigger return.
An exception of sorts is the Nacogdoches County plant, which Southern Company acquired last year. Before construction started, the plant's previous owner had signed a contract with Austin Energy in which the capital-area utility agreed to buy the power for 20 years.
Natural gas prices were then perhaps three times what they are today, and there was anticipation of a potential federal price on carbon-dioxide emissions, according to Michael E. Webber, associate director at the Center for International Energy & Environmental Policy at the University of Texas. Mr. Webber was part of a commission that is tasked with reviewing Austin Energy's policies, and he voted in favor of the plant in 2008.
Even back then, the plant -- conceived to help satisfy Austin Energy's goal of getting 30 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020 -- was controversial, Mr. Webber said. Now, he said, ''it's hard to justify biomass'' with gas prices so much lower.
Other plants, like the one in Lufkin, are desperately hoping that the Legislature will pass a new renewable electricity requirement that would apply to energy sources other than already-thriving wind power. This would likely force electric companies to buy some biomass power. (A 2007 state law established a grant program to aid biomass power, but the $30 million has not been financed.)
This year the state's Public Utility Commission considered crafting a requirement for 500 megawatts of power from non-wind renewables, which would include solar and geothermal power as well as biomass. (For comparison's sake, the Lufkin plant is 50 megawatts and the Nacogdoches County plant is 100 megawatts.) But it has not acted, and the Legislature is likely to consider the issue.
Asked when he and his partners would break even, Mr. Vines said the answer was ''contingent on the development'' of a 500-megawatt, non-wind requirement.
Environmentalists also support a non-wind renewables requirement, but the powerful manufacturing lobby will stand opposed, fearful that it would drive up electricity prices.
''We will not support a mandate or a subsidy requiring biomass,'' Mr. Bellsnyder said.

HEADLINE: Falling Into the Partisan Trap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Partisan Mind'' (column, Nov. 29), Ross Douthat describes the flip-flopping and ''role reversal'' that occur as people switch their views about a policy depending on which party is responsible for it. 
This will never end as long as ''We the People'' still believe that we are included rather than marginalized in most decision-making.
The decision is made and we are told how we feel about it according to our partisan affiliation. It is the politicians who are partisan. The people are just sitting in the stadium with their team jerseys on, thinking that they actually affect the outcome of the game by showing up (voting).
''Enough!'' is how the majority really feels, but nothing will change until the political divide is perceived as being between ''we the people'' and ''they the government,'' and then we make sure that we have influence, not just opinions.
George Nuckols Quebro Plaza, Panama, Nov. 29, 2010
To the Editor:
In a refreshingly nonpartisan column, Ross Douthat documents the many ways that the partisan mind-set clouds objective thinking.
The tendency to cognitively twist events so they fit a partisan outlook is worsened by the contemporary media environment. Cable networks (think of Fox and MSNBC), as well as a multitude of Web sites, present a one-dimensional view of complex events that reinforces the beliefs of the partisans who are particularly likely to seek out this information.
Given the fragmented nature of the media audience, cable networks benefit economically by offering news that attracts a partisan niche. Republicans become more convinced of the wisdom of a Republican worldview after feasting on Fox, while Democrats feel more confident that the Democratic administration is correct after consuming the MSNBC diet.
This leads to a lack of exposure to ideas and information that might challenge a partisan perspective. Partisan Americans -- and there are many of them -- are deprived of what John Stuart Mill called ''the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.''
Richard M. Perloff Cleveland, Nov. 29, 2010
The writer is a professor at, and director of, the School of Communication, Cleveland State University.
To the Editor:
There is one ''modest virtue'' of partisanship, Ross Douthat argues, and that is a ''reasonably passionate opposition'' that provides a check and balance for executive power.
Unfortunately, the fungus of 100 percent partisan opposition that aims to paralyze the majority party's programs overshadows partisanship's ''modest virtue'' and results in government inaction.

HEADLINE: It's the Big Questions That Slow Growth

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA D. ROMER. 
Christina D. Romer is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.

 BODY:
UNCERTAINTY is frequently blamed for the sorry state of the economy -- for why businesses are not investing strongly in new equipment or hiring more workers, and for why consumers are not spending freely. On Wall Street, it's even said that government meddling is the main culprit and that political gridlock is the cure.
This is a serious misreading of the situation. Uncertainty is likely holding back the recovery. But its sources are far more fundamental than the tax and environmental issues that typically top the list of complaints. And the solution is certainly not for the government to do less. Rather, it needs to do much more. 
Despite all of the hand-wringing over the future of the Bush tax cuts, it is just not plausible that they are a major source of uncertainty. At a meeting on Tuesday with Congressional leaders, President Obama indicated, as he had done frequently before, that he was eager to reach a compromise.
Both political parties have clearly stated their intention to extend the tax cuts on incomes less than $250,000. The biggest question is whether the top tax rate will be 35 or 39.6 percent. That is not the degree or kind of uncertainty that is likely to cause businesses and consumers to put hiring and spending decisions on hold.
The more genuine source of tax uncertainty is related to the government's long-run budget deficits. Congressional Budget Officeprojections show that the current budget trajectory is grossly unsustainable. The tax changes required to balance the budget in the future could be modest or enormous, depending on what happens to spending.
Simply promising not to raise taxes wouldn't be helpful. The American people are wise enough to understand that wishing won't make the problem go away. The only way to resolve this fundamental uncertainty is to enact a credible long-run deficit reduction plan that shows what spending will be cut and what taxes will be raised, once the economy returns to full employment.
The release of the report of the president's bipartisan deficit commission on Wednesday was an important step, but it is unclear whether the administration and Congress will embrace the recommendations.
Wall Street analysts often cite possible government regulations on the environment as another source of damaging uncertainty. But as with the deficit, inaction could be far more damaging than action. Climate change and dependence on foreign oil are problems that won't go away on their own. Tabling plans to deal with them doesn't make it easier for companies to plan and invest; it makes it harder.
Until businesses and communities know the costs and incentives for developing renewable energy, nuclear power and natural gas -- and whether we will address climate change through prices or direct regulation -- it will be very hard to invest in new power sources and related industrial technologies.
The deepest and most destructive uncertainty we face centers on the overall health of the economy and its prospects for growth. Unlike other postwar recessions that were caused by tight monetary policy and high interest rates, the recent downturn resulted from the bursting of a housing bubble and a financial crisis. Because we are in largely uncharted territory, figuring out how and when the economy will recover is much harder than usual.
Some forecasters say that consumer spending is on the rebound and that housing construction will bounce back as the normal demographic determinants of housing demand reassert themselves. Others say that the process of deleveraging -- getting debt burdens back down to normal levels -- will continue to inhibit the growth of consumer spending and business investment, and that the oversupply of housing and commercial real estate built up during the bubble will continue to depress construction and real estate prices.
One sign of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty is that the forecasts of respected analysts are all over the map. According to the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the difference between the highest and the lowest forecasts of unemployment a year from now is about twice as large as it was before the crisis. And forecasters' reported uncertainty about their longer-run forecasts has shown no sign of improving over the last year. If professional forecasters are unsure of the future, businesses and consumers certainly are as well.
Such uncertainty about future economic conditions can make people hold off on any spending that is difficult to undo. Companies may hesitate to build factories or hire permanent employees until they have a better sense of whether the markets for their products will be strong or weak. Consumers may not buy new cars or build additions to their homes until they are more certain about future employment.
In a paper I wrote many years ago, I found that such macroeconomic uncertainty helped start the Great Depression. The stock market crash in October 1929 didn't destroy a particularly large amount of wealth or make people highly pessimistic. Rather, it made companies and consumers very unsure about future income, and so led them to stop spending as they waited for more information.
How do we resolve uncertainty about future growth? The Federal Reserve, Congress and the president need to reaffirm that they will do whatever it takes to restore the economy to full health. They could take a lesson from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who declared in his 1933 inaugural address that he would treat the task of putting people back to work ''as we would treat the emergency of a war.''
They should follow up with powerful fiscal and monetary actions to create jobs -- coupled with a concrete plan for tackling our long-run budget problems. We are at a critical moment. With many in Congress opposed to further jobs measures and tax increases of any kind, the chances of prolonged gridlock are high.
BUT such policy paralysis would be a disaster. It would make uncertainty more acute by leaving us to the unpredictable forces of natural recovery and with no prospect of resolving our unsustainable deficits. Aggressive action to restore growth and face up to our long-run challenges is the only true and lasting solution.

HEADLINE: Networker On a Mission

BYLINE: By DANIEL BERGNER. 
Daniel Bergner is a contributing writer. He is the author of ''In the Land of Magic Soldiers: A Story of White and Black in West Africa.''

 BODY:
''I do human rights the way I played basketball,'' John Prendergast said. We were sitting in the outdoor restaurant of an unfinished hotel in Juba, a boomtown of mud and shanties beside the White Nile in southern Sudan. It's a restaurant where the South's liberation leaders tend to gather, and these days they are in a buoyant mood. They have traded their fatigues for dress shirts and suits. A half-century of civil war seems to be culminating in independence. If a referendum on Jan. 9 goes as expected, the map of Africa will be redrawn -- with a new nation around the size of Texas. But for the moment, Prendergast, who is America's most influential activist in Africa's most troubled regions and who huddled on a White House patio with President Barack Obama a few days earlier, talked about basketball guards. 
Pistol Pete Maravich, the N.B.A. All-Star of the '70s, with his floppy socks and flashy ball-handling, was a childhood hero, Prendergast said. He spoke about his own brief high-school glory, his own attempts to dazzle and, now, his celebrity-strewn methods of making Americans turn their eyes to Africa. He raked his fingers through wavy gray hair that fell to the shoulders of his T-shirt. The hair, along with the unshaven scruff on his chin, made for a look of dashing flamboyance that was undercut by bursts of boyish energy. ''There are a lot of criticisms that it's about me and not the cause,'' he went on about his work in the field of human rights. He declared that he can't be bothered by the complaints, some of which arise from his habit of dropping into conflict zones with actors like George Clooney and Angelina Jolie. At 47, he has devoted all of his adult life to Africa, especially the Horn and Congo, formerly known as Zaire. He's been jailed in southern Sudan. He's had militiamen's assault rifles jammed into his stomach in Congo. While we sat in the Juba restaurant in October, he was fighting off a rare infection that is a precursor to elephantiasis, contracted in Sudan a week or two before. Swollen glands throughout his body made him wince as he walked across the restaurant.
Prendergast laid a small map of Sudan -- of the nation as it looks for the moment, not yet divided in two -- on a table in front of Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth, an insider in the South's government in waiting, a towering man with tribal scars, six raised horizontal lines, spanning his forehead. The two men discussed the chances of the new country's being born without causing more cataclysmic warfare. Scribbled notes cluttered the map as Gatkuoth brought Prendergast up to date on developments in the South, on fresh pacts being sealed between the main liberation group and an array of factions. The rebel leaders know from CNN, and from Prendergast himself -- ''So George Clooney and I met with President Obama last week . . .'' -- that Prendergast has pull with their ally America. And for Prendergast, the information that he can learn from those leaders is currency. The mix of his exhaustive knowledge and his marshaling of movie stars has placed him near the heart of the American administration's role in Sudan's impending rearrangement.
If the vote isn't derailed by disputes between North and South, it seems certain that the southern Sudanese will cast their ballots in January overwhelmingly for secession. After that, it's possible that the South -- an expanse of parched scrub and swamp, a land of seminomadic herders whose cattle have gorgeous lyre-shaped horns and whose dung fires send a blue-tinted gauze into the air at dusk -- will emerge quietly into statehood. But many worry that it all will explode. During the phase of fighting from 1983 until the signing of the fragile current peace agreement in 2005, it's estimated that more than two million people, mostly southern civilians, were killed. Many were slaughtered by marauding militia on horseback -- forces armed by the northern regime based in Khartoum. More perished in war-sown famine. Now many analysts warn that a vote to break away will spur Khartoum back into belligerence, that there is no way the North will relinquish the oil fields that fall largely in southern territory and that the next phase of the conflict will be even more catastrophic than anything before it. Earlier this year, Dennis Blair, then America's director of national intelligence, told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that in thinking about the next five years in all the world's unstable places ''a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur in southern Sudan.''
Prendergast insists that the United States can prevent the resumption of warfare. ''I live in the country with the greatest influence in Sudan,'' he said. He was thinking back to the underuse of American power that outraged him during the Rwandan genocide and during the initial crisis in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, a situation mostly separate from Sudan's North-South fighting. He is determined not to let the same kind of abdication bring disaster with the referendum. ''Do I sound like a zealot?'' he asked me. ''I am a zealot.'' His faith in America's capacity to stave off war in Sudan is all but absolute -- though some experts aren't nearly as confident -- and his fear that he will not be heard, that his faith will not be heeded, runs deep. ''I am not a tree falling in a forest,'' he said. For much of his career, he was heard faintly at best as he journeyed alone throughout the Horn, writing about atrocities and failed states in Human Rights Watch reports and journals with names like The Review of African Political Economy and in the occasional newspaper op-ed. In recent months, he has waged a loud campaign to compel Obama and members of his foreign-policy team to engage aggressively in persuading Khartoum to let the South go in peace. ''He has been enormously influential; he's created direction and intensity,'' John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has just emerged as Obama's unofficial point man in averting devastation in Sudan, told me.
Has Prendergast's advocacy sometimes become uncomfortable? I asked Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser, at the White House a few weeks ago. ''Yes!'' McDonough, a man who doesn't seem given to displaying uneasiness, answered emphatically, acknowledging the effect of Prendergast's relentless effort to pull attention to one of the world's easily ignored realms. ''Are you always comfortable with your conscience?''
''My father was a frozen-food salesman -- he sold pork fritters out of his station wagon,'' Prendergast said, remembering his growing up around the Midwest and outside Philadelphia. ''He kept the samples in dry ice and his deep fryer in the back, and he would do demos at hospitals and schools.'' Both his parents were devoted to volunteer work, and Prendergast, during college, volunteered at a homeless shelter. When he was 21, he took in three children -- 7, 8 and 9 years old -- from the shelter to live with him in his small apartment for the summer, so their mother could focus on her younger children. ''Every day we tried to figure it out,'' he told me, describing the way he managed this ad hoc big-brother program, caring for the three with the help of his friends and family. Over the years since, informally or through organizations, he has been a big brother to six more kids -- reading with them, canoeing with them.
During an itinerant college career -- he went to five universities before graduating from Temple -- Prendergast was sure his lifework would be aiding the urban poor, but in 1984 he saw images of the Ethiopian famine one night on television. This was before the crisis became a cause sung about by pop stars, and the inert, skeletal figures stunned him. ''Somehow for the first 21 years of my life, I'd missed the fact that such a level of human suffering could exist,'' he said. ''I was immediately obsessed.''
He applied right away for an Ethiopian visa. After being denied, he flew to Mali, another country of famine. ''I wanted to know what I as a citizen, and what America as a country, could do to keep more people from that depth of agony.'' On the plane, a Malian who went to graduate school at one of the universities Prendergast attended recognized him from the gym, remembering his long hair and Maravich-inspired showboating on the basketball court. Prendergast explained why he was on the flight, and the Malian, an agriculture official, took him to live on his compound and schooled him in the theories of famine. ''My vocation shifted from education and youth employment toward wars and starvation in Africa,'' he said. Two and a half years later, Prendergast was in southern Sudan, in camps for the displaced, documenting war-caused starvation for an American advocacy group.
By 1991, he was traveling along the reedy shallows of the Sobat River, a tributary to the Nile, in a dugout canoe, going to meet with Riek Machar, one of the South's rebel generals. Prendergast was 28. He was employed, at that point, by a small American nongovernmental organization; he envisioned himself absorbing everything he could about the Horn and Central Africa -- where he was living for about two-thirds of each year -- and then one day putting his knowledge to use in a midlevel State Department job that would give him a role in promoting peace and preventing famines. He was making his way to Machar with the ambition of learning more thoroughly about the South's resistance movement -- one that stirred his deep sympathy -- and with the belief that Machar would prove to be a pivotal hero among its commanders. ''I had the glow of naivety,'' he recalled. He'd met Machar before; now he was going to immerse himself in his thinking. He approached the general's swampy base of crouched mud huts. ''There was a bit of 'Apocalypse Now' about that trip,'' he said. ''I was arriving on the river to understand the man. His soldiers were all around us. We sat outside in plastic chairs, and I listened straight through the night.''
By the time Prendergast had his audience with Machar amid the crackle of military radios and the flicker of kerosene lanterns, Sudan had been ravaged by civil war for decades. The fighting started just before independence from joint British and Egyptian colonial control in 1956, with the southerners, who are predominantly black and who practice, for the most part, traditional animist religions or Christianity, battling for freedom or partial separation from Khartoum's Arab and Islamic rule. In 1972, an accord was reached, allowing the South a measure of autonomy; but in 1978, Chevron discovered oil just to the southern side of the North-South line. It wasn't long before Khartoum decided that the South's semi-autonomy, which included resources and revenues, wasn't a good idea. In 1983, Khartoum effectively reunified the country. It declared, too, that Shariah law would be imposed throughout the nation. Southern rebels quickly stormed one of Chevron's bases and resumed their resistance against the North. In the early '90s, the rebels became appealing freedom fighters in the eyes of the U.S. government. This was partly because the Khartoum regime supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and provided a home for numerous jihadists, including Osama bin Laden, earning Khartoum a spot on America's list of state sponsors of terrorism. And it was partly because Christian evangelicals saw the southern cause as a movement of religious brethren.
''He had a vision,'' Prendergast said of his night with Machar. As clouds of insects hovered around the kerosene lamps, the general declaimed that he just split from the South's main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, and that his new force would be the one to carry southerners, at last, to their independent destiny. ''He was charismatic. I was very impressed. He said all the right things about inclusiveness; I thought he could see exactly what the southern rebel movement should look like.'' The S.P.L.A.'s leadership was dominated by members of the Dinka tribe, the South's largest, and was faulted for perpetrating the abuse of other southerners. Machar, who belongs to the Nuer, the South's second-biggest tribe, pledged that his army would fully represent the land's diverse people. After spending three days at Machar's base, Prendergast traveled on. ''I was inspired,'' he said. ''I felt promise.''
Soon, though, he started hearing accounts of a rampage by Machar's new faction on a Dinka area in the Bor region. Prendergast headed in that direction and was horrified to find Dinka corpses and torched Dinka villages. In what came to be known as the Bor massacre, Machar's troops killed around 2,000, mostly women and children. ''It was such a betrayal,'' Prendergast said. ''It was a very, very confusing moment. It left me with a desolate feeling.'' He paused. ''It was a good step in my education about the realities and politics of war.''
Southern Sudan's realities have forever involved outbreaks of warfare between its scores of ethnic groups, but in the '90s, the North was adding fuel to these enmities by backing southern militias. It was a tactic Khartoum had already employed, in a slightly different form, by arming Arab herders in areas bordering the South, herders at odds with southern tribes over scarce water and grazing land, and then watching as the Arabs terrorized southern settlements, forcing civilians to flee, to let crops go unplanted, to face starvation. The North employed a similar strategy in supplying weapons to outfits like Machar's and then to other southern splinter groups in the confidence that, though the factions billed themselves as freedom fighters, they would turn their firepower on each other. ''Mission accomplished, Khartoum,'' Prendergast said bitterly. And in the territory of the oil fields, the North fully co-opted southern commanders to clear the land of people, so that drilling could be done without resistance. In the second half of the decade, a Chinese-led consortium began partnering with Khartoum and started pumping most of what is now nearly 500,000 barrels of petroleum a day from Sudan's fields.
After the Bor massacre, the S.P.L.A. carried out revenge attacks on the Nuer. And Prendergast threw himself into recording, in Human Rights Watch publications, the horrors committed by all southern forces, as if he could reset the moral compass of the liberation movement by holding everyone accountable. For his efforts, Prendergast was arrested by the S.P.L.A. ''You have violated the laws of southern Sudan'' was the only explanation he remembers receiving. For three days, he was held in a metal shipping container -- retching violently from the foul water he was given -- before he was let go.
Many things have changed since Prendergast's stay in that shipping container. For one, Machar realigned himself with the S.P.L.A. nine years ago and is now slated to become the new country's vice president, a situation with which Prendergast has made his own private peace. We went to his Juba compound shortly after Prendergast met with Gatkuoth. Machar was hosting a bull sacrifice.
The killing was to sanctify the fact that another Nuer militia commander, Gabriel Tanginye, was joining the S.P.L.A. after years of fighting fellow southerners. When Gatkuoth told Prendergast in the restaurant about this development, Prendergast exclaimed, ''This is a friggin' success story!'' As Gatkuoth added that the South's incipient president, Salva Kiir, wooed Tanginye with a pledge of forgiveness and the offer of a major general's rank in the S.P.L.A. and that Kiir was in the process of making the same deal with a number of brutal factional leaders, Prendergast, thrilled by Kiir's embracing of old enemies, burst out, ''This is a moment!'' To me, he said that he worried about the South's ability to stitch itself into one country, yet his natural optimism seemed to overwhelm the concern that today's freshly made major generals will soon return to staking their divisive claims. Tanginye told us that the Nuer are the true southern liberationists. Kiir, in a separate meeting, said that the Nuer can't be trusted. But Prendergast's upbeat vision of the emerging southern nation couldn't be repressed. At times, it was almost as if all his years there hadn't completely dimmed the glow of naivety.
At the sacrifice, Machar wore brown wingtips and khakis and had a pen clipped to the pocket of his light blue shirt. Prendergast talked amiably, guardedly with him on a couch in a sparsely furnished living room, gathering information as always, taking in Machar's thoughts on last-minute negotiations with the North -- over borderlines, over oil revenue -- that could jeopardize the referendum. To converse this way with Machar was a compromise; the need to hold perpetrators accountable, the drive that impelled him after Bor, had calmed. ''I'm very relativist in my views,'' he explained to me. ''If these leaders, if these ethnic groups have decided to bury the hatchet, literally to bury the spear, bury the AK-47, I'll bury it.'' Peace, he said, must trump accountability.
After his talk with Machar, we went out into the courtyard. Soldiers chased a black-and-white bull, then roped each of its hooves and held it still. Wearing dark slacks and a tailored shirt with blue and black vertical stripes, Tanginye, the newly integrated commander, raised a wooden spear. He pierced the animal's side once with the spear's slender blade. The bull crumpled and lay dead on the mud, having absorbed, according to this Nuer ritual, a wealth of malign spirits -- forces that had long torn the South apart.
In the town of Bentiu, with the oil rigs pumping nearby on a vast, flat landscape of low trees and scarce huts, the area's governor spread a colonial-era map in front of Prendergast, showing him where the North-South border should be drawn, as if Prendergast, with his access to Obama, could make it so. Prendergast's connections to Washington power can be traced back to 1996, when he was invited to be on a panel at a Princeton University conference about U.S. policy in Somalia. At the conference, he seized the opportunity to catalog President Bill Clinton's failures not only in Somalia but also during the Rwandan genocide and in Sudan. Susan Rice, then the senior director for African affairs in Clinton's National Security Council and now the American ambassador to the United Nations, was the conference's keynote speaker. The two had a spirited conversation afterward, and Prendergast again imagined the possibility of working in government. Less than a year later, he was employed under Rice in Clinton's administration. Rice was passionate about peacemaking in Africa, and Clinton was, in Prendergast's telling, increasingly invested. The administration put its energy into resolving war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Yet Sudan, Prendergast said, never got the engagement it needed. The U.S. government sent nonoffensive military equipment, ranging from boots to transport helicopters, to neighboring countries intending to support opposition to Khartoum. But Prendergast said: ''It was way too little. It was a waste of damn energy.''
In 2003, Prendergast was back to his old existence, doing field research and analysis for the International Crisis Group, an NGO focused on international-conflict resolution. He met Angelina Jolie at a Congressional event where she spoke about her visit to a Congolese refugee camp in Tanzania. After suggesting that she could strengthen her impact by traveling to Congo itself, he took her there. When they returned from the conflict zone -- where he'd long tried to raise awareness -- her photographs of the trip were exhibited on the Web site of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. They received so much traffic that the site crashed. ''You can't get slapped in the face any harder than that,'' he said. ''If I had made that trip alone, maybe a few hundred people would have paid attention.''
It was a lesson fresh in his mind as Khartoum was reacting to a new separatist movement -- in the West, in Darfur. Much as it did in the South, the regime sent local Arab forces, some on camelback, to kill and rape civilians, to chase them from their homes and into deathly disease and malnutrition in order to leave the rebels with no base of support. Prendergast played a central role in drawing American eyes to Darfur's devastation through a campaign that enlisted Clooney along with fellow actors like Mia Farrow and Don Cheadle (with whom Prendergast has paired up to write two books, one of them a best seller, about responding to the world's atrocities). Save Darfur raised millions of dollars for advertising and grass-roots organizing; drew 70,000 people to a rally on the Washington Mall in 2006; and lent momentum toward this year's International Criminal Court indictment of Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, for the genocide of Darfurians.
By escorting Clooney to Juba and along the Nile this fall, Prendergast hoped to spread the star's light from Darfur to the South -- and to jolt Obama, who appeared, to Prendergast along with other activists, to be half-asleep when it came to what might be visited upon southerners and who has been accused of being less invested in Africa generally than he once promised. The Clooney tour typifies the approach of the nonprofit Prendergast co-founded in 2007, the Enough Project, with backing from a foundation started by Pam Omidyar, the wife of the creator of eBay. The project's rationale is that U.S. human rights and international-policy organizations take an elite tack on trying to influence American government involvement in the world's ignored places. The groups struggle for coverage by foreign correspondents and offer to testify in front of Congressional subcommittees. But the organizations usually fail to stir public opinion that could generate political will for their ideas. Enough's plan is to combine thorough field reporting with Web campaigns and celebrity glare. ''If you don't get people in Des Moines to write their congressman or senators,'' Prendergast said, ''you're not going to get anything done in godforsaken regions like eastern Congo and southern Sudan.''
Attracting attention is -- and isn't -- a new goal for Prendergast. He is, after all, a man who once modeled himself on Pistol Pete Maravich, and there are human rights advocates today who see his recent methods as more about self-display than substance. One afternoon in the Juba airport, I caught a glimpse of the pleasure Prendergast takes in the limelight when he crossed the waiting area to let a stranger know that the book she was reading, ''The Worst Date Ever'' -- a jokey nonfiction narrative about tracking down a handsome activist in Africa in the hope of romance -- is about him. Some critics raise other issues. Andrew Natsios, former special envoy to Sudan, worries about Prendergast's vision of American power. ''Prendergast and advocacy groups often grossly overestimate the ability of American diplomacy and power to direct the course of events in other countries,'' Natsios told me. ''And local groups engaged in civil war often believe the overestimates and think they'll be rescued by American influence -- and this can distort negotiations, sometimes disastrously.''
No one, though, seems to doubt Prendergast's success in implanting Sudan in the consciousness of Americans. Right after Prendergast and Clooney returned from the South, there they were on ''Today'' and ''Larry King Live,'' among other shows, speaking to millions of viewers about a place and people those viewers barely knew existed and about America's ability to protect them. They also sat at a small garden table on the Oval Office's stone patio with Obama.
Prendergast's aim was to intensify the president's attention on Sudan. Back in 2005, the North signed the current peace deal with the South, an accord that includes the upcoming referendum on independence, partly because President George W. Bush made it a priority. Impelled by Christian evangelicals, Bush dispatched Secretary of State Colin Powell to signal America's seriousness and help broker an agreement. And Khartoum signed, perhaps believing that this was a key step in getting free of U.S. sanctions dating to its harboring of bin Laden and maybe figuring, many Sudan analysts speculate, that it could find ways to postpone the referendum forever.
The Enough Project's effort to compel Obama included full-page ads over the summer in The New York Times. The ads featured Obama in profile and proclaimed: ''The lives of millions of Sudanese hang in the balance. The choice is clear -- and it's yours.'' The Enough Web site accused Obama of being ''AWOL'' on Sudan. Before their recent talk, Prendergast had spoken with Obama a number of times at various events going back to Obama's term in the Senate, and their most recent brief exchange had been cordial, Prendergast said, despite Enough's campaign. But, he added, ''I wouldn't be getting a 45-minute meeting with the president if it weren't for Clooney.''
In that meeting Prendergast reiterated, he told me, the main points he'd been making for months. He discussed with the president the need to let Khartoum know that America would not look away if the North undermined the South's vote and that the U.S. would reward Khartoum's compliance and punish any belligerence. And he wanted Obama to dispatch a major political or diplomatic figure to the pre-referendum negotiations so that both sides would recognize the strength of America's desire that war be left permanently in the past.
Within a month of the meeting, Obama added Senator John Kerry to what had previously been a low-profile diplomatic effort. The president sent Kerry with an offer to Khartoum: if the North doesn't obstruct the January vote, if the North respects the results and peacefully resolves issues like oil-revenue-sharing, Obama will remove Sudan from America's list of state sponsors of terrorism.
This would be a first step in the awarding of further benefits -- the lifting of sanctions; help with debt relief -- if Khartoum merits them in the future. Prendergast has spoken to administration officials about going as far as working toward a United Nations Security Council deferment of Bashir's indictment for genocide, though he stresses that this is not a current consideration. The mere possibility would outrage some in the human rights community, but again, he'd prefer peace to principles. ''I'm not a human rights purist,'' told me. ''Human rights and peace have to coexist.'' He also wants harsh consequences if Khartoum flouts the vote and stokes North-South war or fails to improve the bleak situation in Darfur. The potential reprisals he mentioned to me progress from aggressive asset seizure to supplying anti-aircraft artillery to the South so it can deter the North's bombing. Sending weaponry may seem like an extreme and unlikely option, but Prendergast said that if such artillery becomes necessary, he would work to mobilize support behind it. For the moment, he is reassured by Kerry's role as a sign that Obama has a major stake in Sudanese peace.
It is difficult to measure exactly Prendergast's importance in Obama's surge of public focus on Sudan. Two weeks before Prendergast and Clooney arrived at the White House, the president addressed a U.N. ministerial meeting to emphasize America's watch over North and South as the referendum nears, a speech that could be attributed in part to Enough's campaign or traced to Obama's long-stated commitment to Africa, a commitment that may be obscured by issues like the economy and Afghanistan but that is never unfelt. One way to understand Prendergast's influence, suggested Samantha Power, who is the National Security Council's senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights and who counts Prendergast among her close friends, is not to see Obama as lacking a sense of urgency on Sudan were it not for Prendergast's recent activism, but rather to view the president as long-engaged on Sudan partly because of the highly successful advocacy movement Prendergast helped to start several years ago around the crisis in Darfur. And now, she continued, on North-South peace, Prendergast is ''creating a political space; he's putting political wind in the sails of people who care about this issue: the president, Denis'' -- she nodded toward McDonough, the deputy national security adviser -- ''me. He's elevated Sudan to Himalayan proportions on the mattering map in Washington.'' While this may be an overstatement, Prendergast has surely helped to pull an expanse of scrub and swamp, and the people who live upon it, into American sightlines.

HEADLINE: Freelance Musicians Hear Mournful Coda As the Jobs Dry Up

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
IN New York's classical-music world most of the attention falls on the big boys: the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, the major international orchestras that pass through Carnegie Hall, the glamorous soloists who can earn tens of thousands of dollars an appearance.
But night after night highly trained players traipse from Washington Heights or the Upper West Side or northern New Jersey or Long Island to play church jobs and weddings, Lincoln Center and Broadway summer festivals and fill-in jobs at the Met and the Philharmonic. They occupy the ranks of a dozen freelance orchestras, put the music in Broadway musicals and provide soundtracks -- or at least they used to -- for Hollywood and Madison Avenue. They form the bedrock of musical life in a great cultural capital.
It was a good living. But the New York freelance musician -- a bright thread in the fabric of the city -- is dying out. In an age of sampling, digitization and outsourcing, New York's soundtrack and advertising-jingle recording industry has essentially collapsed. Broadway jobs are in decline. Dance companies rely increasingly on recorded music. And many freelance orchestras, among the last steady deals, are cutting back on their seasons, sometimes to nothingness. 
Contracts for most of the freelance orchestras expired in September, and the players face the likelihood of further cuts in pay, or at least a freeze. All these orchestras rely on donations and, to a small extent, government grants. The Great Recession has taken its toll, putting a number of them under severe financial pressure.
''This is first time that there are quite a few managements coming to us and saying, 'We just don't have money,' '' said Eugene Moye Jr., a veteran cellist who serves on the players committees in several orchestras. ''Our community is under a lot of pressure. Our jobs are melting away. We have a lot of people who are right on the edge.''
The Brooklyn Philharmonic, founded in 1954, has essentially stopped performing as an orchestra. The Long Island Philharmonic has only one concert scheduled this season -- a Broadway medley -- because of financial problems, although it is continuing its education programs. The Opera Orchestra of New York, which canceled its season last year, has come back with two concerts this year. The American Composers Orchestra is down to three concerts a year in the smaller Zankel Hall instead of five in Carnegie Hall's main auditorium less than a decade ago.
The Queens Symphony, which is supported mainly by the state and the city, has reduced its size to anywhere from 17 to 36 players from around 65, which means presenting smaller-scale programming. The Westchester Philharmonic, despite the star power of its music director, Itzhak Perlman, has $385,000 of debt and has had trouble paying its musicians. The American Symphony Orchestra has run $300,000 to $400,000 deficits a season for the last several years, with the gaps covered at the last minute by donors.
In the face of such problems the American Symphony is seeking a novel solution. It has proposed a contract that would provide a regular paycheck to its players in exchange for their commitment to play more concerts and the option to carry out nonperforming work, like teaching, coaching or benefit concerts.
''The freelance system as it now stands cannot support the musicians, especially with Broadway work drying up for them,'' said Lynne Meloccaro, the ensemble's executive director. Orchestra officials hope the arrangement will solidify the roster, improving quality and making the orchestra more attractive to donors.
''We want this to work,'' said Mr. Moye, the chairman of the players committee. But he added, ''We will not be made into a group of indentured servants.''
The freelance life has always been fraught with uncertainty. But many musicians say they relish the variety and spontaneity.
''I have always been so thrilled and grateful for the music I get to play,'' said Elizabeth Mann, a flutist who performs with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, two of the elite ensembles. ''The lack of stability is something you have to reckon with.''
Other freelance orchestras include the New York Pops, the Riverside Symphony, the Bronx Arts Ensemble and the Little Orchestra Society, along with the Mostly Mozart and American Ballet Theater orchestras. Some 520 musicians populate the rosters of freelance ensembles, said Jay Blumenthal, the official in charge of freelance contracts for Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. Mr. Blumenthal said the orchestra musicians generally earn $252 a performance, and $50 an hour for rehearsal.
Clay Ruede, 55, typified the freelance life that once was. Soon after he arrived in New York with his cello in 1977, music making filled his days and evenings. He crisscrossed the city for recording sessions, Broadway shows, substitute jobs at the Metropolitan Opera, gigs at the Mostly Mozart Festival and rehearsals with his Arden Trio.
He played his last Broadway show, ''The Color Purple,'' in February 2008. He hasn't recorded a movie soundtrack in eight years. With his income down from six figures to about $30,000 this year, Mr. Ruede (pronounced REE-dee) has sold his spare cello and bow, put a playlist from a gig with Bjork on eBay and plans to short-sell his house in Englewood, N.J., to make ends meet. It didn't help that a divorce from the Arden Trio's violinist led to the group's breakup.
''The last three years I've just been barely making it,'' he said. ''I've done stuff I haven't done since I was a teenager: playing weddings for cash, cocktail parties, things I never would have deigned to do. But you do what you have to.'' His next steady engagement is not until March.
Many musicians cite another sort of recession behind the dwindling opportunities: the Classical Music Recession. That is, the decreasing profile of the art form amid modern entertainment-saturated life. Benjamin Herman, 61, a veteran percussionist with vast experience as a freelancer, maintains that the P. D. Q. Bach concerts of the musical humorist Peter Schickele faded away not because the jokes weren't funny but because audiences didn't have enough musical knowledge to get them. While still getting by on occasional weeks of frenzy, Mr. Herman has long stretches of quiet.
In contrast he recalled a day 20 years ago, when he walked by the posters outside Carnegie Hall. ''I pointed to the wall and said, 'I'm doing the wall,' '' he recounted. ''Every placard that was up, I was involved in the ensemble.'' Now, he added, ''once in a while I'm lucky if I'm doing a placard.''
The numbers reflect his story. At the Broadway theaters the total minimum number of musicians -- decided by contract -- has dropped to 335 from 526 in the early 1990s, according to Local 802. (Theater closings contributed to the decline.) The increase in rock musicals has also cut into the traditional freelance market.
On the recording front many producers are taking their business to cheaper orchestras overseas or using digitized music, and major studios have closed their doors. Making $15,000 on a jingle was not unheard of 20 years ago.
Because of the changing conditions, musicians are clinging to the jobs that remain, making it tougher for younger musicians to break in. Meanwhile the pool only grows. New York's main conservatories -- the Juilliard School, the Manhattan School of Music and Mannes College the New School -- pump out more than 500 degree holders a year. And that is not to mention universities in the New York region and conservatories around the country that send their graduates to New York.
The climate has forced many to adapt.
A new breed of younger, social-media-savvy musicians is forming and running its own groups, often with innovative programming, concerts in unexpected places -- bars, art galleries and museums -- and minimal pay. The International Contemporary Ensemble and the Knights, a chamber orchestra, are two of the more established examples.
''You do it yourself,'' said Claire Chase, 32, a flutist who helped start and runs the International Contemporary Ensemble. ''You don't wait for people to discover you.''
History thus repeats itself. The new groups evoke the arrival in the 1970s of ensembles like St. Luke's and Orpheus, then adventuresome, now established names.
To make ends meet older freelancers are also trying to adapt. Dale Stuckenbruck, 57, of West Hempstead, N.Y., a violinist and freelance veteran who lacks enough union work to qualify for health insurance, has developed a specialty playing the musical saw and teaching music to youngsters, helping them make traditional Chinese violins and instruments out of vegetables. He has taken on more violin students and teaches at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University and the Waldorf School in Garden City, N.Y.
''The modern artist has to be much more diversified,'' he said. ''You cannot play just Wieniawski or Chopin.''
His enthusiasm for playing the violin, he added, has not waned. ''I do what I do 24 hours a day, and I love every second,'' he said. ''That's what an artist is. We love it so deeply. We go with what it is. It's not a job. It's our life.''

HEADLINE: Protecting Online Privacy

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission has come up with timely recommendations to protect privacy online.
For years, data trackers have collected information about people's activities as they surf the Web, packaging it into profiles to sell to advertisers. The practice itself is not what is at issue, but rather the way it is done. Many trackers don't disclose it. Others put complex, pro forma disclosures in obscure places on Web sites. Few consumers read them. Most don't understand how much information they are sharing about their online lives. 
Internet companies and advertisers insist that industry self-regulation is enough to protect consumers. But companies' many lapses -- one site that allowed parents to monitor their children online, for example, sold information about the kids' activities to marketers -- suggest it is time for regulators to set minimum standards that every company must follow.
The F.T.C. sets three recommendations to improve the protection of consumer privacy, starting with more transparency, including standard, simple and clear privacy disclosures to let people know who is doing what with the data about their online activities.
It recommends that companies include privacy protection in their operational goals. And most important, the F.T.C. insists that consumers be given a clear, simple option to opt out of online data tracking altogether -- along the lines of the do-not-call registry -- perhaps through a ''do not track'' button on Web browsers.
Advertisers argue that allowing surfers to opt out of tracking en masse would hobble the ad revenues that support most Web sites. This argument is overblown.
Giving Americans the choice to opt out of data tracking does not mean everybody will. Moreover, even if regulation limits advertisers' ability to precisely target their ads according to consumers' tastes, they will still need to advertise. They will just do it differently. Advertising spending in the United States amounted to 1.8 percent of G.D.P. last year. In 1990, before Yahoo even existed, it amounted to 2.2 percent of G.D.P. It has remained within that range over nearly two decades.
The F.T.C.'s report, which it calls preliminary, is only a first step toward better privacy protection. It is calling for public comment over the next two months, after which it will issue definitive recommendations. Yet while the commission has said it will police privacy abuses more aggressively, its proposal for a ''do not track'' button will probably require an act of Congress.
Fortunately, privacy protection has bipartisan support. So this is a great opportunity for Congress to prove that it can pass some meaningful legislation.

HEADLINE: Penn Station and Beyond

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While I enjoyed Tom Scocca and Choire Sicha's whimsical look at commuters' love-hate relationship with Penn Station (''Miracle on 33rd Street,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 23), I'd like to stress one point: It's true that the East Side Access project will bring Long Island Rail Road customers directly to Grand Central Terminal and the East Side's high-paying, high-skilled jobs, but we will not be moving any part of our operation from Penn Station. 
In fact, this project fundamentally changes the way we operate -- the equivalent of a ''moon shot'' for the railroad -- not by moving across town, but by expanding the service we provide to accommodate growth in the regional economy.
Providing direct Long Island Rail Road service to Grand Central is designed in part to ease overcrowded trains arriving at Penn Station without reducing service to the West Side of Manhattan. It will relieve pressure on Penn Station while allowing for future customer growth expected as a result of development plans for the 34th Street corridor, including the Hudson Yards project.
Because Penn Station will remain the heart of the Long Island Rail Road's operation for the 83 million customers we serve each year, all three railroads that share the station -- Amtrak, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit -- must pitch in to make it work better. With cooperation and capital dollars from each railroad, we can improve customer flow, retail and food opportunities, and use of space at each level of the station for all of our customers.

HEADLINE: Destination: LAPTOPISTAN

BYLINE: By DAVID SAX

 BODY:
JUST after 4 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon, as a dozen people clicked away on their laptops at the Atlas Cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, half of a tree broke off without warning less than a block away. It crashed into the middle of Havemeyer Street, crushing a parked car, setting off alarms and blocking the street. A deafening chorus of horns rose outside Atlas's window as traffic halted. An 18-wheeler executed a sketchy 10-point turn in the middle of a crowded intersection before a pair of fire trucks made their way through the traffic jam in a blaze of red. Chain saws roared, sawdust flew and the horns built to a peak. It was New York urban pandemonium at its finest. 
Inside the warm confines of Atlas, separated from the chaos by only a thin wall of glass, not a soul stirred. A quiet mention was made of the falling tree, a few heads rose for a second, and then, just as quickly, they ducked back down. They all returned to whatever was on the other side of their glowing, partly eaten apples. On a day when the cafe Internet connection had already been down for four hours, and the toilet had been blocked for even longer, I thought I had seen these worker bees pushed to their limit. But I had underestimated them. Nothing could stir these people. They were not in New York; they were citizens of Laptopistan.
I was an interloper among them, an anthropologist of sorts, sent to untangle their odd society, to understand their mores and unwritten rules. How did the natives interact? How did the government function? What was the economy like in this land of bottomless cups and table hoggers? And what, oh what, were they all writing?
I was, admittedly, a profoundly skeptical observer. Though I had been a freelance writer for the last eight years, I had always worked at home, clad in pajamas and brewing my own fuel rather than paying $3 for someone to make pretty designs in my caffeinated foam. Whenever my wife suggested that I get out of the house, maybe take my laptop to a cafe, I shot back: ''Real freelancers don't work in coffee shops. It's just unemployed hipsters and their unpublished novels, or screenplays, or Facebook stati.''
My disdain for the coffee shop writing scene only grew this June, when I met a friend at the Red Horse Cafe in Park Slope. I had previously been there only on weekends, when it was filled with couples sharing the Sunday paper and parents wiping brownie residue off their toddlers. That weekday afternoon it was a place transformed. Gone were the newspapers and the strollers. Laptops had colonized every flat surface. No one uttered a word; people just stared into screens, expressionless. It felt like that moment in a horror movie when the innocent couple stumbles into a house filled with hibernating zombies, and they listen, in terror, as the floorboard creaks.
My friend and I ordered our coffee, and began to discuss whatever it was we were there to discuss. Within seconds of opening my mouth, I felt a change in the room. Eyes rose from their screens and landed on us -- the zombies were awake, and they weren't happy. One of them passed our table on the way to the washroom and let loose what can only be described as a snicker. We downed our coffee and beat a quick retreat. ''To hell with those laptop-wielding fundamentalists,'' I said.
So what was I doing in Laptopistan? I moved from New York to Toronto in September, but had come back to the city for a week and was sleeping on a friend's couch. I needed a place to work. Someone suggested Atlas. I swallowed my skepticism and got my passport ready.
SET on the corner of Havemeyer and Grand Streets, and flooded with light from two walls of windows, Atlas Cafe, which opened in 2003, looks like a combination of worn trattoria and late 1990s Seattle coffeehouse. The name reflects its wall-sized map of the world (there are also a mobile of hanging globes, and flourishes of decor inspired by someone's travel to the Far East). The soundtrack is a mix of old country and folk (Dylan, Willy, Cohen and Cash), classical, bebop and French ballads.
A makeshift milk station sits in the center of the 750-square-foot room. To the left is a long bar of dark stained rustic wood, where people order food and drink (proper espressos for $1.50, excellent panini, salads and deadly little chocolate-filled Italian doughnuts, $3), as well as the windowless, orange washroom. There are three stools at the bar, and beside them a table of reclaimed timber pressed against a cozy window bench. According to two signs, this little corner, perhaps one-sixth of the cafe, is designated a laptop-free zone.
Everything beyond is Laptopistan: two rows of old church pews formed into an elongated L, each fronted by small wooden tables and chairs. Scattered along the pews are tattered blue tubular pillows, for lumbar support. Windows run along the walls, flooding the computer zone with natural light during the day, creating a fishbowl effect for those inside looking out, and for passers-by, who frequently stop and stare at the tableau.
Entering Laptopistan is a task in itself. The floor presents an obstacle course of power cables snaking their way around coffee cups, over chairs, and around table legs, eventually finding a home in one of two power strips that look as though they came from a Soviet coal refinery. Whenever a plug is inserted, the outlet sparks, and certain movements can cause all the plugs on a given strip to simultaneously eject.
A quick glance around shows I have brought my laptop, a month-old MacBook Pro, to its nesting ground. Diversity here means the odd white MacBook or old black PowerBook scattered amid the silver MacBook Pros. Throughout the week I will see only a handful of PCs, each looking sadly out of place, like they have arrived at a black-tie affair in a corduroy blazer.
I worked for a few hours, and quickly learned the principal laws of Laptopistan:
Silence Is Golden. There is no prohibition on talking, of course, but, as one Atlas regular of several years, Joelle Hann, explained, ''there's almost a code that people aren't going to talk loud.'' When people's phones ring, they run outside as fast as possible to take the call.
''If someone's on Skype or having a conversation, people make an effort to chill out their conversations with looks,'' said Ms. Hann, a yoga teacher and a freelance journalist and textbook editor. ''When they don't stop, you can feel the tension.'' Shushing conversations is equally verboten. ''No one wants to be the librarian,'' Ms. Hann added.
Respect Personal Space. While any open seat is technically available, it is forbidden to set up your computer on a table with a computer already on it; doubling up is allowed only when all tables are taken. At the same time, people bounce from table to table throughout the day, chasing the sun, the shade or their own feng shui.
Mind Your Neighborhood. When you get up to take a call, get coffee or use the washroom, you need only to look at a neighbor, make eye contact, look back at your computer and nod. The deal is sealed without a word: You watch my MacBook and I'll watch yours.
MOST Laptopistanis -- Laptopistanites? Laptopistanians? -- at Atlas are in their 20s, 30s or early 40s, split evenly between men and women. The dress is casual, with both sexes wearing T-shirts, sweaters and jeans, though a few women seem dressed for ''work'' with button-down blouses, blazers, even a dress or two. Most Laptopistanis work alone, though occasionally I spotted a group collaborating at a corner table. Socially, Laptopistan is a conservative society; outward displays of emotion are frowned upon. Most people hide behind their screens.
Aaron Tugendhaft is the exception. He appears at Atlas every morning for a few hours, tie askew, black coffee at his side, some heady-looking book in front of him. Mr. Tugendhaft, who is an adjunct professor of religion at New York University and the editor of a small custom press, is one of the only Atlas regulars I observed sans laptop.
''I've made friends with people because I'm the only guy without a computer,'' he told me, quietly, one morning. ''A book can be a conversation starter.''
Mr. Tugendhaft has been coming to Atlas nearly every day for three and a half years, but there are many Laptopistanis he has never spoken to. (''Some of them are in the room right now,'' he confided in a low voice, eyeing a woman in a jean jacket two tables over.) He has dated fellow Laptopistanis, but not anymore, preferring to keep romance out of the workplace. People tend to keep to themselves, he said, until something breaks the routine: an argument between lovers, news of a subway breakdown, or, most often, some sort of interaction around the power strips.
''Power is power,'' Mr. Tugendhaft said.
Mallory Roberts, a longhaired freelance astrophysicist, said that he had met two girlfriends (now exes), and his current roommate, via power-strip negotiations. ''Three months ago Courtney was looking for a plug and we got to talking,'' he said of the roommate, with whom he is now working on a documentary about a giant telescope in Puerto Rico. ''It turns out we went to the same university, and she needed a place to stay.
''There's a recognition here,'' he added, ''that people come to a cafe to not be alone.''
THE cost of living in Laptopistan, at least for my personal intake of tea, bagels, sandwiches and salad, averaged $12 a day. Other cafes popular with freelancers charge for wireless Internet access and even table time, but the owners of the Atlas, Enrico Lorenzetti and Luca Tesconi, refuse to. Observing the gross daily consumption in Laptopistan, where people seem to nurse a cup of coffee and a cookie for hours, I could not imagine how the two managed to stay in business. But they said the laptops were a stealth economic engine.
While the people behind the screens spent a paltry $6 to $10 per day, their true value is as a draw for more profitable takeout customers, Mr. Lorenzetti said. From the moment the door opens at 7 a.m. until it closes at 9 p.m., the place is buzzing, a productive society, visible from the street through wraparound windows. ''People come in to buy food and coffee to go, because they see a full crowd,'' he said. ''They think 'Hey, this place must be good if I can't even get a table.' ''
My long-held notion that Laptopistan's citizens were just sitting around e-mailing other writers in other cafes around the world dissipated as I got to know the MacBook Pro owners around me. Sure, there were aspiring screenwriters, novelists and people updating Twitter, but there was also Gauri Nanda, a product designer from Detroit who created Clocky, the alarm clock on wheels that's featured at the MoMA store and sold worldwide. There was Billy Schultz, a corporate human resources consultant crunching numbers for spreadsheets in PowerPoint and Excel (on a Lenovo PC, no less), and Meredith Sadin, working on her doctorate in American politics at Princeton.
Laptopistan's is an entrepreneurial economy, driven by solitary thinkers. Aszure Barton, a choreographer from Alberta, was working with colleagues to prepare for her contemporary dance show called BUSK, which will debut Dec. 17 at the Jerome Robbins Theater. Robert Olinger runs a biotech startup that is getting silkworms to make spider silk at commercial scale, designs online education programs for the New York City Department of Education, and directs theater projects with Russian artists. In just a few days I met architects and event planners, database designers, classical musicians, film editors and app developers, every facet of the creative economy working under one roof, not so much together as in tandem.
''Here, people have large ambitions,'' Mr. Olinger said. ''Some have resources, some don't. They don't have career plans mapped out, but they have a career in mind. They're not looking at a particular ladder to climb, they're looking at a mountain to conquer.''
WHEN that tree fell that Wednesday afternoon, I was one of the only people who walked over to check it out. I knew I was becoming one of them when a voice in my head said: ''O.K., time to get back to work.''
At home, the slightest change in light is enough of an excuse to get up, walk around, clip my nails or head into the kitchen. Though home offices seem like the perfect work environment, their unrestricted silence, uninterrupted solitude and creature comforts breed distraction. In Laptopistan, I focused with intense precision, sitting motionless for hours at a time. At home, when the Internet goes down, I feel professionally castrated, and usually retire to the sofa until the connection is restored. When the wireless network at Atlas seized up two afternoons in a row, I just switched to off-line tasks without breaking stride. No one else seemed fazed, either. If anything, the place got more crowded. Laptopistan provides structure, and freelancers, like children, secretly crave structure. You come to work, for two or four or eight hours, and you take comfort in the knowledge that everyone else is there to work as well. There's a silent social pressure to it all.
''It almost sounds sick,'' said Selena Ross, a fellow Canadian freelance journalist I sat next to one day, ''but the fact that people are watching me do my work helps me be what they expect me to be. It's like working exhibitionism.''
Back home in Toronto, with my ergonomically correct chair, spacious desk and dedicated Internet connection, I pulled up my notes from the journey to Laptopistan and tried to write. Within 10 minutes, I was lost in Facebook and watching old ''Soul Train'' clips on YouTube.
So I unplugged my laptop, traded my sweat pants for jeans and walked two blocks to the nearest coffee shop. There was some country music playing at a comfortable volume, and the familiar sight of cords along the floor. I took a seat between a guy working on an identical MacBook Pro and a woman drawing in a journal, and I worked like I was back in Atlas: productively, contentedly, fueled by a steady diet of Earl Grey tea, an economically acceptable quantity of cookies, and that social pressure I was craving.
After an hour or so, the guy next to me got up to go to the washroom, turned toward his laptop and looked at me.
With a nod, I completed the transaction. When he walked away, I smiled. It was not a big smile; most likely it was barely visible to anyone looking beyond my screen. Precisely the secret smile that citizens of Laptopistan allow themselves when no one's looking.
Correction: December 12, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about people who sit in cafes and use laptops misspelled the given name of a singer whose music is played in one cafe, the Atlas in Williamsburg. He is Willie Nelson, not Willy.

HEADLINE: When a Career Path Leads Abroad

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: thesearch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AT its best, an overseas job offers rich cultural experiences and professional advancement -- along with a whiff of glamour. But international work is not for everyone, and those considering it need to be realistic and strategic.
The idea of working abroad can be enticing -- perhaps conjuring images of sipping drinks at a charming Old World cafe. But ''the romance of an international assignment always exceeds the reality,'' said Mary B. Teagarden, professor of global strategy at the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Glendale, Ariz.
Choosing the wrong person for an overseas job is costly, for both companies and workers. ''The failure rate with international assignments is quite high,'' Professor Teagarden said -- people come home before their contracted time or they don't achieve their goals. Business is lost, and professional and personal relationships can be damaged, she said. 
That is why she and her colleagues at Thunderbird have identified a ''global mind-set'' -- attributes of a successful overseas employee. For one thing, people who thrive overseas are drawn to variety and novelty, she said. For example, ask someone what types of food or television programs they like, she said. If their answers cover a wide range, she said, these are likely to be better candidates for an international assignment.
They also show resiliency and are willing to take risks, she said. ''They may be a black sheep or the outlier at home,'' she said, and the international assignment fills a professional void in their lives.
In ''Get Ahead by Going Abroad,'' Stacie Nevadomski Berdan and C. Perry Yeatman identify five qualities that are crucial to overseas success: adaptability and flexibility; the ability to listen and communicate well; skill at building teams and relationships; patience and persistence; and curiosity and open-mindedness. The ''command and control'' personality -- a hallmark of American leadership -- does not tend to work well cross-culturally, Ms. Berdan said.
Her book focuses on women; she and Ms. Yeatman found that the women they surveyed who worked abroad (the typical assignment was three to five years) advanced professionally at a much faster pace than women who stayed in their home countries.
That is an incentive to pursue foreign work, not to mention that being overseas is ''a mind-bending cultural experience,'' Ms. Berdan said. But how to begin?
Many people think of American multinational companies when they seek a foreign job. But cast your net wider by looking at companies based overseas, especially those with headquarters in your designated foreign country, Ms. Berdan said. Find out about these companies through Web sites like simplyhired.com and goinglobal.com.
And don't forget about the State Department, nongovernmental organizations and nonprofit groups, if your interests and ideals tend that way.
For the unemployed who are not afraid to take a risk, Ms. Berdan says, it can be effective to move to the foreign city of your choice and look for a job when you get there. (This, of course, is much easier to do if you are single.)
Do your research, and consider countries that have high growth rates over all or in a particular industry, Ms. Berdan said. China, India and Brazil are on a growth surge, for example, and tourism is strong in countries like Costa Rica and Belize, she said.
If you are going to pick up and move without a job, have at least six months of savings and be aware of visa requirements and tax laws along with personal safety issues, she added.
Expatriates are usually a small and close-knit group, Ms. Berdan said. Network with them online before you move to start obtaining job leads; she says one good site for international networking is www.internations.org.
If you want to position yourself for a foreign assignment at your current company, raise your hand early and often, Ms. Berdan said -- volunteer to take that midnight call from a different time zone.
Of course, it also helps to know a foreign language or two, but don't let that stop you from pursuing an overseas dream. It isn't a deal-breaker at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. The company can put people through intensive language training both before and after arrival at the foreign country, said James H. Wall, global managing director of talent.
Deloitte's member firms have operations in over 150 countries, and demand is strong for overseas workers in big emerging markets like China, India and Brazil, he said, along with Middle Eastern countries like Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Deloitte's openings are in accounting and auditing; tax services; financial advising; and management consulting.
Like Ms. Berdan, Mr. Wall says overseas experience tends to help people's careers -- especially in the new, more global economy. ''We really encourage international exposure and experience,'' Mr. Wall said. ''It creates a more well-rounded professional.''

HEADLINE: MOUNTING DEBTS BY STATES STOKE FEARS OF CRISIS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The State of Illinois is still paying off billions in bills that it got from schools and social service providers last year. Arizona recently stopped paying for certain organ transplants for people in its Medicaid program. States are releasing prisoners early, more to cut expenses than to reward good behavior. And in Newark, the city laid off 13 percent of its police officers last week.
While next year could be even worse, there are bigger, longer-term risks, financial analysts say. Their fear is that even when the economy recovers, the shortfalls will not disappear, because many state and local governments have so much debt -- several trillion dollars' worth, with much of it off the books and largely hidden from view -- that it could overwhelm them in the next few years.
''It seems to me that crying wolf is probably a good thing to do at this point,'' said Felix Rohatyn, the financier who helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s. 
Some of the same people who warned of the looming subprime crisis two years ago are ringing alarm bells again. Their message: Not just small towns or dying Rust Belt cities, but also large states like Illinois and California are increasingly at risk.
Municipal bankruptcies or defaults have been extremely rare -- no state has defaulted since the Great Depression, and only a handful of cities have declared bankruptcy or are considering doing so.
But the finances of some state and local governments are so distressed that some analysts say they are reminded of the run-up to the subprime mortgage meltdown or of the debt crisis hitting nations in Europe.
Analysts fear that at some point -- no one knows when -- investors could balk at lending to the weakest states, setting off a crisis that could spread to the stronger ones, much as the turmoil in Europe has spread from country to country.
Mr. Rohatyn warned that while municipal bankruptcies were rare, they appeared increasingly possible. And the imbalances are so large in some places that the federal government will probably have to step in at some point, he said, even if that seems unlikely in the current political climate.
''I don't like to play the scared rabbit, but I just don't see where the end of this is,'' he added.
Resorting to Fiscal Tricks
As the downturn has ground on, some of the worst-hit cities and states have resorted to fiscal sleight of hand to stay afloat, helping them close yawning budget gaps each year, but often at great future cost.
Few workers with neglected 401(k) retirement accounts would risk taking out second mortgages to invest in stocks, gambling that the investment gains would be enough to build bigger nest eggs and repay the loans.
But that is just what Illinois, which has been failing to make the required annual payments to its pension funds for years, is doing. It borrowed $10 billion in 2003 and used the money to invest in its pension funds. The recession sent their investment returns below their target, but the state must repay the bonds, with interest. The solution? Illinois sold an additional $3.5 billion worth of pension bonds this year and is planning to borrow $3.7 billion more for its pension funds.
It is the long-term problems of a handful of states, including California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York, that financial analysts worry about most, fearing that their problems might precipitate a crisis that could hurt other states by driving up their borrowing costs.
But it is the short-term budget woes that nearly all states are facing that are preoccupying elected officials.
Illinois is not the only state behind on its bills. Many states, including New York, have delayed payments to vendors and local governments because they had too little cash on hand to make them. California paid vendors with i.o.u.'s last year. A handful of other states, worried about their cash flow, delayed paying tax refunds last spring.
Now, just as the downturn has driven up demand for state assistance, many states are cutting back.
The demand for food stamps has been rising significantly in Idaho, but tight budgets led the state to close nearly a third of the field offices of the state's Department of Health and Welfare, which take applications for them. As states have cut aid to cities, many have resorted to previously unthinkable cuts, laying off police officers and closing firehouses.
Those cuts in aid to cities and counties, which are expected to continue, are one reason some analysts say cities are at greater risk of bankruptcy or are being placed under outside oversight.
Next year is unlikely to bring better news. States and cities typically face their biggest deficits after recessions officially end, as rainy-day funds are depleted and easy measures are exhausted.
This time is expected to be no different. The federal stimulus money increased the federal share of state budgets to over a third last year, from just over a quarter in 2008, according to a report issued last week by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers. That money is set to run out next summer. Tax collections, meanwhile, are not expected to return to their pre-recession levels for another year or two, given that the housing market and broader economy remain weak and that unemployment remains high.
Scott D. Pattison, the budget association's director, said that for states, next year could be ''the worst year of this four- or five-year downturn period.''
And few expect the federal government to offer more direct aid to states, at least in the short term. Many members of the new Republican majority in the House campaigned against the stimulus, and Washington is debating the recommendations of a debt-reduction commission.
So some states are essentially borrowing to pay their operating costs, adding new debts that are not always clearly disclosed.
Arizona, hobbled by the bursting housing bubble, turned to a real estate deal for relief, essentially selling off several state buildings -- including the tower where the governor has her office -- for a $735 million upfront payment. But leasing back the buildings over the next 20 years will ultimately cost taxpayers an extra $400 million in interest.
Many governments are delaying payments to their pension funds, which will eventually need to be made, along with the high interest -- usually around 8 percent -- that the funds are expected to earn each year.
New York balanced its budget this year by shortchanging its pension fund. And in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie deferred paying the $3.1 billion that was due to the pension funds this year.
It is these growing hidden debts that make many analysts nervous. States and municipalities currently have around $2.8 trillion worth of outstanding bonds, but that number is dwarfed by the debts that many are carrying off their books.
State and local pensions -- another form of promised debt, guaranteed in some states by their constitutions -- face hidden shortfalls of as much as $3.5 trillion by some calculations. And the health benefits that state and large local governments have promised their retirees going forward could cost more than $530 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office.
''Most financial crises happen in unpredictable ways, and they hit you when you're not looking,'' said Jerome H. Powell, a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center who was an under secretary of the Treasury for finance during the bailout of the savings and loan industry in the early 1990s. ''This one isn't like that. You can see it coming. It would be sinful not to do something about this while there's a chance.''
So far, investors have bought states' bonds eagerly, on the widespread understanding that states and cities almost never default. But in recent weeks the demand has diminished sharply. Last month, mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds reported a big sell-off -- a bigger one-week sell-off, in fact, than they had when the financial markets melted down in 2008. And hedge funds are already seeking out ways to place bets against the debts of some states, with the help of their investment banks.
Of course, not all states are in as dire straits as Illinois or California. And the credit-rating agencies say that the risk of default is small. States and cities typically make a priority of repaying their bond holders, even before paying for essential services. Standard & Poor'sissued a report this month saying that the crises that states and municipalities were facing were ''more about tough decisions than potential defaults.''
Change in Ratings
The credit ratings of a number of local governments have improved this year, not because their finances have strengthened somewhat, but because the ratings agencies have changed the way they analyze governments.
The new higher ratings, which lower the cost of borrowing, emphasize the fact that municipal defaults have been much rarer than corporate defaults.
This October, Moody's issued a report explaining why it now rates all 50 states, even Illinois, as better credit risks than a vast majority of American non-financial companies.
One reason: the belief that the federal government is more likely to bail out a teetering state than a bankrupt company.
''The federal government has broadly channeled cash to all state governments during recent recessions and provided support to individual states following natural disasters,'' Moody's explained, adding that there was no way of being sure how Washington would respond to a bond default by a state, since it had not happened since the 1930s.
But some analysts fear the ratings are too sanguine, recalling that the ratings agencies also dismissed the possibility that a subprime crisis was brewing. While most agree that defaults are unlikely, they fear that as states struggle with their growing debts, investors could decide not to buy the debt of the weakest state or local governments.
That would force a crisis, since states cannot operate if they cannot borrow. Such a crisis could then spread to healthier states, making it more expensive for them to borrow, if Europe is an example.
Meredith Whitney, a bank analyst who was among the first to warn of the impact the subprime mortgage meltdown would have on banks, is warning that she sees similar problems with state and local government finances.
''The state situation reminded me so much of the banks, pre-crisis,'' she said this fall on CNBC.
There are eerie similarities between the subprime debt crisis and the looming municipal debt woes. Among them:
Just as housing was once considered a sure bet -- prices would never fall all across the country at the same time, conventional wisdom suggested -- municipal bonds have long been considered an investment safe enough for grandmothers, because states could always raise taxes to pay their bondholders. Now that proposition is being tested. Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, considered bankruptcy this year because it faced $68 million in debt payments related to a failed incinerator, which is more than the city's entire annual budget. But officials there have resisted raising taxes.
Much of the debt of states and cities is hidden, since it is off the books, just as the amount of mortgage-related debt turned out to be underestimated. States and municipalities often understate their pension liabilities, in part by using accounting methods that would not be allowed in the private sector. Joshua D. Rauh, an associate professor of finance at Northwestern University, and Robert Novy-Marx, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Rochester, calculated that the true unfunded liability for stateand local pension plans is roughly $3.5 trillion.
The states and many cities still carry good ratings, and those issuing warnings are dismissed as alarmists, reminding some analysts of the lead up to the subprime crisis.
Now states are bracing for more painful cuts, more layoffs, more tax increases, more battles with public employee unions, more requests to bail out cities. And in the long term, as cities and states try to keep up on their debts, the very nature of government could change as they have less money left over to pay for the services they have long provided.
Richard Ravitch, the lieutenant governor of New York, is among those warning that states are on an unsustainable path, and that their disclosures of pension and health care obligations are often misleading. And he worries how long it can last.
''They didn't do it with bad motives,'' he said. ''Ninety-five percent of them didn't understand what they were doing. They did it because it was easier than taxing people or cutting benefits. We're getting closer and closer to the point where we can't do that anymore. I don't know where that is, but I know we're close.''

HEADLINE: I've Seen The Future (In Haiti)

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
St.-MARC, Haiti
Cash is so 20th century.
I've been experimenting with a 21st-century alternative, using money on a cellphone account to buy goods in shops. It's a bit like using a credit card, but the system can also enable you to use your cellphone account to transfer money to individuals or companies domestically or internationally. And it's more secure because a thief would have to steal not only your phone but also your PIN to get access to your money.
What's really astonishing, though, is the site of my experimentation with ''mobile money.'' Not in the banking capitals of New York City or London, but in this remote Haitian town of St.-Marc. 
Mercy Corps, through a United States government-financed program, is providing food for people here in St.-Marc who have taken in earthquake survivors. The standard method would be to hand out bags of rice, or vouchers. Instead, Mercy Corps will be pushing a button once a month, and $40 will automatically go into each person's cellphone savings account -- redeemable at local merchants for rice, corn flour, beans or cooking oil.
I took one of these phones and walked into a humble little grocery shop with no electricity -- ''Rosie Boutique,'' named for the owner's little daughter -- and became the first person to make a cellphone purchase there. I typed the codes into my phone, and then both my phone and the store's phone received instantaneous text messages saying that the transfer was complete. The food was now mine.
''It doesn't get any cooler than this,'' said Kokoevi Sossouvi, the Mercy Corps program manager. She's right -- and the technology isn't just cool, but could be a breakthrough in chipping away at global poverty.
You see, the world's poor face a problem even bigger than being fleeced by bankers. It's being ignored by bankers.
Most poor people around the world don't have access to banks. In particular, one of the biggest challenges for the poor is how to save money. The poor often have money coming in just a few times a year -- after a harvest, or after a temporary job of picking coffee beans -- but each time they have no way to save it.
Banks typically won't accept tiny deposits. In West Africa, private money dealers accept deposits, but they charge 40 percent annual interest rates on them. So money is more likely to be kept under a mattress, and stolen or squandered.
The poor do establish their own savings accounts in the form of chickens, goats or jewelry that they can buy and later sell. ''But what if your goat gets sick and dies?'' notes Ms. Sossouvi.
That's why the most powerful idea in microfinance isn't microloans, but microsavings -- helping the poor safely store their money. And mobile phones offer a low-cost way to make microsavings feasible and extend financial services to the poor. About three-fourths of Haitians have access to a mobile phone, and similar numbers are found in many poor parts of the world.
Kenya has been a leader in mobile money, but many other developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas are now jumping on board as well. For the poor, mobile telephones could have as profound an impact on finance -- on banking the unbanked -- as they have on communications.
One terrific poverty-fighting organization in Haiti, Fonkoze, is also expanding into financial services through mobile phones. It is implementing a system whereby Haitians in America will be able to use cellphones to send unlimited remittances to the phones of relatives back in Haiti. On the Haitian side, the recipient of the money would be able to go into any Fonkoze branch and cash out -- or, better yet, use the remittance as the start of a savings account.
Nothing goes as planned in the developing world, and that's true of mobile banking. Many people in the program here in St.-Marc are illiterate and have trouble mastering the codes, and the first time I tried a transaction I lost a cell signal. Central banks and regulators are sometimes wary of telephone companies engaging in finance.
But Robin Padberg, the chief executive of the Voila cellphone company that Mercy Corps is working with, says that early in the new year the mobile money system will be expanded so that anyone will be able to make purchases, put money into a mobile phone account or take cash out. That'll be a milestone in the inclusion of the poor in the world of financial services.
And some day, I'm pretty sure, I'll engage in as sophisticated a financial transaction as Haitians -- say, walking into a deli and buying a pastrami on rye with my BlackBerry -- without even leaving Manhattan.

LENGTH: 608 words

HEADLINE: Straight Outta Wesleyan

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
Your indie-rap group, Das Racist, is known for songs that wittily riff on Taco Bell, Googleand the general limitations of American consumerism. Rap is a black art form that originated in the Bronx, so why, as two Wesleyan graduates who met in college, would you think you could rap? Himanshu Suri (top): Would you prefer your rappers to be uneducated? Victor Vazquez: And would we even be on the page of this publication if we had not gone to Wesleyan? 
You jokingly describe yourself as ''Puerto Rican cousins'' in a song title, when in fact you are neither Puerto Rican nor cousins. What are you actually? Suri: It's weird. I'm an Indian-American who is participating in a historically black art form, while acknowledging that the experience of South Asians in America has been a relatively easier one than that of black Americans. Vazquez: My dad is black and my mom is white, and I don't know if I am neither or both. And we don't have the time to get into the identity-politics discussion that this would lead to. Suri: Then what are we doing here? Vazquez: We're bigging up our brand so that we can make more money. Suri: To buy things. I want to start dressing more like a British colonialist in a red coat and maybe lighten my skin with that money.
Earlier this year, you released your first two albums, ''Shut Up, Dude'' and ''Sit Down, Man,'' both of them mixtapes available as free downloads. What is the difference between a mixtape and an album? Suri: It's a semantic thing. Mixtapes are free. Historically, mixtapes did not feature original productions, although with the rise of the Internet and the fall of the major labels, they have moved toward mostly original production, which makes the term obsolete.
If your albums are available free, how do you make money? Vazquez: Touring. Most people are making their money on touring, merchandise and licensing. I've been paying rent off the shows for a while now. My rent is $290, so it's not a big deal. It's five people in a four-bedroom in Bushwick. I keep my stuff at my parents' house. I like to go home, hug my parents, drink chai with my mom, watch Hindi movies and re-Indianize two days a week before I re-emerge into the filth that is progressive liberal white America in trendy Williamsburg.
Why do you speak of your friends in Brooklyn as filth? Suri: They know what they did.
You met at Wesleyan University, in 2003. Vazquez: I was his R.A. at a dorm for students of color.
What did you study? Suri: I was an economics major. From a cost-benefit perspective, college was a waste of time and money.
Do you see your work as a critique of white America? Suri: I think it is solely a critique of John Boehner. As our bandmate Ashok Kondabolu would say, John Boehner represents the utmost in white demonry.
This is precisely why I make a point of never asking rappers questions about politics. Suri: Deborah, chill. Vazquez: Fall back.
Why is your group called Das Racist? Suri: 'Das racist!'' is something we would yell at the television when something racially insensitive would pop up in an ad or on a TV show, which is basically a longer ad.
What are television shows ads for? Vazquez: Ads. Television shows are ads for ads.
Like most musicians, you dislike the process of categorizing your work. That said, how would you categorize your work? Suri: It's a realist painting of a collage. Vazquez: I would say we are proto-postworld pop.
Ha. Is that capitalized? Vazquez: It's all capitalized! Suri: All caps everything!
What separates you from other rappers? Vazquez: We're the best rappers. Suri: We are better at rapping than everyone else who raps.

He also headed its sister company Marathon Specialty Steels. The company's name changed to Thyssen Steel Corporation and subsequently to Thyssen Inc., and Mr. Drechsler served as President and Chief Executive Officer. He led Thyssen's growth in America from a steel importer and mill representative to an international trader in steel, coal and scrap, and a US based distributor of steel. Mr. Drechsler retired from Thyssen in 1993. During his tenure at Thyssen, Mr. Drechsler was Chairman of the German American Chamber of Commerce from 1974 to 1981, and a leading representative of German industry in the US for many years. He also served on the board of The AXA Group. Guenther was an avid horseback rider and a member of the Fairfield County Hunt Club in Fairfield, CT. He loved social interaction and took great pleasure in bringing people together. Guenther launched and nurtured the careers of many associates. He will be dearly missed. Guenther is survived by his children, Ana Katharina and Christian, Christian's wife Karen, and his grandson Jack Guenther all of New York, NY, his beloved wife Gloria Drechsler, and his stepson Rolf Weischman both of Berlin, Germany.

HEADLINE: Listen To McCain (Mrs.)

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
As the troops waited for President Obama to come into the hangar at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan, an Army band serenaded the crowd.
Not with Sousa or the theme from ''Patton.'' The band -- drawn from the 101st Airborne Division and called Nuts after General McAuliffe's rebuttal to a German surrender ultimatum -- jammed to a more resonant tune.
The young female soldier who is the lead singer belted out ''I Kissed A Girl'' -- Katy Perry's ode to Sapphic smooching. 
The lyrics about ''the taste of her cherry Chapstick'' and ''just human nature'' offered a cheeky counterpoint to the weighty debate going on half-a-world away as the Senate Armed Services Committee hashed over questions of human nature and sexual tension.
In two days of ''don't ask, don't tell'' hearings, senators discussed the knotty issue of whether gays and straights in the military could shower together without losing battles. Once again, the Democrats waited too long to close the deal, the president showed no leadership, and a campaign promise that was seen as a fait accompli now seems a casualty.
Even after a Pentagon report showing that most troops and their families think that allowing gays and lesbians to be themselves would not be a big deal, even after the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff urged the Senate to repeal the law that demands dishonesty, Democrats were still fending off a snarling John McCain and a few unreconstructed Southerners.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the committee, was eager to show that a gay soldier could be just as lethal as a straight one. He read a quote from the Pentagon report: ''As one Special Operations force warfighter told us, 'We have a gay guy [in the unit]. He's big, he's mean, and he kills lots of bad guys. No one cared that he was gay.' ''
Levin read the quote to Gen. James Amos, the commandant of the Marines, who are the most resistant to gays serving openly. ''I don't doubt,'' the general replied, ''that at any given base or combat outpost that we'll find men and women that are out there just exactly like that Special Operations soldier, Marine, sailor, whoever he was.''
Yet General Amos said that because of ''the very tough fight in Afghanistan, the almost singular focus of our combat forces as they train up and deploy into theater, the necessary tightly woven culture of those combat forces,'' he would recommend against the repeal right now.
McCain stressed that we should not make this sort of change while we're in a bad economy and two long-running wars. So gay Americans who risk their lives get endlessly oppressed because chest-beating straight guys in the Bush era continued deregulation and careened into endless combat missions -- and not even in the country hosting Osama bin Laden?
Some Republicans complained about what Senator Scott Brown called ''implementing social change in the middle of two battles.'' But those battles were designed to implement social change in Islamic countries on an epic scale.
In yet another ludicrous bit of goal-post shifting, McCain said it wasn't enough that the top two leaders of the military, and many of the troops, favored repeal. Now he wants to hold 13 hearings and solicit the views of senior enlisted personnel around the world, even though, as the Army chief, Gen. George Casey Jr., dryly informed the panel, the military is not a democracy. The five service chiefs agreed that, if asked, they could successfully carry out the changes.
It's unclear why McCain is being so stubborn and stalling, particularly when those closest to him -- his wife, his daughter and his cloakroom buddy Joe Lieberman -- have all boldly spoken out on behalf of gays in the military.
It seems a sore point at home: Meghan McCain said the topic would be off-limits at Thanksgiving. And Lieberman, following an indignant McCain on the panel Thursday, asserted, ''It's just wrong and un-American to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.''
Senator Brown, a lieutenant colonel and a J.A.G. lawyer in the Army National Guard, recalled a visit to Walter Reed, where he ''saw a soldier who lost both his legs, lost an arm and lost most of another arm, doing crunches, you know, to try to get his torso strengthened enough so he could still have a viable, you know, and fulfilling life.'' He said he did not care if that man, or the other heroes and fallen fighters, were gay or straight.
''I just wanted to know if they gave their limb or their life, you know, with pride and with honor for our country,'' he said. Later, he put out a statement saying he supports the repeal.
Tale of two Republicans: In his own fuzzy way, the Massachusetts newcomer was eloquent and inclusive. And in his own grumpy way, the Arizona old-timer was erratic and intolerant.
Gays aren't risking dying because they're dying to do makeovers and make-outs in the barracks. They're going to adapt and fit in. They're good at that because they've had to be.

HEADLINE: STATE'S SECRETS DAY 7; Vast Hacking by a China Fearful of the Web

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ and JOHN MARKOFF; James Glanz reported from New York, and John Markoff from San Francisco. Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
As China ratcheted up the pressure on Google to censor its Internet searches last year, the American Embassy sent a secret cable to Washington detailing one reason top Chinese leaders had become so obsessed with the Internet search company: they were Googling themselves.
The May 18, 2009, cable, titled ''Google China Paying Price for Resisting Censorship,'' quoted a well-placed source as saying that Li Changchun, a member of China's top ruling body, the Politburo Standing Committee, and the country's senior propaganda official, was taken aback to discover that he could conduct Chinese-language searches on Google's main international Web site. When Mr. Li typed his name into the search engine at google.com, he found ''results critical of him.''
That cable from American diplomats was one of many made public by WikiLeaks that portray China's leadership as nearly obsessed with the threat posed by the Internet to their grip on power -- and, the reverse, by the opportunities it offered them, through hacking, to obtain secrets stored in computers of its rivals, especially the United States. 
Extensive hacking operations suspected of originating in China, including one leveled at Google, are a central theme in the cables. The operations began earlier and were aimed at a wider array of American government and military data than generally known, including on the computers of United States diplomats involved in climate change talks with China.
One cable, dated early this year, quoted a Chinese person with family connections to the elite as saying that Mr. Li himself directed an attack on Google's servers in the United States, though that claim has been called into question. In an interview with The New York Times, the person cited in the cable said that Mr. Li personally oversaw a campaign against Google's operations in China but the person did not know who directed the hacking attack.
The cables catalog the heavy pressure that was placed on Google to comply with local censorship laws, as well as Google's willingness to comply -- up to a point. That coercion began building years before the company finally decided to pull its search engine out of China last spring in the wake of the successful hacking attack on its home servers, which yielded Chinese dissidents' e-mail accounts as well as Google's proprietary source code.
The demands on Google went well beyond removing material on subjects like the Dalai Lama or the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Chinese officials also put pressure on the United States government to censor the Google Earth satellite imaging service by lowering the resolution of images of Chinese government facilities, warning that Washington could be held responsible if terrorists used that information to attack government or military facilities, the cables show. An American diplomat replied that Google was a private company and that he would report the request to Washington but that he had no sense about how the government would act.
Yet despite the hints of paranoia that appear in some cables, there are also clear signs that Chinese leaders do not consider the Internet an unstoppable force for openness and democracy, as some Americans believe.
In fact, this spring, around the time of the Google pullout, China's State Council Information Office delivered a triumphant report to the leadership on its work to regulate traffic online, according to a crucial Chinese contact cited by the State Department in a cable in early 2010, when contacted directly by The Times.
The message delivered by the office, the person said, was that ''in the past, a lot of officials worried that the Web could not be controlled.''
''But through the Google incident and other increased controls and surveillance, like real-name registration, they reached a conclusion: the Web is fundamentally controllable,'' the person said.
That confidence may also reflect what the cables show are repeated and often successful hacking attacks from China on the United States government, private enterprises and Western allies that began by 2002, several years before such intrusions were widely reported in the United States.
At least one previously unreported attack in 2008, code-named Byzantine Candor by American investigators, yielded more than 50 megabytes of e-mails and a complete list of user names and passwords from an American government agency, a Nov. 3, 2008, cable revealed for the first time.
Precisely how these hacking attacks are coordinated is not clear. Many appear to rely on Chinese freelancers and an irregular army of ''patriotic hackers'' who operate with the support of civilian or military authorities, but not directly under their day-to-day control, the cables and interviews suggest.
But the cables also appear to contain some suppositions by Chinese and Americans passed along by diplomats. For example, the cable dated earlier this year referring to the hacking attack on Google said: ''A well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.''
The cable goes on to quote this person as saying that the hacking of Google ''had been coordinated out of the State Council Information Office with the oversight'' of Mr. Li and another Politburo member, Zhou Yongkang.'' Mr. Zhou is China's top security official.
But the person cited in the cable gave a divergent account. He detailed a campaign to press Google coordinated by the Propaganda Department's director, Liu Yunshan. Mr. Li and Mr. Zhou issued approvals in several instances, he said, but he had no direct knowledge linking them to the hacking attack aimed at securing commercial secrets or dissidents' e-mail accounts -- considered the purview of security officials.
Still, the cables provide a patchwork of detail about cyberattacks that American officials believe originated in China with either the assistance or knowledge of the Chinese military.
For example, in 2008 Chinese intruders based in Shanghai and linked to the People's Liberation Army used a computer document labeled ''salary increase -- survey and forecast'' as bait as part of the sophisticated intrusion scheme that yielded more than 50 megabytes of e-mails and a complete list of user names and passwords from a United States government agency that was not identified.
The cables indicate that the American government has been fighting a pitched battle with intruders who have been clearly identified as using Chinese-language keyboards and physically located in China. In most cases the intruders took great pains to conceal their identities, but occasionally they let their guard down. In one case described in the documents, investigators tracked one of the intruders who was surfing the Web in Taiwan ''for personal use.''
In June 2009 during climate change talks between the United States and China, the secretary of state's office sent a secret cable warning about e-mail ''spear phishing'' attacks directed at five State Department employees in the Division of Ocean Affairs of the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change.
The messages, which purport to come from a National Journal columnist, had the subject line ''China and Climate Change.'' The e-mail contained a PDF file that was intended to install a malicious software program known as Poison Ivy, which was meant to give an intruder complete control of the victim's computer. That attack failed.
The cables also reveal that a surveillance system dubbed Ghostnet that stole information from the computers used by the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and South Asian governments and was uncovered in 2009 was linked to a second broad series of break-ins into American government computers code-named Byzantine Hades. Government investigators were able to make a ''tenuous connection'' between those break-ins and the People's Liberation Army.
The documents also reveal that in 2008 German intelligence briefed American officials on similar attacks beginning in 2006 against the German government, including military, economic, science and technology, commercial, diplomatic, and research and development targets. The Germans described the attacks as preceding events like the German government's meetings with the Chinese government.
Even as such attacks were occurring, Google made a corporate decision in 2006, controversial even within the company, to establish a domestic Chinese version of its search engine, called google.cn. In doing so, it agreed to comply with China's censorship laws.
But despite that concession, Chinese officials were never comfortable with Google, the cables and interviews show.
The Chinese claimed that Google Earth, the company's satellite mapping software, offered detailed ''images of China's military, nuclear, space, energy and other sensitive government agency installations'' that would be an asset to terrorists. A cable sent on Nov. 7, 2006, reported that Liu Jieyi, an assistant minister of foreign affairs, warned the American Embassy in Beijing that there would be ''grave consequences'' if terrorists exploited the imagery.
A year later, another cable pointed out that Google searches for politically delicate terms would sometimes be automatically redirected to Baidu, the Chinese company that was Google's main competitor in China. Baidu is known for scrubbing its own search engine of results that might be unwelcome to government censors.
Google conducted numerous negotiations with officials in the State Council Information Office and other departments involved in censorship, propaganda and media licensing, the cables show. The May 18, 2009, cable that revealed pressure on the company by Mr. Li, the propaganda chief, said Google had taken some measures ''to try and placate the government.'' The cable also noted that Google had asked the American government to intervene with China on its behalf.
But Chinese officials became alarmed that Google still did less than its Chinese rivals to remove material Chinese officials considered offensive. Such material included information about Chinese dissidents and human rights issues, but also about central and provincial Chinese leaders and their children -- considered an especially taboo topic, interviews with people quoted in the cables reveal.
Mr. Li, after apparently searching for information online on himself and his children, was reported to have stepped up pressure on Google. He also took steps to punish Google commercially, according to the May 18 cable.
The propaganda chief ordered three big state-owned Chinese telecommunications companies to stop doing business with Google. Mr. Li also demanded that Google executives remove any link between its sanitized Chinese Web site and its main international one, which he deemed ''an illegal site,'' the cable said.
Google ultimately stopped complying with repeated censorship requests. It stopped offering a censored version of its search engine in China earlier this year, citing both the hacking attacks and its unwillingness to continue obeying censorship orders.

HEADLINE: All or Nothing = Nothing

BYLINE: By HENRY J. AARON. 
Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a co-author of ''Reforming Medicare'' and ''Can We Say No?: The Challenge of Rationing Health Care.''

 BODY:
Washington
TWO plans for reducing the federal deficit are now on the table. One of them, proposed by the chairmen of President Obama's debt-reduction commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, was endorsed on Friday by 11 of the 18 panel members. The other comes from the nonprofit Bipartisan Policy Center. The two plans differ in important ways, but both put everything on the table, including not only things like tax rates and defense spending but also Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
This approach is mistaken, and it's at the heart of why both plans are unlikely to succeed. Deficit reduction should stop debt from growing faster than gross domestic product -- and do so within the next decade. But closing the projected long-term gap between Social Security spending and revenues and materially slowing the growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending will take much longer. 
The Bipartisan Policy Center's proposal illustrates this temporal mismatch. It aims to prevent government debt -- now equal to roughly 60 percent of gross national product -- from growing faster than income does. After some additional increase during the current economic slowdown, this plan would return the ratio of debt to income to below 60 percent by 2020. To that end, it would lower government spending and raise taxes by $5 trillion over that period. Its menu is replete with controversial items -- including cuts in defense spending, a national value-added tax and myriad cuts in domestic spending.
The most highly charged suggestions, however, are its proposed changes in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The plan would convert Medicare into a voucher system under which the elderly and disabled would receive money to buy health insurance. The value of this voucher would increase more slowly than health care costs have grown for the past half century. The proposal would also raise by two- to five-fold the states' share of part of Medicaid costs.
The Bipartisan Policy Center's plan would also reduce the share of earnings that Social Security would replace for future retirees. This ''replacement rate'' is already set to decline under current law, but the plan would cut it further, by as much as 22.5 percent.
The proposed changes in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (whose acceptance by Congress is not assured, to say the least) account for only 5 percent of the deficit reduction that the overall plan would achieve by 2020. To be sure, they promise to do considerably more in later years. But they are largely extraneous to the immediate goal of deficit reduction and debt stabilization by 2020.
The president's debt-reduction commission advances even larger changes to Social Security -- cuts of up to 41.5 percent -- a longer list of near-term changes to Medicare and a blanket cap on the longer-term growth of overall health care spending. But its approach is similar to that of the Bipartisan Policy Center's in that it relies primarily on cuts in other government spending and on tax increases to reduce the deficit.
Stabilizing the debt must begin as soon as economic recovery is well established and must be accomplished over the next decade in order to prevent the ratio of debt to G.D.P. from becoming excessive. Timely deficit reduction is therefore urgent. Asking Congress simultaneously to reform three of the most important and complicated government programs only jeopardizes the solution of the more immediate problem.
The Social Security challenge plays out over the next quarter-century. Early legislation to close the gap between revenues and spending is desirable, because changes will be less onerous if they are phased in. If President Obama believes that a commission could help to restore balance in Social Security, he should appoint one now, but its work could not do much quickly to help reduce the deficit.
The fiscal challenge posed by Medicare and Medicaid is vastly larger and infinitely more difficult to meet than that posed by Social Security. Some modest savings in Medicare are manageable, along the lines suggested by both commissions, including increased premiums for upper-income beneficiaries and modest increases in Medicare deductibles.
As for Medicaid, its benefits are already stringently limited in some states. In others, payments to providers are so low that doctors shun the program and hospitals suffer losses. To reduce Medicaid benefits now, just as the Affordable Care Act will be adding roughly 16 million new beneficiaries, would risk chaos.
To slash Medicare and Medicaid spending before reforms to the health care system bear fruit would mean reneging on the nation's commitment to provide standard health care for the elderly, the disabled and the poor. The only realistic way to realize big savings in the two programs is to reform the entire health care payment and delivery system in a way that will slow the growth of all health spending. The Affordable Care Act is intended to initiate such systemic reforms. The best way to rein in growth of spending on Medicare and Medicaid is to put the provisions of that law into action, but this will take many years.
The job that should not be delayed, to stop excessive growth in the federal deficit, is challenging but doable: curb tax expenditures (including tax deductions, credits, exclusions and exemptions); end at least some of the tax cuts that were enacted under President George W. Bush; enact many of the cuts in defense spending advocated by both budget commissions; limit, but not eviscerate, other discretionary spending; and gradually increase Medicare premiums for upper-income beneficiaries.
Congress and President Obama should adopt a three-stage program: start deficit reduction as soon as recovery is securely under way, reform Social Security soon and resolutely carry out the Affordable Care Act so that the growth of Medicare and Medicaid can be slowed. Trying to do everything at once only makes it difficult to do anything at all.

HEADLINE: All the President's Captors

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THOSE desperate to decipher the baffling Obama presidency could do worse than consult an article titled ''Understanding Stockholm Syndrome'' in the online archive of The F.B.I. Law Enforcement Bulletin. It explains that hostage takers are most successful at winning a victim's loyalty if they temper their brutality with a bogus show of kindness. Soon enough, the hostage will start concentrating on his captors' ''good side'' and develop psychological characteristics to please them -- ''dependency; lack of initiative; and an inability to act, decide or think.''
This dynamic was acted out -- yet again -- in President Obama's latest and perhaps most humiliating attempt to placate his Republican captors in Washington. No sooner did he invite the G.O.P.'s Congressional leaders to a post-election White House summit meeting than they countered his hospitality with a slap -- postponing the date for two weeks because of ''scheduling conflicts.'' But they were kind enough to reschedule, and that was enough to get Obama to concentrate once more on his captors' ''good side.'' 
And so, as the big bipartisan event finally arrived last week, he handed them an unexpected gift, a freeze on federal salaries. Then he made a hostage video hailing the White House meeting as ''a sincere effort on the part of everybody involved to actually commit to work together.'' Hardly had this staged effusion of happy talk been disseminated than we learned of Mitch McConnell's letter vowing to hold not just the president but the entire government hostage by blocking all legislation until the Bush-era tax cuts were extended for the top 2 percent of American households.
The captors will win this battle, if they haven't already by the time you read this, because Obama has seemingly surrendered his once-considerable abilities to act, decide or think. That pay freeze made as little sense intellectually as it did politically. It will save the government a scant $5 billion over two years and will actually cost the recovery at least as much, since much of that $5 billion would have been spent on goods and services by federal workers with an average yearly income of $75,000. By contrast, the extension of the Bush tax cuts to the $250,000-plus income bracket will add $80 billion to the deficit in two years, much of which will just be banked by the wealthier beneficiaries.
Obama didn't even point out this discrepancy -- as he might have, had he chosen to make a stirring call for shared sacrifice rather than just hand the Republicans a fiscal olive branch that they could then use as a stick to beat him. He was too busy tending to his other announcement of the week: dispatching Timothy Geithner to lead ''negotiations'' with the Republicans on the tax cuts. This presidency has been one long blur of such ''negotiations'' -- starting with the not-on-C-Span horse-trading that allowed corporate players to blunt health care and financial regulatory reform. Next up is a ''negotiation'' with the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has spent well over $100 million trying to shoot down Obama's policies over the last two years. It's enough to arouse nostalgia for the ''beer summit'' with Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the Cambridge cop, which at least was transparent and did no damage to the public interest.
The cliche criticisms of Obama are (from the left) that he is a naive centrist, not the audacious liberal that Democrats thought they were getting, and (from the right) that he is a socialist out to impose government on every corner of American life. But the real problem is that he's so indistinct no one across the entire political spectrum knows who he is. A chief executive who repeatedly presents himself as a conciliator, forever searching for the ''good side'' of all adversaries and convening summits, in the end comes across as weightless, if not AWOL. A Rorschach test may make for a fine presidential candidate -- when everyone projects their hopes on the guy. But it doesn't work in the Oval Office: These days everyone is projecting their fears on Obama instead.
I don't agree with almost anything Chris Christie, the new Republican governor of New Jersey, has to say. But the popularity of his leadership right now is instructive. New Jersey has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992, with Obama carrying the state by a landslide margin of almost 15 percentage points. Yet Christie now has a higher approval number (51 percent) in the latest Quinnipiac state poll than either Obama or New Jersey's two senators, both Democrats.
Christie's popularity among national right-wing activists and bloggers has been stoked by a viral YouTube video where he dresses down a constituent in a manner that recalls Ralph Kramden sending Alice ''to the moon.'' But the core of Christie's appeal at home is that he explains passionately held views in concrete, plain-spoken detail. Voters know what he stands for and sometimes respect him for his forthrightness even when they reject the stands themselves. This extends to his signature issue -- his fiscal and rhetorical blows against public education. He's New Jersey's most popular statewide politician despite the fact that a 59 percent majority in the state thinks public schools deserve more taxpayer money, not less.
G.O.P. propagandists notwithstanding, Christie's appeal does not prove that New Jersey (and therefore the country) has ''turned to the right.'' It does prove that people want a leader with a strong voice, even if only to argue with it.
No one expects Obama to imitate Christie's in-your-face, bull-in-the-china-shop shtick. But they have waited in vain for him to stand firm on what matters to him and to the country rather than forever attempting to turn non-argumentative reasonableness into its own virtuous reward. It's clear now the shellacking was not the hoped-for wake-up call. For starters, Obama might have robustly challenged the election story line pushed by the G.O.P. both before and after Nov. 2 -- that deficit eradication and tax cuts for all are voters' No. 1 priority. Repeating it constantly -- as McConnell and John Boehner do, brilliantly -- does not make it true. But the myth becomes reality if there's no leader to trumpet the counternarrative.
In the summer before the election, the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll (of June 21) found that only 15 percent of respondents thought the deficit should be the government's top priority (behind jobs and economic growth, at 33 percent); the Washington Post/ABC News survey just a week before Election Day found that only 7 percent chose the deficit as the most important issue influencing their vote (again well behind the economy, at 37 percent). After constant G.O.P. fear-mongering about the budget -- some of it echoed, rather than countered, by Obama -- deficit reduction did jump to first place in Nov. 2 exit polls as voters' highest priority for the next Congress. The disciplined Republican message had turned the deficit into a catchall synonym for America's entire economic health. But at 40 percent, deficit reduction still was neck and neck with ''spending to create jobs'' (37 percent). Cutting taxes was chosen by only 18 percent.
We're now at the brink of a new economic disaster that will eventually yank a chicken out of every pot. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that the extended Bush-era tax cuts will contribute by far the largest share to the next decade's deficits -- ahead of the recession's drain on tax revenues, Iraq and Afghanistan war spending, TARP and Obama's stimulus. The new Congress's plan to block any governmental intervention on behalf of 15 million-plus jobless Americans guarantees that the unemployment rate, back up to 9.8 percent as of Friday, will remain intractable too.
Obama should have pounded home the case against profligate tax cuts for the wealthiest before the Democrats lost the Senate. Even now Warren Buffett -- not a socialist, by the way -- is making the case with a Christie-esque directness that usually eludes the president. ''The rich are always going to say that, you know, just give us more money and we'll all go out and spend more, and then it will trickle down to the rest of you,'' he told Christiane Amanpour on ''This Week'' last Sunday. ''But that has not worked the last 10 years, and I hope the American public is catching on.''
Everyone will have caught on by 2012, but that will be too late for many jobless Americans, let alone for Obama. As the economics commentator Jeff Madrick wrote in The Huffington Post, the unemployment rate has been above 7 percent only four times in a presidential election year since World War II -- and in three of the four the incumbent lost (Ford, Carter, the first Bush). Reagan did win in 1984 with an unemployment rate of 7.2 percent, but the rate was falling rapidly (from a high of 10.8 two years earlier), and Reagan was as clear-cut in his leadership as Christie (only nicer).
But as Madrick adds, there has never been a sitting president over that period who has had to run with an unemployment rate as high as 8 percent -- which is precisely where the Fed's most recent forecasts predict the rate could be mired when Obama faces the voters again in 2012. You'd think he'd be one Stockholm Syndrome victim with every incentive to break out.

 BODY:
Zoe Heller
Stones or Beatles? It is the most divisive question in pop culture, and the novelist Zoe Heller (''Notes on a Scandal'') knows where she stands, even after her interview with Mick Jagger (''Without Moss,'' Page 162). ''Beatles songs are what my family sang on road trips when I was growing up, so they have the superior nostalgic appeal.'' Heller's last novel, ''The Believers,'' evoked the spirit of Greenwich Village. Her idea of yuletide bliss is similarly transportative: ''A day or two of English countryside -- wood smoke, Wellington boots, crumpets. . . .''
Max Vadukul 
The first image the photographer Max Vadukul saw on television was Mick Jagger singing ''Jumpin' Jack Flash.'' ''It's strange how things in life seem connected,'' says Vadukul, who shot Jagger for the fourth time in ''Without Moss'' (Page 162). (Sir Mick actually took the picture of Vadukul at left.) A frequent New Yorker contributor, Vadukul is also responsible for the portrait of Julian Assange (Page 166). ''Julian's totally in another world,'' he says of the WikiLeaks founder and the swirl of intrigue around him. ''Somehow, he is quite sexy.''
David Vandewal
For ''Zing!'' (Page 154), the stylist David Vandewal raided the spring collections of New York-based designers like Thakoon and Alexander Wang, which he sums up this way: ''It's all about the simple day dress.'' Vandewal, who is of Flemish extraction, graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (Brussels, by contrast, is a bore: there's ''no culture'') and worked as a designer for Dries Van Noten, Karl Lagerfeld and Raf Simons. A frequent contributor to T, he splits his time beween New York, Paris and Antwerp.
Misha Glenny
The London-based writer Misha Glenny writes mostly about crime, estimating in his book ''McMafia'' that it accounts for 15 percent of the world's economic output. In the '90s, Glenny covered the Balkans, where he believes mafias, not overheated nationalism, caused the wars that tore apart Yugoslavia. For his next book, he's been staking out the Internet underworld. There resides the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange (''The Gift of Information,'' Page 166). ''He uses the same tools as cyber-criminals, but for very different purposes.''
Susan Winget
Trained as a ballet dancer, Susan Winget became obsessed with performance art in the 1990s and, as a reporter in Stamford, Conn., covered PepsiCo Summerfare, then an important cultural event that routinely lured theater and dance greats like Peter Sellars and Mark Morris. She began styling fashion stories -- like ''Moonstruck'' on Page 178 -- after assisting on an Italian Vogue shoot. ''Somebody asked me to iron clothes in Norway,'' she recalls. ''Sometimes it's hard to believe this is a real job.''
Emma Summerton
In ''Zing!'' (Page 154), the Australian-born photographer Emma Summerton offers up a color-saturated study in strut-your-stuff. ''I like girls that have an opinion,'' she says. ''It's one thing to look good, but if you don't have that other energy and spark, it can be . . . boring.'' A frequent contributor to I.D. and Italian Vogue, Summerton first turned heads with her six-year-long Polaroid self-portrait project, which began as a visual love letter to her photographer boyfriend.
Joan Juliet Buck
Years before she played Madame Brassart, the Cordon Bleu tyrant, in Nora Ephron's film ''Julie & Julia,'' Joan Juliet Buck (''Full House,'' Page 172) was the editor in chief of French Vogue. ''After I left, in 2001, I went as far from fashion as I could go, which was Santa Fe.'' There, the American-born Buck began to study with Ruth Zaporah, a dancer who founded the improvisational Action Theater. Now back in New York, Buck appears often in plays that ''you never heard of and wouldn't see.''
Jame Carroll
For ''The Gift of Reconciliation'' (Page 168), James Carroll got the back story on the imam at the center of the so-called ''Ground Zero mosque'' controversy. Carroll was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1969 but decamped with other Church progressives who felt betrayed by Vatican II. His weekly columns in The Boston Globe often delve into religion, and his next book, ''Jerusalem, Jerusalem: How the Ancient City Ignited the Modern World,'' is set in the Holy Land. ''An inch below the surface of American imagination,'' he says, ''is the City on the Hill.''

HEADLINE: The Stress-Testing of Jamie Dimon

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer and the author of ''The End of Wall Street.''

 BODY:
Back in 2004, way before the mortgage bust and before Americans thought of banks as four-letter words, Jamie Dimon took charge of JPMorgan Chase & Company. Known as a tough, hands-on manager, Dimon was supposed to avert the sort of foolish risks that tempted so many of his peers. And sure enough, he was different. Instead of reviewing brief summaries of the bank's operations, as his predecessor had, Dimon demanded to see the raw data -- hundreds of pages detailing J. P. Morgan's businesses every month. Instead of simply trusting his traders, Dimon put himself through a tutorial, so that he would understand the complex trades the bank was exposed to. And rather than run its mortgage machine at full throttle for as long as possible, Dimon reined in lending earlier than did others and warned his shareholders of looming trouble. 
Prudent as they were, his precautions were not enough. Over the last two years, JPMorgan Chase suffered an astonishing $51 billion in faulty mortgages, unpaid credit cards and other bad loans. And Dimon has landed dead center in the controversies that have caused many Americans to lose faith in banking. Chase issued too many faulty mortgages, it was embarrassed by high overdraft fees on debit cards and recently it has admitted to cutting corners in processing home foreclosures. Americans are angry at bankers for helping to bring the financial system to its knees; they are especially angry at those like Dimon whose banks accepted taxpayer investment.
The popular animus has come as a shock to Dimon. Recently, while entertaining a roomful of corporate clients over a tenderloin dinner, he felt the need to assert his and his industry's worthiness. ''I am not embarrassed to be a banker,'' he noted. ''I am not embarrassed to be in business.'' In truth, Dimon has plenty not to be embarrassed about. He fulfilled a banker's first obligation: he made sure his bank survived. This was thanks to his strategy of maintaining a healthy cushion of capital for a rainy day. When markets melted down and the economy plunged into recession, J. P. Morgan remained not only solvent but profitable every quarter. When other banks were refusing to lend, Dimon's continued to offer credit to customers ranging from homeowners to Pfizer to the State of California. And when the United States needed a strong institution to bail out a failing bank, it turned -- twice -- to JPMorgan Chase.
Dimon sees himself as a patriotic citizen who helped his country in a time of crisis. Now the most visible face of Wall Street, he thinks banks and bankers have a role not only in rebuilding the economy but in coming up with remedies for the financial system. Critics say that, as a part -- even a solvent part -- of a failed system, he should be grateful for the government's assistance rather than stridently critical, as he has been, of some of its reforms. Dimon, they note, took advantage of the crisis to acquire Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, and J. P. Morgan emerged from the crisis as a vastly larger institution. That is a cause for alarm to 33 U.S. senators, who voted this spring for an amendment that would have forced big banks to dismantle. The country is deeply divided over the proper role, and the size, of banks, and nothing epitomizes these tensions quite like the narrative of Jamie Dimon.
Over the past few months, Dimon allowed me into his inner sanctum, giving me an insider's view of how he thinks about banking and how he runs the bank. The executive I encountered was on a mission to reclaim a respected place for his industry, even as he admits that it committed serious mistakes. He was adamant that government officials -- he seemed to include President Obama -- have been unfairly tarring all bankers indiscriminately. ''It's harmful, it's unfair and it leads to bad policy,'' he told me again and again. It's a subject that makes him boil, because Dimon's career has been all about being discriminating -- about weighing this or that particular risk, sifting through the merits of this or that loan. Dimon has always been unusually blunt, and he told me that not only are big banks like J. P. Morgan (it has $2 trillion in assets) not too big, but that they should be allowed to grow bigger. This will come as an affront to critics in the Tea Party as well as in Cambridge lecture halls. America's five biggest banks, including Dimon's, now control 46 percent of all deposits, up from a mere 12 percent in the early '90s. Since the financial crisis, a sort of Jacksonian animosity toward big financial institutions has overtaken the public -- witness that, in the recent election, no fewer than 200 candidates spent money on ads attacking Wall Street. ''Big banks don't have a lot of friends right now,'' says Nancy Bush, an analyst with NAB Research. ''Europe loves its big banks. America hates them.''
JPMorgan Chase is a true colossus, the kind that progressives like Louis Brandeis inveighed against early in the previous century. It is America's biggest credit-card company, the third-ranking mortgage issuer and the biggest in auto loans. In investment banking, it is neck and neck with Goldman Sachs. But neither Goldman nor any other firm can match J. P. Morgan's breadth or overall strength.
Perhaps a simpler way to think of Dimon's bank is that it provides diverse forms of financing to people as well as to corporations and also manages their investments. In all, it moves more than a trillion dollars in cash and securities through the system every day. Simon Johnson, a liberal economist at M.I.T., who favors busting up the biggest banks, takes aim at Dimon for ''defiantly affirm[ing] that JPMorgan Chase should be allowed to grow bigger.'' Set aside, for the moment, fears about ''too big to fail'': Johnson writes that behemoths like J. P. Morgan offer no compensating benefits for the added risk of their size; indeed, he sees ''no evidence for economies of scale or scope -- or other social benefits.''
Dimon not only believes that view is ''completely wrong,'' but he is pursuing a strategy predicated on the benefits of synergies and economies of scale. ''Walk into a Chase branch and we can give you so much quicker, better and faster,'' Dimon says, referring to the bank's array of loans, credit cards and investment products. ''Like Wal-Mart. '' It is an intriguing comparison; this is how Dimon wants to be seen -- as a retailer with 5,200 branches nationwide whose products happen to be financial services. The reason that J. P. Morgan runs so many disparate businesses, he says, is that they aren't really disparate. Just as customers in Wal-Mart shop for groceries as well as televisions, people who want credit cards also need mortgages; small businesses that require commercial loans occasionally need an investment banker; and all of the above need a place to put their assets.
Few people think of banks this way, but as Dimon observed in a shareholder letter in 2005, ''Twenty years ago, who would have thought [Wal-Mart] would sell lettuce and tomatoes?'' As with lettuce, most of the products that banks offer are commodities. (No one cares where they get a loan, as long as it is cheaper.) Dimon sees the front of the store, which lends money, as linked to the back, which deals in securities. Glass-Steagall, the 1930s law that separated Wall Street from banking, forbade this approach, but it was repealed in the 1990s. Dimon's biggest quarrel with Dodd-Frank, the financial-reform legislation enacted over the summer, was that it erected new walls. Damon Silvers, policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said of J. P. Morgan's lobbying effort, ''They fought anything that appeared to resiloize the financial system, such as the Volcker rule,'' which will prevent banks from trading with their own capital, ''and other kinds of neo-Glass-Steagall things.'' Dimon vigorously supported enhanced mortgage regulation but not a separate consumer agency to administer it; he backed more controls on derivatives, but not the aspect of the law that requires banks to set up a new subsidiary for certain types of derivatives. (That and other derivatives reforms could clip $1 billion from J. P. Morgan's revenues a year.)
Dimon echoes the standard business sentiment that boundaries that create inefficiencies raise costs for the enterprise and, therefore, for customers. Perfectly unfettered, he thinks one bank could gain a 30 percent share of the market. Dimon doesn't defend monopoly, but he says Americans should view financial mergers as not any scarier than, say, combining Chevrolet and Buick and calling it General Motors. Of course, financial companies are different. G.M.'s assets won't disappear overnight; during a panic, a bank's just might, and that could destabilize the financial system. This is why banks are closely regulated. A lot of the focus on preventing panics has centered on the size of banks; Dimon argues that regulating capital levels is more effective. Requiring higher capital puts a brake on how much banks can lend, and therefore earn, but gives them an added cushion to withstand losses.
There are, believe it or not, reasons for wanting banks to be big, including safety. A large bank with many loans is less prone to failure than, say, a bank in Texas that lends to only oil drillers. For related reasons, as a bank gets bigger, its credit will generally be stronger, its borrowing costs lower. But as Dimon points out, banking also suffers from diseconomies of scale, like the lack of attention to detail and the ''hubris'' that can undermine a large organization. Such sins are precisely what crippled Citigroup and A.I.G. Nonetheless, Dimon insists that for a bank that gets it right, the positives of consolidation are overwhelming. Since J. P. Morgan's acquisition, in 2008, of Washington Mutual, each Chase branch spends $1 million less on overhead and technology than it did before. ''Economies of scale are a good thing,'' Dimon stresses, sounding like a buttoned-down version of Sam Walton. ''If we didn't have them, we'd still be living in tents and eating buffalo.''
DIMON GREW UP IN QUEENS, the grandson of a Greek immigrant who rose from bank clerk to stockbroker, a profession also taken up by Jamie's father. At home, Jamie absorbed a first-generation reverence for America and the stock-market wisdom of Benjamin Graham. (A disclosure: my mother is friendly with Dimon's parents.) Teddy, his twin, recalls a superconfident sibling who always wanted the ball when the game was on the line. His interest in business took off in college, in part thanks to his father's boss, Sanford I. Weill, already a legend for having built a brokerage empire. After Harvard Business School, in 1982, Dimon turned down an offer from Goldman Sachs and took the riskier route, going to work as Weill's assistant at American Express. In 1986, after leaving American Express, Weill gained control of the Commercial Credit Company, a sleepy finance firm catering to middle-class clients -- many of them the subprime borrowers of their day -- and started rebuilding his empire deal by deal. Under Weill's tutelage, Dimon was soon managing first one, then other financial operations -- Primerica, Smith Barney, Salomon Brothers. He has been running banks ever since.
Like the mechanic who grew up in a body shop, Dimon today is intimately familiar with the details of his trade. Jack Welch, the retired chief executive of General Electric, says that Dimon stands out from the many other chief executives of banks he worked with. ''Most banking executives get into a trading thing, and they don't know a lot about other aspects of the bank,'' Welch says. But Dimon does.
Ever since the late 1980s, Wall Street has been seized by repeated market meltdowns, often involving complex securities that have raised the broader question of whether America's financial industry is truly benefiting the public. Dimon has lived through every such crisis of the past decade -- from Russia's debt default in 1998 to the broad collapse in 2008. And while the leadership of Wall Street has lately resembled a revolving door, Dimon emerged with his reputation intact and even enhanced.
That he manages to be the exception to the rule is a credit to his radar for trouble. Judy, his wife, whom he met at Harvard, claims he has an instinct for danger. Jay Fishman, who worked with Dimon in the '90s (today he is chief executive of Travelers), says: ''Jamie has a healthy regard for the idea that we will go through crises and that we will be lousy at predicting them. The flip side is he will run his businesses more carefully.'' In the early '90s, when banks were racking up huge losses in commercial real estate, Dimon ordered Fishman to study what would happen to Primerica if Citibank should fail. It was the sort of far-fetched risk that no other banker would worry about. A few years later, Primerica acquired Travelers, which had been weakened by Hurricane Andrew. Dimon demanded to see the catastrophe risk in every region the firm covered. Dimon did not have day-to-day control over insurance, but he routinely trespassed over organizational charts. He told Fishman to limit his exposure so that even a once-in-a-century storm would not cost the company more than a single quarter's earnings. That was a highly unusual, and unusually conservative, approach.
THIS FALL, DIMON SPOKE at a conference sponsored by Barclays Capital: a thousand people crammed into the ballroom at a Manhattan Sheraton to hear him. The master of ceremonies began by noting that Dimon was also the lunchtime speaker at the conference in 2006, just before the mortgage bubble burst. It was interesting to recall, he said, who else spoke then: Kerry Killinger, the chief executive of Washington Mutual; Michael Perry, chairman of IndyMac; as well as executives from the subprime lender Countrywide Financial and Lehman Brothers. ''Jamie told us that day about subprime exposure -- his was the first major bank to talk about that,'' the master of ceremonies said. ''All of those other firms disappeared.''
Dimon, without so much as an introductory remark or joke, launched into a 45-minute fusillade on the ''massive issues,'' both regulatory and economic, facing J. P. Morgan. Dimon's staff had asked him to tone down his political jibes, but he couldn't resist showing a slide in which the new regulatory authorities created by Dodd-Frank appear as hopelessly tangled as strands in a bowl of spaghetti.
As the audience of investors was aware, Americans are in a downsizing mode; instead of taking out new loans, they are repaying debts incurred during the bubble. At J. P. Morgan and other banks, revenues have been steadily shrinking. Regulatory pressures are intensifying. Dimon, in other words, has reached the top at a moment when growth opportunities appear dimmer than they have in years.
One area Dimon is excited about is credit cards. J. P. Morgan is promoting a couple of Chase-branded cards, with the aim of cutting out partners like Starbucks. But Dimon laments that people -- he means the Congress -- don't really understand the credit-card business. Last year, Congress enacted a law that restricted pricing flexibility -- for instance, banks must give a 45-day notice before raising their rates, even when a borrower misses a payment. The legislation was meant to prevent sudden interest-rate increases that had caught cardholders unawares.
Dimon argues that all businesses charge for some things and not for others. For instance, restaurants give you the tablecloth and the silverware free and ''mark up'' the food. (Dimon loves to illustrate banking verities with examples from more familiar, and less threatening, industries.) Credit-card companies provide a service -- convenience -- ''free,'' but the business entails significant risks. In a typical month, Chase lends $140 billion to people, with no form of security. The bank earns interest on those loans, of course, but it has to pay expenses and eat the bills of cardholders who fail to pay them back. Before the bust, unpaid bills totaled roughly $6 billion; in 2009, when unemployment rose to double digits, credit-card losses soared to $18 billion, and the business plunged into the red. How to set rates that keep such a business both profitable and an attractive proposition for customers is what bankers do -- or at least, what they try to do.
To compensate for its inability to quickly raise rates, Chase has decided to lessen its exposure by no longer offering cards to a portion of its customers that it deems the riskiest. This isn't necessarily bad; if the mortgage mess taught us anything, it is that banks should exercise discipline. Dimon is also protecting his firm by raising fees in areas that the law doesn't reach. Free checking is on its way out. ''Because you can't charge for some things,'' Dimon rattled on at the Sheraton, ''you have to charge for others. When the government gets involved in pricing, I don't think it's the right way to look at a business.''
There is another way to see it: that absent government regulation, a contract between an individual borrower and a global bank is apt to be a lopsided affair, because of the parties' grossly unequal information. The imbroglio over debit-card fees is a case in point. Before Congress acted, banks were raking in overdraft fees. ''It got to be too much,'' Dimon acknowledged to me later. ''People have a $2 cup of coffee, and they got a $34 fee, three times a day.'' Banks now have to solicit permission from customers before letting them overdraw. Bank of America is not, as a rule, permitting debit-card customers to overdraw, in effect protecting customers from themselves. J. P. Morgan, taking a less paternalistic approach, is seeking its customers' permission. ''People should have a choice,'' Dimon says. The logic is, if you are waiting in line at Target to pay for a digital camera and are $20 short, you might want the ability to overdraw. From society's standpoint, there is a tension: at what point do we want banks to stop serving us drinks?
Chase pushed its patrons hard; its letter soliciting overdraft rights fairly screamed (in red ink), ''Your debit card may not work the same way anymore . . . unless we hear from you.'' The Consumers Union, based in Washington, objected to its alarmist tone. Dimon agreed that the letter was ''obnoxious.'' While still seeking overdraft permission, he pulled the letter. J. P. Morgan is showing some leniency with other fees; the bank is no longer zinging customers for overdrafts of less than $5. Dimon says these changes are good; it is doubtful they would have occurred had activists not raised a stink. This is also an argument for the financial-consumer agency that Dimon opposed.
DIMON'S LIFE IS WORK and family (he has three 20-something daughters). On weekends, he consumes a mountain of printed material; he arrives on Monday with a penned list of questions for subordinates (he carries the list in his breast pocket, crossing off items as he grabs people in the hallways). He regularly grills the executives in J. P. Morgan's six business units over every possible contingency; he personally monitors the bank's largest credit and trading exposures. Though Dimon seemingly meddles in every detail, he relies on his lieutenants and lets them push back. ''It's not a one-man band,'' says John Hogan, the head risk manager of the company's investment bank. ''It's a discussion. He listens; he probes.''
Hogan's comment notwithstanding, Dimon is a famously bad listener. He interrupts and finishes people's sentences. At a recent off-site meeting, he was so domineering that one of his partners complained, ''Jamie, you're not allowing any give and take.'' Dimon backed off. J. P. Morgan is far more of a team-run organization than his cult status might suggest, and it's not uncommon to see executives shouting around a table. On a recent Monday, Dimon convened the leaders of Chase's retail bank -- the one that is stuffed with nonperforming mortgages. The corporate headquarters, a skyscraper rising from Park Avenue, was suffused in a misty gloom. The executives discussed one positive sign -- an apparent tapering off of new delinquencies. For Chase as for other banks, however, mortgage problems will not go away. Dimon got an update on efforts by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to force the banks to buy back billions in faulty mortgages; the two agencies, which buy the bulk of mortgages in this country, say the banks offloaded loans that were not up to the agencies' standards. It's a serious concern, and Chase, which is contesting some of their claims, has set aside $3 billion (equal to 3 percent of its revenue) to cover possible losses.
Nationwide, more than four million mortgages are seriously delinquent -- a staggering number. In their eagerness to unload such loans, banks have rushed to foreclose, submitting many thousands of improper affidavits. Plaintiffs' lawyers have called for a halt to the process, and Chase has suspended 115,000 foreclosures. Dimon acknowledged to me that in Chase affidavits, individuals incorrectly said they had reviewed loan files when in fact they relied on the work of others. So far, he says, Chase has not found cases of homes foreclosed on in error; payments on its suspended foreclosures are, on average, 15 months overdue.
The states are investigating. Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general, who is leading a 50-state inquiry, says banks should follow the letter of the law; the point of requiring proper affidavits, he notes, is to ensure that banks bent on foreclosing submit reliable evidence to the courts. He also has a broader purpose. ''What we do feel,'' Miller says, ''is that the mortgage-servicing companies should do a better job on reaching modifications. When a homeowner can make a payment, everybody wins.''
Like Miller, many people wonder why banks don't simply renegotiate the terms. Chase and other banks have been sued for not modifying loans quickly enough under a government program intended to ease the crisis. People at Chase say they are working full speed, but the program is nightmarishly complex. Since the start of 2009, Chase has agreed to modify 272,000 mortgages, about half of which are processed through government programs. Over the same span, Chase has foreclosed on 224,000 homes. Foreclosure is not an optimal outcome for lenders, but nor is it in their interest to grant universal forgiveness. Chase, for instance, does not want to modify loans of borrowers who are hopelessly behind and would most likely default even with a modification.
One area where it sees an opportunity is among homeowners who are current on payments, but might be tempted to walk because their mortgage debt is significantly higher than their property is worth. At the Monday meeting I attended, Ravi Shankar, a senior executive in Chase's mortgage business, described a new program to modify a batch of particularly bad loans that Chase inherited from Washington Mutual. The WaMu loans were due to ''reset'' to roughly twice their current interest rate, at which point many of the borrowers would probably default.
Shankar's unit had reduced the principal on billions of dollars of these mortgages by about a sixth, bringing them in line with market value. Dimon snapped, ''I wouldn't do modifications on investment properties.'' People who bought real estate as a speculation are a sore spot with Dimon. They have defaulted at epidemic rates -- many after fraudulently claiming to be purchasing a primary residence. (One asked Chase for modifications on nine different loans.) Shankar responded that the program has been offering modifications to investors. ''Well I hope you chose the right people, Shankar'' -- Dimon's tone was jocular but edgy. Armed with statistics, Shankar reported that, so far, the program was succeeding in reducing foreclosures. The numbers seemed to bring Dimon on board, and he exclaimed, ''We should try aggressively to do as much as we can for these folks.''
Later, we went to Dimon's office to talk. He sat in an armchair next to a freestanding globe, with a view looking northeast over the Manhattan skyline. Dimon ruefully observed that the optimal way to deal with delinquent loans would be to evaluate customers one at a time -- the way the bygone corner banker did when a borrower got sick or lost his job. Of course, corner banks disappeared when conglomerateurs like Dimon acquired them. But it's important to remember that the mass production of mortgages was welcomed early in the decade, because it allowed more people to get credit. Society wants banks to make loans, only not with such improvidence that large numbers of borrowers end up defaulting. There is, again, a tension between these goals; and when mortgage shops were converted to factories, banks lost sight of how to manage it. ''This is way beyond the capacity of the machine,'' Dimon admitted.
AT 54, DIMON REMAINS TRIM, and though his hair is salt and peppery, there is something boyish -- a puckish, faintly suppressed grin -- in his manner. He speaks hurriedly, almost garbling the words, clutching a coffee cup while jabbing the air with his free hand. Colleagues marvel at his accessibility and his seemingly perfect recall. ''You go in his office, there is almost nothing on his desk,'' says Steve Black, a longtime colleague. ''He reads it and remembers.''
I first met Dimon 12 years ago, after Sanford Weill merged his growing financial empire into Citigroup. Dimon was the heir apparent, and to the outside world, the two had a perfect partnership. Weill masterminded the deals, and Dimon performed the intensive labor of managing people and evaluating risks. But under the surface, their relationship was strained. Weill was insecure about Dimon's growing assertiveness; Dimon was a restless No. 2. Once, when Dimon was in high school, his twin recalled, a math teacher chewed out the class, wrapping up his tirade with a rhetorical, ''Does anyone have a problem with that?'' Jamie raised his hand and said, ''I do'' and was promptly booted out. Chafing under Weill's ego, he acted out again. Late in 1998, Weill fired him.
Dimon handled his dismissal without noticeable bitterness. He spent more time with his family, read more books (he tends toward biographies of statesmen) and took boxing lessons. He also experienced an epiphany. On the day he was fired, leaving the building for the last time, he ran into Guy Moszkowski, a securities analyst, in the lobby.
Moszkowski asked what Dimon, then 42, would do next. ''I don't know,'' Dimon replied. ''I'm going to take my time. But I'm never going to work for anyone else again.''
Sixteen months later, in the spring of 2000, Dimon took the top job at Bank One, a troubled Chicago bank that was operating in the red. It also had a cultural problem; following a merger of two rival organizations, it had never melded into a cohesive entity. This was symbolized by its unwieldy, 22-person board. Dimon trimmed the board to 14 members. Then he asked the board to cut the dividend, further challenging the directors, whose constituents (shareholders) wanted the income. Dimon said strengthening the bank's capital came first. Next he fired hundreds of consultants. Then he gathered the senior managers and told them nobody (himself included) was getting a bonus.
By 2003, he had turned the bank around. The following spring, he merged Bank One with JPMorgan Chase, a storied bank that had been hurt by Enron and other fiascoes. It was also troubled by the poor cohesion of various mergers. The simmering rivalries between their former staffs were so intense that traders were known to sabotage one another by withholding data. Dimon, who was president of the combined bank and became chief executive after 18 months, went around telling people they were overpaid. Once again he slashed bonuses. His style was harsh but effective. One manager described him as ''shockingly direct.'' Lieutenants told me that he made decisions on the merits and was committed to the success of the whole bank, rather than to one faction or another. For a company torn by politics, it was refreshing.
When Dimon arrived at J. P. Morgan, Bill Winters, the co-head of the investment bank, had heard that Dimon viewed derivatives trading as excessively risky. Winters confronted him, and Dimon responded that he didn't understand derivatives well enough to have an opinion. Winters took him to school. ''It got quite detailed -- long-dated currency options and so on,'' Winters recalled. ''He was the only C.E.O. I ever worked for who did that.''
Dimon inculcated a culture of risk-control by preaching accountability. His point in firing consultants was that employees, not outsiders, should be responsible for the bank.
Dimon has a reputation as a cost cutter; it's a term he hates and one that obscures his protective feeling toward the organization. Linda Bammann, who served a stint as deputy chief risk officer, recalls that when he hired her, he took her to dinner and said: ''Every single person in this firm is our responsibility. If we ever have to lay people off, it's because we haven't done a good job.'' No one would call Dimon cuddly: he is profane, snappish and sparing with praise. What comes through, according to a large sampling of colleagues, is his passion for the organization. His wife's word for him is ''maternal.''
Dimon's mantra is ''Do the right thing.'' That might sound like a corporate bromide, but it informs his view of how to run the company, from dealing with problems directly to trying to make gay employees at his firm feel comfortable. Dimon seems incapable of stifling unpleasant news; this translates, at a corporate level, to a rare emphasis on transparency. In a company aiming for interbusiness synergies, openness has strategic value. Unlike in the pre-Dimon days, heads of the various units share their numbers. Openness also works as a sort of spiritual glue. Mike Cavanagh, who worked for Dimon in the early '90s, jumped ship from Citigroup to join him at Bank One and today runs a J. P. Morgan business that caters to institutional clients, says Dimon ''can't help but tell the truth.'' Though executives would like to see Dimon develop a little humility, colleagues speak of him with uncommon loyalty.
DURING THE MORTGAGE DEBACLE, Dimon's reputation for averting risk suffered a hit. Oddly, the executive who worried about 100-year storms failed to challenge the industry models on home defaults. Many banks, including Chase, issued ''stated-income loans'' on which applicants were not required to document their income. Some mortgage brokers clearly encouraged borrowers to lie. Dimon says he thought Chase had enough information, electronically, to police such loans. ''We didn't anticipate the lying,'' Dimon says, harping on a familiar theme -- that bankers were not the only ones at fault. The blame for lying may have been his customers', but the responsibility is Dimon's. As Warren Buffett once observed: every bank is offered bad loans; it is the banker's job to reject them. At Bank One, Dimon had ceased buying mortgages from outside brokers because their performance was poor. At Chase, he bought them. When I asked why, Dimon said underlings convinced him they were exercising proper caution, adding, ''It was a huge business, packaging and selling [the loans] to Fannie Mae.'' Turning silent, Dimon rotated his palms face up -- as if nothing could excuse his error. ''I bought that crap,'' he concluded.
J. P. Morgan was also too blase in extending credit to private-equity buyers. Dimon got several things right, however. He nixed the most aggressive type of mortgages, known as option ARMs, on which borrowers were hooked on an initial low teaser rate. He kept the bank's capital position strong. He did not go overboard on short-term debt (a cheap source of financing, but one that can render a bank vulnerable in a panic). And he was wary of the now-infamous packages of mortgage securities known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. Winters and Steve Black, who jointly ran the investment bank, didn't think the risks of C.D.O.'s were worth it, and kept the portfolio small. This meant forgoing big profits, and Dimon invited Winters and Black to a dinner of the board to explain in detail JPMorgan Chase's reluctance to follow its peers -- a typically Dimon bit of leveling with his board. Executives say the collaboration between Chase (which issued mortgages) and J. P. Morgan (which traded them) prompted the company to reduce its risk faster than others.
In August 2006, Dimon learned that default rates on brokered mortgages were worrisomely rising. He ordered a study of the bank's exposure and tightened its loan criteria. At the time, the subprime craze was going full blast. In his annual letter to shareholders, published early in 2007, Dimon warned that the favorable credit environment was coming to an end and investors should brace for a downturn. Annual letters are generally exercises in spin control written by staff members; Dimon writes his own. Not satisfied with a generalized warning, he specified how much JPMorgan Chase could lose if the boom times ended. By contrast, Citigroup's chief executive, Charles Prince, devoted all of three sentences to the credit outlook in his annual letter, in which he forecast ''moderate deterioration.''
The next year, in a strikingly self-critical missive, Dimon admitted he had underestimated the severity of the crisis. ''We still found ourselves having to tighten our underwriting of subprime mortgage loans six times through the end of 2007,'' he wrote. ''Yes, this means our standards were not tough enough the first five times.'' Prophetically, he warned of a ''panic'' if mortgage investors should sell in unison.
Shortly after he wrote those words, the government implored him to rescue Bear Stearns, which was experiencing just such a panic. Dimon concluded that the risks were too great and turned the government down. When Timothy Geithner, then head of the New York Fed, persisted, Dimon asked for a federal backstop, and the deal went ahead with government assistance.
Bear Stearns modestly added to J. P. Morgan's franchise (Dimon says he was largely motivated by a desire to ease the crisis). More significant was the purchase of Washington Mutual, the country's biggest savings and loan, which Dimon picked up at a fire-sale price after the government seized it in September 2008.
He also prepared for the worst. Around the time Lehman failed, Dimon began holding three daily risk meetings to monitor J. P. Morgan's exposure. Meanwhile, he mapped out a plan to withstand a surge in unemployment. ''We could have handled 15 percent,'' he told me. If total disaster struck, he figured he could lay off 45,000 of his 233,000 employees, cease all marketing and slash pay. ''We would have survived,'' he insists. The market ratified that verdict: as depositors fled from weaker banks, J. P. Morgan took in an additional $180 billion.
A turning point in Dimon's collaboration with the federal government arrived in October, when Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, summoned nine chief executives and told them that the Troubled Asset Relief Program would be used to invest directly in their banks. Dimon told his board that J. P. Morgan did not need the capital and didn't see any benefit in taking it. (It did benefit from another government program, which guaranteed banks' debt issues, and thus secured them a lower interest rate.) Under pressure from Paulson, Dimon reluctantly accepted the TARP. Again, he says he believed he was acting for the country's good.
TARP became a symbol of bailout policy gone awry. Actually, the program has succeeded for banks and, thus far, for the government. Taxpayers earned $795 million on the J. P. Morgan stake. Dimon is upset that people think he was bailed out. But there is at least some truth to the view of Christina Romer, a former economist for President Obama, who notes that Dimon ''was part of the system that gave rise to the crisis. He certainly benefited. If the system went south, he'd have gone south with everybody else.''
A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT, Dimon supported Obama in 2008. After the election, he wrote thoughtfully on financial reform. His suggestions were not the stuff of a banking apologist; arguing that the system of bundling mortgages into securities had to be revamped, he wrote to shareholders, ''We cannot rely on market discipline alone to fix this problem.'' He expounded on the need for ''health care coverage for all,'' infrastructure spending and energy innovation -- with a few tweaks, it could have been an Obama stump speech. Presumably, Dimon figured Washington would at least listen. But as public ire against bankers mounted, word came back that the White House wasn't interested in Dimon's ideas: bankers were part of the problem, not the fix.
Late last year, he was due to visit the White House with a group of chief executives. The day before, ''60 Minutes'' broadcast an interview with Obama in which he referred derisively to ''fat cat'' bankers. To Dimon, who earned $16 million for 2009 -- all but $1 million of it in long-term stock incentives -- the slap was the sort of broad-brush slur he was hearing too much of on all sides. He reminded the president: ''President Lincoln could have denigrated all Southerners. He didn't.''
Judy Dimon says the crisis took a toll on him. He used to stand up to bullies who threatened his smaller twin; now he felt as if he, and bankers in general, were being bullied. There is a picture in the Dimons' Park Avenue home of James Dean in a sidelong pose and a leather jacket; it reminds Judy Dimon of the contrarian business-school student who also wore black leather and seemed, even as he raced up the corporate ladder, not quite establishment. Jamie Dimon, of course, is a rebel with a very pinstriped cause. I saw him entertaining corporate clients over dinner, rousing his guests to ''fight for what you believe in'' in Washington, meaning turning back the tide of what he regards as ill-considered regulation. During the Dodd-Frank debates, he argued with a U.S. senator, and later, during a family dinner at the Four Seasons restaurant, he spoiled the family's night out by ripping into a politician who innocently wandered by his table. He seems to not quite connect the backlash against bankers to the deep recession that Wall Street did in fact trigger.
Dimon does not dispute that mortgage lenders and investment banks deserve a lot of the blame. But regulatory lapses and excess leverage throughout the system, he says, contributed as well. What gets him riled is his sense that Washington is captive to a binary, us-against-them environment in which bankers are cast as villains. Perhaps naively, he was disappointed that political concerns played a large role in shaping the legislation. (An example is that Dodd-Frank limited bank investment in hedge funds, even though the latter were peripheral to the crisis.) In contrast, Dimon admires the approach of the members of the Basel Committee, the international regulators who are imposing heightened capital requirements, because they are asking the questions that, in theory, bankers ask of themselves: how much capital do banks need to withstand the inevitable downturn, and what is an acceptable level of risk?
Although he supports most of Dodd-Frank, Dimon says he wishes Congress had thought more deeply about the role that big banks -- and big corporations generally -- play in society. Unprompted, he declared, ''There is a huge misunderstanding on how the economy works, how Main Street and Wall Street work.'' They aren't at odds, Dimon was saying; Wall Street intersects with Main Street. ''A lot of jobs are created in small businesses, but what drives them is capital expenditures. When Caterpillar builds a plant,'' Dimon continued, mentioning a big J. P. Morgan client, ''that's good for jobs. And not just jobs. These big companies lead the way in philanthropy, in having diverse work forces. Yet we act like they're some bad thing.'' Now worked up, he launched into a defense of his values. ''Do I want everyone to have access to universal health care? Yes. Do I want inner-city kids to graduate from schools? Yes. Personally, I don't mind paying higher taxes. But don't mess up the machine that creates the value so you can do these things. This economy is what gave us everything.''
Since the financial crisis, Dimon has asserted that it's the interconnectedness of markets -- the tendency of investors to flee from one vulnerable asset class and then another -- rather than the size of banks that presents the greatest systemic threat. Banking in the United States, he notes, remains far less concentrated than in just about every other developed nation. As he wrote in one of his sermonlike shareholder letters: ''This is not your grandfather's economy. The role of banks in the capital markets has changed considerably.'' He means that banks, once the principal source of loans for America, today supply less than a third of the total credit. The rest comes from bond investors, money-market funds, mutual funds. These new or expanded capital markets, Dimon says, have converted formerly long-term assets (think mortgages) into liquid securities that can be sold in an eye blink. And it was those securities that were the main source of panic in 2008.
Of course, once the panic started, several of J. P. Morgan's rival investment banks did suffer a run, and while Dimon is correct that these episodes differed from the 1930s-style bank runs, it's not unlikely that if another crisis occurs, regulators will be tempted to rescue the biggest banks again. The new ''systemic regulator'' that the Dodd-Frank act established is meant to unwind a failing institution without rewarding its creditors or investors. Dimon is a huge supporter of the concept. ''No one should be too big to fail,'' he tells me. And J. P. Morgan? ''Right,'' he says. ''Morgan should have to file for bankruptcy.'' Suddenly, he begins to scratch out how a putative bankruptcy of his company would look, dissecting the capital structure line by line.
Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, recently predicted that the banking behemoths will most likely break up over time. Bernanke has considerable clout, because the Federal Reserve has yet to enact capital rules for the very big banks; conceivably, the Fed could make it too costly for them to stay big. Even if it doesn't, banks are forbidden to acquire more than 10 percent of the total of deposits. Since J. P. Morgan is already over 9 percent, Dimon has probably cut his last deal, at least within U.S. borders.
That is one reason he is focusing overseas. Last year, J. P. Morgan financed the acquisition by Kirin, the Japanese brewer, of a beer company in Australia as well as a Brazilian purchase of a steel company in the United States. It will have to do more such deals to get the international share of its corporate business to half from its current 30 percent. At home, Dimon is personally more involved in winning business (he courted General Motors' federal overseers to become the co-lead in underwriting G.M.'s stock sale). He is likely to play that role overseas, as well. He appointed Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, as senior adviser to the bank, and Dimon personally visited Africa, China, India and Russia this year; he saw Vladimir Putin at Putin's summer residence and returned impressed by his knowledge of global business (he has not said anything so flattering with respect to Obama).
Noting Dimon's global emphasis, Simon Johnson, the Dimon critic and a former International Monetary Fund economist, wrote in The New Republic that J. P. Morgan is becoming too global to fail -- and that this is dangerous for society. He argues that, notwithstanding the intentions of Dodd-Frank, supersize banks could be bailed out again, because the world economy is becoming dependent on them. Though this is hypothesis, big institutions do wield political clout, and this is a potential drawback of size. Dimon's point is that Asia and Europe are host to a growing portion of the world's financial giants; for competitive, if not for patriotic reasons, America needs its share. Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, may be right when he says that in today's economy, it is time to get over Jacksonian fears of bigness. ''It's a romantic notion to say we are going back to an era when all banks were small,'' Blinder says.
Historically, the biggest enemy of big banks hasn't been government rule-making but rather missteps by banks. Citigroup's expansionist vision was derailed when it overlooked the risks in collateralized debt obligations and, more essentially, when Weill, who retired as chief executive in 2003, failed to name a capable successor. Although Dimon could remain at J. P. Morgan for another decade -- he says he has forsaken any thought of public service -- J. P. Morgan's enormous heft gives the public more than a passing interest in what and who comes next. Board members consider it an active concern. ''When you have a guy as skilled as Jamie, you have to be sure that the bank is not just Jamie -- that you have a team,'' a director told me.
The issue flared into the open in 2009 when the investment bank became torn by a bitter disagreement between its co-chiefs, Winters and Black. Dimon became convinced that Winters, with whom his own relationship was strained, would not be his successor. Black was older than Dimon and out of the running. Dimon was especially alarmed by the feuding because he views the investment bank as an arena for grooming the next chief executive. Late last year, he fired Winters and moved Black, formerly one of his closest confidants, out of a key role. (Black, who was deeply wounded, subsequently announced his resignation. He still calls Dimon ''a terrific leader.'') Alluding obliquely to the turmoil in his annual letter, Dimon wrote that ''poor C.E.O. succession has destroyed many a company.'' With Winters and Black in mind -- or was it himself and Weill? -- he vowed to avoid ''a psychological drama or a Shakespearean tragedy.''
WHILE J. P. MORGAN'S management is considered strong, the disruption was a reminder that banks can go bad in a hurry. And Dimon has yet to fulfill one of the primary tasks he was hired for: to generate enduring wealth for shareholders. Since he arrived at J. P. Morgan, in 2004, the company's stock is flat, a dispiriting result that the directors surely didn't anticipate. His achievement can be measured in terms of the trouble he avoided -- the average bank stock, over that time, is down by half.
One of his Morgan colleagues says that for Dimon to go down as, possibly, the best chief executive of his era, he has to get the stock up and also raise the bank's profitability. Dimon would like to see such gains, of course, but he manages with a sense of fatalism that discourages the setting of precise targets. The very role of banks in the future -- will they prosper as more regulated entities or give ground to less controlled nonbanks? -- is murky. Dimon is no futurologist; he is more comfortable talking about the blocking and tackling of the business, his hope to execute better, to lower costs. When I ask about his ambition, he says he wants to make the business more vibrant for customers and employees, which should lead to more homes financed and jobs created. If he can manage that, he will feel that he served his shareholders and, in a way, served the country, too.
It has been a while, of course, since a banker dared to speak of his trade as a public service. Too many homes have been lost; too much illusory equity disappeared into the smoke and mirrors of the bust. Dimon is not some corner lender; he runs a vast bank. Throughout American history, the financiers who ran such giants have been, variously, lionized as builders and disdained as captains of a privileged class. Dimon would have little patience for such sweeping cliches. His recipe for restoring his industry's reputation is prosaic: ''You do the right thing every day, or try to. There will be mistakes -- you correct them.''

HEADLINE: Of Debts and Doubts

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Common wisdom here holds that the report issued by the president's fiscal commission last week is probably going nowhere, despite the endorsement of 11 of the 18 commission members. Sure, voters like to complain about the debt, the insiders say, but once you start talking about higher taxes and cuts in benefits, you find that no one wants to be the one to sacrifice.
There may be truth to this premise, but only some. After all, generations of Americans have sacrificed plenty for the nation's cause, and there's no reason to think we've lost the capacity. What makes this case for sacrifice so much harder to embrace, perhaps, is that it goes to our national psyche, threatening our self-image as a land with limitless potential. While past generations have readily sacrificed for national greatness, debt reduction -- at least in the gloomy way its advocates argue for it -- feels like a call to sacrifice in the name of our national decline. 
After all, this sense of limitless potential, too, is what we often mean by ''American exceptionalism'' -- a concept that, as the reporter Karen Tumulty noted last week in The Washington Post, has recently come to permeate the rhetoric of leading Republicans. It isn't simply that America, by virtue of symbolizing liberty, has a unique responsibility to shape the affairs of humankind. It's also the belief that free markets can create a kind of endless prosperity, driving an economic and military dominance that exempts Americans from having to accept constraints or trade-offs.
For much of the Industrial Age, and especially between World War II and the oil crises of the 1970s, this was, in fact, reality. Wages and profits rose, the social safety net and the nation's military reach both expanded, and government lived largely within its means. College education, suburban lawns, good pensions and blissful security all became part of the pact with the middle class, as much a part of the constellation of entitlements as Medicare and Medicaid.
Exactly who or what lost the never-ending expansion -- liberal excess, conservative nihilism or simply the tide of technology and globalization -- is the animating debate of modern politics. Whatever the answer, the fiscal commission's point is that the limitless age is at an end.
We've debated looming debt before, of course, most notably in the Reagan years and again in the early '90s. But never did the crisis seem so immediate as now. In the preamble to its report, the commission warned that by 2025, should trends continue, federal revenue would be enough only to cover entitlements and interest payments. Everything else, including defense spending, would have to be borrowed.
Digested line by line, few of the commission's proposals to prevent this calamity seem all that radical, and the most painful are offset by ''sweeteners.'' Increases in Social Security and gas taxes, for instance, would be accompanied by a new, streamlined tax code that would lower income taxes for citizens and businesses.
Taken together, however, especially as a flurry of bullet points on cable news, a lot of the proposals would seem to chisel away at our inherited notions of that 20th-century American ideal. Changes to Social Security, for example, would mean higher taxes and reduced benefits for the guy who manages to pull down six figures, while Americans entering the work force now would have to wait until 69 to retire. (As it stands, the retirement age is ultimately slated to reach 67.)
The commission report touches on our expectation of homeownership, too, by proposing to roll back the tax deduction for mortgage interest. Such a change would hardly rip the stuffing out of the American dream, since it would apply only to mortgages over $500,000 or to second homes. But just raising the issue suggests that government should no longer make homeownership a priority for middle-class Americans, that maybe renting isn't such a bad idea after all.
The commission's recommendations would necessitate a leaner military, undermining our postwar image of America as the world's reigning protector. The proposed increase in the gas tax -- by 15 cents over a period of a year -- carries more than a little symbolic weight in a culture where the open road, and the ability to access it cheaply, is tantamount to personal liberty. And the proposals would eliminate some subsidies for federal student loans and the tax exclusion for employer-based health care, both emblematic of things Americans once took for granted but now find increasingly worrisome.
All of this might give the impression that the panel's work is, in fact, an acknowledgment of inevitable decline, an accord to be signed mournfully at the Appomattox of the American century. But that's not necessarily the case.
In fact, policy experts argue that steps along the lines of the commission's recommendations could actually modernize outdated systems -- making the country more competitive as a result -- without profoundly affecting the American experience. A simpler, updated tax code for businesses might help spur entrepreneurship, while a hard line on inefficient spending (farm subsidies come to mind) might free up government to invest more in new technologies and infrastructure. A streamlined military of the kind championed by Robert Gates, the defense secretary, would probably be better prepared for the challenges ahead than a military burdened by the costs of obsolete weapons systems and bases left over from the cold war.
If that's true, the pivotal question for advocates of budget reform may be how to communicate that more optimistic vision to voters, rather than focusing so relentlessly on the pain they intend to inflict. Absent some change in the public perception, after all, lawmakers aren't likely to risk their careers for what amounts to a menu of unpopular choices.
Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget at the New America Foundation, suggested that the commission enlist the help of all the living ex-presidents to make its case. The political scientist William Galston believes that President Obama should use his State of the Union address to lay out a case for the commission's plan.
Former Senator Gary Hart, who recently helped author his own budget plan as part of a panel assembled by Esquire magazine, thinks the commission's chairmen should take their case on the road, flashing Ross Perot-style flip charts at chambers of commerce and Kiwanis Clubs around the nation. The idea of such a campaign in the Internet age sounds almost quaint, an echo of 20th-century life. Then again, maybe that more hopeful echo is what anxious Americans really need to hear.
Correction: December 12, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the deficit commission reversed the retirement age for Americans entering the work force now and the retirement age proposed by the commission. The retirement age for these workers is 67 and would ultimately reach 69 if the commission's plan is adopted.

HEADLINE: G.E. Goes With What It Knows: Making Stuff

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
TO train its future leaders, General Electric has rising young stars study and visit an array of different organizations, from Google to West Point.
What can managers at the 132-year-old industrial giant learn from Google? A corporate mind-set that prizes ''constant entrepreneurship,'' says Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, during an interview at his corporate headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.
And what wisdom is on tap at the United States Military Academy? ''Adaptability'' and ''resiliency'' amid uncertainty, says Mr. Immelt -- skills as vital to surviving in business as they are on the battlefield.
Strategies are useful, he says, but only if they can quickly adjust to nasty real-world surprises. ''In the words of the great philosopher Mike Tyson,'' Mr. Immelt says, smiling, ''everybody has a plan till they get punched in the mouth.'' 
Perhaps no company outside of the banking sector was hit as hard by the financial crisis as G.E., certainly none that seemed healthy before the economic tailspin. Its big finance arm, GE Capital, long a cash machine that bolstered the mother ship's bottom line, became an albatross, threatening to pull down the entire enterprise. G.E. cut its dividend for the first time since the Great Depression, lost its triple-A credit rating and hastily arranged a $3 billion investment from the billionaire Warren E. Buffett.
Having skirted disaster, G.E. is recovering gradually these days. Its finance unit is on the mend, with the size of its debts and troubled loans trending downward. Mind you, middling recoveries are a relative matter at G.E. After all, the company remains a colossus on track to deliver profits of more than $10 billion on sales of about $150 billion this year. But investors are used to getting more from G.E., which earned $22 billion on revenue of $173 billion in 2007.
So G.E. has revamped its strategy in the wake of the financial crisis. Its heritage of industrial innovation reaches back to Thomas Edison and the incandescent light bulb, and with that legacy in mind, G.E. is going back to basics. The company, Mr. Immelt insists, must rely more on making physical products and less on financial engineering -- a path that, he insists, is also necessary for the American economy as a whole.
Mr. Immelt candidly admits that G.E. was seduced by GE Capital's financial promise -- the lure of rapid-fire money-making unencumbered by the long-range planning, costs and headaches that go into producing heavy-duty material goods. Other industrial corporations were enthralled with finance, of course, but none as much as G.E., which became the nation's largest nonbank financial company.
The big buildup of GE Capital occurred during the tenure of Mr. Immelt's famous predecessor, Jack Welch. But while Mr. Immelt, who took over in 2001, spun off the unit's insurance business, he also bulked up on commercial real estate and other loans. In 2004, G.E. even bought a subprime lender in California, WMC Mortgage, which it shed in 2007 for a $1 billion loss.
IN the buoyant years before the credit crisis, the company's finance arm contributed nearly half of G.E.'s overall profits. When Mr. Immelt had qualms about the unit's risks, he sought outside opinions, including ordering up a study by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in 2007.
Sixty days later, the consulting team, he says, told G.E. that money from nations with a trade surplus, like China, and sovereign wealth funds, among other investors, would provide enough liquidity in the financial system to fuel lending and leverage for the foreseeable future. (McKinsey declined to comment on the study.)
Mr. Immelt and his advisers had plenty of company in missing the gathering storm.
''But clearly,'' Mr. Immelt concedes, ''GE Capital was too big in the context of G.E.'' Going back to the early 1990s, he explains, anticipated returns -- not so much market expertise -- guided investment decisions. If a deal looked like a money spinner, he says, it got the nod. ''And you don't have to build a factory,'' he adds.
Today, the financial unit is becoming smaller and focusing on fields where G.E. believes it has a competitive advantage. Those specialty areas include industries in which G.E. has a strong manufacturing presence, like power generation, aviation and health-care equipment, and lending to midsize industrial companies. Unless a deal is in a business where G.E. has distinctive skills, Mr. Immelt says he won't let GE Capital dive in.
''We're not going to do it, whether there are supernormal returns or not,'' he says.
He's most animated talking about heavyweight products that take patience and piles of cash to develop, weigh tons and last for years -- next-generation jet engines, power turbines, locomotives, nuclear plants, water-treatment systems, medical-imaging equipment, solar panels and windmills. Mr. Immelt notes, for example, that the cost of a good-sized solar-panel plant, about $70 million, is more than twice the total investment in Google in the six years before it went public in 2004.
The costs and complexities of such businesses, he adds, make it hard for just any company to compete. These are markets, he says, that have ''big moats. They're tough to get in.''
The big-moat businesses can also be quite lucrative. Mr. Immelt points to G.E.'s jet-engine business as an example, saying that it has higher profit margins and returns on capital than the leading banks. ''It doesn't happen every quarter or every year,'' he says. ''But over a 10- or 20-year time period, the businesses that are hard to do had the best returns. So the arithmetic works over time.''
Technology-based manufacturing of all sorts, Mr. Immelt says, has to be a central part of reinvigorating the economy. In speeches and position papers, Mr. Immelt, a member of the White House's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, has called for doubling manufacturing employment in America, to 20 percent of the work force, which he concedes is an ''aspirational'' goal.
Making progress, he adds, will require significantly improving the nation's prowess as an exporter. G.E., by the way, happens to be America's second-largest exporter, after Boeing. So Mr. Immelt's views about what changes would benefit the economy would probably help G.E. as well.
''Many bought into the idea that America could go from a technology-based, export-oriented powerhouse to a services-led, consumption-based economy -- and somehow still expect to prosper,'' Mr. Immelt said in a typical speech last year before the Detroit Economic Club. ''That idea was flat wrong.'' He added: ''Our economy tilted instead toward the quicker profits of financial services.''
Mr. Immelt is backing his words with actions -- plans announced over the last 18 months include the creation of more than 4,000 jobs in manufacturing production and research in the United States. They include new factory jobs in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Alabama and Mississippi, for making products including energy-thrifty washers and dryers, fluorescent light bulbs, sodium batteries, environmental coatings and jet engines. And the company is opening a research center in Michigan for advanced manufacturing technologies.
''The underlying DNA of G.E., going back a century, has been to invest for growth in its technology base,'' says Noel Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan business school who once ran G.E.'s management school in Crotonville, N.Y. ''So by increasing R.& D. spending and with investments in manufacturing, Jeff Immelt is going 'back to the future' at G.E.''
ABOUT 1,000 miles from corporate headquarters, inside a gleaming new plant that is the result of a $100 million, three-year investment, G.E.'s back-to-basics strategy is on display.
The spotless factory, in Batesville, Miss., spans 300,000 square feet -- about five football fields -- and cranes and bulldozers are already working on a 40,000-square-foot addition. The site makes strong, lightweight composite parts for a new generation of more fuel-efficient jet engines. Initial production began last year. It is an industrial symphony of materials science, high-tech machinery and hand craftsmanship. Computer-controlled machines cut carbon-fiber fabric precisely, but, as if it were in an industrial bakery, the fabric still has to be kneaded into shape and into molds by hand and then cured and baked in giant ovens.
The parts are for new versions of fuel-efficient, quieter engines that will be used in wide-body, long-haul planes like the Boeing 747-8 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Passenger and cargo carriers have 1,300 of these engines on order, and about 80 percent of the production is for export.
For each job at the factory, there are about 30 applicants. The payroll has more than doubled this year, to 220, and is on its way to 450 by 2012. Everyone dresses in blue short-sleeve shirts with a G.E. logo and dark pants. Production is organized around the concept of ''high-performance work teams,'' typically six to 12 workers.
It's a bottom-up approach that shuns hierarchy, and places most of the responsibility for continuous improvement on the teams. An egalitarian ethos is reflected in the job titles. The boss, Jeanne Edwards, is the ''plant leader.'' Line workers are called ''production associates.'' There are no supervisors here, only ''leaders'' and ''coaches.'' There aren't many of those anyway -- all but 29 workers are hourly employees, and production associates start at about $35,000 a year.
The team approach seems to be working. Workers and coaches steadily look for ways to tweak the production process for greater efficiency. Since production began last year, the manufacturing ''cycle time'' -- from cutting carbon-fiber fabric to shipping a finished part -- has been reduced by 80 percent, says Antroine Townes, 27, an engineer who guides process-improvement efforts.
To get hired at the Batesville plant, applicants must first take a reading, math and problem-solving test administered by the state employment agency. Candidates who do well are then invited for interviews at the plant and are evaluated in team settings. For example, they are placed in groups of four and told to assemble a Lego helicopter in 15 minutes.
''We want to see how they interact, how they work together,'' says Terry Collins, the plant's human resources leader. ''We don't give a heck about making the helicopter.''
The workers hired so far come from varied backgrounds, some from more regimented factory settings. Recruits from traditional factories, says Ms. Edwards, the plant leader, ''often tend to have some trouble at first.''
Audra Harris, 36, left a job as a machine operator at a commercial roofing manufacturer to come to the G.E. plant. In her first months, Ms. Harris says she initially found the team approach ''very challenging,'' but adapted quickly. ''Here you get to make a lot of decisions,'' she says.
Steve Lentz, 55, who had worked in a printing factory and a bottling factory before joining G.E, says the large investment in a high-tech facility proved that the company had a long-term commitment. ''I figured I could wrap up my career here,'' he says. ''At other places, you don't know when the shoe will drop.''
Jeffrey Parker, 29, was hired last year. A college graduate, he had never set foot in a manufacturing plant before and had worked as a mortgage broker for Countrywide Financial.
He says his perception of manufacturing work was laborers tethered to machines, doing boring repetitive tasks in grimy factories. ''I had a real rough, blue-collar view of what manufacturing life is like,'' he says. ''It's not like that here.''
MR. Immelt says his broadest responsibility at G.E. is to ''drive change and develop people.'' Any executive who wants to change things, he says, should be guided by ''a point of view about what's going on in the world, and you invest around that point of view.''
One big trend that corporations must embrace, he notes, is the ''reordering of the global economy.'' In a talk to students at the Stanford business school this year, Mr. Immelt observed that when he was a young executive moving up the ranks at G.E. in the 1980s, developed nations accounted for 80 percent of worldwide economic growth. In the coming decade, he told the students, emerging markets are expected to deliver 80 percent of global growth.
Under Mr. Immelt, G.E. has sharply expanded its overseas sales, to $81 billion last year from $51 billion in 2001. But the company has fallen short of some of its ambitious goals for even higher growth, especially in markets like India and China. To accelerate the growth abroad, Mr. Immelt last month reassigned John G. Rice, a vice chairman, to Hong Kong, where he will oversee sales, marketing and operations outside the United States.
Mr. Immelt has expressed frustration about the difficulties of doing business in China, especially in industries that Beijing has marked as priorities to the nation's economic development. In a meeting with a group of Italian business executives in Rome in July, he told the group, according to The Financial Times: ''I really worry about China. I am not sure that in the end they want any of us to win, or any of us to be successful.''
G.E. has said the remarks were taken out of context and do not represent the company's view.
And Mr. Immelt now offers a more subtle assessment, saying that China is too large and complex to approach in a cookie-cutter way. ''I defy anybody to say they have a one-China strategy,'' he says. ''I defy anyone.''
In some markets in China, he says, G.E. will be guided solely by whether Chinese rivals are weak or strong. But in industries like solar and wind power that are a focus of Beijing's five-year economic plans, for example, competitive tactics need to be fine-tuned to adapt to state policy.
''Is it a strategic industry or one that is going to be allowed to commercialize on its own?'' Mr. Immelt says.
The approach to China, he says, isn't so different from the approach used in foreign markets where G.E. has been for decades and prospered. ''Is France a completely open market to G.E.? No, of course not,'' Mr. Immelt observes. ''I think we're more discerning about China because it's China, and they're big and they're more concerning. But the best global companies are ones that are nuanced.''
Being nuanced in foreign markets, he says, is a skill that ''I think we're pretty good at.''
Mr. Immelt also sees himself as the champion of what he calls ''large-scale entrepreneurship'' at G.E. By that, he means identifying long-term market shifts -- ''what's next,'' he says -- and then marshaling the company's research, manufacturing and marketing resources to capitalize on the opportunity. He firmly believes that corporate size, when focused, can be a crucial advantage in the high-tech industrial markets where G.E. competes.
''It's about using the scale of G.E., the majesty of the company, to drive growth and change,'' he says.
Mr. Immelt's leadership style, according to colleagues and advisers, is a blend of analysis, encouragement, cajoling and sometimes orders by decree. He grew up in Cincinnati, where his father, Joseph, once managed G.E.'s aircraft engine business. He attended Dartmouth College, majored in applied mathematics, was elected president of his fraternity, and played tackle on the football team.
Next came a short stint at Procter & Gamble. Nearby sat another aspiring business leader, Steven A. Ballmer, now chief executive of Microsoft. Mr. Ballmer recalls Mr. Immelt as bright, energetic and engaging company during after-work dinners and bar-hopping. After little contact for years, Mr. Ballmer says the two have ''really reconnected'' in the last decade after they both became chief executives of leading American corporations, getting together for dinners and rounds of golf, sharing thoughts on leadership and management.
Mr. Ballmer observes that they both took over from revered, successful leaders -- Mr. Welch at G.E., and Bill Gates at Microsoft -- just after the stock market had peaked and that investors have had lingering doubts about the outlook for both companies, despite solid results in most years.
''Even if you're doing a good job, it doesn't always get reported that way,'' Mr. Ballmer notes.
After P.& G., Mr. Immelt went to Harvard Business School for an M.B.A. A math whiz, his favorite subject was finance. But when he graduated in 1982, he turned down a job offer from Morgan Stanley, opting for an industrial company -- and the one where his father had built a career -- over Wall Street. At G.E., he began climbing the ranks.
Relaxed and affable, he is routinely described as ''comfortable in his own skin.'' In his autobiography, Mr. Welch wrote that he selected Mr. Immelt as his successor because ''I felt Jeff had the perfect blend of intelligence and edge and epitomized the trait that's so important to me -- he was really comfortable in his own skin.''
THE G.E. campaign to promote energy-efficient products, begun in 2005 and called ecomagination, is a model of Mr. Immelt's efforts to push large-scale change. It began because he believed that energy efficiency and alternative energy sources were growth markets and that G.E. should capitalize on those trends.
To find new ideas, Mr. Immelt spends much of his time traveling and talking to customers, industry partners, government officials and analysts.
Mr. Immelt, according to Beth Comstock, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at G.E., is constantly scouting for opportunity. ''He says, 'Hey, I think there's something here,' '' Ms. Comstock says. ''Let's see what we can do.'' When he gets excited, teams are dispatched to assess markets, products and research and technology trends, typically in a few weeks or less.
When the campaign began, some inside and outside of G.E. dismissed it as a marketing gimmick, and internal employee surveys found little enthusiasm for it. ''Ecomagination had a favorability rating of like one when it started, maybe two, me and Beth,'' Mr. Immelt recalls, amused. ''So it was like two against 300,000 the first day.''
But momentum built gradually, especially as more G.E. products delivered energy savings and market acceptance. Today, products that qualify for the ecomagination label total $20 billion in sales. One example: G.E. not only sells a hybrid locomotive, but also is building a battery plant in upstate New York that will employ 350 workers. Its production is intended for fuel-efficient locomotives and backup power supplies for data centers and telecommunications switching stations. G.E. hopes to make industrial batteries a $1 billion-a-year business.
''That was totally Jeff Immelt,'' says Mark Little, who oversees G.E.'s research efforts and led the locomotive effort. ''The kinds of things that cut across business units -- or have no natural home in a business -- are not natural acts for us. And he makes sure they happen.''
Occasionally, Mr. Immelt just issues an order. After a trip to Brazil in January, he became convinced that the country was rapidly advancing in technology and that G.E. should place a research lab there. When he returned to the United States, he told Mr. Little, as Mr. Immelt recalls, ''Hey dude, you're going to put a global research center in Brazil. Pick a good place.'' Last month, G.E. announced it would build a research center in Rio de Janeiro.
Leadership by fiat when done in moderation, Mr. Immelt says, can drive change and set a course. ''I think that if you run a big company, you've got to four or five times a year, just say, 'Hey team, look, here's where we're going,' '' he says. ''If you do it 10 times, nobody wants to work for you. If you do it zero times, you have anarchy.''
Despite the financial crisis and recession, Mr. Immelt has kept investing for the long haul. Research and development spending increased last year to $3.3 billion, and will be still higher this year. ''It would have been easy to say times are tough and we'll pull back on research spending and long-range projects, but he didn't do any of that,'' says Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth and a former consultant to G.E. ''Jeff Immelt really held onto his technology-led-innovation agenda.''
G.E.'s management traditions emphasize patience and its leaders typically have long tenures. Mr. Welch was at the helm for two decades, and Mr. Immelt, 54, has been in charge for nearly a decade. A winter or two of discontent is not cause for dismissal. But the stock price, which closed at $16.78 on Friday, is less than half its level when Mr. Immelt took over in 2001. The stock has barely budged in the last year, as G.E. slowly climbs back from the financial crisis.
There is no indication of a restive board. Yet shareholders are waiting to see better days from the battered stock of G.E., long the bluest of blue chip companies. Under Mr. Immelt, the company has pared its offerings -- the plastics business was sold off, the majority stake in NBC Universal is being sold to Comcast, and, of course, GE Capital has been whittled down.
THE near-term prospects for G.E.'s stock seem to depend, if not on financial engineering, then at least on financial moves that might lift the dividend back toward its pre-crisis levels. The NBC sale to Comcast could bring $8 billion in cash. And negotiating with Mr. Buffett to buy back his $3 billion in preferred stock, which pays a 10 percent dividend, could free up $300 million in yearly fees. Those steps could clear the way to raising the dividend and making the stock fetching again for investors.
''That's the fulcrum for G.E. stock until the economy strengthens and the industrial business really gets rolling again,'' says Nicholas Heymann, an analyst for Sterne, Agee & Leach.
Mr. Immelt observes that G.E.'s stock, which climbed above $40 in 2007 before the crisis kicked in, has mirrored how investors have viewed financial services over the last decade. That's a perception Mr. Immelt hopes to change as he re-emphasizes G.E.'s manufacturing prowess and reins in the financial operation.
''As we come out of the recession, we're going to see if the moves to streamline the portfolio will pay off,'' says Steven Winoker, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''We haven't seen positive results yet.''
For his part, Mr. Immelt is an optimist. ''We're going to be one of the companies that comes out of the crisis stronger than we went in,'' he says. ''I think that is something that is ultimately going to be good for employees and investors.''

HEADLINE: The Country Can Learn a Lesson From These Students

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
Twenty-one-year old Zakiya Qualls seemed almost too shy to speak at the start of our telephone conversation. But her tone was lively and her voice forceful when she talked about her senior-year science research at Howard University and her dream of finding a cure for Parkinson's disease.
''There are novel compounds all over the world that people have been using for hundreds of years that might prevent'' diseases like Parkinson's, she explained, sounding suddenly older. ''Take curry. People in India eat it almost every day and they tend to have lower rates of neurodegenerative disease.'' Then she plunged into the results of her experiments, which showed that an ingredient found in turmeric, used in curries, might protect neurons from toxins. 
Ms. Qualls was one of more than 150 students who received awards last month at the 10th Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students, in Charlotte, N.C. Sponsored by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, it attracted about 2,000 mainly minority students, along with hundreds of research program recruiters and professors who led seminars and judged competitions.
The conference was life-changing for Melissa Youssef, a 21-year-old senior and award winner from Furman University in Greenville, S.C., where she knows only a few science majors.
''It was heaven to be around people who were interested in the same thing,'' she said. She went home determined to pursue both an M.D. and a Ph.D., even though it will probably take eight years.
The gathering had a similar effect on James McCann, a quiet young man from St. Edward's University in Texas who wowed the conference with his work on a bacterium that preys on victims of cystic fibrosis. This was his introduction to the international world of biomedical research that he has his heart set on joining.
To preserve its economic future, this country needs to get many more American students -- especially more minority students -- excited about science.
Once the world's leader in science education, the United States has fallen far behind. It ranks 21st out of 30 developed nations in terms of student performance on international science tests. It ranks 27th among developed nations in the percentage of students who graduate from college with degrees in the natural sciences and in engineering.
Right now only about 6 percent of young college graduates in this country have degrees in science or engineering, as opposed to about 10 percent in many developed nations. The numbers are far worse for minorities: only 2.7 percent of young African-American college graduates and 2.2 percent of Latinos.
This is the problem that keeps Freeman Hrabowski awake at night. Mr. Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, led the committee that produced ''Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation,'' an eye-opening study issued by the National Academies, the country's leading science advisory group.
The report sets the goal of nearly doubling the percentage of science graduates. To reach this goal, the country should at least triple the percentage of science and engineering degrees granted to underrepresented minority groups, who will represent nearly half the national population by the year 2050.
That won't happen unless the states begin to renovate their weak math and science curriculums. Colleges and universities, with help from government, need to provide more financial aid for science students and reverse a disastrous pattern of attrition that now sees more than half of science students switching majors before they graduate.
Mr. Hrabowski leads by example at U.M.B.C., which now produces more minority scientists than any predominantly white institution in the country. Still, he is often met with skepticism when he tells other educators that they could have large numbers of high-performing minority students if they engaged those students meaningfully in the work of science itself. He hopes that this year's conference in Charlotte will drive this point home.

HEADLINE: Europe's Piecemeal Failure

BYLINE: By ALISTAIR DARLING. 
Alistair Darling, a member of the British Parliament, was the chancellor of the Exchequer from 2007 to 2010.

 BODY:
London
WHEN I look at events in Europe today, with Ireland getting bailed out and talk of crises brewing elsewhere on the continent, I am reminded of the weeks leading up to the banking crisis in 2008. As the credit crunch began and banks found it increasingly difficult to get access to funding, policy makers faced a choice: deal with the problem in a piecemeal way, or address the root causes immediately.
For too long many policy makers opted to fudge their approach; they dealt with the problem bank by bank and refused to recognize the system's fundamental flaws.
As a result, we saw Lehman Brothers go bankrupt, Bear Stearns bought up in a fire sale and a major British bank come within hours of collapse. 
During that summer I realized that unless we put a firewall in place to prevent the crisis from spreading, we would face a catastrophe in the banking sector and the wider economy. That's why I took the controversial step of injecting billions of pounds into the banking system to stabilize it. By tackling the fundamental problem, the lack of capital in banks, we stopped a meltdown. It was drastic action, but I have no doubt that it worked.
The same approach is now urgently needed for European economies. It is not enough for the euro zone nations to bail out each economy as it falls into a crisis -- they must address the root causes of the continent's problems.
This hasn't been the approach so far. In May, Europe eventually faced up to the fact that it had to help Greece, which was finding it increasingly difficult to borrow to cover its debts. But the rescue was far too long in coming, and the United States Treasury deserves a great deal of credit for forcing the issue to a head.
Thanks to the bailout, the immediate crisis was resolved; we bought some time. But that time was not used to put in place a more fundamental approach that would deal with overly indebted European economies.
And so, a little over a week ago, we saw a new crisis: Ireland had to accept that its banks' debts were so large that it needed help. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund stepped in with a bailout package, and again the immediate crisis was averted.
But did the Irish bailout draw a line under the euro zone crisis? Far from it. Bond yields rose for Portugal, Spain and even Italy, a strong indication that problems remain.
More than anything, the problems in the euro zone have exposed the monetary union's basic fault line. The euro zone shares a common currency, but the political and economic union that underpins it has a limited ability to resolve disagreements among member states and to take decisive steps to resolve difficulties.
The result is a political crisis alongside the economic one: commentators speak as if the only options are complete political union or the breakup of the euro zone. But the first will not happen, while the second would create many more painful and destabilizing problems. Instead, just as with the banking crisis, Europe must construct a firewall to stop the crisis from spreading.
This will involve two sets of steps. First, action is needed now to provide stability. To that end, the European Central Bank needs to make a firm commitment to buying government bonds from at-risk countries. That's what it did during the Greek crisis, where its resolve played a key role in returning investor confidence to the bond market. Since then, however, it has sent out increasingly mixed signals about whether it would do so in the future (although last week it did step up its bond purchases, to some effect).
The European Central Bank should be clear that it will continue to intervene to stabilize markets, and it needs to consider going further. During my time as chancellor of the Exchequer I authorized the Bank of England to engage in quantitative easing by increasing the money supply, a step that has been taken twice by the Federal Reserve as well.
Despite the success of our actions, however, the European Central Bank has refused to consider doing the same. It should think again. Quite simply, Europe cannot afford to bump along the economic bottom for the next few years with sluggish growth.
The euro zone states also need to deal with banks carrying unsustainable debt. Last summer Europe carried out so-called stress tests on its banks to see which ones were at risk of collapse. But these tests were insufficient (as I noted at the time). The tests did not pay enough attention to the banks' interrelationships, not just in Europe but globally. Banks in trouble need to be restructured and broken up, if necessary.
Finally, alongside such preventive measures, Europe needs to step up its contingency planning in case banks wind up failing. The Irish banks are not unique, after all. This means being clear about what sits on a bank's balance sheet, and what is to be done if a bank becomes insolvent. The lack of such transparency in the case of the Lehman Brothers collapse led to the seizing up of the global finance sector -- no one knew who owed what to whom.
The second set of steps is more long term and involves Europe's accepting two fundamental principles. The first is that austerity alone will not work. It is not enough simply to demand that countries at risk of default immediately shrink their deficits and cut government spending. That approach is self-defeating: inflicting deflationary, painful austerity policies runs the risk of stifling the growth the countries need to pay down their debt and recover.
Today too many European advocates of austerity at all costs stand virtually unchallenged. Their solution is similar to that of dealing with troubled banks one by one: it is a fudge, addressing just one part of a much larger problem.
What is needed instead is a balanced approach in which deficits are brought down quickly, but not in such a way as to destroy the economic or social fabric of those countries. The pace of deficit reduction needs to match the capacity of the private sector to pick up the slack.
The second principle is that countries with heavy debt burdens need more than just a bailout. Markets need to see that these countries have some hope of being able to manage their debt burdens in the future, especially after seeing their governments nationalize the balance sheets of collapsing banks.
Consumers in these countries, seeing their economies in crisis, will not want to spend money or borrow more. Companies will be wary of making investments. So growth, and the means of meeting countries' debt burdens, must come from exports.
That means in the medium term, larger euro zone countries will need to increase their own spending to balance the contraction in demand they are imposing on their crisis-stricken neighbors. Unfortunately, today the opposite is occurring: major European economies are undertaking their own austerity measures, shrinking demand for imports at home. This approach offers the peripheral countries no way out, and unwieldy transfer payments of one form or another, like bailouts or other aid packages, risk becoming unavoidable.
I have spoken with too many European politicians who, when I ask them where growth will come from in the future, say they can't be sure. But without a clear path forward, we will see minimal growth for Europe's stronger economies; for those in danger already it could be disastrous.
We cannot go on like this. The crisis in the euro zone is the single largest threat to the fragile global recovery we are now seeing. And this is not just a problem for Europe. It matters to us in Britain, as well as to the United States and Asia.
At last year's Group of 20 meetings in London, the participating countries agreed to stabilize the international banking system and to stimulate the world economy. Further progress was made in Pittsburgh six months later. There was real political will to do what was necessary.
That momentum has now been lost, and it will not be regained without greater involvement from the major economies. Decisive action, confronting the underlying causes of this crisis, is now imperative.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Leaves, Iraqis Suffer Economic Toll

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Yasir Ghazi contributed reporting from Tikrit and Baghdad, and an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Kirkuk.

 BODY:
TIKRIT, Iraq -- Qahtan Kareem is a businessman whose main business -- the United States -- is leaving town. He made his fortune buying and reselling scrap and surplus from military bases. Now, as the American Army withdraws from Iraq, he is grim about the future of his company and its 430 employees.
''It's going to be a disaster,'' he said, sitting in an office lined with framed photographs of him with American officers. ''There are no jobs outside American camps.''
While the political and security consequences of the American withdrawal have yet to be fully resolved, its economic effects have already taken a sharp toll on the tens of thousands of Iraqis who earned their livelihoods, sometimes at great risk, working for the military and the legions of American civilian and defense contractors. 
They are now stranded between worlds, struggling to find new jobs in a country where about one in four people is unemployed, and scorned by those who view working for Westerners as treachery. Dozens have been killed, and few have been able to take advantage of American programs to relocate endangered Iraqi allies, discouraged by long waiting lists and tangled rules for applying.
''We've been left behind,'' said Sayf Alaa Kamel, 22, who said he left school to work as a painter for an American contractor, but lost his job earlier this year.
The number of Iraqis employed by the American military has plummeted from 44,000 in January 2009, before the United States began to reduce its forces, to about 10,500 now, according to the military's figures. The number of American-financed contractors and grant recipients fell by 22 percent just during the summer, according to a report by the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction.
Those numbers are likely to keep falling as the United States continues what one military official called a ''glide path'' out of Iraq.
Layoffs and economic dislocation are natural consequences of the ebb of war, and their ravages in Tikrit, a sunbaked town 100 miles north of Baghdad best known as the home of Saddam Hussein, are mirrored in cities and towns across Iraq in varying degrees. High unemployment, especially among the young men who are favored insurgent recruiting targets, poses a security risk that threatens to undo hard-fought gains.
Contracts are expiring and reconstruction money is almost completely spent. The 49,700 remaining American troops need fewer Iraqis to paint gymnasiums, lay bricks or serve as links to local communities.
The newly jobless Iraqis say they are struggling to find work in the country's anemic private sector or bribe their way into a government job. Some have moved their families to boom towns in the Kurdish north or the oil-rich south.
Those who fared especially well during the war are living on the money they saved. Others, awash in debt, have sold the refrigerators and the laptops they bought with American paychecks.
Mr. Kareem is planning to close two of his five junkyards, one near Baghdad and the other in Anbar Province in the west, putting about 120 people out of work. He hopes to build a $4 million recycling center near Tikrit, but is uncertain when he will break ground.
''We don't know what's in store for us,'' he said. ''Our business will close. Our employees will be out of work. They'll be back to where they started, and terrorists will see this and take advantage.''
In Baghdad, the owners of the Zanubia transportation company said they once employed 55 drivers, engineers, electricians, security guards and other staff members to haul supplies for contractors working with the Army Corps of Engineers and the United Nations. Drivers were shot at and kidnapped, and the company's owners received death threats. But the money rolled in. At its peak -- ''the golden age,'' one of the owners said -- Zanubia had contracts worth about $1 million a month.
''There were people who hated the Americans,'' said Ayad Faraj, 34, a partner in the company. ''We didn't see them as an occupation. It was in our interest to work with them.''
Business has slowed to about $20,000 a month, and Zanubia has downsized its headquarters from a large house to a dingy office. The company has sold its trucks and surplus goods, and its owners say they are barely hanging on.
''It's almost finished,'' said Sami Nasir, the other partner. ''Two years ago, we were so busy. Now, days pass without us doing anything.''
In the dusty and forlorn village of Asakr, about 100 miles north of Baghdad, an American military camp changed the fortunes of the town and its people.
Many of the 1,000 or so residents live in rows of nearly identical cinderblock homes that get about four hours of electricity a day. The streets are rutted dirt, there is no secondary school and the most prominent architectural feature is a pyramid-shaped bunker.
But since 2003, Camp Speicher, the headquarters of American forces in northern Iraq, has offered a rare opportunity. Residents said they would hitch a five-minute ride to work every morning and spend the day installing electrical cables, repairing cars or interpreting Arabic. Work at the base -- a small town with its own airfield, soccer stadium, shops and American fast-food restaurants -- paid reliably, and the Americans treated them professionally.
A former cleaner and laborer for American contractors, Ismail Esam Mohadeen, 26, sat in his living room, surrounded by a television, a gilded tea set, an armoire and stuffed animals his children had scattered. ''This is all from the work I did,'' he said.
Now, the base's total population has fallen by more than half to 4,000, according to military officials there, and its former local employees are sorting out conflicted feelings of gratitude, nostalgia and frustration.
''The money was so much better, and the work was actually comfortable,'' Mr. Mohadeen said. ''We thought we'd have jobs. We were there for eight years. We didn't see this coming.''
Some still have framed letters hanging on their bedroom walls, signed by Army officers praising their work and supporting them for American visas. They still remember the English they learned on base, but with no one to talk to, their vocabulary is fading.
Mohamed Jabar, 24, who recently lost his job as a driver earning $800 a month for an Iraqi subcontractor, is among those trying to scrub away the stigma of their former work.
A native of the restive, and heavily Sunni, Diyala Province, Mr. Jabar said that insurgents threatened him and interrogated his neighbors about his employers, driving him from the home he shared with his mother. But newly unemployed, he returned to beg forgiveness of local militants and ask that his name be struck from their hit lists. He said he promised them he was done with the Americans.
''I went through all that danger and risked my life,'' he said. ''It wasn't worth it, but what was the alternative? I got a little money. Now life must go on.''

HEADLINE: DEAL TO EXTEND BUSH'S TAX CUTS IS SEEN AS NEAR

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- White House officials and Congressional Republicans said Sunday they were closing in on a deal to temporarily continue the Bush-era tax cuts at all income levels, while bitterly frustrated Democratic Congressional leaders began exploring whether they would have the votes for such a package.
A day after the Senate rejected President Obama's preferred tax plan, officials said the broad contours of a compromise were in focus.
Rather than extending the tax rates only on income described by Democrats as middle class -- up to $250,000 a year for couples and $200,000 for individuals -- the deal would also keep the rates for higher earners, probably for two years. In return, Republicans said they would probably agree to extend jobless aid for the long-term unemployed.
Senior Democrats on Sunday said that they were resigned to defeat in the highly charged tax debate, and they voiced dismay. 
''We're moving in that direction,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat said dejectedly when Bob Schieffer, host of ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, asked him if the 2001 and 2003 tax rates would be extended even for the wealthy. ''And we're only moving there against my judgment,'' Mr. Durbin added.
In meetings with administration officials after the Senate votes, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and many other House and Senate Democrats voiced deep unhappiness at the prospect of extending all the tax cuts and also expressed their belief that the White House did not appear to be getting enough for such a big concession, officials said.
That sort of anger raised the likelihood that Republicans would have to generate large numbers of votes to advance any deal in Congress, much as they did to help approve the big financial system bailout at President George W. Bush's request in 2008.
White House officials, meanwhile, expressed hope of sealing a deal swiftly, perhaps by midweek, and clearing the Congressional calendar for a long list of other priorities that they aim to accomplish by the end of the year, including ratification of the New Start arms treaty with Russia and the repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gay service members as part of a wider Pentagon policy bill.
Administration officials said the negotiations were focused on the question of extending the tax rates for one or two years, with a three-year extension highly unlikely, even though that time frame would probably eliminate the tax fight as an urgent issue in the 2012 elections.
Many Republicans say they want a permanent extension of the rates, or as long an extension as possible. Democrats say they would not mind the issue coming up during Mr. Obama's re-election bid, because they see it as politically helpful to them in painting Republicans as defenders of the rich. The debate, of course, could cut the other way, with Republicans again portraying Democrats as seeking to raise taxes.
Some Congressional Democrats have suggested a willingness to let the tax rates expire for everyone at the end of the year, and to press the fight into next year. At the same time, some prominent economists have counseled that it would be wise not to substantially raise taxes or cut spending at the moment given the risk of further hindering an already precarious economic recovery.
In an interview on ''60 Minutes'' on Sunday night, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, said policy makers should be careful to protect the recovery in what could be interpreted as a warning to Democrats not to raise taxes and to Republicans not to cut government spending. ''We don't want to take actions this year that will affect this year's spending and this year's taxes in a way that will hurt the recovery,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''That's important.''
But Mr. Bernanke also warned about the dangers of the nation's fast-growing debt, which will be increased by $4 trillion or more over 10 years as a result of the tax deal being worked out by Republicans and the White House, and said policy makers must start thinking now about the ''long-term structural deficit.''
After the failed votes in the Senate on Saturday, top Democratic Congressional leaders met at the White House with Mr. Obama, who told them he would not agree to any deal unless it included the extension of jobless aid, which has begun to run out, and also the extension of a number of tax breaks for middle- and lower-income Americans that were included in last year's economic stimulus plan.
In a twist on the Republicans' argument that letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire would amount to a tax increase in a weak economy, Mr. Obama said allowing the stimulus provisions to expire would result in a similar tax increase on working-class Americans who could afford it even less than the high-income people who would benefit from the Republicans' plan.
The Democratic Congressional leaders attended another strategy session at the residence of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has taken a personal hand in the negotiations with Senate Republicans, with whom he has personal relationships from his long tenure as a senator.
Other participants included the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and the budget director, Jacob Lew, who are attending the formal negotiations with Congress on behalf of the White House; the House majority leader, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland; and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who is representing House Democrats in the official talks.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, has made it clear that from the Republican perspective, there is little left to discuss about the tax rates. ''Look, this argument is over,'' Mr. McConnell said in an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. ''The Senate voted yesterday. Every Republican and five Democrats said we're not raising taxes on anybody in the middle of a recession.'' The outcome of those votes was such a foregone conclusion, he said, ''It's almost laughable that we were in session yesterday.''
Still, Mr. McConnell said Republicans were negotiating on several fronts. He said that he understood Mr. Obama would not agree to a permanent extension of the Bush-era tax rates. ''Obviously, the president won't sign a permanent extension,'' he said. ''So we're going to have some kind of extension. I'd like one as long as possible.''
And Mr. McConnell acknowledged that there would be a continuation of jobless aid for the long-term unemployed, though he reiterated the Republican contention that the cost should be offset with reductions in spending elsewhere.
''I think we will extend unemployment compensation,'' he said. ''We've had some very vigorous debates in the Senate. Not about whether to do it but whether to pay for it as opposed to adding it to the deficit. All of those discussions are still under way.''
Many Democrats are enraged that Republicans have so far blocked the effort to extend jobless aid, and are insisting on offsetting the cost even as they refuse to offset the lost revenue from the tax cuts.
''They've said, 'No, we are willing to hold that hostage so that we can give the wealthiest people in the country a bonus tax cut,' '' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: Let's Not Make a Deal

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Back in 2001, former President George W. Bush pulled a fast one. He wanted to enact an irresponsible tax cut, largely for the benefit of the wealthiest Americans. But there were Senate rules in place designed to prevent that kind of irresponsibility. So Mr. Bush evaded the rules by making the tax cut temporary, with the whole thing scheduled to expire on the last day of 2010.
The plan, of course, was to come back later and make the thing permanent, never mind the impact on the deficit. But that never happened. And so here we are, with 2010 almost over and nothing resolved. 
Democrats have tried to push a compromise: let tax cuts for the wealthy expire, but extend tax cuts for the middle class. Republicans, however, are having none of it. They have been filibustering Democratic attempts to separate tax cuts that mainly benefit a tiny group of wealthy Americans from those that mainly help the middle class. It's all or nothing, they say: all the Bush tax cuts must be extended. What should Democrats do?
The answer is that they should just say no. If G.O.P. intransigence means that taxes rise at the end of this month, so be it.
Think about the logic of the situation. Right now, the Republicans see themselves as successful blackmailers, holding a clear upper hand. President Obama, they believe, wouldn't dare preside over a broad tax increase while the economy is depressed. And they therefore believe that he will give in to their demands.
But while raising taxes when unemployment is high is a bad thing, there are worse things. And a cold, hard look at the consequences of giving in to the G.O.P. now suggests that saying no, and letting the Bush tax cuts expire on schedule, is the lesser of two evils.
Bear in mind that Republicans want to make those tax cuts permanent. They might agree to a two- or three-year extension -- but only because they believe that this would set up the conditions for a permanent extension later. And they may well be right: if tax-cut blackmail works now, why shouldn't it work again later?
America, however, cannot afford to make those cuts permanent. We're talking about almost $4 trillion in lost revenue just over the next decade; over the next 75 years, the revenue loss would be more than three times the entire projected Social Security shortfall. So giving in to Republican demands would mean risking a major fiscal crisis -- a crisis that could be resolved only by making savage cuts in federal spending.
And we're not talking about government programs nobody cares about: the only way to cut spending enough to pay for the Bush tax cuts in the long run would be to dismantle large parts of Social Security and Medicare.
So the potential cost of giving in to Republican demands is high. What about the costs of letting the tax cuts expire? To be sure, letting taxes rise in a depressed economy would do damage -- but not as much as many people seem to think.
A few months ago, the Congressional Budget Office released a report on the impact of various tax options. A two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts, it estimated, would lower the unemployment rate next year by between 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points compared with what it would be if the tax cuts were allowed to expire; the effect would be about twice as large in 2012. Those are significant numbers, but not huge -- certainly not enough to justify the apocalyptic rhetoric one often hears about what will happen if the tax cuts are allowed to end on schedule.
Oh, and what about confidence? I've been skeptical about claims that budget deficits hurt the economy even in the short run, because they undermine confidence in the government's long-run solvency. Advanced countries, I've argued, have a lot of fiscal leeway. But anything that makes permanent extension of obviously irresponsible tax cuts more likely also sends a strong signal to investors: it says, ''Hey, we aren't really an advanced country; we're a banana republic!'' And that can't be good for the economy.
Last but not least: if Democrats give in to the blackmailers now, they'll just face more demands in the future. As long as Republicans believe that Mr. Obama will do anything to avoid short-term pain, they'll have every incentive to keep taking hostages. If the president will endanger America's fiscal future to avoid a tax increase, what will he give to avoid a government shutdown?
So Mr. Obama should draw a line in the sand, right here, right now. If Republicans hold out, and taxes go up, he should tell the nation the truth, and denounce the blackmail attempt for what it is.
Yes, letting taxes go up would be politically risky. But giving in would be risky, too -- especially for a president whom voters are starting to write off as a man too timid to take a stand. Now is the time for him to prove them wrong.

HEADLINE: A Bleak Budget Outlook for Public Broadcasters

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
In less than four weeks, NJN, the public radio and television network owned by New Jersey, will run out of state money to operate. Without a last-minute intervention, its outlets will go off the air on Dec. 31, and NJN's 130 employees have already received layoff notices.
With plenty of competing options being floated to reinvent NJN, no one really expects it to go dark in the long term. Last week, Gov. Chris Christie told The Star-Ledger in Newark that he expected to delay the cuts in order to give interested parties time to come up with a plan. NJN had been receiving about $11 million a year in state subsidies, including $4 million as part of its $18 million operating budget. 
But the brinkmanship underscores a difficult reality for public broadcasters. Even as they nervously wait to see whether Republicans carry through on threats to cut their federal financing, many are already grappling with deep cuts at the state level.
The cuts have already taken their toll in Pennsylvania, where last year the elimination of nearly 90 percent of the state's $8 million for public stations led to layoffs and the disappearance of local programs like WPSU-TV's ''Scholastic Scrimmage'' quiz show for high school students.
Losing the show hit many rural communities particularly hard, said Ted Krichels, the general manager of Penn State Public Broadcasting, which operates WPSU. His station's loss of $1 million a year in state money ''affected short-term our ability to be community-responsive,'' he said, adding that local production was particularly labor-intensive.
Other states, including Utah, South Carolina and Idaho, have already reduced public broadcasting subsidies, and public money may be cut in Mississippi and Virginia, too. Two years ago, New York's public broadcasters faced a 50 percent reduction that was changed to 20 percent, and they had no cuts last year.
The state-level cuts are part of a broader tough economic environment for stations, which also raise money from individual donors, foundations and corporate underwriting.
From 2008 to 2009, nonfederal support of public television stations declined an estimated $260 million, said Mark Erstling, a senior vice president at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which administers federal money. For 2010, the public radio and television stations that the corporation surveyed were expecting to lose 14 percent of their overall revenue, he said.
''We're projecting for 2010 through 2013 that the economy will recover and stations will lag,'' he said. ''Every source of income they have other than, so far, federal, has declined.''
So far, he said, stations have made their way through the recession by cutting discretionary items and staff. Some operators, including the University of Michigan, have sold off stations. In November, Pittsburgh's WQED-TV sold a secondary commercial station it owned to Ion Media Networks for $3 million.
But even as stations adjust to harsh new realities, some public broadcasters see opportunity. The Pennsylvania cuts intensified talks among several broadcasters in the state about reducing overhead by sharing some operations and programs, Mr. Krichels said.
Mr. Erstling said that in New Jersey, which has overlapping signals from Philadelphia and New York City, ''I think there's enormous opportunities to be had.'' The corporation recently offered $20 million in nationwide incentives for overlapping stations that agreed to merge or collaborate.
In 1992, New York's WNET-TV proposed assuming NJN's management, but was dismissed as an outsider. Today WNET.org, which owns Thirteen and WLIW21, is again part of talks about NJN's future.
Neal Shapiro, president and chief executive of WNET.org, said: ''We believe that whatever happens should be New Jersey-centric and the licenses should stay with the state. But we think what we can bring is some expertise and economies of scale as an added ingredient to make something happen that is achievable, economical and journalistically of value.''
WNYC of New York has been part of the talks on the radio side. ''We're happy to help in any way,'' said Laura Walker, president and chief executive of WNYC Public Radio. ''An independent public radio in whatever form could be very strong and could really serve New Jersey better.''
Indeed, Ms. Walker says the three WNYC-owned stations -- WNYC-AM, WNYC-FM and WQXR -- already attract the largest public radio audience in New Jersey, and WNYC has committed to increasing its coverage of state issues. WNYC, which was sold by New York City in 1997, is often held up as an example by those who believe stations are better off not being government-owned.
''There's no doubt that being independent has been extraordinarily good for WNYC,'' Ms. Walker said, ''most importantly for the listeners and the users.''
Some in New Jersey are opposed to seeing outsiders come in. Janice Selinger, acting executive director of NJN, said she could envision cutting costs by having back offices work together but would be opposed to giving up control of programming.
''No matter how well-intentioned New York and Pennsylvania media may be, they're not going to cover New Jersey the way we do,'' she said. ''It's important to have a voice for the state of New Jersey.''

HEADLINE: CITY ROOM; A Butcher In Therapy, With Chin Now Up

BYLINE: By JULIE BESONEN

 BODY:
Six months or so ago, Jeffrey Ruhalter was a butcher in a deep funk, grappling with a sinking family business that dated back to his German great-great-grandfather in 1870. Jeffrey's Meat Market is, he says, the last original tenant at the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side, opened by his grandfather in 1940. The dynamics of change, along with the global economic downturn, had blindsided him.
In the past year, nine restaurants he supplied with meat closed, one right after the other. ''How do you collect from restaurants that have closed?'' Mr. Ruhalter asked. He was in the process of laying off three of his seven butchers. 
He was so depressed, psychologically and fiscally, that he discontinued Day of the Rose, a random holiday when he handed out 20 dozen roses to women at the market. ''All you had to do was breathe if you were a woman; 2 years old or 82 years old, you got a rose,'' he said. ''I couldn't afford it anymore.''
By midsummer, Mr. Ruhalter, 54, was seriously considering closing.
So he went into therapy to see if he could reinvent himself.
After about six weeks of treatment, Mr. Ruhalter had gained some clarity and realized what he had going for him.
''What am I?'' he asked as he stood in his stall last week, surrounded by the odd assortment of 31 portraits local artists had painted of him - smiling Jeffreys, sad Jeffreys, bloodstained Jeffreys, a beheaded Jeffrey. ''I'm someone's butcher. That's what I am. My grandfather and father hated being butchers, but I love it. It's not over till the fat lady sings, and then I'll kick her in the teeth.''
After the epiphany, Mr. Ruhalter slipped off his white apron, put on a black suit and a colorful tie and hit the streets. For several years, he had run an emergency meat-supply business - its name is a colorful variant on ''Who Messed Up the Order'' - for restaurants that needed last-minute provisions.
If business was not coming to him, he decided, he was going to go and get it. ''I'm in the middle of a million restaurants, and I figured there's got to be a way,'' he said. ''I walked in cold to one and then another and another, found the chef and said: 'I am Jeffrey. I'm your local butcher. I want your business. What can I do for you?' '' The result: 65 new orders.
Mr. Ruhalter, who has offered butchering classes for a few years, added a sausage-making class that was an immediate hit, at $75 a pop.
''Sausages have become a major player,'' he said. ''I can custom-make them fat free and salt free. I make them from lamb, pork, veal, chicken, turkey, venison, wild boar, elk, all natural, organic,'' he rattled off. ''They're selling out.''
It also helped that the Essex Street Market recently extended its hours to 7 p.m. instead of 6 p.m. and is now open on Sundays, bringing in extra money.
Between the therapy and the new revenue streams, Mr. Ruhalter has gotten much of his groove back, and he has decided to remain in business.
Though Day of the Rose remains on hiatus, female customers still get special attention from Mr. Ruhalter, who wears his long brown hair in a ponytail and has two hoop earrings on his left ear. ''Swashbuckling,'' is how he describes his look.
A longtime practice he has maintained, despite everything, is paper-wrapping a handful of thick-cut bacon for each new customer. If he knows it is your birthday, it might be a free steak.
Last week, a young blonde stepped up to the counter and seems uncertain about buying a goose, saying she would check back.
''Dear lady, when you make up your mind, call me; and if my wife answers, hang up right away and call back five minutes later,'' he told her.
Mr. Ruhalter, who has no wife, recently moved to an apartment on Ludlow Street to be within walking distance of the market. ''I write the check on the first and stop crying by the third,'' he said. His own sizable rent has made him fully aware of how gentrified the Lower East Side has become since his grandfather's day, how much the culture has changed.
''Everybody goes to Whole Foods,'' he said. ''Women aren't staying home cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner anymore. They're not having five kids. They're having one. Everybody works now. They come home exhausted.''
Recognizing a need, he has revved up Dinner by Jeffrey, fully seasoned meals ready to pop in the oven, starting at $12 for two. ''It's a service for women and it's available only by invitation,'' he said. ''Because if I don't like you, make your own damn dinner.''
Mr. Ruhalter, slim and tautly muscled, eats little himself. To relax at night, he watercolors and writes poetry. Over the years, he has curated several art shows at his shop, assembling paintings and sculptures behind the glassed-in meat cases. Once he even put on a hat show, displaying a local milliner's wares on mannequin heads along the counter. His permanent collection includes a rendition of a bacon dollar bill, a painting of a hamburger crowned with a golden halo and a lacquered bacon headdress, like something Bob Mackie would design for Cher.
One wall alone holds six paintings of the butcher. He pointed out his favorite, by the artist Linda Griggs. ''My chin is raised, I've got the apron around my neck, I look proud, as if I'm the king of a company, a C.E.O.'' He gazed at it for a moment, his chin raised, then smiled. ''Narcissism, it's a sickness. But my therapist says I'm getting better.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Trove of Ancient Silver Said to Be Stolen Returns to Its Home in Sicily

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

 BODY:
AIDONE, Italy -- They came in throngs. On Friday afternoon hundreds of residents from this tiny hilltop town in eastern Sicily excitedly trekked up the steep slope to the town's archaeology museum to celebrate the return to Aidone of a treasure trove that was buried nearby some 2,200 years ago and illegally whisked away in more recent times.
This year this cache of 16 Hellenistic silver-gilt objects known as the Morgantina silver was on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. For decades archaeologists, magistrates and eventually the Italian government had attempted to convince the museum that the pieces had been illegally excavated 30 years ago from Morgantina, an ancient Greek settlement whose ruins lie next to Aidone. 
Their perseverance -- as well as increasingly incontrovertible evidence -- paid off, and the silver hoard was included in a 2006 accord between the Italian government and the museum for the return of several objects that Italians said had been looted from Italian soil. The silver was returned to Italy in February, but only now has it been restored to Sicily, installed in a freshly whitewashed hall alongside more mundane objects -- a brass comb, an ancient coin, a large terra-cotta altar -- also found in the house where archaeologists believe the silver was probably buried in 211 B.C. when Morgantina fell to the Romans.
''They're beautiful works of art, they tempted a lot of people, but it's right that they've come back to their proper home,'' said one visitor, Alfredo Scivoli, who opened a bed-and-breakfast here in April, in anticipation of the tourists that local officials hope will be drawn here by the silver.
At a packed conference on the return of the treasure earlier in the day Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, the former superintendent of Pompeii and the first Italian scholar officially to study the silver at the Met more than two decades ago, said most of the collection dated from the third century B.C. and was used for religious purposes and for banquets. He said that it probably had been collected for its material value rather than for its artistic value, and together the items weigh only about 10 pounds.
Objects used for symposia, as the ancient Greeks called their drinking banquets, include a ladle with a dog's-head handle (typical of Morgantina) and various drinking bowls. Scholars believe that the silver objects had been hidden inside two kraters (large bowls for mixing wine) decorated with feet depicting theatrical masks, and that secreting them away probably kept them safe for posterity.
''The silver can perhaps shed light on the brutal, dramatic circumstances of the final years of the Second Punic War and, seen within the framework of the house, we get a sense of the art and the material culture of Hellenistic Sicily,'' said Malcolm Bell III, professor emeritus of art history and archaeology at the University of Virginia and the director of excavations at Morgantina. ''They have truly been recontextualized, and that is really important.''
For decades too Dr. Bell was a leading crusader for the return of the treasure, and in Aidone, where his excavations brought seasonal work for many residents, he is very much a hero. ''This is a very happy moment and deeply satisfying,'' he said in an interview.
For Aidone the silver's return means much more than righting a wrong.
For an economically depressed town that offers few employment opportunities and has seen droves of younger people seek their fortunes elsewhere, the Morgantina treasure presents new hope for the future.
Last year the Aidone Archaeological Museum became the permanent home to two archaic acroliths (statues usually made with wooden trunks but stone heads and extremities) that had also been looted from Morgantina. They had once been owned by Maurice Tempelsman, a New York businessman. The two statues -- representing the mother-and-daughter goddesses Demeter and Persephone -- now sit majestically enthroned, draped in evocative bespoke tunics by the Sicilian designer Marella Ferrera.
Another boost to the collection will come next year when the J. Paul Getty Museum's villa in Malibu, Calif., returns a cult statue of a goddess that it bought in 1988 for $18 million. It too was probably looted from Morgantina. That statue -- which has been traditionally identified as Aphrodite, though there is a growing debate over whom it personifies -- will be disassembled for transport and then reassembled in its new home. In return Sicily will loan several works to the Getty.
''This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Mayor Filippo Gangi of Aidone. The ''extraordinary triptych'' of artworks, he said, could ''trigger an unprecedented economic development'' in Aidone, exploiting too the town's proximity to the Roman Villa del Casale, which boasts more than 4,200 square yards of late Roman mosaics and is already one of the most visited sites in Sicily.
A new outlet mall in Enna, the provincial capital, is also expected to draw crowds, said Sebastiano Missineo, the regional councilor for cultural heritage and Sicilian identity. ''It's all bound to generate wealth for the territory,'' he said.
But not so long ago many locals moonlighted as tomb robbers. Mayor Gangi said it was ''a once-tolerated sport,'' and more than one person at the museum on Friday mused whether the original thieves, who have never been formally identified, would show up.
The new exhibition at the museum includes a 100-lira coin from 1978 found at the so-called House of Eupolemos, the modest abode from which archaeologists believe the silver was stolen. The coin suggested a time frame for the theft. The Met acquired the silver in two installments, in 1981 and 1982, for a total of $2.74 million from Robert Hecht, now 91, an antiquities dealer in New York and Paris who is on trial in Rome on charges of conspiring to deal in looted artifacts. (Silvio Raffiotta, the magistrate who led the legal attack on the Met 20 years ago, admitted that Italy's ''negligence and silence'' were as much to blame as tomb robbers for the silver ending up in the United States.)
According to the 2006 accord the Met shares joint custody of the silver, which will travel between New York and Aidone every four years for exhibit. When the silver came to Italy in February, the Met received a recently excavated 20-piece Roman dining set from the Pompeii region.
The Morgantina silver is set to return to New York in 2014, but several archaeologists here suggested that the fragile artifacts were put at risk every time they traveled. This did not stop the Sicilian regional assembly from showcasing the set at the Shanghai World Expo this year.
The Aidone museum is small, without space for temporary exhibitions or multimedia stations, and roads to the town badly need repairs, said Enrico Caruso, who in September was appointed director of the new Archaeological Park of Morgantina. But all of its treasures belong in Aidone, he said, adding, ''Here they are not orphans.''
Correction: December 10, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about a looted trove of ancient silver that was returned to the town of Aidone in Sicily misidentified the government entity that sent the silver for display at the Shanghai World Expo this year. It was the Sicilian regional assembly, not the Italian government.

HEADLINE: MetroCard Blazes Mother's Path to a Job

BYLINE: By CHANNING JOSEPH

 BODY:
When Jessica Torres is nervous, words flutter from her mouth like butterflies in springtime, flitting in every direction. As she giggles, short phrases fly from her lips, colliding with each other, trailing off or suddenly reappearing.
''It makes me feel like ...,'' she begins. And ''honestly, you know, like ...,'' she begins again, a split second later.
All the while, her hands emphatically slice and grab at the air, as if to catch her wayward words and put them back in some kind of order before they escape forever. 
It is difficult not to smile and laugh with Ms. Torres, 22, as she talks about her young son, D'Anthony, her love of blue jeans and bargain-priced earrings, or her dream of one day owning a funeral home. (As for working with dead bodies, she said with a chuckle that she ''wouldn't mind.'')
But when her swirling sentences begin to settle down, her serious side reveals itself.
''I was just so scared,'' Ms. Torres said, recalling a moment in 2006 when all the right words did escape her grasp.
For two days, tension had hung like smoke over the three-bedroom apartment that she and her mother shared in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Ms. Torres's father lives in Puerto Rico and visits New York only once a year, so her mother is the only parent who has been a consistent part of her life. But for two days, that parent had stopped speaking to her.
''I was packing my things,'' Ms. Torres remembered, ''because I thought she was going to throw me out.''
Indeed, her mother, Freda Torres, 57 -- a Pentecostalist who attends church every day and is adamantly opposed to abortion -- had warned her repeatedly about the risks of unprotected sex and the hardships of teenage parenthood. Yet the younger Ms. Torres, unmarried and 17, was pregnant.
No words seemed appropriate to break two days of weighty silence, so the normally talkative Ms. Torres simply placed a sonogram of her 3-month-old fetus on the pink sofa where her mother often sat to watch soap operas. And she waited.
''That's when she came to me,'' Ms. Torres recalled, adding that her mother finally told her reassuringly, '' 'We'll get through this.' ''
Even with her mother's support, the last four years have not been easy for Ms. Torres. She and D'Anthony's father, a sheet-metal worker, are no longer together.
And though he has been helping out financially, the primary child care responsibilities have fallen on Ms. Torres and her mother, who lives on disability payments.
After dropping out of high school, Jessica Torres spent two years supporting her son and herself with jobs in retail sales before obtaining her high school equivalency diploma in October 2008.
Last June, after a bout of unemployment, Ms. Torres discovered Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow, a beneficiary agency of the Community Service Society, one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With a grant of $89, she was able to buy a one-month unlimited MetroCard and to participate in the agency's five-week job-training program, which included classes in business math, business English, office procedures and other subjects.
When she completed the training, Ms. Torres was hired for a paid internship at the Bushwick, Brooklyn, office of Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow.
There, she greeted clients and helped with marketing, fund-raising and administrative duties. Those who have worked with Ms. Torres say she has gained confidence and a new sense of pride.
''I think she has come to realize her abilities and her self-worth,'' said Dani Smejkal, a senior counselor.
But Ms. Torres's internship ended nearly two months ago, so she is again hunting for a job. Still, she is optimistic about her prospects.
And when she reflects on her current circumstances -- and the people who motivate her most to succeed -- her words float into place easily.
''It's just me, my mom and my baby,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In Ivory Coast, a Second Government Takes Shape

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from the United Nations.

 BODY:
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- The winner of last week's presidential election set up a parallel government on Sunday while the incumbent refused to give up power, raising the stakes in a political standoff that threatens to tip this nation back into civil war.
Thabo Mbeki, the former South African president, arrived here Sunday to mediate the dispute, but there was little to suggest he would find middle ground, while militants on both sides were sending signals that a return to armed conflict in this West African nation could not be ruled out. 
Alassane Ouattara, whose victory was recognized by the United States, France and African nations, formed a government in a lagoon-side hotel where the United Nations has stepped up security. His prime minister, Guillaume Soro, appointed an emergency cabinet of 13 ministers on Sunday night, his spokesman said.
Three armored personnel carriers guarded the Golf Hotel, where Mr. Ouattara's government assembled. A United Nations spokesman said that about 2,000 additional peacekeepers had been moved to Abidjan since the election and that they would guard the hotel as long as Mr. Ouattara needed them.
The incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo, staged an elaborate inauguration ceremony at the presidential palace this weekend and appointed his own prime minister on Sunday, despite being declared the loser in last Sunday's presidential election by the country's top election official and the United Nations. He appears to have the support of the state bureaucracy and the military, which patrolled the streets of Abidjan on Sunday.
''Gbagbo is giving all the signals that he's not going to back down by any other means'' but force, said Michael McGovern, a West Africa specialist at Yale. ''This could be the nightmare scenario that would set the conditions for a real all-out war to take place.''
''The fact is, Gbagbo is pushing so far, he really risks tipping the whole situation into renewed violence. It's absolutely double or nothing.''
Mr. Mbeki met with both men on Sunday but gave no indication of the prospect for fruitful negotiations. He said the situation was ''very serious'' and warned against a return to the civil war that ended here in 2003.
''We're trying to talk to everybody,'' he said. ''We're listening. That's our task here.''
But Mr. Ouattara said there was nothing to discuss.
''I told President Mbeki I am the president of Ivory Coast, and it is in that capacity that I am receiving him,'' Mr. Ouattara said. He said he asked Mr. Mbeki to urge Mr. Gbagbo to ''step down as he should after losing an election.''
Abidjan, the nation's economic capital, was quiet on Sunday, with no renewal of Saturday's anti-Gbagbo demonstrations. Young activists in Mr. Ouattara's camp said they were under orders to hold back while diplomats tried to reach a resolution.
But tens of thousands of people demonstrated against Mr. Gbagbo on Sunday in the northern city of Bouake, the stronghold of a 2002 rebellion that split the country into sovereign northern and southern zones, according to a spokesman for the rebels there and to news reports. Mr. Ouattara's prime minister, Mr. Soro, is also the secretary general of the rebel movement in the north, which continues to be well armed, according to analysts.
United Nations officials said they were pinning their hopes on Mr. Mbeki, who was representing the African Union as a special envoy here. The United Nations Security Council, which has yet to make a statement on the dispute, is expected to meet on the issue on Tuesday.
The military announced Sunday that on Monday it would reopen the country's borders, which have been sealed for over a week.
Foreign broadcasts and text messages were still jammed, however. Shops were closed, and economic life ground to a virtual standstill. Mounds of trash are piled up even in better-off neighborhoods, and groups of young men approach guests outside a downtown hotel, saying they are hungry and pleading for money.
Fires continued to smolder in the Treichville neighborhood here, where activists spoke Sunday of a brutal combined assault the day before by state security forces and militant youth gangs allied to Mr. Gbagbo. A doctor at the clinic in Treichville said about 116 were wounded, eight seriously, by what he described as ''concussion grenades'' used by the security forces.
The doctor, who would give his name only as Dr. Cisse, and others said pro-Gbagbo militants of a muscular student union, known by the French abbreviation Fesci, had acted in concert with the security forces. He and others said the Fesci members beat those deemed to be from the north.
''We are going to be demonstrating until Gbagbo leaves power,'' said Kadi Konate, a pro-Ouattara youth leader in Treichville.
Elsewhere in the city, other Ouattara activists concurred. ''If this can't be resolved in a diplomatic manner, we'll just have to see,'' a top youth leader in the Ouattara camp, Ben Sylla, said Sunday in Adjame, a stronghold of Mr. Ouattara in Abidjan, declining to specify what the next steps might be.
But he ruled out a power-sharing agreement.
''Gbagbo has lost the election,'' he said. ''Everyone agrees: Gbagbo has lost.''

HEADLINE: Waning Support for College Radio Sets Off a Debate

BYLINE: By JOHN VORWALD

 BODY:
Like many college radio stations across the country, Rice University's KTRU and Vanderbilt University's WRVU play a broad swath of music -- from undiscovered indie bands and obscure blues acts to '60s garage rock and '80s postpunk. It's a mix largely absent from commercial broadcasts, and students active in radio say their stations add distinct voices to their cities' broadcast landscape.
But as colleges across the country look for ways to tighten budgets amid recession-induced shortfalls, some administrators -- most recently in the South -- have focused on college radio, leading even well-endowed universities to sell off their FM stations. That trend was felt this summer at Rice and Vanderbilt, among the most prominent of Southern universities, stirring debate about the viability of broadcast radio, the reach of online broadcasting and the value of student broadcast programming. 
''We play music that you won't find on any other Houston radio station'' said Joey Yang, a junior at Rice and station manager for KTRU. ''KTRU's mission is to broadcast exactly what you can't find elsewhere on the dial.''
Scott Cardone, a sophomore disk jockey at WRVU with a two-hour electric blues show, pointed to the potential void in Nashville if Vanderbilt's FM signal were to be sold. ''The community will lose what probably is the last radio station playing anything other than country, Christian or Top 40 in the whole city,'' he said. ''You can't hear the music that we play anywhere else.''
At the center of public discussion are ''student habits'' -- or whether students are actually tuning in to the universities' FM signals.
In September, Vanderbilt Student Communications, the corporate body that oversees Vanderbilt University media, released a statement announcing it would explore the migration of its student-run radio station to exclusively online programming. The exploration, which was voted on by a board of five at-large students and three faculty members, was a response to ''changing student habits and evolving economic challenges,'' according to a statement by the group.
In August, Rice announced the decision to sell student-founded station KTRU -- its 50,000-watt FM frequency, broadcast tower and F.C.C. license -- to the University of Houston, for $9.5 million. In a statement, David W. Leebron, the president of Rice, called the station a ''vastly underutilized resource.''
The announcements at Rice and Vanderbilt highlight a stream of college radio station closings in recent years, including KTXT at Texas Tech University in 2008 and Augustana College's KAUR in South Dakota in 2009.
While officials at both Rice and Vanderbilt emphasize that the stations will continue to broadcast online, Mr. Yang believes the loss of a terrestrial signal will effectively delegitimize KTRU.
''As a 50,000-watt station that can be heard all across Houston, there's a sense of responsibility to the community,'' he said. ''When you lose a terrestrial footprint in Houston -- anyone can put out a signal that's on the Internet -- it takes away the legitimacy of what we're trying to do.''
Despite obvious parallels between KTRU and WRVU, Chris Carroll, director of student media at Vanderbilt Student Communications, draws a stark contrast between the situations at the two universities. At Vanderbilt, he said, ''what's happening, really, is a big public discussion about is this a good idea or not, and there's no conclusion to that yet.'' Rice, he said, made the decision to sell KTRU behind closed doors -- without student input.
Mr. Carroll, who does not vote on the organization's board, contends that students just don't listen to terrestrial radio anymore.
''We will pull a random sample of Vanderbilt undergrads -- of 500 or so at a time. And what we've found is that these students aren't listening to radio at all. It's not just WRVU,'' he said. Instead, students are listening on mobile devices like smartphones and laptops, both of which are more readily serviced by the Internet, he said.
Mr. Cardone acknowledges that WRVU's audience may be thinner on campus than off, but he believes the station justifies its value as one of the only relevant connections between the students and the city. According to Arbitron, a media and marketing research firm that measures local radio audiences, the station reaches just over 30,000 people each week in greater Nashville.
After a tumultuous summer, groups focused on saving the stations have mobilized at both campuses. Both have Web sites -- savektru.org and savewrvu.org -- and Facebook pages to gather comments and provide updates.
Friends of KTRU, a group opposed to selling the station, retained the Paul Hastings firm to represent it, and on Friday, the group filed a petition to deny with the F.C.C., claiming the sale was not in the public interest.
At Vanderbilt, Mr. Carroll says the WRVU page on vandymedia.org, an umbrella site for the campus student media, has garnered more than 700 comments. He says he will sort them into common themes before the board reviews them early next year.

HEADLINE: On the Express Train to Hell and Other Sonic Journeys

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
The American Composers Orchestra has had to scale back its operations in recent seasons. This essential freelance ensemble, which has championed American music for 34 years, used to present up to five concerts a season at Carnegie Hall. Like many arts institutions facing economic hard times, it has adjusted. These days it offers a playfully billed series called Orchestra Underground at Zankel Hall, downstairs from Carnegie's main hall.
Still, the concert on Friday night, the second of three this season, expertly conducted by the orchestra's music director, George Manahan (best known as the music director of New York City Opera), offered an exhilarating program, with an Ives classic and four premieres. Orchestra Underground has found its audience. The hall was packed, the performances were bracing, and the composers were cheered, proving that downsizing does not have to be a downer. 
Titled ''A Time and Place,'' the program offered works inspired by particular periods and settings. It was a great idea to begin with Ives's short tone poem ''Central Park in the Dark,'' which evokes sensations and sounds that might be experienced while sitting on a park bench on a summer night. As sustained quiet, thick-textured string chords convey the overall calm of the scene, urban sounds intrude, with a passing fire engine, pianos playing ragtime from nearby taverns and more.
This was a perfect prelude to Ryan Francis's ''High Line,'' which does something similar. In an engaging short video introducing the piece (I wish there had been videos for all the new works), Mr. Francis explained that the score was inspired by the High Line in Manhattan, which turned abandoned elevated railroad tracks into an elongated pedestrian park. Mr. Francis suggests the ambience of the High Line through hovering chords played by patchy strings with swelling winds and brass. But bursts of activity -- riffs and arpeggios from the marimba, vibraphone and two pianos -- keep jostling the bucolic harmonies.
Douglas J. Cuomo's ''Black Diamond Express Train to Hell,'' which came next, uses a scratchy 1927 recording of a fiery sermon delivered by a Chicago preacher as the sonic centerpiece of a 13-minute orchestral work. With its richly metaphorical language (warning of a hellbound train making stops at Deceiversville and Drunkardsville), the sermon is a musical mix of speech and song. Mr. Cuomo chops up and repeats words and phrases to create a vocal part around which the orchestra plays fractured marches, bursting chords and spans of astringent harmonies.
The work's prominent solo cello part was played by the brilliant Maya Beiser. But the energy almost stopped during a long, fitful cello solo, even though Ms. Beiser played it with intensity.
The young composer Christopher Trapani writes that he was trying to evoke the allure of the West -- country guitars, all things Californian and even West African music -- in his 15-minute ''Westering.'' Though I was at a loss to detect those myriad inspirations in the music, I really liked the piece, almost a concerto, featuring hexaphonic guitar, an electric guitar with separate pickups for each of the six strings. By playing the strings, the soloist (here Mr. Trapani) activates signals that emit transformed guitar sounds: repeated chords, arpeggios, wah-wah whines. The music evolves in long waves, with the orchestra building to big, lush chords that shatter, sending scattered remnants every which way.
The composer Jerome Kitzke has long been inspired by the northern Great Plains and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Why his new piece is called ''The Fire at 4 a.m.'' his program notes did not say. It is like a celebratory, clattering ritual, with fragments of tunes and pounding rhythms.
The orchestra players have to shout and sputter bits of words, sing and sigh. Though I was not so taken with it, the players seemed to enjoy themselves immensely, and Mr. Kitzke won a nice ovation from the Underground Orchestra audience.

HEADLINE: For Federal Employees, a Feeling of Being Targets in the Budget Wars

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Iyauta Moore may be many things -- a single mother raised by a single mother in the South Bronx, a 34-year-old woman with a master's degree in public administration from American University, a top-level government employee who makes a little over $100,000 a year -- but she bristles at the notion that she is just another overpaid, underworked, cosseted bureaucrat.
''What I do here involves creating something that doesn't exist,'' she said of her job at the Department of Education, where she is establishing a group to help oversee all of the department's grants. ''That's not pushing paper.'' 
Ms. Moore, who is a member of the American Federation of Government Employees, added: ''We're out and we're making a difference in the community. And I don't really think you can put a dollar figure on that.''
But as politicians intent on cutting the federal budget try to do just that, career government employees are feeling besieged.
During the midterm elections, the federal work force became a target for Republicans in particular. In a speech in Cleveland, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the top Republican in the House, called it ''nonsense'' that ''taxpayers are subsidizing the fattened salaries and pensions of federal bureaucrats.'' And last week, President Obama proposed a two-year freeze on the salaries of federal employees.
''I think federal employees are definitely getting a bad rap and definitely have become political punching bags,'' said William R. Dougan, the president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 blue- and white-collar government workers. ''It's hard for people, until they actually experience not having some of the services that the government provides, to understand what the government does.''
Mathew Kolodzie, 31, is a Department of Defense firefighter at the Watervliet Arsenal near Albany. He works two days on, followed by three days off, and is required to work a minimum of 144 hours over a two-week pay period. This year, he spent Thanksgiving at the firehouse.
He is paid $48,113 a year, which he says is enough for him and his family to get by; he and his wife have one daughter and ''one on the way.'' But, he said, ''This pay freeze isn't the greatest timing, especially around Christmas.''
Carl Houtman, 49, is a research chemical engineer for the Forest Service in Madison, Wis. As an upper-level government employee, he makes around $100,000 a year, but says that while his job is equivalent to that of a university professor, ''a typical professor at my level is making $150,000 a year, and in private companies, I would be able to double by salary.''
Still, he likes the freedom his government job affords -- the flexible schedule that allows him to attend his children's concerts and teach a tai chi class, the ability to ''tell the truth, not filtered by whether or not my company is going to die, or whether or not I'm going to get tenure.'' He considers his job secure.
Mr. Houtman methodically logs in 40 hours per week on a time sheet, although, he says, he often works closer to 50.
Critics point out that the number of federal employees making over $150,000 has doubled under Mr. Obama, but that fact is somewhat misleading. In 2008, thousands of federal employees were held under a $149,000 pay cap, and in 2009 when Congress raised that by 2.9 percent, it bumped a significant number of salaries just over $150,000.
And the government has worried for years that a wave of retirements is about to hit, possibly costing dearly in talent, experience and institutional memory.
The overall executive branch civilian work force, excluding the Postal Service, stood at 2,094,000 in 2009, according to Office of Personnel Management data -- roughly where it was in the 1970s at the end of the Nixon administration. It grew under President Ronald Reagan, declined throughout the administrations of the first President Bush and Bill Clinton, and now stands roughly between the numbers for the Reagan and Clinton years.
Government jobs can pay well, but comparisons with the private sector are complex.
''At the top, the government is not competitive at all; it pays much less,'' said John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group. ''At the start of one's career, it tends to pay below. In the middle, sometimes it's about right. And for blue-collar and clerical jobs, the government is paying at market or above.''
Some say there are fewer performance incentives in government employment.
''Once you're past your probationary year, there's basically no reward for performance,'' said James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization.
And indeed, some federal workers say they are happy with the status quo.
Lance Hamann, 40, works as a purchasing agent for the Department of Agriculture at a vocational jobs center in Puxico, Mo. His salary is a bit more than $40,000. He is the president of Local 1840 of the federal employees federation.
''To me, there's a rhyme and reason to all the red tape the government does have,'' he said, ''so I try my best to be patient with the red tape, knowing that's just how the government runs.''
He says he is happy where he is professionally, with a decent paying job in the town where he grew up.
''I don't necessarily want to move up the ladder, per se, and accept the additional responsibilities,'' he said, ''even though that may come with additional pay.''

HEADLINE: Iran Claims Advance With Uranium From Its Own Mine

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Iran on Sunday claimed for the first time to have used domestically mined uranium ore to make the material needed for uranium enrichment. It called the step a major advance in its atomic program, sending a defiant message before a new round of talks on Iran's suspect nuclear activities.
Western experts said the progress appeared to be more symbolic than substantive and did not bear immediately on whether Iran could accelerate its efforts at enriching uranium, which can fuel either reactors or atom bombs. 
But Iran's successful processing of uranium ore from a domestically mined source, which it has been working on for years, suggested the Iranians had found a way to bypass United Nations sanctions that ban them from importing raw uranium.
The announcement also reflected Iran's intention to show it remains undaunted in its pursuit of nuclear capabilities despite some significant recent setbacks. Those setbacks include increased economic isolation from a range of United Nations sanctions, the mysterious bombing attacks on two Iranian nuclear scientists in Tehran last week and an acknowledgment by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that some of Iran's centrifuges, used to purify uranium, had been successfully singled out by Internet saboteurs using malignant software.
The White House said Sunday that Iran's announcement was not unexpected but that it reinforced international suspicions about Iran's motives for enriching uranium at all.
In Tehran on Sunday, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's nuclear program, said the country had succeeded for the first time in domestically producing uranium concentrate from uranium ore mined inside Iran. The concentrate, known as yellowcake, is a precursor to the uranium fed into spinning centrifuges for enrichment.
''This means that Iran has become self-sufficient in the entire fuel cycle,'' Mr. Salehi declared. He said at a televised news conference that the announcement meant ''we will be taking part in the negotiations with strength and power.''
Mr. Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said the yellowcake was produced at the Gachin uranium mine in southern Iran and delivered to the uranium conversion facility in the central city of Isfahan for processing into uranium destined for the thousands of centrifuges of Natanz.
Mr. Salehi said the delivery was evidence that last week's mysterious bombings of the Iranian scientists would not slow the country's progress. One of the scientists died and the other was wounded.
The two days of talks that begin Monday in Geneva are the first on Iran's nuclear program in more than a year. Six world powers -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- are seeking reassurances that Tehran's ambitions are peaceful.
Iran bought yellowcake from South Africa in the 1980s, but those supplies are running low.
Even so, Western experts say Iran can keep the centrifuges at its Natanz plant in the desert running for decades because over the years it has converted so much yellowcake to uranium meant for enrichment.
''This is a face-saving announcement,'' David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear proliferation, said in an interview. ''For years, they've been saying that they are mining. So here's finally some proof.''
In a statement, a spokesman for the National Security Council, Mike Hammer, said Iran's yellowcake announcement was ''not unexpected'' given that Iran is now banned from importing the material under United Nations sanctions and that it has worked to develop its own program of mining and indigenous production.
''However,'' he added, ''this calls into further question Iran's intentions and raises additional concerns at a time when Iran needs to address the concerns of the international community.''
Since 2006, the United Nations Security Council has repeatedly called on Iran to halt its program of uranium enrichment and has punished it with four rounds of sanctions. Tehran insists it wants enriched uranium to fuel reactors for making electricity and medical isotopes, while the West fears that it wants the material as a way to fuel atom bombs.
Ahead of the Geneva talks, Mr. Hammer said, the United States and its allies are looking to see if Iran will enter into discussions ''with the seriousness of purpose required to begin to address international concerns.''

John Ditullio is on trial for a double stabbing that wounded a woman and killed a teenager in 2006, and his lawyer successfully argued that his tattoos -- which include a swastika on his neck -- could be distracting or prejudicial to the jurors, which under the law is supposed to consider only the facts presented to them.

HEADLINE: History Museum Sells Pieces Of Its Past, Reviving a Debate

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- A galloping horse weather vane sold for about $20,000, and the cigar store Indians brought in more than $1 million. A Thomas Sully oil painting of Andrew Jackson netted $80,500, and a still life by Raphaelle Peale, part of the family that put portraiture in this city on the map, was auctioned at Christie's for $842,500.
These were just a few of more than 2,000 items quietly sold by the Philadelphia History Museum over the last several years, all part of an effort to cull its collection of 100,000 artifacts and raise money for a $5.8 million renovation of its 1826 building.
In doing so the museum stepped into the quicksand of murky rules, guidelines and ethical strictures meant to discourage museums everywhere from selling collections to pay bills. It is one of the hottest issues in the museum world today. With budgets shrinking in a bad economy, the pressure to generate revenue is growing along with fears that museums are squandering public trusts meant to preserve the artifacts of the past for future generations. 
The National Academy Museum in New York, Fisk University and Brandeis have all recently drawn fire -- and even sanctions -- for selling or planning to sell artworks, and none of them sold as many works as the museum here.
In general art and objects are supposed to be sold only to finance acquisitions, though different museums are governed by different standards. Art museums, regulated by a formal code of the Association of Art Museum Directors, may not sell work for any other reason.
As a history museum, though, this institution -- formally called the Philadelphia History Museum at the Atwater Kent -- is subject to separate, less stringent guidelines put forward by other associations. So museum officials say the installation of new carpet, paint and lighting were all legitimate expenses to be paid from the proceeds under the guidelines of the American Association of Museums, which say that sales can be used for the ''direct care'' of a collection. Adding to the confusion, there is a third set of standards maintained by the American Association for State and Local History permitting proceeds to go toward the ''preservation'' of a collection, a similarly broad term.
The New York State legislature, confronting this maze of precepts, recently considered passing a law that would make selling collections -- the art world term is deaccessioning -- to pay operating expenses illegal. It never made it to the Assembly floor because museums opposed it.
Some museum professionals say that having differing guidelines for art and history museums only fosters confusion at a time when finding any means of raising money is especially appealing.
''This rapidly becomes a slippery slope,'' said Derick Dreher, the director of the Rosenbach Museum & Library in Philadelphia. ''What museum director wouldn't be tempted to say that air-conditioning is absolutely crucial for care of collections? Heating, humidification and dehumidification, similarly. But if we go down this road, we end up paying our gas, electric and water bills -- classic operations costs -- with deaccessioning proceeds.''
But, some argue, museums sometimes have to pare down their collections to remain viable. ''Museums really cannot continue to accumulate and accumulate and accumulate ad infinitum,'' said Janet C. Marstine, founding director of the Insitute of Musuem Ethics at Seton Hall University and now a lecturer and program director at the University of Leicester. ''What does one do with former acquisitions policies that did not make sense, or not having an acquisitions policy, or having so many objects they can't care for or don't really fit within their purpose?''
The Philadelphia History Museum, which has been closed for nearly two years for renovations, hopes to finance the completion of the project -- about $1.5 million -- from the sale of ''an artifact'' it would not identify. It views its sales as falling within the history museum guidelines.
''We view the entire reconstruction project as preserving and caring for our largest artifact, the building,'' said Gregory J. Kleiber, the museum's treasurer, ''and making possible the display and conservation under museum-appropriate conditions of the other pieces of our collection.''
The state and local history association -- which serves nearly 4,000 institutions -- said that history museums resist easy definition and therefore make rigid regulation difficult. ''History artifacts include everything from locomotives to artwork -- it's a very broad type of collection -- so it's really hard to set one ethics statement that covers the kaleidoscopic nature of the history collections,'' said Terry Davis, the association's president. ''We intentionally leave our policies -- our ethics statement -- rather loose. Our belief is a board should take the ethics statement and make thoughtful decisions about what's best for the care of their collections.''
Ford W. Bell, the president of the American Association of Museums, acknowledged that his group's policy was ''less clear'' than the one governing art museums, and that whether or not a history museum's sales fit within the guidelines ''is somewhat subjective.''
''In general, we hope that museums will not use the collections as an asset to support the operations of the museum or things that are not directed to collections' care or buying new objects,'' Mr. Bell said.
In selling items, the Philadelphia History Museum's officials say they are trying to maintain their collections responsibly within limited storage capacity and to keep the institution focused on its core purpose. In addition to large-ticket items, the museum has sold relatively minor pieces, like two wooden 19th-century rocking chairs (one in need of caning), which together brought $35, and assorted lithographs of New York City from the mid-19th century, which went for $12.50. Some objects have been given to other institutions.
''We've collected a lot of things over the years, many of which have very little to do with our mission as a history museum,'' said Mr. Kleiber, the treasurer, who was president of the museum from September 2007 to September 2010.
''We want to continue the process, to continue looking at what doesn't fit our needs and move forward,'' he added. ''We were very conscious when we started the process that this sort of thing raises eyebrows. We feel we've been very careful and very thoughtful about the entire thing.''
The history museum initially said it had no record of how many items it had sold, how much the sales had brought in or where the proceeds had been directed. ''I'm sure there are records around,'' Mr. Kleiber said. ''I'm not sure I've seen them.''
The museum later acknowledged that between 2003 and 2009 it sold 2,595 items at Philadelphia-area auction houses, earning a total of about $115,000. Another 64 items -- some of which were transferred to the museum in 2001 by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which shared in the proceeds -- were auctioned at Christie's, bringing in $3.4 million. The museum has sold ''mountains of stuff,'' Mr. Kleiber said, but much of it is only ''little bits of paper, odd bits of this and little bits of that.''
Some museum professionals say the institution should have been more transparent about its sales, explaining what it was selling and why.
''I wish some of these things were staying here and wish there had been a greater opportunity for local museums to purchase them,'' said Page Talbott, a trustee of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. ''There wasn't time built into it, to have a conversation about it. The sale had already been planned and catalogs printed.''
Others say the scope of the sales is troubling. ''The motivation appears to be liquidation, rather than preserving the embedded knowledge and experience that these artifacts bring,'' said Kenneth Finkel, lecturer in American studies at Temple University who briefly served as deputy director of the museum. ''Decisions made by donors and curators and libraries become the legacy. And the decision to deaccession stupidly is also a legacy.''
Many of the more prominent works sold were paintings done by members of the Peale family, whose most famous member, Charles Willson Peale, is viewed as the founder of America's first major museum, which operated in Philadelphia in the 1800s. ''There is nothing that's more centrally Philadelphian than the Peale family,'' said Mr. Dreher of the Rosenbach museum. ''Though I respect the museum's right to act as it did, it's taking away the opportunity for the public in and around Philadelphia to be enlightened by these works, and now one of the best stories can't be told because it's gone.''
Mr. Kleiber said that making sales more public is ''something we'll consider.''
Regarding the Raphaelle Peale still life, one of the more valuable items sold at Christie's, Mr. Kleiber said: ''The Peale we felt was very much outside the mission. We're a history museum, not an art museum. It's a picture of a fish.''

HEADLINE: Rabbit Ears Perk Up for Free HDTV

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Julie and Anthony Bayerl of St. Paul, Minn., love watching prime-time shows on the sleek 50-inch television in their bedroom. They also love that they pay nothing for the programming.
The only thing they do not love is how a low-flying plane, heavy rain or just a little too much movement in the room can wipe out the picture.
''If someone is changing in there, it messes up your reception,'' said Ms. Bayerl, a legislative assistant. ''We try to stay very still when we watch television.''
The Bayerls are using an old technology that some people are giving a second chance. They pull free TV signals out of the air with the modern equivalent of the classic rabbit-ear antenna. 
Some viewers who have decided that they are no longer willing or able to pay for cable or satellite service, including younger ones, are buying antennas and tuning in to a surprising number of free broadcast channels. These often become part of a video diet that includes the fast-growing menu of options available online.
The antenna reception has also led many of these converts to discover -- or rediscover -- the frustration of weak and spotty signals. But its fans argue that it is tough to beat the price.
''My husband's best friend thinks we're big dorks for having rabbit ears and not cable,'' Ms. Bayerl said. But when their introductory price for cable TV and Internet access expired this year and the bill soared to $150, the couple halved it by cutting TV. ''It wasn't something we were willing to pay for,'' she said.
Many pay TV customers are making the same decision. From April to September, cable and satellite companies had a net loss of about 330,000 customers. Craig Moffett, a longtime cable analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said the consensus of the industry executives he had talked to was that most of these so-called cord-cutters were turning to over-the-air TV. ''It looks like they're leaving for the antenna,'' he said.
Neil Smit, president of Comcast Cable, acknowledged in a recent call with investors that some customers had dropped cable for free signals. Company executives also said they expected business to rebound with the economy.
Last month, Time Warner Cable fought back with a lower-cost package that it said might appeal to people who are feeling the economic squeeze. For $40 in New York, or $30 in Ohio, customers can get a slimmed-down set of channels.
To be sure, around 90 percent of American households still pay for cable or satellite television -- a figure that in recent years has been slowly and steadily rising. But American's relationship with television has recently been in flux, in part because of the switch last June to digital broadcast signals.
That initially gave pay TV providers a group of new subscribers who had worried that their old sets would not pick up the new signals. But analysts say some of those subscribers have since gone back to free signals.
Another big change is the rise of Internet video, which can ease the pain of losing favorite cable channels.
Bradley Lautenbach, 28, who recently moved to Los Angeles to work at Disney, found enough alternatives to allow him to turn back the technological clock on his TV.
''I've always had cable. It's the thing you do when you move to a new place: call the company and set it up,'' he said. Not this time. Instead, he got an antenna and now watches over-the-air news and sports, complemented by episodes of shows like ''Entourage'' that he buys from iTunes. ''I don't miss cable at all,'' he said.
Industrywide figures on antenna sales are hard to come by, so it is difficult to tell how widely they are being adopted. Antennas Direct, a maker of TV antennas in St. Louis, expects to sell 500,000 this year, up from 385,000 in 2009, according to its president, Richard Schneider.
The company's digital TV antennas, like others on the market, are a far cry from the wire-hanger versions of old. The sleek circles encased in plastic look more like mouse ears than anything belonging to a bunny.
Mr. Schneider said that based on customer support calls and feedback from retailers, his customers were 20-somethings who pair over-the-air and Internet programming, people forced to make choices by a tough economy and others who, he argues, have long been eager to sever ties with their pay-TV provider.
''Over-the-air is the new basic cable,'' he said, arguing that free TV and Internet alternatives ''are giving people the rationale they've been looking for to end a bad relationship.''
Broadcasters, far from being troubled by the trend, believe it benefits them, according to Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters. He said broadcasters did not mind the move to over-the-air programming because those viewers were also potential audience members for the ads that support programming.
Modern antennas, which cost $25 to $150, pick up high-definition signals that can actually be crisper than the cable or satellite version of the same program, because the pay TV companies compress the video data.
But compared with analog broadcasts, which occasionally showed static, digital signals are less forgiving of interference and more likely to blank out altogether. At a World Cup viewing party in a Brooklyn apartment last summer, the hosts encouraged guests to limit trips to the kitchen and the bathroom to avoid too many interruptions of the signal.
The new antennas do pull in more programs than your grandfather's rabbit ears, because of new channels that broadcasters added during the transition to digital signals. The broadcasters can fit multiple digital channels into the same frequencies that used to carry one analog channel.
In St. Paul, for example, where Ms. Bayerl lives, there are extra channels from ABC and NBC with local news and weather, four public television channels and a music video channel. Big markets like Los Angeles have 40 or more channels, according to Nielsen.
Given the new options, Chris Foster, 29, a graduate student at the University of Virginia, and his wife decided to forgo a $35 fee for basic cable. They watch movies and older shows through Netflix on the Internet and use their antenna for sitcoms and the news.
Mr. Forster concedes he misses cable news stations, but over all, he is satisfied. ''It feels more like a step forward than a step back,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Noah's Ark, the Theme Park

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
Facing a rising tide of joblessness, the governor of Kentucky has found one solution: build an ark.
The state has promised generous tax incentives to a group of entrepreneurs who plan to construct a full-size replica of Noah's ark, load it with animals and actors, and make it the centerpiece of a Bible-based tourist attraction called Ark Encounter.
Since Gov. Steven L. Beshear announced the plan on Wednesday, some constitutional experts have raised alarms over whether government backing for an enterprise that promotes religion violates the First Amendment's requirement of separation of church and state. But Mr. Beshear, a Democrat, said the arrangement posed no constitutional problem, and brushed off questions about his stand on creationism. 
''The people of Kentucky didn't elect me governor to debate religion,'' he said at a news conference. ''They elected me governor to create jobs.''
The theme park was conceived by the same Christian ministry that built the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Ky., where dioramas designed to debunk evolution show humans and dinosaurs coexisting peacefully on an earth created by God in six days. The ministry, Answers in Genesis, believes that the earth is only 6,000 years old -- a controversial assertion even among many Bible-believing Christians.
Although the Creation Museum has been a target of ridicule by some, it has drawn 1.2 million visitors in its first three years -- proving that there is a sizable paying audience for entertainment rooted in a literal interpretation of the Bible.
On Friday, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Kentucky's second-largest newspaper, criticized Mr. Beshear in an editorial for a plan that it said would result in low-wage jobs and a poor image for the state.
''Anyone who wants to believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible has that right,'' the editorial said. ''However, the way the Beshear administration handled this makes it appear Kentucky either embraces such thinking or is desperate to take advantage of those who do.''
The developers of Ark Encounter, who have incorporated as a profit-making company, say they expect to spend $150 million, employ 900 people and attract 1.6 million visitors from around the world in the first year. With the Creation Museum only 45 miles away, they envision a Christian tourism corridor that would draw busloads from churches and Christian schools for two- and three-day visits.
''It's our opportunity to present accurate, factual biblical information to people about a subject that they're really interested in,'' said Mike Zovath, a senior vice president of Answers in Genesis.
In the interest of verisimilitude, the ark is to be built with wooden pegs and timber framing by Amish builders, Mr. Zovath said. Animals including giraffes -- but only small, young giraffes -- will be kept in pens on board.
''We think that God would probably have sent healthy juvenile-sized animals that weren't fully grown yet, so there would be plenty of room,'' said Mr. Zovath, a retired Army lieutenant colonel heading the ark project. ''We want to show how Noah would have taken care of them, taken care of waste management, taken care of water needs and food needs.''
Ark Encounter is designed to be a model of environmentally sensitive development, Mr. Zovath said, to minimize its carbon footprint. ''I don't believe in global warming,'' he said, ''but I do believe we've got to be good stewards of everything God's given us.''
The park will include a 100-foot Tower of Babel, a first-century Middle Eastern village and a journey through the Old Testament, with special effects depicting Moses, the 10 plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. For children, there will be a petting zoo, live bird and animal shows and a play area with ziplines and climbing nets -- all Bible-themed. Even the trainer, Dan Breeding, will present animal acts with a Gospel message about creation.
Under Kentucky's Tourism Development Act, tourist attractions can get back up to 25 percent of their development costs over 10 years from sales tax generated at the facility. Ark Encounter stands to receive $37.5 million -- a quarter of its investment.
The entry fee for adults would be somewhere in the middle- to upper-$30 range, said Cary Summers, the lead consultant, who has run large entertainment attractions in Branson, Mo., and helped expand the Bass Pro Shops into shopping and entertainment complexes.
Mr. Summers said the developers had options on 800 acres of land in Grant County, Ky. If all the approvals are granted, they expect to break ground next year and finish by 2014.
He said they had been offering the proposal quietly for two years, and also showed it to officials in Ohio and Indiana. But Kentucky was by far the most receptive and offered the most generous financial incentives, he said, because it sees tourism as a promising means of economic development.
Officials in Kentucky's Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet said in a telephone interview that they examined the constitutional issues carefully before proceeding. They said that Ark Encounter is unlike the Creation Museum, which is run by the Answers in Genesis ministry and received no tax incentives.
Ark Encounter is owned by a profit-making company, of which Answers in Genesis is a part owner. The ministry will manage the park's day-to-day operations.
William Dexter, general counsel for the tourism cabinet, said the most applicable precedent was American Atheists Inc. v. the City of Detroit Downtown Development Authority. A federal Court of Appeals found that Detroit could give grants to churches as well as businesses to encourage urban renewal.
''Our facts are quite similar, except that in our case it's a tourism development by a for-profit corporation,'' Mr. Dexter said.
But some advocates of separation of church and state say that by providing tax incentives to an explicitly Christian enterprise, Kentucky is violating the constitutional prohibition on government establishment of religion.
Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional scholar and founding dean of the School of Law at the University of California, Irvine, said: ''If this is about bringing the Bible to life, and it's the Bible's account of history that they're presenting, then the government is paying for the advancement of religion. And the Supreme Court has said that the government can't advance religion.''
He added, ''The fact that it's an economic development plan doesn't excuse it.''

HEADLINE: Hints of a Truce In Economic Battle

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
The sounds of the lame-duck session of Congress represent more than two parties clashing over power and philosophy.
They are also clashing over how to manage the shift from one economic era to another. But unusual as it seems from recent political history, those conflicts may now be leading toward a year-end truce.
Republicans, reflecting the importance that supply-side economists attach to marginal tax rates in stimulating growth, have insisted on extending all of President George W. Bush's tax cuts. That includes preserving the 35 percent top rate for households earning more than $250,000 a year. 
President Obama and fellow Democrats, reflecting the emphasis of Keynesian economists on increasing demand as a means of kick-starting growth, have insisted on extension of unemployment benefits and various tax breaks for middle-class families. Those steps, they argue, would do more to get consumers spending again.
Both prescriptions for America's near-term economic woes collide with the need each party acknowledges to curb long-term deficits and shift from consumption toward investment.
Yet three factors are now increasing the odds that the White House and Congress will come together in a bipartisan compromise.
One is that Republican victories in midterm elections, while increasing the leverage of Mr. Obama's adversaries in policy fights, have also increased their responsibility for producing results.
A second is an uptick in confidence, following the just-completed presidential debt-reduction commission, that Washington will soon turn toward addressing long-term budget imbalances. A third is mounting pressure, underscored by last week's disappointing unemployment report, to accelerate the weak economic recovery.
Building Confidence
Nearly two years into Mr. Obama's presidency, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of his strategy for ending the recession. White House aides argue that the $787-billion stimulus package averted depression and has returned the economy to growth; liberal economists say its principal flaw was that it wasn't big enough.
Republicans insist the effort to increase consumer demand was ill-suited for a period of consumer retrenchment after the burst of the real estate bubble. ''Households are saving more for good reason,'' said Greg Mankiw, a Harvard professor who led Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
Mr. Mankiw agreed that Washington should seek to reduce unemployment by increasing demand but added, ''The question is, 'Where's demand going to come from?' '' His answer: from American business, through bigger tax breaks for capital investment than the administration has offered thus far, and through the Federal Reserve's ''quantitative easing'' that some other Republicans have lambasted.
Many Congressional Republicans, pointing toward the British government's turn toward austerity, say their economic prescription is to cut government spending now. That sounds to traditional Keynesians like a formula for reducing demand and increasing unemployment.
But if those cuts were part of a long-term strategy for reducing deficits, rising confidence in America's economic future might in turn increase business investment now. ''Fiscal contractions can be expansionary,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia Business School.
He praised the recommendations from Mr. Obama's deficit-reduction commission as steps that would lift confidence and encourage investment. So did Mr. Mankiw, though he acknowledged that forecasting changes in what economists call ''animal spirits'' is art as well as science.
Two Right Answers
Austan Goolsbee, who leads President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, voices substantial agreement with his Republican predecessors. He said that Mr. Obama had not received enough credit for business investment incentives he had already proposed and that the administration was now examining additional steps for a ''pro-growth, pro-investment package.''
''We're not saying that our long-term recovery ought to be built on trying to increase consumer spending,'' Mr. Goolsbee said.
In addition to appointing the deficit-reduction panel, Mr. Obama has repeatedly advocated a ''rebalancing'' of the global economy to increase American investment and exports. And the wind-down of stimulus spending that began in 2009, Mr. Goolsbee added, itself represents a turn toward austerity.
But administration officials insist that, while focusing on long-term growth, they cannot overlook the blow that an expiration of unemployment benefits for the jobless and various tax benefits for the middle class would have on the nation's fragile recovery. As American corporations sit on some $1 trillion in cash, Mr. Goolsbee argued, the greatest immediate obstacle to investment is concern over lack of demand for their products.
In the lame-duck session's standoff over taxes and spending, some analysts are concluding that both sides are right.
Temporarily extending tax cuts for wealthy Americans would help the economy enough to be worth the cost, said Mark Zandi, an independent economist; and so would extending unemployment benefits. After the bitter political warfare of 2010, that is a deal Republicans and Democratic politicians appear to be now converging upon.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leader Sees Outline of Tax Deal

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
After thwarting efforts to raise taxes on America's top earners, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, predicted Sunday that Congress would retain the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for a limited number of years and might also extend unemployment benefits as part of a compromise with the White House.
In recent weeks, as the blocking power of the Republican minority overwhelmed a Senate majority, the White House and Congress had been discussing a deal to extend the reduced Bush tax rates for all income levels, not just for those below $250,000, for a short period, perhaps two years. News reports have indicated that as part of such a deal President Obama, who wanted to raise the rates for incomes above the $250,000 threshold, would insist on an extension of unemployment insurance for jobless Americans whose benefits are running out. 
Mr. McConnell, interviewed on the NBC television program ''Meet the Press,'' flatly confirmed the outlines of that compromise. ''I think we will extend unemployment compensation,'' he said. The debate among lawmakers, he said, is ''not about whether to do it but whether to pay for it as opposed to adding it to the deficit.''
He would prefer to make the tax cuts permanent because the current, 10-year-old tax rate ''is appropriate,'' he said. But ''the president won't sign a permanent extension.''
''I'm very hopeful that the tax rates won't go up,'' he added, signaling his belief that the White House has abandoned its efforts to raise taxes.
Mr. McConnell also said he had not made up his mind about whether he would support a new nuclear arms treaty with Russia in the remainder of this congressional session, an apparent confirmation that Republican support for ratification may also be part of the multifaceted discussions with the White House. Mr. McConnell's statement appeared more flexible than some made by Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, who has been the Republican point man on the treaty and said last month that there was not enough time to consider renewing the pact in the lame-duck session of Congress.
On Saturday, the Democrats failed to muster the 60 votes that could have stymied a Republican filibuster, thereby effectively losing two Senate floor votes on the tax cuts -- one to let tax rates rise for couples making over $250,000 and individuals making $200,000 and another to end the tax breaks on incomes exceeding $1 million.
Thus the focus in Washington shifted to the behind-the-scenes negotiations between Republican and Democratic leaders and the Oval Office. In describing those talks, Mr. McConnell seemed unusually magnanimous about relations with the White House, a result of the cards he was handed by the November elections, in which Republicans took back the House and trimmed the Democratic majority in the Senate.
''We've had more conversations in the past two weeks than we've had in the past two years,'' he said about the White House, with a smile. ''There's a growing awareness that the power will be more symmetrical in the next Congress.''
With the Senate's weekend votes now recorded, ''it's pretty clear that taxes are not going up on anybody in the middle of a recession,'' the senator said, adding, ''We're discussing how long we should extend the tax rates.''
Mr. McConnell said raising taxes would hurt the nation's 700,000 small businesses, which generate jobs. Democrats have argued that there is little evidence that individual income over $1 million is invested in job creation.
Interviewed on the same program, a combative Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Republican position on tax cuts ''would put money in the pockets of people who may never invest it in the United States.''
To retain those tax cuts for the wealthy, he said, the Republicans were ''willing to hold unemployment compensation hostage.''

HEADLINE: Same-Sex Initiative Reaches Next Hurdle

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- It has been more than two years since voters outlawed same-sex marriage with a ballot initiative in California, and it may be two more before the legality of that measure -- Proposition 8 -- is finally decided, most likely by the Supreme Court.
On Monday, however, the two sides in the debate will lock horns at the highest legal level yet, when a federal challenge to the law filed by two gay couples is heard by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. 
But the lawyers involved expect few surprises when it comes to arguments.
''A lot of the stuff is going to be repeated,'' said Jordan Lorence, senior counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative legal group that has helped defend Proposition 8. ''But what I hope is that it will not be the one-sided presentation of the facts the district court had in its opinion.''
That opinion was issued in August by Judge Vaughn R. Walker, who said that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional and in violation of the principles of due process and equal protection. The measure has remained in effect as the higher appellate court considers it.
The hearing on Monday will unfold in two parts and cover two issues. The first is the question of legal standing: the major defendants in the case -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Attorney General Jerry Brown -- have opted not to defend the measure, leaving the defense to groups like Mr. Lorence's.
Mr. Brown was elected governor last month, meaning the state's next chief executive will not support the ban. David Boies, the veteran Washington lawyer challenging the measure, said that proponents would need to prove that their lives were being directly, and substantially, harmed by Judge Walker's decision in order to prove their standing.
''It's not enough that you have a policy disagreement,'' Mr. Boies said.
While the state has opted out of the defense, in September, officials in Imperial County -- a rural area east of Los Angeles that has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state -- filed briefs to defend the measure, saying that Judge Walker had disregarded the will of California's voters, who passed Proposition 8 in 2008 with 52 percent of the vote.
''The district court in this case failed to recognize his role as a judge as opposed to a policy maker,'' the brief read. ''Before this court is an opportunity to restore the vote of over seven million Californians.''
The panel that will hear the arguments has also been questioned by supporters of the measure. On Thursday, one of the three panelists -- Judge Stephen Reinhardt -- rebuffed a motion asking him to disqualify himself because he is married to Ramona Ripston, the longtime executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. The A.C.L.U. has actively opposed Proposition 8, but Judge Reinhardt said that he could remain impartial.
The judges will spend the second part of Monday's hearing on the actual legality of Proposition 8. Opponents have argued -- and Judge Walker agreed -- that voters had no legitimate state interest in defining marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman, and provided more than a dozen witnesses during testimony in January to back up their case. Supporters of the measure offered two witnesses.
Both sides expect pointed questions from the panel on Monday, though its decision will not be the last word on Proposition 8. Both sides are already preparing for an appeal to either a larger array of judges in the Ninth Circuit or directly to the United States Supreme Court.
''We are ready to go from Day 1,'' said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for opponents of the measure.

HEADLINE: WikiLeaks, Facebook And Perils of Oversharing

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
THE recent release of internal State Department cables by WikiLeaks, assisted by a coalition of news outlets in the United States and Europe, has been viewed as a national security matter -- have confidential sources been compromised? Could relations between the United States and Russia (or Italy or France or Pakistan) be permanently damaged?
But one can take an even longer view of the meaning of the WikiLeaks campaign: by exposing the candid workings of government, the project and its leader, Julian Assange, have transformed the debate over Internet privacy from one about the individual to one about the government. 
In the aftermath, many of the sharpest critics of WikiLeaks have belittled what has been learned, saying the material appears meant to humiliate the United States with embarrassing assessments of world leaders rather than inform the public of gross misbehavior. The damage to the government instead relates to the loss of the confidentiality needed to conduct foreign affairs.
The conservative commentator Tunku Varadarajan, writing in The Daily Beast, was among the most direct in making the point: ''Diplomacy, to work at all effectively, must draw a line between the 'consultative process' and the 'work product.' This is but part of the human condition: Human beings need to consult, speculate, brainstorm, argue with each other -- yes, even to gossip and say dopey things -- in order to find their way through the difficult task of coming to an official, or publicly stated position which would then be open (legitimately) to criticism.''
So, without a zone of privacy it becomes impossible for a government to sustain complicated, even contradictory, ideas about relationships and about the world -- in other words, it becomes impossible to think. And, imagine that: apparently governments need to think.
Were he not talking about geopolitics and accusing Mr. Assange of being a Marxist (skipping right past the Socialist label), Mr. Varadarajan would sound a lot like the commentators who worry about the generation growing up engulfed by modern Internet technologies.
These young people, too, lack the ability to say and do dopey things without it seemingly haunting them forever. They may never have bought a book without being profiled. Or queried a search engine without being sized up for an advertisement. Or proffered, and maybe then withdrawn, friendship, without it being logged.
The author and critic Zadie Smithmade these points in an essay titled ''Generation Why?'' in The New York Review of Books. It included a scathing assessment of what Facebook and other Web technologies have wrought among her college students. She fears that by sharing so much -- and having so much shared about themselves -- these young people have lost any hope for an inner life.
Whether the formats or the people are to blame is almost beside the point. ''I am dreaming of a Web that caters to a kind of person who no longer exists,'' she writes. ''A private person, a person who is a mystery, to the world and -- which is more important -- to herself.''
In the essay's climax, she describes teaching an experimental novel ''about a man who decides to pass most of his time in his bathroom,'' who lacks ''interiority.'' She concludes: ''To my students this novel feels perfectly realistic; an accurate portrait of their own denuded selfhood, or, to put it neutrally, a close analogue of the undeniable boredom of urban twenty-first-century existence.''
Of course, there are reasons privacy is allocated the way it is -- that is, why governments should get it, and individuals less so. The Internet economy thrives on data collection about users -- to deliver better advertisements or to allow ''friends'' to share what they consume. And, naturally, diplomats need to be able to be candid back home, and be sociable at official functions.
In fact, the catty nature of many of the cables -- comparing Vladimir V. Putin and Dmitri A. Medvedev to Batman and Robin, for example -- reminds one of high school, and the perils of oversharing. You feel for the United States these days: I have home room with Dmitri, how can I look him in the face now?
To an outsider looking in, another teenage expression comes to mind: T.M.I., or too much information.
''The whole thing seems a little Facebooky,'' said Lisa Lynch, a journalism professor at Concordia University in Montreal, who has written about WikiLeaks. She said she was surprised no one had displayed the information in the cables as Facebook status updates: ''You know, Sarkozy is no longer in a relationship with the United States.''
Still, there was a larger purpose in the cable releases, she said. And it was not to teach the world the importance of privacy by showing the powerful how it feels to be transparent to the world. WikiLeaks has swept up the obscure and the weak (albeit obnoxious) in its past, as when it named members of the racist British National Party who certainly did not seek to be exposed.
Taking advantage of new technologies, Ms. Lynch said, the project has leveled the playing field, ''reversing hierarchies of who gets censored and who gets surveilled.''
In the process, WikiLeaks is perhaps trying to render governments as brain-addled as Ms. Smith sees her students.
In an essay attributed to Mr. Assange -- posted to his Web site in 2006 shortly before the start of WikiLeaks and given the name ''State and Terrorist Conspiracies'' -- he describes his views on authoritarian governments, the governments that he is trying to bedevil.
He speaks explicitly about trying to prevent oppressive governments from communicating internally: a government ''that cannot think is powerless to preserve itself,'' he writes in the essay.
One scholar, Aaron Bady, last week wrote an analysis of ''State and Terrorist Conspiracies'' on his blog, saying that Mr. Assange's strategy for combating an authoritarian government was ''to degrade its ability to conspire, to hinder its ability to 'think' as a conspiratorial mind. The metaphor of a computing network is mostly implicit, but utterly crucial: he seeks to oppose the power of the state by treating it like a computer and tossing sand in its diodes.''
Put differently, governments, like teenagers, need to know when to keep their mouths shut: WikiLeaks is trying hard to make that task impossible.

HEADLINE: In Interview, Bernanke Backs Tax Code Shift

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in an interview broadcast on Sunday evening that rising inequality was eroding social cohesion and that Congress could help economic growth by making the tax code more efficient.
The statements, in an interview with ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, were a rare foray outside the strict boundaries of the Fed's mandate, to which Mr. Bernanke has typically confined his remarks.
In the interview, which was taped last week during a visit to the Ohio State University, Mr. Bernanke was unusually blunt in defending the Fed's decision last month to inject $600 billion into the banking system to jolt the flagging recovery. 
''This fear of inflation, I think, is way overstated,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''We've looked at it very, very carefully. We've analyzed it every which way.''
On fiscal policy, a topic he has largely avoided, Mr. Bernanke repeated his point that the government should avoid an immediate contraction that could jeopardize the fragile recovery, while at the same time starting to address ''the long-term structural budget deficit.''
But he went slightly further when asked how Congress might help the economy grow.
''The tax code is very inefficient -- both the personal tax code and the corporate tax code,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''By closing loopholes and lowering rates, you could increase the efficiency of the tax code and create more incentives for people to invest.''
That statement seemed to be an endorsement of one proposal from the fiscal commission appointed by President Obama. Among the ideas it put forward last week was reducing personal income tax rates but eliminating a number of popular deductions.
When asked about rising inequality in the United States, Mr. Bernanke offered a response that was likely to be embraced by liberals.
''It's a very bad development,'' he said. ''It's creating two societies. And it's based very much, I think, on educational differences. The unemployment rate we've been talking about. If you're a college graduate, unemployment is 5 percent. If you're a high school graduate, it's 10 percent or more. It's a very big difference.''
Mr. Bernanke added: ''It leads to an unequal society, and a society which doesn't have the cohesion that we'd like to see.''
During the interview, Mr. Bernanke reiterated his view that a double-dip recession was unlikely, but added, ''We're not very far from the level where the economy is not self-sustaining.''
The chairman also left open the option of going beyond the $600 billion of Treasury securities the Fed plans to buy through June 2011.
''It's certainly possible,'' Mr. Bernanke said, adding: ''It depends on the efficacy of the program. It depends on inflation. And finally, it depends on how the economy looks.''
Mr. Bernanke offered a retort to critics, saying, ''We're not printing money. The amount of currency in circulation is not changing. The money supply is not changing in any significant way.''
Mr. Bernanke's remarks suggested that the Fed was highly unlikely to change course when it meets on Dec. 14 for the final time this year.
The Fed has made it clear that its implicit long-run target for inflation is around 2 percent or slightly less, and Mr. Bernanke said that ''we've been very, very clear that we will not allow inflation to rise above'' that level.

HEADLINE: G.E. and JPMorgan Got Lots of Fed Help in '08

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JO CRAVEN McGINTY

 BODY:
Newly disclosed records show that during the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve essentially lent $16.1 billion to General Electric by buying short-term corporate i.o.u.'s from the company at a time when the public market for such debt had nearly frozen.
And on Sept. 15, 2008, the day Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection, JPMorgan Chase received a $3 billion loan from the Fed. The loan was extended under one of several Fed programs tapped by the Wall Street bank, one of the more robust financial institutions to weather the crisis.
The two companies received help even as their chief executives, Jeffrey R. Immelt of G.E. and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, sat on the nine-member board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Neither executive was involved in creating the emergency programs, which were approved by the Fed's board of governors in Washington. Both companies also disclosed that they were among scores of institutions that received support from the Fed. Nevertheless, some policy experts expressed discomfort with the situation. 
''In my view, it is an obvious conflict of interest for C.E.O.'s of banks and large corporations who serve on the Fed's board of directors to have received cheap loans from the Fed,'' Senator Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent who wrote the legal provision requiring the Fed to make the disclosures, said in a statement on Sunday.
''While they got a huge amount of government support, small businesses are going bankrupt because they can't receive affordable credit, workers are losing their homes to foreclosure, and consumers are being charged 25 percent to 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards by the very same banks that were bailed out,'' he added.
The details of the emergency loan program were disclosed last week when the Fed reluctantly released records of 21,000 crisis-related transactions under orders from Congress. The disclosures are likely to renew questions about the influence of bank officers and corporate executives in the operations of the Fed.
''It's ugly,'' said Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and a historian of the Fed. ''It has the appearance of impropriety.''
The Dodd-Frank Act, which President Obama signed in July, bars representatives of banks that are members of the Fed system, like Mr. Dimon, from having a vote in selecting the presidents of the Fed's 12 district banks, altering a system that went back to the creation of the Fed in 1913.
Mr. Sanders also wrote a provision requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate potential conflicts of interest at the Fed. The results of that audit are expected in July.
The New York Fed is the most powerful of the Federal Reserve's 12 branches and was charged with carrying out various emergency programs that supported financial markets during the crisis.
In a statement, the New York Fed said that its ''board of directors was not involved in the creation of the emergency lending facilities authorized by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve.'' The Fed says it has been, or will be, repaid on all of its loans.
While Mr. Immelt and Mr. Dimon were not involved in setting up the programs, the records show their companies still received substantial support.
G.E. was one of the largest beneficiaries of the Fed program to buy commercial paper, or short-term i.o.u.'s. A few institutions -- among them Bank of America, UBS, Barclays and Citigroup -- sold even more to the Fed.
In contrast, JPMorgan got far less help under the program for investment banks than some of its Wall Street rivals, like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which each tapped the program on more than 100 occasions.
On 12 occasions in October and November 2008, G.E. issued short-term i.o.u.'s -- which all corporations use for everyday transactions like paying their employees and suppliers; the Fed purchased a total of $16.1 billion of them.
''Our participation was not affected by Jeff's status as a New York Fed board member,'' said Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, the company's finance arm. ''We have been proactive in disclosing our participation in the funding programs.''
The records indicate JPMorgan and its subsidiaries participated in seven Fed programs, including two related to its purchase of Bear Stearns in March 2008, a prelude to the deepening of the financial crisis later that year.
JPMorgan Chase borrowed seven times from a program designed to make it easier for sound institutions to borrow as the financial strains in the market first became apparent. It received 23 loans under a program designed to stabilize the market for Treasury securities. And it got 570 loans for purchases of asset-backed commercial paper.
Under a program the Fed created in March 2008 to lend directly to investment banks for the first time in its history, JPMorgan received three loans, including the $3 billion loan on the day that Lehman collapsed. (The other two loans were made the next month, for $10 million each.)
Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, said the bank ''is proud to have been a source of stability for the markets'' and, in fact, was asked to take part in some of the programs as the Fed tried to calm the markets.
''Our fortress balance sheet allowed us to help the federal government avoid a bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and to acquire Washington Mutual, providing essential credit and minimizing market disruptions that could have been disastrous,'' she said in a statement. ''In addition to these actions, the government encouraged us to use its lending facilities during times of market turmoil to help reduce any stigma and to improve market liquidity for our clients.''
The Fed, as the nation's central bank, has responsibility for guiding monetary policy and is an independent arm of the government. The New York Fed, like the other Fed banks, is overseen by a nine-member board.
Three members are bankers, chosen by fellow bankers; another three are chosen by bankers to represent the public; and the final three are chosen by the Federal Reserve's seven-member board of governors in Washington. The chairman of each Fed bank must come from the last group.
The new disclosures do not represent the first time the New York Fed's relationship with the banks it assisted has come under scrutiny.
Goldman, previously an investment bank, became a Fed-regulated bank holding company during the crisis. It tapped the Fed program to help investment banks 52 times, owing $18 billion to the Fed at one point -- receiving far greater support than JPMorgan.
The chairman of the New York Fed at the time, Stephen Friedman, was a Goldman director and former chairman of Goldman. The Fed granted Mr. Friedman a waiver so he could continue serving as chairman of the New York Fed.
While awaiting the waiver, Mr. Friedman bought shares of Goldman around the time the bank received Fed support. After The Wall Street Journal reported on the purchases, Mr. Friedman stepped down, saying the Fed ''does not need this distraction.'' The New York Fed's top lawyer said at the time that Mr. Friedman ''did not violate any Federal Reserve statute, rule or policy.''
Mr. Friedman's successor as chairman of the New York Fed was Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. Fed observers say it is unlikely that a former banker will serve as the agency's chairman any time soon.

HEADLINE: Social Science Palooza

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Every day, hundreds of thousands of scholars study human behavior. Every day, a few of their studies are bundled and distributed via e-mail by Kevin Lewis, who covers the social sciences for The Boston Globe and National Affairs. And every day, I file away these studies because I find them bizarrely interesting.
In this column, I'm going to try to summarize as many of these studies as space allows. No single study is dispositive, but I hope these summaries can spark some conversations: 
Female mammals tend to avoid close male relatives during moments of peak fertility in order to avoid inbreeding. For the journal Psychological Science, Debra Lieberman, Elizabeth Pillsworth and Martie Haselton tracked young women's cellphone calls. They found that these women had fewer and shorter calls with their fathers during peak fertility days, but not with female relatives.
Classic research has suggested that the more people doubt their own beliefs the more, paradoxically, they are inclined to proselytize in favor of them. David Gal and Derek Rucker published a study in Psychological Science in which they presented some research subjects with evidence that undermined their core convictions. The subjects who were forced to confront the counterevidence went on to more forcefully advocate their original beliefs, thus confirming the earlier findings.
Physical contact improves team performance. For the journal Emotion, Michael Kraus, Cassey Huang and Dacher Keltner measured how frequently members of N.B.A. teams touched each other. Teams that touched each other frequently early in the 2008-2009 season did better than teams that touched less frequently, even after accounting for player status, preseason expectations and early season performance.
According to John Gaski and Jeff Sagarin in the Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology and Economics, there is a surprisingly strong relationship between daylight saving time and lower SAT scores. No explanation was offered.
For an article in The Review of Economics and Statistics, Mark Duggan, Randi Hjalmarsson and Brian Jacob investigated whether gun shows increase crime rates. They identified 3,400 gun shows in Texas and California and looked at crime rates for the areas around the shows for the following month. They found no relationship between gun shows and crime in either state.
Self-control consumes glucose in the brain. For an article in the journal Aggressive Behavior, Nathan DeWall, Timothy Deckman, Matthew Gaillot and Brad Bushman found that research subjects who consumed a glucose beverage behaved less aggressively than subjects who drank a placebo beverage. They found an indirect relationship between diabetes (a disorder marked by low glucose levels) and low self-control. States with high diabetes rates also had high crime rates. Countries with a different condition that leads to low glucose levels had higher killing rates, both during wartime and during peacetime.
We tend to admire extroverted leaders. But Adam Grant, Francesca Gino and David Hofmann have added a wrinkle to this bias in an article in The Academy of Management Journal. They found that extraverted leaders perform best when their employees are passive, but this effect is reversed when the employees are proactive. In these cases, the extroverted leaders are less receptive to their employees' initiatives.
Beautiful women should take up chess. Anna Dreber, Christer Gerdes and Patrik Gransmark wrote a Stockholm University working paper in which they found that male chess players pursue riskier strategies when they're facing attractive female opponents, even though the risk-taking didn't improve their performance.
People remember information that is hard to master. In a study for Cognition, Connor Diemand-Yauman, Daniel Oppenheimer and Erikka Vaughan found that information in hard-to-read fonts was better remembered than information transmitted in easier fonts.
Would you rather date someone who dumped his or her last partner or someone who was the dumpee? For an article in Evolutionary Psychology, Christine Stanik, Robert Kurzban and Phoebe Ellsworth found that men will give a woman a lower rating when they learn that she dumped her last boyfriend, perhaps fearing they will be next. But women rated men more highly when they learned that they had done the dumping, perhaps seeing it as a sign of desirability.
These studies remind us that we are strange, complicated creatures -- deeply influenced by primordial biases and our current relationships. But you don't have to settle for my summaries of these kinds of studies. Go to the National Affairs Web site, where there are links to Kevin Lewis's daily batch of studies. A day without social science is like a day without sunshine.

HEADLINE: Top Test Scores From Shanghai Stun Educators

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
With China's debut in international standardized testing, students in Shanghai have surprised experts by outscoring their counterparts in dozens of other countries, in reading as well as in math and science, according to the results of a respected exam.
American officials and Europeans involved in administering the test in about 65 countries acknowledged that the scores from Shanghai -- an industrial powerhouse with some 20 million residents and scores of modern universities that is a magnet for the best students in the country -- are by no means representative of all of China.
About 5,100 15-year-olds in Shanghai were chosen as a representative cross-section of students in that city. In the United States, a similar number of students from across the country were selected as a representative sample for the test.
Experts noted the obvious difficulty of using a standardized test to compare countries and cities of vastly different sizes. Even so, they said the stellar academic performance of students in Shanghai was noteworthy, and another sign of China's rapid modernization. 
The results also appeared to reflect the culture of education there, including greater emphasis on teacher training and more time spent on studying rather than extracurricular activities like sports.
''Wow, I'm kind of stunned, I'm thinking Sputnik,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., who served in President Ronald Reagan's Department of Education, referring to the groundbreaking Soviet satellite launching. Mr. Finn, who has visited schools all across China, said, ''I've seen how relentless the Chinese are at accomplishing goals, and if they can do this in Shanghai in 2009, they can do it in 10 cities in 2019, and in 50 cities by 2029.''
The test, the Program for International Student Assessment, known as PISA, was given to 15-year-old students by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group that includes the world's major industrial powers.
The results are to be released officially on Tuesday, but advance copies were provided to the news media a day early.
''We have to see this as a wake-up call,'' Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in an interview on Monday.
''I know skeptics will want to argue with the results, but we consider them to be accurate and reliable, and we have to see them as a challenge to get better,'' he added. ''The United States came in 23rd or 24th in most subjects. We can quibble, or we can face the brutal truth that we're being out-educated.''
In math, the Shanghai students performed in a class by themselves, outperforming second-place Singapore, which has been seen as an educational superstar in recent years. The average math scores of American students put them below 30 other countries.
PISA scores are on a scale, with 500 as the average. Two-thirds of students in participating countries score between 400 and 600. On the math test last year, students in Shanghai scored 600, in Singapore 562, in Germany 513, and in the United States 487.
In reading, Shanghai students scored 556, ahead of second-place Korea with 539. The United States scored 500 and came in 17th, putting it on par with students in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and several other countries.
In science, Shanghai students scored 575. In second place was Finland, where the average score was 554. The United States scored 502 -- in 23rd place -- with a performance indistinguishable from Poland, Ireland, Norway, France and several other countries.
The testing in Shanghai was carried out by an international contractor, working with Chinese authorities, and overseen by the Australian Council for Educational Research, a nonprofit testing group, said Andreas Schleicher, who directs the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's international educational testing program.
Mark Schneider, a commissioner of the Department of Education's research arm in the George W. Bush administration, who returned from an educational research visit to China on Friday, said he had been skeptical about some PISA results in the past. But Mr. Schneider said he considered the accuracy of these results to be unassailable.
''The technical side of this was well regulated, the sampling was O.K., and there was no evidence of cheating,'' he said.
Mr. Schneider, however, noted some factors that may have influenced the outcome.
For one thing, Shanghai is a huge migration hub within China. Students are supposed to return to their home provinces to attend high school, but the Shanghai authorities could increase scores by allowing stellar students to stay in the city, he said. And Shanghai students apparently were told the test was important for China's image and thus were more motivated to do well, he said.
''Can you imagine the reaction if we told the students of Chicago that the PISA was an important international test and that America's reputation depended on them performing well?'' Mr. Schneider said. ''That said, China is taking education very seriously. The work ethic is amazingly strong.''
In a speech to a college audience in North Carolina, President Obama recalled how the Soviet Union's 1957 launching of Sputnik provoked the United States to increase investment in math and science education, helping America win the space race.
''Fifty years later, our generation's Sputnik moment is back,'' Mr. Obama said. With billions of people in India and China ''suddenly plugged into the world economy,'' he said, nations with the most educated workers will prevail. ''As it stands right now,'' he said, ''America is in danger of falling behind.''
If Shanghai is a showcase of Chinese educational progress, America's showcase would be Massachusetts, which has routinely scored higher than all other states on America's main federal math test in recent years.
But in a 2007 study that correlated the results of that test with the results of an international math exam, Massachusetts students scored behind Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. Shanghai did not participate in the test.
A 259-page Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report on the latest Pisa results notes that throughout its history, China has been organized around competitive examinations. ''Schools work their students long hours every day, and the work weeks extend into the weekends,'' it said.
Chinese students spend less time than American students on athletics, music and other activities not geared toward success on exams in core subjects. Also, in recent years, teaching has rapidly climbed up the ladder of preferred occupations in China, and salaries have risen. In Shanghai, the authorities have undertaken important curricular reforms, and educators have been given more freedom to experiment.
Ever since his organization received the Shanghai test scores last year, Mr. Schleicher said, international testing experts have investigated them to vouchsafe for their accuracy, expecting that they would produce astonishment in many Western countries.
''This is the first time that we have internationally comparable data on learning outcomes in China,'' Mr. Schleicher said. ''While that's important, for me the real significance of these results is that they refute the commonly held hypothesis that China just produces rote learning.''
''Large fractions of these students demonstrate their ability to extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge very creatively in novel situations,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Divorce Soars in Iran as Women Work System and Defy Tradition

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YONG

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- The wedding nearly 1,400 years ago of Imam Ali, Shiite Islam's most revered figure, and Fatemeh al-Zahra, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, is commemorated in Iran's packed political calendar as a day to celebrate family values.
But in a sign of the Iranian authorities' increasing concern about Iran's shifting social landscape, Marriage Day, as it is usually known in Iran, this year was renamed No Divorce Day. Iran's justice minister decreed that no divorce permits would be issued.
Whether the switch was effective or not, the officials' concerns are understandable. Divorce is skyrocketing in Iran. Over a decade, the number each year has roughly tripled to a little more than 150,000 in 2010 from around 50,000 in 2000, according to official figures. Nationwide, there is one divorce for every seven marriages; in Tehran, the ratio is 1 divorce for every 3.76 marriages, the government has reported.
While the change in divorce rates is remarkable, even more surprising is the major force behind it: the increasing willingness of Iranian women to manipulate the Iranian legal system to escape unwanted marriages. 
The numbers are still modest compared with the United States, which typically records about a million divorces a year in a population about four times as large. But for Iran, with a conservative Islamic culture that strongly discourages divorce, the trend is striking, and shows few signs of slowing. In the last Iranian calendar year, ending in March, divorces were up 16 percent from the year before, compared with a 1 percent increase in marriages.
''In May, a registry office I work with recorded 70 divorces and only 3 marriages,'' said a lawyer who requested anonymity for fear of retribution by the Iranian authorities. ''The next month, a friend at another office said he recorded 60 divorces and only one marriage.'' He noted that both offices were in central Tehran and not in the city's affluent north, which is considered more liberal and Westernized.
Not only is divorce on the rise, but marriages are also failing early, with 30 percent of divorces in any given year occurring in the first year of marriage and 50 percent in the first five years. Some people, doubtful of the government statistics, suspect that the numbers are even higher.
Conservative commentators call the problem a social ill on par with drug addiction and prostitution. Senior officials and members of Parliament have increasingly referred to the issue as a ''crisis'' and a ''national threat.'' Explanations for the rising divorce rate vary. More liberal commentators emphasize factors like rapid urbanization, high living costs and a jobless rate that official figures put at close to one in four among 16- to 25-year-olds. Conservatives often point to what they say is growing godlessness among the young and the corrupting effects of the Western media.
''High dowries, high living costs, lack of jobs and financial support make young people fear marriage,'' said a member of Parliament, Gholamreza Asadollahi, who also blamed young people who had lost their belief ''in the unseen power of God to solve life's problems.''
But most experts agree that nothing has contributed as much as a deep-rooted awakening in Iranian women that is altering traditional attitudes toward marriage, relationships, careers and, generally speaking, women's place in what is still an overwhelmingly patriarchal society.
Twenty percent of Iranian women are employed or actively looking for jobs, according to government figures, compared with 7 percent in the first years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Female undergraduate students outnumber men in Iran's universities almost two to one.
''This economic freedom has had an effect on the behavior of women in the home,'' said Saeid Madani, a member of the Iranian Sociological Association. ''In the past, if a housewife left her home, she would go hungry; now there is a degree of possibility of finding a job and earning an income.''
But something more is at work than simple economics, many experts say. ''Women have found the courage to break with tradition and say no to the past,'' said Azardokht Mofidi, a psychiatrist and the author of several books on psychoanalysis. ''They are no longer prepared to put up with hardships in marriage, and their expectations have risen to include equality in relationships.''
Nazanin, a woman nearing 50 who has been divorced twice, has experienced the change in attitudes. Married at age 18, during the politically charged years of the Islamic Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war, Nazanin divorced two years later in the face of a society that still held firm to the Persian adage that a woman enters her husband's home wearing a white wedding dress and leaves it in her white funeral clothes.
''For years, I hid the fact,'' said Nazanin, relaxing without a hijab in the modest, sparsely decorated apartment where she lives with her adult son. ''For a while, my family told the neighbors stories and lies, saying he had gone to work abroad. At work, because I was still young, I kept wearing my ring and didn't tell anybody.''
After she broke up with her second husband 14 years ago, her religious parents were once again mortified, but friends were more accepting. In the years since, Nazanin says she has seen a reversal in society's attitudes.
''Now, it has become so normal that society has become neutral,'' she said. ''Our generation has completely lost its sensitivity to divorce. It's so common that you can see it in your own family. You just accept it.''
Even so, she would give only her first name and refused to be photographed, for fear of being punished by the authorities.
Iran's rising divorce rate is all the more noteworthy given the laws on divorce. While husbands are empowered to end their marriages in a matter of weeks without stating any reason, women must establish sufficient grounds for divorce in a process that can take several years, even with professional legal advice.
Facing such an uneven playing field, marital lawyers say, Iranian women have increasingly turned to leveraging their legal right to a mehrieh -- a single payment agreed on before marriage that constitutes a kind of Islamic marriage insurance. Husbands are obliged to pay this sum to wives when they divorce.
Under what are known as ''divorces of mutual consent,'' a woman may forgo part or all of her mehrieh to provide a financial incentive to her husband to let her leave. In recent years, there have been exponential increases in the value of mehriehs, which now often reach the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars. Some conservatives have raised the idea of capping mehriehs to reduce the divorce rate. Clerics and government officials promote the idea of having a purely symbolic mehrieh, like a handful of gold coins or a Koran.
Whether such measures can stem the tide of divorce remains to be seen, particularly in a society where it seems to be losing its stigma.
''At first I was afraid of how society would treat me after divorce,'' said a seamstress named Sara, 33. ''But after all the support that I got from my friends and my father, my uncle and aunts and the people who I turned to for advice, I thought, 'No, the period in which people were prejudiced against divorce is over.' No one ever judged me.''

HEADLINE: Pulling Back The Curtain On Inquiries

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
To hear Eric H. Holder Jr. tell it, the Justice Department is aggressively cracking down on financial fraud.
On Monday in Washington, Mr. Holder, the United States attorney general, announced with much fanfare the results of a new enforcement program: Operation Broken Trust. ''With this operation, the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force is sending a strong message,'' Mr. Holder declared, highlighting the Ponzi schemes, affinity frauds and investment scams his department had prosecuted.
In all, Mr. Holder said his new task force had brought cases against 343 criminal defendants and 189 civil defendants for fraud schemes that harmed more than 120,000 victims throughout the country, involving more than $8 billion in estimated losses. 
It all sounded quite important, and the program's slogan is pretty catchy. But after you get past the pandering sound bites, a question comes to mind: is anyone in the corner offices of Wall Street's biggest firms or corporate America's biggest companies paying any attention to Mr. Holder's ''strong message''?
Of course not. (I actually called some chief executives after Mr. Holder's news conference, and not one had heard of Operation Broken Trust.)
That's because in the two years since the peak of the financial crisis, the government has not brought one criminal case against a big-time corporate official of any sort.
Instead, inexplicably, prosecutors are busy chasing small-timers: penny-stock frauds, a husband-and-wife team charged in an insider trading case and mini-Ponzi schemes.
''They will pick on minor misdemeanors by individual market participants,'' said David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager who was among the Cassandras before the financial crisis. To Mr. Einhorn, the government is ''not willing to take on significant misbehavior by sizable'' firms. ''But since there have been almost no big prosecutions, there's very little evidence that it has stopped bad actors from behaving badly.''
That is not to suggest that the government should not enforce the law just because certain crimes are smaller than others. The markets won't work unless the public believes that the playing field is level and that someone is enforcing the rules.
But fraud at big corporations surely dwarfs by orders of magnitude the shareholders' losses of $8 billion that Mr. Holder highlighted. If the government spent half the time trying to ferret out fraud at major companies that it does tracking pump-and-dump schemes, we might have been able to stop the financial crisis, or at least we'd have a fighting chance at stopping the next one.
Shawn J. Chen, a partner in the Washington office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, called the announcement by Mr. Holder ''a public relations push more than anything else.'' Mr. Chen went so far as to suggest that the number of cases Mr. Holder cited as evidence of the department's crackdown were somewhat fictional.
''It's hard to believe that they built up all these cases in the past four months,'' since the task force was created, Mr. Chen said, suggesting it was more likely that Mr. Holder counted every case that had anything to do with financial fraud and put them all under the Operation Broken Trust umbrella.
At the moment, by the looks of the headlines, the government's next big crackdown will be insider trading cases at hedge funds. The government is bringing to bear all its resources, including the F.B.I., which is using wiretaps and raiding offices. But when in recent years have you heard of such maneuvers used on the chief executive of a major corporation?
For those wondering why the government seems to have studiously avoided taking on big companies, I stumbled on a novel theory worth sharing.
Mr. Einhorn, who had his own run-ins with the government when he tried to reveal fraud at Allied Capital and wrote about them in his book, ''Fooling Some of the People All of the Time,'' says he believes the government consciously and strategically does not pursue cases against big companies and officers.
His theory is intriguing. Any case against a big company or officer, he says, inherently ''penalizes the shareholders.'' And the shareholders are the ''little guys'' whom the government is supposedly seeking to protect. Mr. Einhorn makes a good point. While the public lusts for the hanging of a corporate executive, the shareholders would also most likely take the big hit in the wallet.
To Mr. Einhorn, however, the government's approach means shareholders look the other way instead of raising red flags themselves.
He said: ''The problem with trying to give existing shareholders a free ride on whatever's going on'' - that's what he argues the government is doing - ''is that it takes away the incentive for existing shareholders to be worried when they see management misbehaving. It would be a much stronger, self-reinforcing, positive system if when shareholders saw management misbehaving, they were incentivized to call up management and say, 'Please stop misbehaving or something bad is going to happen to my investment.'
''Instead, what they do, implicitly, is encourage the further misbehavior.''
He may be taking his theory a bit too far, but he says he believes the government's strategy, if you want to call it that, stems from ''an embedded belief that they did the wrong thing with Enron and with Arthur Andersen - the criminal prosecution, particularly of Andersen.''
Of course, Mr. Holder and the Justice Department do not agree with Mr. Einhorn's assessment.
But, ultimately, Mr. Holder's Operation Broken Trust should be as much about restoring faith in the markets as it is in the government's ability to police them properly.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
