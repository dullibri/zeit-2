HEADLINE: Skepticism Over U.S. Involvement in Foreign Conflicts

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ALLISON KOPICKI; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Allison Kopicki from New York. Megan Thee-Brenan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Americans are increasingly skeptical about whether the United States should thrust itself into conflicts overseas, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, but that reluctance does not extend to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
After 12 years of war and amid signs of a sustainable economic recovery, nearly six in 10 people said the United States should not take a leading role among all other countries in trying to solve conflicts, the poll found, while only about a third said it should remain at the forefront. 
On Iran, however, the same proportion of people -- 58 percent -- favored the United States taking military action to stop Iran from manufacturing a bomb, an action that President Obama has repeatedly warned the Iranian government is a ''red line'' for the United States.
The support for a more restrained American role has grown markedly since the question was last asked, in April 2003, a month after the invasion of Iraq. And it suggests Mr. Obama is in tune with the public mood in his refusal to be drawn into the bloody civil war in Syria.
''We don't have the finances for it, we have problems of our own, and we have to solve our own issues before we take on everyone else's problems,'' Michael Burt, 54, of Creedmoor, N.C., who worked in hotel security but is now on disability leave, said in a follow-up interview.
Even as Americans signal a desire to draw inward, however, they appear sensitive to the nation's growing vulnerability to attacks on its computer systems. An overwhelming majority said cyberattacks were a very serious or somewhat serious threat, with nearly six in 10 saying the United States is not adequately prepared for them.
More than half of Americans said the United States should never conduct cyberattacks against another country, while about a third said such attacks should be carried out. The Bush and Obama administrations, working with the Israelis, have made covert attacks against Iran's nuclear program.
For Mr. Obama, who shuffled his national-security ranks this week by naming Susan E. Rice as national security adviser, the poll brought a mixed verdict on foreign policy. Forty-five percent approved of his stewardship and 39 percent disapproved.
The administration's handling of the attack on the mission in Benghazi, Libya, continues to cast a shadow. Fifty-three percent of people said it was ''mostly hiding something'' about the attack, while 34 percent said it was ''mostly telling the truth.''
At the same time, people were cynical about the motives of Republicans in denouncing administration officials, including Ms. Rice, over Benghazi. Nearly six in 10 said the criticisms were mainly for political reasons, as opposed to a search for the truth.
When people were quizzed about the level of American engagement in April 2003, 48 percent said the United States should take the lead, while 43 percent said it should not. In the latest poll, only 35 percent said it should take the lead; 58 percent said it should not.
The evolution of those attitudes is in line with some of the ideas that Mr. Obama laid out last month for how the United States should handle counterterrorism in the post-9/11 era -- a strategy that continues to rely on the use of drones. Seventy-two percent of people supported using drones to kill terrorism suspects, though there was significant concern that they kill innocent people and are not subject to adequate oversight.
Mr. Obama's renewed promise to close the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and transfer the inmates found little support, however. Fifty-eight percent of people said it should remain open, while only 34 percent said it should be closed.
The telephone poll was conducted on both landlines and cellphones from May 31 to June 4 with 1,022 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: The New Security Team

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
When President Obama chose Tom Donilon as national security adviser early in his first term, his main national security goals were extricating the United States from costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and keeping the nation safe. Mr. Donilon, who was known more as a political dealmaker than a foreign policy strategist, was steady in executing those goals and in rebalancing American policy more toward Asia. 
In naming Susan Rice as Mr. Donilon's replacement, Mr. Obama has chosen someone with a different managerial style. Ms. Rice, the second woman after Condoleezza Rice to occupy this important position, has a close personal relationship with Mr. Obama, having advised him since his first presidential campaign, and she is more direct and outspoken than the cautious manager she is succeeding.
In policy terms, her task will be to help Mr. Obama go beyond those first-term goals, explain to Americans and the world how he intends to wield American leadership and fulfill his stalled promises, including reducing nuclear weapons, curbing climate change and using foreign aid and other economic tools to help the nations that were changed by the Arab Spring uprisings achieve economic and political stability.
Ms. Rice will be judged not just on the quality of her strategic advice but on whether she can be an honest broker among the other top officials and agencies involved in national security decision-making, and whether she will allow contrary views to be heard. As in most modern administrations, foreign policy is largely driven by the White House; even so, the State Department is an essential part of the process and should not be sidelined. Indeed, Ms. Rice might have found herself running that department had a trumped-up controversy over the Benghazi, Libya, tragedy not caused her to withdraw her name from consideration.
Mr. Obama has nominated Samantha Power, a strong human rights advocate and former White House aide, to replace Ms. Rice as ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Power is likely to confront questions about past statements criticizing Israel's policies during her Senate confirmation.
Both women are seen as liberal interventionists who favor using American power on behalf of humanitarian causes overseas. Both will bring fresh energy to their positions. But it is unlikely they will push Mr. Obama into an unwise intervention in Syria. While Ms. Power is understood to favor a more assertive American role there, Ms. Rice, like Mr. Obama, remains cautious, especially given the absence of reasonable guarantees that proposals like establishing a no-fly zone or arming the deeply dysfunctional array of rebel groups would produce a better outcome.
Ms. Rice's lack of experience in Asia is a weakness, as is her willingness at times to defend dictatorial leaders in Africa. Unlike Ms. Power, she does not need Senate confirmation and will begin her new job next month. It is hard to take seriously the charge that Mr. Obama would name Ms. Rice to this critical job just to spite Republican critics who manufactured the Benghazi controversy. But that controversy exacerbated tensions with Congress, and it will be important for her to try to repair the breach.

HEADLINE: Report Criticizes Federal Stewardship of Wild Horses

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
DENVER -- A new report catalogs a range of problems with the way the federal government is managing thousands of wild horses and burros that roam the American West, supporting the position of animal rights advocates who have long argued that the program is ineffective and needlessly cruel.
The report, conducted by the National Academy of Sciences at the behest of the Bureau of Land Management and released Wednesday, concluded that the bureau's methods of counting the thousands of wild horses and burros that wander rural stretches of the United States were inconsistent and most likely inaccurate. 
It also said that the bureau's policy of removing the animals from the range and taking them to holding facilities as a means of population control, an approach that has drawn sharp criticism from wild horse proponents, did not work. ''Continuing 'business as usual' will be expensive and unproductive for B.L.M. and the public it serves,'' the report said. ''Compelling evidence exists that there are more horses and burros on public rangelands than reported at the national level and that population growth rates are high.''
An icon of frontier mythology, wild horses, which trace their lineage to United States Cavalry horses, workhorses and horses brought by Spanish settlers, have been at the center of an increasingly bitter dispute over the past several years. The bureau contends that their numbers have become unmanageable. And it says it has little choice but to bring them to enclosed pastures so that other animals can share the land. Horse advocates counter that the horses should be allowed to live freely.
The bureau estimates that about 37,300 wild horses and burros roam on federally managed rangeland in 10 Western states and that nearly 50,000 additional animals are being cared for at short-term corrals and long-term pastures. With essentially no natural predators, herds typically double every four years.
The National Academy of Sciences report found that the bureau had most likely undercounted the horses by 10 to 50 percent. It also said that the bureau's horse removals might inadvertently allow the animal population to swell by reducing competition for forage.
The report recommended that more fertility control drugs be used as an alternative, a departure from the bureau's current approach.
''It needs to be used in a consistent, widespread manner, which has not been done today,'' said Dr. Guy Palmer, a veterinarian at Washington State University and the chairman of the committee that conducted the study.
''In theory, you could continue the status quo if the American public is willing to continue to pay for long-term holding pastures,'' Dr. Palmer said. ''However, there are growing concerns that this is economically unsustainable. And that's not what the public expects.''
According to the bureau, the program's budget ballooned to $75 million in 2012 from about $20.4 million in 2000, driven primarily by the rising cost of holding horses and burros.
In its research, the National Academy of Sciences did not specifically address the issue of roundups, which involve helicopters corralling wild horses into traps and have become a rallying cry for critics who say they are dangerous and inhumane. Nonetheless, horse advocates said the findings affirmed their concerns by calling for changes in the program.
''The report is a powerful validation of what wild horse advocates have been saying for years,'' said Suzanne Roy, director of the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign. ''The report delivers a strong case for an immediate halt to the roundup and removal of wild horses from the range, an increase in wild horse and burro population levels and implementation of in-the-wild management using available fertility control options.''
A bureau spokesman, Tom Gorey, said the bureau needed and wanted to do a better job managing the animals, but was well aware the program was in a ''crisis'' because it was running out of holding space. Mr. Gorey also pointed out that because fertility control treatments lasted only one to two years, some horse removals would have to continue.
Leaving the population control to nature, he said, ''would subject horses and burros to mass starvation and dehydration,'' he said. ''We don't think that laissez-faire style is something the American public or Congress would support.''
Mr. Gorey noted that the conclusion that wild horses had been undercounted undermined assertions from animal rights advocates that the program was deliberately overstating the problem ''to disguise an alleged agenda of 'managing for extinction.' ''
In a statement, Neil Kornze, the bureau's principal deputy director, said the bureau was open to more options to better control the wild horse population and help the program become more cost effective. ''Our agency is committed to protecting and managing these iconic animals for current and future generations,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Russia's Newest Dissenters

BYLINE: By VADIM NIKITIN

 BODY:
Late last week, Sergei Guriev, a respected economic adviser to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, announced from Paris that he was not returning to Russia. The former rector of Moscow's liberal New Economic School, where Barack Obama spoke in 2009, had come under investigation from the state prosecutor's office after criticizing the ongoing incarceration of the former Yukos head Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
''I won't go back even if there is a small chance of losing my freedom,'' he told a reporter for this newspaper. ''I have not done anything wrong and do not want to live in fear.'' 
Guriev's self-exile is the latest in a series of recent departures from government by wealthy, educated and Westernized elites who had aligned themselves with the leadership's more liberal Medvedev-led faction, which as become increasingly beleaguered since President Vladimir Putin's controversial re-election in May 2012.
Earlier, the banker Pavel Borodin was granted political asylum in Britain. The American financier William Browder was deported from Russia. Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin's former chief propagandist, was recently dismissed from government and is now also reportedly being investigated.
The most common narrative surrounding the crackdown describes it as a stealth purge against the country's best and brightest.
''We're talking about a major brain drain,'' Tanya Lokshina, deputy director of Moscow's chapter of Human Rights Watch, told The Moscow Times.
But another key characteristic many of these men share is their former loyalty to the government they are now leaving: a stark reminder that Putinism was built with the massive complicity of the country's liberal elite, much of which has stood by the regime through its worst excesses of the past decade.
Apart from the anti-corruption activist Aleksei Navalny and a few other exceptions, like the leftist leader Sergei Udaltsov, many of the high-profile victims of Putin's latest purge had been enthusiastic fellow travelers, even enablers of the regime.
Guriev was a long-time ally of Medvedev. Surkov was the Kremlin's chief ideologue in Putin's first term who constructed the entire ideological carapace that is now being deployed against him. Browder and Pavel Borodin spent years accumulating shady money while talking up Putin to foreign investors until their game was up. For years they reaped the fruits of such collaboration: prestigious government and academic positions, lucrative consultant jobs, the freedom and money to buy property abroad (including, in Guriev's case, a Paris apartment where he is now hiding out).
Is it any wonder that as they begin to turn away from Putin, he would try to destroy them?
As more and more former insiders fall foul of the Kremlin, parallels with the Stalinist purges have begun to appear in the media. In the 1930s, nearly everyone in the government was vulnerable to blackmail for having colluded in earlier rounds of witch hunts against old friends. And those few who hadn't could be safely rounded up anyway -- because no one would believe the possibility of innocence.
East Germany also springs to mind, where Putin's service as a K.G.B. agent may have taught him some old Stasi methods.
Yet there is a key difference between those historical episodes and the present situation: the absence of force. Under communism, people were forced to collaborate with the security services (even then, there were thousands who refused). But in the absence of such totalitarian means of coercion in today's Russia, who or what, apart from his own greed and ambition, made Guriev and those like him shill for the Kremlin for all those years?
''I have no complaints about Vladimir Putin or Dmitri Medvedev,'' Guriev told the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy as late as last week. The statement is telling: Could Guriev really not think of anything to complain about after two rigged elections and at least five years into the largest crackdown on civil rights since the Brezhnev era?
Yet whatever one might think about their principles, there is little doubt that the crackdown on Guriev and others is obscene, politically motivated and entirely at odds with the rule of law. Nothing can justify the Kremlin's treatment of these dissenters, even if they had in many ways set their own traps.
But they should not expect much by way of popular sympathy. After all, during their time in the sun, few of them expressed much concern for the plight of ordinary citizens, many more of whom remain on government hand-outs than have found wealth and success under Putin.
So long as the fallout now suffered by the Guriev class remains a minority affliction, their current travails are unlikely to rouse any major solidarity among their less fortunate countrymen, who have yet to become fully fledged stakeholders in the system. Meanwhile, the crackdown is being framed in much of the Western media as an assault on Russia's best and brightest.
But having arrived at the top by hitching themselves to the Kremlin's leviathan, can the new dissenters really justify such a label, let alone be taken seriously as principled dissenters?

HEADLINE: In Developing Talent, a U.S. Coach Turns to His Roots

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
LA LONDE-LES-MAURES, France -- The midday sun is blazing, the coastal breeze is a blessing, and the data from heart monitors worn by every young American working out in a stadium between the mountains and the Golden Islands will help the coaches to know how far they can prudently push these young players.
''Your first touch is the important one,'' the head coach, Tab Ramos, calls out. 
This trainer is looking for touch, control and movement. Those were the same qualities that marked him out as a player 30 years ago -- and they are core traits for this new generation. Two weeks from now, the United States will kick off against Spain, the favorite to win the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey.
Also in a group with France and Ghana -- among the leaders in world youth soccer -- the young Americans are facing the ultimate test of where they are in the global game. They reached the final of the regional Concacaf Cup, and lost to a penalty goal late in added time against the host Mexico in heat and high altitude. But this is a group of players that Ramos says he would take anywhere, against anyone.
Ramos is not a boastful man. Determined, yes, but there remains in Tab Ramos a hint of the humble lad, the street player, who came out of Montevideo to settle with his family in New Jersey at age 11. Even then, there were good judges of natural talent in New York -- and they could barely ignore the huge and obvious skills in the diminutive child he was then.
After representing the United States at three World Cups and at the Olympic Games -- and finishing a degree in Spanish from North Carolina State via correspondence courses -- the head coach to the Under-20s regards himself as an all-American.
''I have had this crest,'' he says, pointing to the U.S. badge on his shirt, ''for 32 years.''
The pressure on results, a part of the global culture and not simply engrained in the United States, seems to there: Ramos has no contract beyond this summer tournament.
Yet in some ways his work is more intrinsic to developing the United States as a soccer nation than the role that Jürgen Klinsmann holds as the senior men's head coach. The United States is not going to win the next World Cup, or even the one after that.
But 2013 is be the centennial year of the U.S. Soccer Federation. Nobody knows better than Sunil Gulati, a senior lecturer in international trade and economics at Columbia University, and the president of U.S. soccer, that it has been 100 years of playing catch-up in the sport he loves, but that his country has not always taken seriously.
It does now.
Klinsmann might be trying to fill some gaps by seeking out players of his own native German origin, but Ramos is also doing what comes naturally: 8 of the 11 players who pushed Mexico so far in the Concacaf final in March are of Hispanic origin.
Ramos corrects a visitor who describes some of these developing talents -- Daniel Cuevas, Benji Joya, Alonso Hernandez, Mario Rodriguez and others -- as Hispanic or Latino. ''They are Americans who happen to have Hispanic roots,'' he says.
What they have, in Ramos's eyes, is a real American attitude of never being afraid to take on any team on the field. His players are the best he can find, wherever they come from -- players who he believes who can ''be 10 years in the national team for the U.S.''
The Hispanic aspect will not go away. How could it, when the fastest-expanding group in a population that tripled through the 20th century to over 300 million was by far the Latino element? And why would it, with the native love of soccer among Mexicans, Uruguayans, Brazilians and others as natural as drawing breath?
The Census Bureau and the United Nations agree that by the year 2050, the U.S. population will swell again to more than 400 million -- of whom a quarter are likely to have Hispanic roots. And as the United States goes in search of a style for its growing soccer ambition, it would seem logical that the Latino game that suits Argentines and Brazilians and Mexicans well enough will become the American way as well.
Ramos insists that he is looking for the talent and the winning mentality in his players -- and nothing else. Klinsmann talks about seeking out players with hunger for the ball, hunger to compete, and ability to move through the transition between defense and attack that is faster today than it was in his playing time, or Ramos's.
To achieve that, a young player has to possess the ability, and then to develop the strength and speed to receive the ball at great speed against opponents who are coached to deny them the time and space to express those skills.
Ramos believes he actually has a more rewarding job than Klinsmann. ''I get to mold a team,'' he says, stressing the word mold.
Barely a month ago, he became aware of Alonso Hernandez, a 19-year-old out of El Paso, Texas, who suddenly broke into the first-team roster of a leading Mexican club, C.F. Monterrey.
The coach there had worked with Ramos, and Ramos studied video of every second that Hernandez had played before he called him into his squad.
Americans back home made conclusions from the team losing to France, Colombia and South Korea in the Toulon youth tournament this past week -- and beating only the Democratic Republic of Congo. The coach has tried new combinations, with different players while waiting for regular starters to be released by their Major League Soccer clubs.
He committed his players against a French team that fielded other players, and against the physical Congolese, the talented Colombians and the organized Koreans. The target is June 21 in Turkey.
''What we have,'' Ramos concludes, ''is the connection between youth and the senior national team.''
U.S. soccer has been 100 years in the making. There could well be players under Ramos's wing who will break into the World Cup in Brazil just one year from now.

HEADLINE: Karl, Coach of the Year, Is Out of a Job in Denver

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
MIAMI -- The Denver Nuggets parted ways with George Karl on Thursday, adding an unexpected jolt to an unusually hyperactive N.B.A. coaching carousel.
Karl was dismissed with a year left on his contract, and just 29 days after he was named coach of the year for leading the Nuggets a 57-25 record -- the franchise's best mark since entering the N.B.A.
He does not figure to be unemployed for long. Six teams are searching for head coaches, and Karl is already drawing interest from the Los Angeles Clippers and the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nets, who are also in the market for a coach, are not expected to pursue Karl, according to a person familiar with their search. 
Karl, 62, is the 11th head coach to lose his job since the start of the season. That figure will probably rise to a dozen if the Grizzlies, as expected, let Lionel Hollins leave. Those two could end up trading places, with Hollins now high on the Nuggets' list of candidates.
It is also possible that Minnesota's Rick Adelman, who took a leave of absence this past season to be with his ailing wife, might resign.
That would make 13 teams changing coaches between opening night of 2012 and opening night of 2013, tying an N.B.A. high, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
There were 13 head coaching changes in 2003 and 2005, according to Elias. There have been three years -- 1992, 1997 and 2004 -- in which 12 teams changed coaches.
Karl joined the Nuggets in the middle of the 2004-5 season and presided over five 50-win campaigns and eight trips to the playoffs. The Nuggets made it out of the first round only once, however, despite a lineup featuring Carmelo Anthony. Denver traded Anthony to the Knicks in 2011.
This past season was among the Nuggets' finest, as Karl guided a roster devoid of a single star to the fourth-best record in the league. But it ended on a sour note, as the Nuggets -- without their injured No. 2 scorer, Danilo Gallinari -- fell to the Golden State Warriors in the first round.
Karl was reportedly seeking a contract extension and, according to reports, was also flirting with the Clippers, irritating Nuggets ownership. His departure comes just a week after the Nuggets lost General Manager Masai Ujiri -- named the N.B.A. executive of the year -- to the Toronto Raptors.
Karl, who ranks sixth on the career list with 1,131 wins, now becomes the hottest name on the coaching market. Hollins and Brian Shaw, the Indiana Pacers' associate head coach, are the other two most popular candidates.
In addition to the Nets, the Nuggets, the Clippers and the Grizzlies, the other teams with vacancies are the Detroit Pistons and the Philadelphia 76ers.
STERN STILL BACKS SPURS FINE Seven months after Gregg Popovich sent home four starters, riling the league and drawing a $250,000 fine, the San Antonio Spurs are in the finals -- a result that could be viewed as vindication.
After all, Popovich, the Spurs' coach, said he made the decision to preserve his 30-something stars, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker, who had broken down in prior seasons. But Popovich also sent home Danny Green, a much younger starter, leaving a lineup of second-stringers to battle the Miami Heat for a nationally televised game on Nov. 29.
Seven months later, Commissioner David Stern still feels justified in fining the Spurs for the move.
''Pop is a great coach, a Hall of Famer and a visionary,'' Stern said in his annual N.B.A. finals news conference. ''But on this one, he wasn't resting Danny Green. It was a game that was being played. I know it, you know it and he knows it. And maybe the game is successful.''
Stern was referring to the idea that Popovich was taking a stand against the N.B.A.'s schedule, which had the Spurs playing four road games in five nights that week. In fining the franchise, Stern cited a higher priority: guaranteeing ticket-buyers the best possible product.
He said the N.B.A. has ''some obligation to our fans'' to guarantee ''that if you buy a ticket for a particular team, that you might see a representative sample of that team.''
Stern added: ''Of course, I would never, never tell a coach that he shouldn't rest a player that needs rest. We understand that completely. And that's not what we did.''
On other topics, Stern said the league would consider expanding the use of instant replay -- perhaps with an off-site official reviewing plays, instead of the on-court officials -- and stronger penalties to deter flopping.
This was the N.B.A.'s first season with an anti-flopping policy, with public warnings and fines used to discourage players from embellishing contact in an effort to fool the referees. It appeared to reduce the amount of acting during the regular season, but flopping took a prominent role in the Eastern Conference finals between the Heat and the Indiana Pacers, an indication that flopping cannot be eliminated when the stakes are high.
''It isn't enough,'' Stern said of the $5,000 fine for a first offense. ''You're not going to cause somebody to stop it for $5,000 when the average player's salary is $5.5 million. And anyone who thought that was going to happen was allowing hope to prevail over reason. But you take a step and you begin to see it.''
Stern said the league's competition committee and owners would consider a more stringent policy, but added, ''I don't know if we have the stomach.''
This was Stern's last finals address before his scheduled retirement next February. He eschewed any sentimental ruminations but said he was pleased with the matchup of the Spurs and the Heat, calling it ''probably the best that I could possibly expect for my last finals.''

HEADLINE: North and South Korea Agree to First Official Dialogue in Years

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North and South Korea agreed Thursday to hold their first government dialogue in years, an abrupt change after tensions over the North's nuclear program this year escalated into one of the divided peninsula's worst crises.
The announcement raised hopes that the two countries were moving toward a thaw in relations after a prolonged standoff in recent years that included military provocations from the North and retaliatory economic penalties from the South. 
The agreement came after North Korea made a surprise overture on Thursday, proposing official negotiations with the South on reopening two shuttered joint economic projects, including the recently closed Kaesong industrial park, as well as humanitarian programs. South Korea, which has demanded such talks in recent months, quickly accepted the offer, proposing a cabinet minister-level meeting in the South Korean capital, Seoul, next Wednesday.
North Korea on Friday welcomed the quick response from the South and proposed working-level talks in Kaesong on Sunday to prepare for the proposed cabinet-level meeting. It also said it was restoring cross-border communications lines it had cut off earlier this year out of anger over joint United States-South Korean military drills.
The sudden change comes a day before President Obama's scheduled meeting in California with President Xi Jinping of China, North Korea's main ally. The North's recent belligerence -- including threats of nuclear attacks if provoked -- was expected to be a main topic of discussion.
Last month, Mr. Xi told a high-level North Korean envoy visiting Beijing that the North needed to return to international talks aimed at ending its nuclear program, which is becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous. Analysts on Thursday cast the North's latest move as a possible political gambit to ensure its benefactors in China do not bond with Mr. Obama over North Korea's defiance.
''It is trying to shift the international focus from applying sanctions and pressure on the North to starting dialogue with it,'' said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.
The Chinese, who have grown increasingly frustrated with their recalcitrant ally, not only backed United Nations sanctions over the North's nuclear test in February, they have also taken public steps to confront North Korea including ordering the Bank of China to stop dealing with the North's largest foreign-exchange bank.
Analysts suggested that another motivation in trying to reopen the joint ventures with South Korea is to generate badly needed revenue. Kaesong's factories, which paired North Korean workers with South Korean capital and management, alone generated $90 million in hard currency each year for its workers; experts say the state took much of that money.
The eight-year-old complex, the last symbol of inter-Korean cooperation from years of warmer relations, was closed after North Korea pulled out all its 53,000 workers in April amid the latest crisis.
The overtures on Thursday and Friday were among the few conciliatory moves made by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, who has made his mark during a year and a half in power by defying the United States and South Korea.
The Obama administration said it welcomed news of the North-South dialogue. ''We support, and have always supported, improved inter-Korean relationship, and we will continue our close coordination with our allies and partners in the region,'' the State Department's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said. Still, the overtures could complicate American strategy, which has been hard-line and focused on economic punishments to force the North to make real concessions on its nuclear program.
North Korea also proposed resuming cross-border tours from South Korea to a North Korean mountain resort that were suspended after North Korean soldiers fatally shot a tourist from the South in 2008, and reviving programs for arranging the temporary reunions of Korean families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.
Until Thursday, North Korea had rejected the South's repeated call for official dialogue to discuss the fate of the Kaesong park.
''We hope the government-to-government talks will become an opportunity to build trust between the South and North,'' the South's Unification Ministry said in a statement.
North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, meanwhile, said, ''Our position has been consistent for promoting the reconciliation and solidarity of the nation and achieving reunification and peaceful prosperity.'' It added, ''The South's authorities should not miss this opportunity if they really want to build trust and improve North-South relations.''
The North, analysts said, appears to be seeking a return to the level of inter-Korean economic cooperation that had prevailed on the peninsula for a decade until 2008. They said that the North Korean proposal could force the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, a conservative, to decide whether to revive the inter-Korean projects without any progress in denuclearizing North Korea. In a speech on Thursday, Ms. Park, who is slated to meet Mr. Xi late this month, reiterated her stance that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons to open the way for the international community to ease sanctions and help with its economy.
Some analysts were skeptical of any long-term change. ''There is no fundamental change in their positions,'' said Dong Yong-seung, a North Korea specialist at the Samsung Economic Research Institute. ''Denuclearization remains a stumbling block.''
The Obama administration has been leery of returning to the international talks the Chinese are pushing again; in the past, the North moved ahead with its nuclear programs despite talks and considerable investment from South Korea. Washington has also said it wants North Korea to improve ties with South Korea first, before reviving the international talks that involve six countries.
The proposal by North Korea indicated that it was meeting at least part of Washington's demands.

HEADLINE: The Spite Club

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
House Republicans have voted 37 times to repeal ObamaRomneyCare -- the Affordable Care Act, which creates a national health insurance system similar to the one Massachusetts has had since 2006. Nonetheless, almost all of the act will go fully into effect at the beginning of next year.
There is, however, one form of obstruction still available to the G.O.P. Last year's Supreme Court decision upholding the law's constitutionality also gave states the right to opt out of one piece of the plan, a federally financed expansion of Medicaid. Sure enough, a number of Republican-dominated states seem set to reject Medicaid expansion, at least at first. 
And why would they do this? They won't save money. On the contrary, they will hurt their own budgets and damage their own economies. Nor will Medicaid rejectionism serve any clear political purpose. As I'll explain later, it will probably hurt Republicans for years to come.
No, the only way to understand the refusal to expand Medicaid is as an act of sheer spite. And the cost of that spite won't just come in the form of lost dollars; it will also come in the form of gratuitous hardship for some of our most vulnerable citizens.
Some background: Obamacare rests on three pillars. First, insurers must offer the same coverage to everyone regardless of medical history. Second, everyone must purchase coverage -- the famous ''mandate'' -- so that the young and healthy don't opt out until they get older and/or sicker. Third, premiums will be subsidized, so as to make insurance affordable for everyone. And this system is going into effect next year, whether Republicans like it or not.
Under this system, by the way, a few people -- basically young, healthy individuals who don't already get insurance from their employers, and whose incomes are high enough that they won't benefit from subsidies -- will end up paying more for insurance than they do now. Right-wingers are hyping this observation as if it were some kind of shocking surprise, when it was, in fact, well-known to everyone from the beginning of the debate. And, as far as anyone can tell, we're talking about a small number of people who are, by definition, relatively well off.
Back to the Medicaid expansion. Obamacare, as I've just explained, relies on subsidies to make insurance affordable for lower-income Americans. But we already have a program, Medicaid, providing health coverage to very-low-income Americans, at a cost private insurers can't match. So the Affordable Care Act, sensibly, relies on an expansion of Medicaid rather than the mandate-plus-subsidy arrangement to guarantee care to the poor and near-poor.
But Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, and the Supreme Court made it possible for states to opt out of the expansion. And it appears that a number of states will take advantage of that ''opportunity.'' What will that mean?
A new study from the RAND Corporation, a nonpartisan research institution, examines the consequences if 14 states whose governors have declared their opposition to Medicaid expansion do, in fact, reject the expansion. The result, the study concluded, would be a huge financial hit: the rejectionist states would lose more than $8 billion a year in federal aid, and would also find themselves on the hook for roughly $1 billion more to cover the losses hospitals incur when treating the uninsured.
Meanwhile, Medicaid rejectionism will deny health coverage to roughly 3.6 million Americans, with essentially all of the victims living near or below the poverty line. And since past experience shows that Medicaid expansion is associated with significant declines in mortality, this would mean a lot of avoidable deaths: about 19,000 a year, the study estimated.
Just think about this for a minute. It's one thing when politicians refuse to spend money helping the poor and vulnerable; that's just business as usual. But here we have a case in which politicians are, in effect, spending large sums, in the form of rejected aid, not to help the poor but to hurt them.
And as I said, it doesn't even make sense as cynical politics. If Obamacare works (which it will), millions of middle-income voters -- the kind of people who might support either party in future elections -- will see major benefits, even in rejectionist states. So rejectionism won't discredit health reform. What it might do, however, is drive home to lower-income voters -- many of them nonwhite -- just how little the G.O.P. cares about their well-being, and reinforce the already strong Democratic advantage among Latinos, in particular.
Rationally, in other words, Republicans should accept defeat on health care, at least for now, and move on. Instead, however, their spitefulness appears to override all other considerations. And millions of Americans will pay the price.

HEADLINE: Obama and Xi Must Think Broadly to Avoid a Classic Trap

BYLINE: By GRAHAM T. ALLISON Jr.. 
Graham T. Allison Jr. is the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School.

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- AS President Obama welcomes China's new president, Xi Jinping, for an informal ''shirt-sleeves'' summit meeting in California on Friday, the bureaucracies of both governments must be quivering. Each will have prepared a long list of issues for its country's leader to discuss, from cyberattacks and trade disputes to North Korean antics and competing claims in the seas near China. Talking points have been drafted, and many hope that a historic communiqué is in the works.
But if that's all that happens, this summit meeting will have been a huge missed opportunity. Let us hope that these two leaders will rise above their bureaucracies' narrow goals to confront the overarching challenge facing the two most important nations in the world. 
Simply put, can the United States and China escape Thucydides Trap?
In 11 of 15 cases since 1500 in which a rising power rivaled a ruling power, the outcome was war. Can Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi successfully defy those odds?
More than 2,000 years ago, Thucydides, the Athenian general and historian, offered a brilliant insight about the cause of the Peloponnesian War when he identified not one but two variables in such cases. As he famously wrote: ''It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable.''
Thucydides knew it was more complicated than that. But readers today should ask themselves the following: how could a peripheral clash between the cities of Corinth and Corcyra in the fifth century B.C. have triggered a cascade that ended in catastrophe for both Athenians and Spartans? It is the dynamic inherent when a rising power becomes more confident, a ruling power fears losing its edge, and entangling alliances on each side drive the parties toward war.
It is a pattern we have seen before. Turn the clock back 100 years. In 1913, a rising Germany challenged the existing power, Britain, which had for a century been accustomed to ruling the waves. A best-selling book, Norman Angell's ''The Great Illusion,'' published in 1909, proclaimed that modern war was obsolete: nations had become so economically entangled that the cost of conflict would clearly swamp any benefits an aggressor could hope to achieve . Andrew Carnegie, the Bill Gates of his era, was completing construction of the Peace Palace in The Hague, to oversee what he believed would be an era of perpetual peace. As he said in a letter to his closest friends, ''We send this New Year Greeting, January 1, 1914, strong in the faith that international Peace is soon to prevail.''
Six months later, the assassination of an archduke in Sarajevo by a Serbian terrorist ignited what became the First World War. Thucydides Trap -- rapidly rising powers, fearful ruling powers and their tangle of alliances -- launched Europe into the abyss. By 1918, all of the major original contestants were devastated: Kaiser Wilhelm II gone, the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved, the Czar Nicholas II deposed by the Bolsheviks, and both France and England shorn of the flower of their youth and treasure.
The point is not that war between the United States and China is inevitable. Consider one of the few success stories in which a rising power eclipsed a ruling one without war: the United States and Britain, beginning in the late 19th century. Their so-called great rapprochement emerged from a long period of mistrust and hostility that stands in contrast to modern perceptions of their cultural similarities, mutual affection and inherently shared interests. But this peaceful outcome depended largely on factors absent today: recognition by the ruling power of the time that, having no strong allies near the United States and facing a bigger threat from another rising power closer to home, it could not constrain the rise of the challenger and should instead accommodate American desires as much as possible.
Today, we must recognize that China's extraordinary rise and the discombobulation this inevitably poses to America (which has come to believe that it is naturally No. 1) constitute a historic challenge. Under these conditions, business-as-usual, bureaucracy-as-usual and leadership-as-usual have typically produced war. Preventing war in this case, therefore, will require super-ordinary efforts by leaders of both countries -- not just at a single summit, but over a generation.
Do Presidents Xi and Obama get it? Does each understand that successful management of relations between the sole superpower of today and a rising future superpower is not simply a matter of resolving one thing after another -- but rather a challenge of Thucydidean proportions?
There are reasons for hoping the answer may be yes. China's leaders have studied the historical record of rising states. A decade ago, the topic for a collective study session by the Politburo was a ''Historical Investigation of the Development of the World's Main Powers since the 15th Century.'' As Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister of Singapore, has noted: ''In the security arena, the Chinese understand that the U.S. has spent so much more and has built up such advantages that direct challenges would be futile. Not until China has overtaken the U.S. in the development and application of technology can they envisage confronting the U.S. militarily.''
Against this backdrop, Mr. Xi called for a ''new type of great power relations'' when he visited the United States last year, as he prepared to assume the leadership of China. Both leaders now have an opportunity, and a responsibility, to make this aspiration a reality, not just a slogan.
President Obama's decision to invite the new leader of China to spend a weekend talking candidly about mutual hopes and fears represents a great leap forward in diplomacy. Both presidents know that for each of them, the highest priority is nation-building at home.
Still, history will judge this meeting not in terms of resolution of specific issues but rather on whether the leaders begin a serious conversation about building a new type of relationship between the two superpowers that bridges their rivalries and allows them to escape Thucydides Trap.

HEADLINE: Markets Give Up Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded late Thursday, after the Dow Jones industrial average briefly dropped more than 100 points and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped below its 50-day moving average. 
By the end of trading, the S.&P. was up 0.9 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq was up 0.7 percent.
Investors were looking ahead to Friday's nonfarm payroll report from the Department of Labor, which will not only give insight into the strength of the economic recovery, but could also provide a clue into how long the Federal Reserve will keep its stimulus policy intact.
Today's session ended two consecutive days of market decline based on concerns that the Federal Reserve might scale back its bond-buying stimulus before the economy is strong enough to stand on its own.
Economic data showed weekly initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 11,000, to a seasonally adjusted 346,000. Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast a total of 345,000 new filings compared with 354,000 in the previous week. On Friday, the Labor Department presents its nonfarm payrolls report for May.
''If you are bullish and you think it's a better-than-expected number tomorrow, you are putting some money to work, if you are worried the jobs numbers are going to be soggy, you are staying put for now,'' said Joseph P. Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management in New York.
The ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed that private employers accelerated hiring in May from the previous month, but the gains fell short of expectations.
The S.&P. 500 had run up to a record high on May 21, partly on the belief that softer economic data would ensure that the Fed would keep its stimulus measures in place, as opposed to scaling them back earlier than expected.

HEADLINE: Advocate In Myanmar Hopes to Seek Presidency

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar -- Yes, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would like to be president of Myanmar.
Since her election to Parliament last year, the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and the leader of Myanmar's opposition has alternately dodged the issue, parried it with rhetorical questions of her own and more recently answered with what sounded like a qualified yes.
But on Thursday, speaking to an audience of foreign business executives, she was explicit and unequivocal about her political ambitions. 
''I want to run for president,'' she told a room packed with executives at a meeting hosted by the World Economic Forum here. ''If I pretended that I didn't want to be president I wouldn't be honest. And I would rather be honest with my people than otherwise.''
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was jailed by the military for the better part of two decades, and her ascension to the presidency would be a kind of Mandela moment for this impoverished and formerly hermetic country that is now opening to the world.
Unlike previous occasions when she was asked about the presidency -- including during recent trips to the United States and Japan -- Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi also laid out her intentions in the Burmese language on Thursday. Burmese journalists said this was a first.
''It's natural that a leader of a political party says he or she is ready to lead the country and the government,'' she said in Burmese.
She also did not hesitate to answer the question in the presence of the man analysts presume would be her rival for the office, Thura Shwe Mann, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament.
By the end of the day, after journalists had lobbed a number of follow-up questions at her, she said she was wary of discussing the subject further.
''I'm getting a little bit tired of this presidency business,'' she said.
Even before her comments on Thursday there was little doubt among political analysts in Myanmar that she aspired to the presidency in elections that are scheduled for 2015. In recent months she has surprised some of her followers by wooing the country's powerful military, her former jailers, whose support she needs to change the Constitution. (Under current rules, her marriage to a foreigner -- her husband was English -- disqualifies her from the presidency.)
The 2015 elections threaten the dominance of the party formed by former military officers that currently holds the majority of seats in Parliament.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi commands allegiance verging on idolization among her ethnic group, the Burman, who make up about two-thirds of Myanmar's population of 55 million.
But over the past year she has been accused by ethnic minorities in the country and by foreign human rights organizations of playing politics and pandering to the Buddhist majority. She has been criticized for her oblique and restrained reaction to the repeated eruptions of violence against Muslims that have killed more than 200 people and displaced well over 100,000. The violence has been led by Buddhist mobs.
On Thursday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not dispute that she had been muted in reacting to the violence. Asked about the killings in western Myanmar, she said she was afraid of stoking the violence and giving fodder to the ''more extremist elements in these communities.''
''I do not want to aggravate the situation by saying that one community is wrong or the other community is wrong,'' she said. ''If they have not enjoyed the sympathy of politicians or influential groups then it makes them more extremist.''
She said she was seeking to avoid ''a vicious cycle of people getting more and more aggressive and more and more extremist.''
As a measure of the distance that the country has traveled since Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest in 2010, one of the country's most powerful ministers, U Soe Thane, shared the stage with her in a debate, and referred to her as ''my respectable elder sister.''

HEADLINE: Down So Long, It Looks Like Up to the Euro Zone

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- This is what passes for good economic news in Europe: Spain just added 265 jobs.
''Clearly encouraging,'' the nation's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said of the development.
Never mind that nearly five million people in Spain are out of work. The latest unemployment report from the government, issued on Tuesday, was held up by Mr. Rajoy as a sign that maybe, just maybe, the economy is getting better.
Nearly six years after the financial crisis in the United States spread across the Atlantic, plunging Europe into recession and, in some places, desperate depression, ''good'' is relative. Economic figures that would be considered disastrous elsewhere are being held up by many politicians and policy makers as really not so bad at all -- the first tender shoots of a recovery that is out there somewhere. 
Or perhaps not. Politicians everywhere rarely tire of talking up the economy. The question is whether the supposed good news that European leaders are trumpeting is merely convenient cover. The risk -- not only to Europe, but to the rest of the world -- is that they are simply hoping they have done enough to restore growth, and that the hard decisions some say must still be made can be pushed into the future.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, defying calls for bolder action. Even so, Mario Draghi, the president of the bank, highlighted the potential ''downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area.''
What few politicians acknowledge publicly is that many of the steps that economists say must still be taken are surefire vote-losers. Liberalizing rigid labor markets, for instance, might spur growth and help young people break into the work force. But it would surely alienate voters who end up losing jobs they thought they had for life.
''Policy makers have a strong interest in the current strategy's appearing to work,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ''Even the faintest glimmer of hope is interpreted as a sign of recovery.''
Mr. Tilford said Europe was trapped in a Japanese-style malaise. ''There's a surreal debate going on that if we don't do A, B or C there's a risk Europe will be like Japan,'' he said. ''If you look at the data for the last six years, Europe is already worse.''
The danger is that a sense of economic decline has become so ingrained that mediocrity is mistaken for excellence and the status quo marketed as a forward march. Germany, the economic envy of Europe, is expected to grow a mere 0.3 percent this year -- a blistering pace only by the new standards of underachievement.
Financially, Europe looks less risky than it did a year ago, when fear was rampant that the euro might fall apart. Bond markets have calmed down. Unemployment is declining, albeit very slowly, in a few countries like Spain and Ireland.
During a visit to Athens last week, the Dutch finance minister said he detected ''the first signal of a turn in the economy.'' Then, on Wednesday, news arrived from Brussels that the Greek economy was indeed getting better. It shrank by only -- only -- 5.3 percent in the first three months of the year. That was in fact an improvement: it had contracted 5.7 percent the previous quarter.
The financial markets, which have bounced back from their lows, don't fully capture the economic pain many Europeans feel. That is because financial markets ride on hope and look forward, not back. Germany's benchmark DAX index of stocks, for instance, has risen 39 percent in the last year, even though that nation's economy, while strong for Europe, is hardly humming along. On Thursday, European stocks were off just modestly, despite the weak outlook from the central bank.
As worries continue about the long-term future of Europe and its currency, the euro, some analysts worry that the good news, such as it is, might be too good. Signs of growth could prompt a sell-off in European bond markets, driving up interest rates at a time when economies are still fragile.
But for many Europeans, that isn't the big worry. The economy of the euro zone has been shrinking for a year and a half, and the Continent is less wealthy than it was in 2008. Euro area governments are still under pressure to cut spending, even if the budgeteers in Brussels last week granted France, Spain, Portugal and four other countries a little extra time to get their books in order.
The consulting firm Ernst & Young on Wednesday published a survey showing that foreign companies investing in Europe created about 170,000 new jobs in 2012, an 8 percent increase over 2011. But the total value of foreign direct investment to Europe, including Britain and Eastern Europe, plunged by 36 percent to $293.5 billion -- double the decline worldwide. Foreign businesses, in other words, remained deeply cautious about investing in Europe's future.
Even if the euro zone economy does stop declining, that does not mean it will grow. It could simply hit bottom and stay there.
If that happens, there may be few easy options.
German voters remain unwilling to support common euro zone bonds or other large aid programs for troubled countries. And the European Central Bank remains unlikely to begin pumping money into the economy as the United States Federal Reserve and, even more so, the Bank of Japan have done, because of divisions on the central bank's policy-making Governing Council.
As a result, political leaders have little choice but to continue the laborious, politically risky task of remaking their economies so that they can compete in world markets and create jobs.
''There is still more work to be done,'' said Martin van Vliet, senior euro zone economist at ING Bank in Amsterdam. ''Countries will have to make new reforms, and those are very unpopular.''
How will we know when the euro zone is really on the mend? The true measure is jobs, Mr. van Vliet said.
When real employment growth resumes in Southern Europe, ''then I am willing to declare the worst is behind us,'' he said. ''Until then I am not so sure.''

HEADLINE: Europe Continues Wrestling With Online Privacy Rules

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and SOMINI SENGUPTA; James Kanter reported from Brussels and Somini Sengupta from San Francisco.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- More than a year ago, the European Union's top justice official proposed a tough set of measures for protecting the privacy of personal data online.
But because of intense lobbying by Silicon Valley companies and other powerful groups in Brussels, several proposals have been softened, no agreement is in sight and governments are openly sparring with one another over how far to go in protecting privacy.
On Thursday, justice ministers from the European Union's 27 member states agreed to a business-friendly proposal that what companies do with personal data would be scrutinized by regulators only if there were ''risks'' to individuals, including identity theft or discrimination. 
The ministers debated a proposal that would no longer require companies to obtain ''explicit'' consent from users whose personal data they collect and process, instead of ''unambiguous'' consent, which is considered to be a lower legal threshold. And they discussed a proposal on balancing an individual's right to data protection with other rights, including the freedom to do business.
The ministers deferred discussion of the other most fractious provision, the so-called right to be forgotten. But in recent weeks, public comments by lawmakers and draft language suggested a softening of approach.
''The right to be forgotten has been softened, made more palatable,'' said Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, professor of Internet governance at the University of Oxford. ''But it is by no means dead.''
Although a final version of the legislation is not expected to be completed for many months, and maybe not until next year, the developments on Thursday are an early signal that the technology industry's lobbying efforts are gaining some traction.
The lobbying has been ''exceptional'' and legislators in Europe need ''to guard against undue pressure from industry and third countries to lower the level of data protection that currently exists,'' said Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor, referring to countries outside of the European Union.
''The benefits for industry should not and do not need to be at the expense of our fundamental rights to privacy and data protection,'' Mr. Hustinx warned in e-mailed comments.
In the last year, American technology companies have dispatched representatives to Brussels and issued white papers through industry associations arguing that stringent privacy regulations would hamstring businesses, already suffering from the recession in Europe.
United States government officials have also made trips across the Atlantic to press policy makers like Viviane Reding, the union's justice commissioner, who drafted the original, strict measures, to press for a less restrictive approach to data privacy.
The industry's arguments have found a ready audience among some European governments. They include Ireland and Britain, where there are acute worries that the European Union is failing to take advantage of growth opportunities from Internet businesses that might help revive the economy. Apple, Facebook and Google all have European headquarters in Dublin.
''Europe is not sleepwalking into unworkable regulations,'' said Richard Allan, Facebook's director of policy for Europe, echoing a cautious optimism among industry officials about the data privacy law. ''What's positive is that over the last year, the debate has broadened out. There are other voices in the debate, who are saying: 'Hang on a minute. What about the economic crisis?' ''
The proposed law would affect most companies that deal in personal information -- including pictures posted on social networks or information on what people buy on retail sites or look for using a search engine.
Whatever is enacted would serve as the privacy law in every country in the European Union and potentially have a bearing on other countries drafting data protection laws of their own.
The ministers took up their version of the law on Thursday; another version is under discussion by the European Parliament.
The Parliament is considering its version while intense lobbying is being conducted by companies, governments and other organizations that have submitted about 4,000 amendments. The various versions will need to be reconciled before they can become law.
''Ultimately, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,'' Alan Shatter, the Irish justice minister, who was the chairman of Thursday's meeting, told his colleagues.
The liberal-leaning language on obtaining consent from Web users was suggested by the Irish. Another provision the Irish suggested would remove the restriction on companies to collect only a ''minimum'' amount of data. That could be important for any company that wants to use the data it collects in new ways.
But Chris Grayling, the British justice secretary, said those concessions were not enough. He said the rules were still overly burdensome for European businesses, along with United States technology giants.
Although the most contentious provision -- the right to be forgotten -- did not come up on Thursday, language is circulating that could limit it. The provision as originally conceived would enable users to demand that their accumulated data be deleted forever. But it has raised questions about what to do with data that is in turn shared with third-party companies.
The softer language would tweak it so that the data may not necessarily disappear from the Internet as a whole, but be scrubbed from the site where it was originally posted.
The shift, said David A. Hoffman, global privacy officer for Intel, shows ''a much greater degree of nuance.''
Mr. Hoffman added, ''They are going to move it much closer to a more limited, balanced ability for individuals to access their data and then to request their data be corrected, amended or deleted.''
That is fairly close to what exists in most European countries now.
Also still to be debated are the sanctions for breaking the law, which could include fines of up to 2 percent of a company's annual worldwide sales.
Ms. Reding sharply disagreed with some of the modifications put forth by the Irish. And she won strong backing during the meeting from Italy and France for maintaining robust rules requiring companies to give consumers every chance to guard their privacy online.
The French justice minister, Christiane Taubira, said at the meeting: ''Not saying anything is not the same thing as saying yes, so we think it's very important that we have explicit consent. We have to protect people.''

HEADLINE: Obama Urged To Prod China On Rights At Meeting

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A year ago the fate of Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese activist spirited into the American Embassy in Beijing, threatened to upend the Obama administration's careful cultivation of China's leaders before an important annual meeting between the two governments. On Thursday, Mr. Chen joined relatives of prominent political prisoners and 30 organizations in calling on President Obama to use his summit meeting in California this weekend with President Xi Jinping to highlight the issue of human rights abuses in China.
In a letter to Mr. Obama and in a briefing here, the organizations tried to draw attention to an issue that has been largely overshadowed ahead of the meetings by thorny questions about the two countries' economic and military relationships and pressing international issues like Syria, Iran and North Korea. They urged Mr. Obama to appeal for the release of 16 prominent prisoners jailed for political reasons, including Liu Xiaobo, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. 
The campaign, echoed by statements and letters by members of Congress, underscored the balance that Mr. Obama, like previous presidents, has tried to strike, at times awkwardly, between engaging China as a rising economic and diplomatic power and championing Chinese advocating for political or religious freedoms.
''They are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg among hundreds of thousands of cases,'' said Mr. Chen, a lawyer who had been placed under illegal house arrest before he made a daring escape to the American Embassy last year. He spoke through a computer link from New York, where he settled after the administration negotiated his release. His remarks were translated by Bob Fu, the pastor and president of ChinaAid, a group in Texas that champions the rights of Christians in China.
''So we should work together and join hands together to free them,'' Mr. Chen added, arguing that human rights, not economic and trade issues, should be at the center of Mr. Obama's agenda during his meeting.
The White House has portrayed the informal meeting with Mr. Xi, which begins Friday afternoon at a 200-acre estate outside Palm Springs, Calif., as an opportunity for the two leaders to develop a personal relationship. Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi have set aside several hours for meetings and meals that are intended to be less scripted than typical meetings between world leaders.
Todd Stein of the International Campaign for Tibet said that Mr. Obama had spoken out on universal freedoms, as other presidents have done, but that the question he faced was how to raise them in an effective way with China's new leader, who has pledged to respect the rule of law. ''It's really in the mechanics of the summit and how he conveys that message,'' Mr. Stein said.
One senior administration official complained that the summit meeting would begin only days after the disclosure that the United States had compiled an enormous database of telephone and computer records -- as the State Department has been urging countries in the Middle East and Africa against creating intrusive domestic surveillance programs to combat terrorism. ''The parallels the Chinese can draw to their own surveillance programs are stark,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. ''The optics of this are very damaging.''
A White House spokeswoman, Caitlin M. Heydan, said that Mr. Obama would raise human rights during the meetings. She would not discuss individual cases.
China's leaders have always denounced American criticism of abuses as interference in its internal affairs. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Xi, who became president in March, will approach the issue differently.
For years the United States has included blistering criticism of China's record in its annual reports on human rights and religious freedom. Mr. Obama has been far less pointed in his public remarks, prompting critics to accuse him of undermining the issue. Advocates here in Washington highlighted several of the 16 cases in poignantly personal terms.
''We all know how dangerous it is to get our hopes up,'' said Ti-Anna Wang, who described the life imprisonment of her father, Wang Bingzhang, a campaigner for democracy who was a United States resident when he returned to China and was jailed over strong American protests.

HEADLINE: Bill Would Sweeten Loans for Energy-Efficient Homes

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Home buyers purchasing energy-efficient properties could qualify for larger mortgages than their incomes would normally allow under a Senate bill reintroduced Thursday with broad real estate industry support.
The measure would allow lenders to include projected energy savings from efficiency upgrades when measuring the borrower's income against expenses and the value of the home against the debt. In addition to giving borrowers larger loans in new purchases and refinancings, it could also lower their interest rates.
Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia who worked in the real estate industry for 33 years and introduced the bill with Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, said that consumers should get credit for energy-saving construction materials, which are often ''out of sight and out of mind and are not valued.'' Decreasing the amount of energy a home uses, he said in an interview, increases ''the amount of dollars in the pockets of the homeowners.'' 
The government already promotes so-called energy-efficient mortgages under a Department of Housing and Urban Development program. But the proposed legislation would require lenders to take the projected energy savings into account when presented with a qualified energy report. The senators originally introduced the bill in 2011, and although it attracted support from groups across a broad political spectrum -- including the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Center for American Progress -- it failed to gain approval. The sponsors have broadened its appeal within the real estate industry, chiefly by eliminating provisions that could have penalized older, less efficient homes or those lacking a report based on estimated energy consumption.
How the bill will fare this time around is unclear. Its proponents in the Senate say they are hopeful it could pass, possibly as part of a comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, and Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. The proponents say the changes could curtail energy use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the market for conservation upgrades.
The legislation would apply to loans guaranteed by the federal agencies that collectively back roughly 90 percent of new mortgages.
In the absence of a home energy report, which would come from an approved third-party inspector, the home's energy use would not become a factor. But lenders would provide applicants with information about the benefits of investing in energy-saving upgrades and counsel them on how they could go about doing so.
''Really we're just talking about disclosure here,'' Sean Babington, legislative counsel on energy and natural resources for Senator Bennet, said in an interview. ''For years you've had to disclose if there are termites in your house or if you have radon gas in your basement. You bring an inspector out to make sure the foundation's not cracked. Here we have something that probably over the life of the home costs the homeowner orders of magnitude more than all those problems, and we totally ignore it.''
According to Senator Bennet's office, a household's average energy costs can run to more than $70,000 over the life of a 30-year loan, more than the real estate taxes and insurance payments that are already taken into account during the underwriting process. Investments in insulated hollow-core doors, double-pane windows and insulated floor-joist systems above crawl spaces can reduce the average home's bill by at least 30 percent, a value that does not always translate into a higher purchase price.
Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, said the consensus in the real estate market was that ''people want green, but to date they haven't been willing to pay for it to the extent of what it costs.''
If passed, proponents say, the proposal could help close that gap, in addition to promoting energy conservation and construction jobs, generating $1.1 billion a year in savings for consumers by 2021.
Loan applicants could expect to gain about 5 percent more borrowing power on average, said Cliff Majersik, executive director of the Institute for Market Transformation, a nonprofit group that promotes energy efficiency in buildings and helped shape the proposal.
''Many people buy what they can qualify for and no more and no less,'' he said. ''There are $2 trillion in mortgage loans that happen every year, and the fact that you have this big blind spot is an enormous impediment to energy efficiency.''

Previews and Openings
'Charles Ives Take Me Home' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Apparently being an insurance executive and a maverick American composer isn't enough. Now Charles Ives is a family peacemaker too, courtesy of this new drama by Jessica Dickey (''The Amish Project''). Here Ives becomes a sort of metaphysical referee between a violinist dad and his basketball-loving daughter. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Eric Grode)
Clubbed Thumb Summerworks (previews start on Friday; opens on Monday) This prestigious three-play summer festival continues with ''Phoebe in Winter,'' by Jen Silverman. As a father awaits the return of his three sons from a distant war, a mysterious interloper (the title character) joins the family with profound consequences. Wild Project, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, clubbedthumb.org. (Grode) 
'The Comedy of Errors' (in previews; opens on June 18) The thought of an intermission-free Shakespeare is a daunting one, but the Public Theater promises just that with its production of this rarely produced comedy. Featuring the familiar faces of Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Hamish Linklater in duplicate (each plays a pair of twins), this lean-and-mean staging by Daniel Sullivan promises to have audiences out of Central Park in well under two hours. Delacorte Theater, Central Park, near 81st Street and Central Park West, (212) 539-8750, shakespeareinthepark.org. (Grode)
'Cornelius' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) J.B. Priestley is one of those relatively obscure playwrights whose works are dusted off and given a fresh new look every few years. Following past resuscitators like David Mamet (who adapted Priestley's ''Dangerous Corner'' for the Atlantic Theater in 1995) and Stephen Daldry (who brought ''An Inspector Calls'' to Broadway in 1994) is 59E59 Theater's Brits Off Broadway festival, which is presenting this 1935 Priestley rarity about love and regrets within a financially teetering import firm. Directed by Sam Yates. 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
Ensemble Studio Theater 2013 Marathon (Series C) (previews start on Friday; opens on Sunday) The one-act play festival begins its third and final batch of works. The recent envelope-pushing playwrights Tommy Smith (''White Hot'') and Jon Kern (''Modern Terrorism'') appear this time around, along with the marathon's éminence grise: Murray Schisgal, 85, who made his first big splash Off Broadway 50 years ago. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Grode)
'The Explorers Club' (in previews; opens on June 20) Nell Benjamin, who co-wrote the score to ''Legally Blonde: The Musical,'' once again takes on the humorous travails of a bright woman trying to surmount institutionalized sexism. Only this time she's looking back about a century, to 1879 London, as the titular organization grapples with whether to allow a brilliant woman (Jennifer Westfeldt) into its ranks. Not even discovering a lost city, it seems, can guarantee membership. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'A Kid Like Jake' (in previews; opens on June 17) As if the application process for New York private schools wasn't daunting enough, one couple (Peter Grosz and the always welcome Carla Gugino) have to take into account their 4-year-old son's predilection for Cinderella and playing dress up. Speaking of high expectations, this new Daniel Pearle play follows one of Lincoln Center Theater's acclaimed productions, ''Disgraced,'' which played in this space last year and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama this year -- the first to be given to a Lincoln Center production. Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Grode)
'Manna-Hata' (previews start on Friday; opens on Monday) Let's hear it for bureaucratic paralysis! Many had hoped the James A. Farley Post Office might have replaced Penn Station years ago. In the meantime it is playing host to Barry Rowell's sprawling, immersive chronicle of 400 years in the life of New York City. Expect to see Boss Tweed, Shirley Chisholm, Peter Stuyvesant, Jane Jacobs, Walt Whitman, Dorothy Parker and many, many, many other quintessential New Yorkers. 425 Eighth Avenue, enter on 31st Street, (866) 811-4111, peculiarworks.org. (Grode)
'A Picture of Autumn' (in previews; opens on Monday) Even by Mint Theater standards, N.C. Hunter's 1951 play qualifies as a rarity: the company is presenting the work's American premiere. Hunter's refined, tentative style became synonymous in some corners with everything that the Angry Young Men of mid-20th-century British theater opposed, but perhaps it's time to revisit this piece here. It's about a family trying to hold on to their decrepit ancestral home, and it gave London audiences their first glimpse of a playwright who would soon become an important, but now-forgotten, British dramatist in the 1950s and '60s. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'Rantoul and Die' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on June 24) The Amoralists, the dependably debauched theater company, hunker down for a two-play summer in New York. A new play by the company's co-founder Derek Ahonen will come in July, but first they will present this biting romantic comedy by Mark Roberts, better known as the creator of the CBS sitcom ''Mike and Molly.'' Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, amoralists.com. (Grode)
'Reasons to Be Happy' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) For anyone going through ''The Office'' withdrawal, the headline here is Jenna Fischer (a k a Pam) in her Off Broadway debut. For everyone else, the news is that Neil LaBute has created a sequel -- the MCC Theater is calling it a companion piece -- to his understated (by LaButian standards) 2008 gem ''Reasons to Be Pretty.'' All four of its characters are back for more high-octane couplings and uncouplings, with Ms. Fischer joined by Josh Hamilton, Leslie Bibb and the LaBute regular Fred Weller. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode)
'Roadkill' (in previews; opens on June 16) St. Ann's Warehouse has gained a reputation for immersive and sometimes challenging theater, but this off-site production may test the limits on both counts. In this piece conceived and directed by Cora Bissett, 25 audience members accompany a 13-year-old Nigerian girl and her ''auntie'' to what she the girl has been told will be her new home. The play's title, and the fact that it has won an award from Amnesty International, may give you a sense of what awaits her. Departs from St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
'The Silver Cord' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) In case you missed this play the last time it was on Broadway -- it was one of the 1926-27 season's biggest hits -- the Peccadillo Theater is reviving it Off Broadway. A domestic drama about a pathologically snug relationship between a woman and her two grown sons, this play offers a rare glimpse at the theater work of Sidney Howard, who is best known as a screenwriter (''Gone With the Wind,'' ''Dodsworth'') but he won a Pulitzer Prize for his play ''They Knew What They Wanted.'' Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, thepeccadillo.com. (Grode)
'Still More of Our Parts' (opens on Thursday) The last time Theater Breaking Through Barriers presented an evening of short plays about life with disabilities, Anita Gates, in her review for The New York Times, called it ''a largely entertaining and worthwhile mini-evening.'' If consistency is any indication, we should expect more of the same during this year's festival: nearly all of that evening's playwrights are back for more, including Neil LaBute, Samuel D. Hunter (''The Whale'') and Bekah Brunstetter. And this time they brought a Tony Award winner, Tonya Pinkins (''Jelly's Last Jam''). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, tbtb.org. (Grode)
'Three Kinds of Exile' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) John Guare's new play has a dependably meaty subject -- the lives of three noted émigrés from Poland and Czechoslovakia, among them the writer Witold Gombrowicz -- and one unexpected co-star: Mr. Guare himself, who is making his Off Broadway acting debut 45 years after winning his first Obie Award for playwriting. Among his co-stars are the actors-turned-authors David Pittu and Martin Moran, so they'll have plenty to talk about. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'The Two-Character Play' (previews start on Monday; opens on June 19) Tennessee Williams's titles may tend toward the florid, but this production goes the truth-in-advertising route. (The play was called ''Out Cry'' when it appeared on Broadway in 1973, only to go on a estate-mandated hiatus.) After a well-received London production in 2010, the play, directed by Gene David Kirk, comes to New York. The two characters -- siblings forced to perform for an audience after being deserted by their acting troupe -- are played by Brad Dourif and the frequent Williams interpreter Amanda Plummer.

'The Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin' (in previews; opens on June 27) David Morse, who has played everything including angels (''St. Elsewhere'') and devils (''How I Learned to Drive''), looks to split the difference in this new play by Steven Levenson (''The Language of Trees''). Here he stars as the title character, a white-collar criminal looking to reconnect with his family after his release from jail. But what if the family is managing just fine without him? Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Grode)
'Venice' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Crumbling political structures in the not-too-distant future: The familiar tropes of dystopian fiction are given a fresh workout by Matt Sax and Eric Rosen, the young voices who scored a hit in 2008 with the hip-hop-flavored ''Clay.'' Here their musical palette expands to include more traditional rock, and they have assembled an impressive cast for this Public Lab staging, one that includes Jennifer Damiano and Leslie Odom Jr. as well as Mr. Sax himself.

Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Assembled Parties' Richard Greenberg's play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm -- with a capital C -- was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynne Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan's soufflé of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend -- and ex-client -- Barbra Streisand (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Macbeth' Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare's tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming's virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely, low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)

'Basilica' Mando Alvarado's new drama sinks into predictable melodrama, but it's still gripping in its portrayal of a family in crisis in San Juan, Tex. This is thanks in large part to the acting, especially that of Felix Solis as the mercurial Joe Garza (2:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'The Caucasian Chalk Circle' Christopher Lloyd brings acrid humor and physical exuberance to his roles as the narrator and the rascally rogue Azdak in Brian Kulick's astute if uneven production of Brecht's fable about a young woman who adopts an abandoned baby. The original music, by Duncan Sheik, is haunting and effective, and Elizabeth A. Davis (''Once'') sings with an appropriate soulfulness as the innocent Grusha (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; Ensemble Studio Theater 2013 Marathon (Series B) The six plays here make for another satisfying bill from Ensemble Studio Theater, which excels at the art of the one-act. One play in particular, ''A Sunrise in Times Square'' by Sharr White, stands out thanks to very fine performances by Julie Fitzpatrick and Joseph Lyle Taylor (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Far From Heaven' Hinting at shimmering vistas beyond picket-fence conformity, Kelli O'Hara's soprano provides the poetry in this generally prosy adaptation of Todd Haynes's 2002 film about a beleaguered housewife in Eisenhower-era Hartford. Though Scott Frankel and Michael Korie have written some alluring songs, the show often seems to confine its wonderful star, and her character, to two dimensions (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; '_______ Up Everything' The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show's characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn's hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Good Television' Rod McLachlan explores the ghoulish world of reality television in this unsurprising but nicely done comedy-drama about a crew descending on the family of a South Carolina meth addict (the terrific John Magaro) in the hopes of digging up drama and good ratings (1:45). Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Gorilla' Five underperforming businessmen are trapped in a series of team-building workshops, where they endure ridiculous exercises intended to generate trust, or intimacy, or whatever it is that these insipid hand-holding, blindfold-wearing, allegedly soul-bearing drills are supposed to instill. Some of the gags are funny, but most are tired and drawn out. The show's attempt to offer more depth fails as well, partly because there are so many thinly developed story lines crammed into too little time (1:25). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Here Lies Love' An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world's a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Murder Ballad' A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club's Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who has replaced Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812' Dave Malloy's transporting pop opera dramatizes an emotionally potent slice of Tolstoy's ''War and Peace.'' Rachel Chavkin directs a superb young cast who bring the loves and losses of 19th-century Russian aristocrats to vibrant, intimate life in a stylish cabaret setting expressly built for the production (2:30).

'Nikolai and the Others' An estimable cast of 18, directed by the ensemble master David Cromer, works in harmonious disharmony in Richard Nelson's sprawling, occasionally soporific portrait of transplanted eminent Russians in leafy Connecticut in the late 1940s. The real-life models for the characters here include George Balanchine (a perfect Michael Cerveris) and Igor Stravinsky (John Glover) (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Potted Potter' With no new Harry Potter adventures to pore over, what's a Muggle in need of a fix to do? One answer: this gloriously goofy parody by Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner, which compresses a retelling of the seven books into 70 minutes, complete with a game of Quidditch. Clearly the two comics attended Professor Flitwick's charms class, because they cast the perfect spell over the audience: reductio ad absurdum (1:10). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Daniel M. Gold)
'The Seagull' The New York Classical Theater's free outdoor production of Chekhov's classic does a fine job of telling the story of its late-19th-century lovers, losers and dreamers at a Russian country estate. The translation can be simplistic at times, but the great lines are there and the settings (the audience moves en masse several times) couldn't be more beautiful (1:40). Central Park, enter at 103rd Street at Central Park West, (212) 252-4531, newyorkclassical.org. (Gates)
'Somewhere Fun' Kathleen Chalfant and Kate Mulgrew, as two upper crusty old friends whose chance meeting on a Manhattan street incites a collage of strange encounters, lead an excellent cast in Jenny Schwartz's intermittently diverting, blatantly word-drunk but deeply frustrating new play. The virtuosic language often delights, but underneath is an emotional void (2:15). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Isherwood)

&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (David Rooney)
'Showgirls! The Musical!' If ever a movie were ripe for a sendup, it's Paul Verhoeven's 1995 turkey, ''Showgirls.'' The lurid story of a hitchhiker turned pole dancer turned Las Vegas star is catnip for any devotee of camp, and this frenetic production pushes it into the camp stratosphere, with X-rated songs, abundant toplessness and a much higher male quotient. Alas, the movie's misogyny lingers. The tireless and fearless April Kidwell, in the Elizabeth Berkley role, is a wonder: Her vibrant physicality and knowing humor inadvertently constitute a welcome riposte to the story's mockery of its protagonist (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00). Return engagement starts on Saturday. The Kingsland Ward at St. John's, 195 Maujer Street, near Humboldt Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 374-5196, thenshefell.com. (Brantley)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

'The Golden Dragon' (closes on Sunday) This darkly whimsical play about alienation and exploitation by the acclaimed German writer Roland Schimmelpfennig is set in a Pan-Asian restaurant and the apartments around it.

'I'm a Stranger Here Myself' (closes on Sunday) The cabaret singer Mark Nadler does an effective job of transforming what last year was a cabaret show into a theatrical production, annotating a journey through music that was created during the Weimar Republic or by composers like Kurt Weill after they escaped Naziism. The show starts out feeling like a pleasant history lesson but ends as a profoundly personal journey (1:45).

'The Last Cyclist' (closes on Sunday) An intriguing exercise in Holocaust history, ''The Last Cyclist'' is an effort to recreate a satirical play that was being readied for performance in 1944 by prisoners at Theresienstadt, the Nazi concentration camp near Prague. The story involves inmates in a mental institution who take over a society and randomly decree that bicyclists should be killed or deported. The Jewish Council of Elders that governed the camp squelched the production after the dress rehearsal. It's not much of a play, but here in 2013 it is a testament to human determination to defy oppression (1:45) West End Theater at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street, (866) 811-4111, thelastcyclist.com.

HEADLINE: A Night When No Bad Deed Goes Punished

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Human sacrifice is a reliable crowd pleaser, from the myth of the Minotaur to Shirley Jackson's short-story shocker ''The Lottery,'' the Japanese film ''Battle Royale,'' the book (and now movie series) ''The Hunger Games'' and the television reality show ''The Voice.'' This week's big-screen oblation, ''The Purge,'' revisits that old sacral feeling, updates it with agitated camerawork and seasons it with the vaguest suggestion of politics -- and then lets it rip with machine guns, machetes and Manson Family-style gigglers in fright masks. Ain't we got fun? 
For most of its first hour, ''The Purge'' isn't exactly an evening's elevating entertainment, but it effectively creeps under the skin. It's 2022 and James Sandin (Ethan Hawke), a high-performing employee at a security firm, is rolling through the entrance of his gated community in a fine mood. He has just been anointed his company's top salesman, good news tempered by the fact that tonight brings the annual Purge, the 12-hour national holiday during which Americans are legally absolved from every crime, including homicide and, presumably, insider trading. Since some crimes are more spectacular than others, more ready-made for big-screen consumption, this yearly national bloodletting appears limited to more familiar, more obvious police-blotter offenses: murder, beatings, more murder.
The time stamp announces that this is the future; that it's also a dystopia is evident from the regressive image of James's wife, Mary (Lena Headey), fussing about in a skirt and heels like a 1950s television handmaid. James, meanwhile, plays the caring father, sitting down to supper with his family (dinner, and then the show) in a scene with his children, Charlie (Max Burkholder), and Zoey (Adelaide Kane), that establishes his loving paterfamilias bona fides. There's a distinct, daddy-knows-best whiff to this tableau that's underscored when a TV announcer bleats about the New Founding Fathers, God and America just before the Emergency Broadcast System kicks in. James mans the alarms and the gates roll down, securing the windows and doors as if home were a prison.
That's the unsubtle message, or rather just one of several such blunt, bludgeoning ideas that the writer and director James DeMonaco tucks into ''The Purge.'' Some introductory text suggests the political stakes, however blurred: unemployment is at 1 percent, crime is nearly nonexistent and it's Morning in America (again): cue the smiling faces, fluttering flags and some pacifying notes from Debussy's ''Clair de Lune.'' The movie doesn't directly point fingers at political conservatives, but Mr. DeMonaco deploys the satire about God 'n' Guns with such cumulative heavy handedness, that the target, so to speak, becomes obvious. (The emblem of the New Founding Fathers looks a lot like one for the National Rifle Association, complete with a gun-toting eagle.)
The message just gets louder and louder, cruder and cruder, which is too bad because Mr. DeMonaco knows how to set a stage. The banality of James and Mary's milieu initially brings to mind the opening of Jackson's ''Lottery'' (1948), in which the ritual bloodletting (ostensibly for harvest) is compared to civic activities like ''square dances, the teenage club, the Halloween program.''
Once lockdown commences, however, Mr. DeMonaco quickly loses his grip on the ever-more blood-slicked material. Out come the guns and in come the villains, inner and outer. A symbol of collective callousness emerges in the form of a sacrificial black man (Edwin Hodge as the Bloody Stranger), an Everyman lifted wholesale from George A. Romero's ''Night of the Living Dead'' if without the powerhouse effect.
''The Purge'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Wholesale slaughter.
The Purge

HEADLINE: Pressure in Britain Over What to Do With Bailed-Out Banks

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
The archbishop of Canterbury, a former chancellor of the Exchequer and the outgoing governor of the Bank of England are unusual comrades in arms.
Yet, the three stalwarts of the British establishment -- Justin Welby, Nigel Lawson and Mervyn King -- are all calling for the breakup of the part-nationalized Royal Bank of Scotland.
They are part of a growing debate in Britain about what to do with the bank and its rival, the Lloyds Banking Group, which received more than $103 billion combined in rescue bailouts during the financial crisis.
Now, nearly five years after British taxpayers first took stakes in the lenders, the government is preparing to reduce its holdings before the next general election, which is expected in early 2015. The government owns 81 percent of R.B.S. and 39 percent of Lloyds. 
Yet, unlike the share sales in financial giants like Citigroup that allowed the United States government to make a profit, the prospective offerings in Britain may be more difficult.
The two banks are still cleaning up their balance sheets and selling off unwanted assets that could put off new investors. Both continue to come under political pressure to increase potentially risky lending to the struggling British economy. And the timing of any share sale, which could come as early as next year, may lead to losses for British taxpayers -- potentially angering voters.
''As we move closer to an election, the share prices of R.B.S. and Lloyds will become more scrutinized,'' said Peter Hahn, a banking professor at the Cass Business School in London. ''Whoever is in government, selling shares in these banks will be a top priority.''
Liz Morley, a representative for UKFI, the government agency that is in charge of managing the bank holdings, declined to comment for this article.
The British government's quandary over the banks stands in contrast with the experience of the United States Treasury Department, which reduced the government's stakes in the big banks more quickly.
Elisabeth Rudman, an analyst with the credit rating firm DBRS, said the two British banks were in much worse shape because of the financial crisis than their American counterparts. R.B.S. was not only burdened by its participation in the acquisition of the Dutch lender ABN Amro, but it had large exposure to imploding real estate markets like Ireland.
The critical element in the British government's effort to shed its banks stakes is timing. Later this month, George Osborne, the current chancellor of the Exchequer, will present his strategy to return the two banks to the private sector. His plan will come soon after the findings of a British parliamentary committee in the middle of June that will outline how the firms could be privatized. Lawmakers remain divided over how the banks' should be privatized, with many of the committee members calling for the breakup of R.B.S. to carve out the most risky assets.
Those in favor of a split say that freeing R.B.S. from its worst-performing assets would allow the bank to lend more, strengthen the banking system and help Britain's economic recovery. Those against the breakup argue that it would cost both time and money that would be better spent letting the bank continue with its planned overhaul.
To connect banks with local communities could involve ''recapitalizing at least one of our major banks and breaking it up into regional banks,'' Archbishop Welby, a former oil executive who sits on the parliamentary committee, said in a speech on April 21.
For Mr. Osborne, planning the offerings will be precarious.
If the British government sells its stakes too soon, it could book a loss that might not sit well with voters. But if the government waits too long to sell, it could deter potential investors from buying the shares. It also may reverse the firms' recent share price rise that have made the banks' stocks some of the best performers in the FTSE 100-stock index over the last 12 months.
''I get confused by all the talk about waiting,'' said Ian Gordon, a banking analyst with Investec in London, adding that the British government should sell the stakes tomorrow. ''Can we sell the shares now? Of course we can.''
The fortunes of the two British banks have certainly improved since they received multibillion-dollar bailouts.
R.B.S. has been gradually digging itself out of its ill-judged ABN Amro acquisition in 2007. The bank, based in Edinburgh, has shed billions of dollars from its balance sheet and cut around 40,000 jobs over the last five years. The firm has also trimmed its investment banking operations, which came under scrutiny this year after R.B.S. was forced to pay a $612 million fine connected to a rate-rigging scandal.
Lloyds, which already is Britain's largest mortgage lender, has refocused its efforts on the British retail banking sector. The bank's chief executive, António Horta-Osório, announced a £1.5 billion net profit in the first quarter of 2013, compared with a £5 million loss in the same period last year.
Analysts say the rise in earnings is mostly driven by cost reductions, a fall in delinquent loans and fast-tracked asset sales like the disposal of a portfolio of real estate-backed securities in the United States for £3.3 billion last month to a number of American investors, including Goldman Sachs.
Market participants are now centering their attention on when the British government will start to reduce it stakes.
R.B.S.'s chairman, Philip Hampton, has said the bank would like the British government to start selling shares from the middle of next year, though the firm's current share price is around 35 percent below what British taxpayers paid for their holding. Lloyds' stock price is slightly above the government's so-called break-even point, though bankers caution that any offering will be dependent on the health of the broader financial markets.
''Bringing too many shares to market could easily scare off investors,'' said a prominent investment banker at a rival firm in London, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''When it comes to reducing the government's stake, timing will be everything.''
Some leading voices in Britain are also calling for restraint.
Alistair Darling, the former chancellor of the Exchequer who led the bailouts of R.B.S. and Lloyds, said the government would make a mistake if it were to rush a sale of shares before the next election. Mr. Darling, a Labour politician who opposes the breakup of R.B.S., said the current government could wait at least another 18 months before selling off its stakes, but must clarify its plans to avoid creating confusion with potential investors.
''A clear statement is needed,'' Mr. Darling said. ''The longer this drags on, the worse this is going to get.''
For any prospective share sale in the two banks to be a success, the British government must convince voters that the offerings would benefit the economy after taxpayers spent billions of dollars to rescue the two lenders.
Just outside an R.B.S. branch in central London on Thursday, many seemed unconvinced that privatizing the bank would help to jump-start Britain's recovery.
''I can't see it making much difference,'' said Sarah Mulligan, an I.T. consultant on her way to a meeting in London's financial district. ''Changing who owns the banks won't necessarily get them lending again.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

&#x2605; BB&C and Fork (Monday) BB&C is a rough-magic collective -- with the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, the drummer Jim Black and the guitarist Nels Cline -- that has only deepened its rapport since recording ''The Veil'' (Cryptogramophone) four summers ago.

&#x2605; Stefano Bollani Trio (Friday) The pianist Stefano Bollani favors melodic precision, shifting dynamics and a ceaseless undercurrent of play: just a few reasons for the success he has had in his native Italy.

Don Byron's New Gospel Quintet/The Bridge Trio (Wednesday) The clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Don Byron, one of jazz's keenest omnivores, has lately been obsessed with gospel music; his most recent album, ''Love, Peace, and Soul'' (Savoy), is a rollicking tribute to Thomas A. Dorsey and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. Appearing on ''The Checkout: Live From 92YTriBeCa,'' a series broadcast by WBGO (88.3 FM), Mr. Byron and his band share a bill with the Bridge Trio, which originated in New Orleans as a collaboration among the drummer Joe Dyson, the bassist Max Moran and the pianist Conun Pappas Jr. At 8 p.m., 92YTriBeCa, 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org; $12 in advance, $15 on the day of the show.

Bob Dorough Trio (Friday and Saturday) For the generation that came of age in the 1970s Mr. Dorough is best known as the tunesmith behind the more slyly informative ditties on ''Schoolhouse Rock.'' His frame of reference as a singer-songwriter and pianist runs both older and more recent here, in a weekend engagement with his trio. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $25 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, Nels Cline and Shahzad Ismaily (Tuesday) Aside from the fact that they're all heralded, genre-fluid guitarists on either side of 60, what do Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot and Nels Cline have in common? A commitment to vernacular American music, for one thing; an agenda of unforced discovery, for another. And a keen sense of collaboration, which should help them in this rare summit, which also features Mr. Ismaily on bass. The evening, part of the fifth anniversary celebration for Le Poisson Rouge, will also feature a guest turn by the harpist Zeena Parkins. At 6:30 and 10 p.m., 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com; $30 to $35, $25 for students at the door. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Jim Hall Trio (Friday through Sunday) The career of the jazz guitarist Jim Hall describes one long arc of refinement. His style -- full of subtlety and curiosity, with the austere grace of a Shaker chair -- has sounded effortlessly modern at almost every juncture. He works here with a pair of sideman who know his nuances: the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Gilad Hekselman Trio (Tuesday and Wednesday) The prepossessing young guitarist Gilad Hekselman recently released a knockout album, ''This Just In'' (Jazz Village), that should provide the material for this engagement. On Tuesday he'll augment his trio with the tenor saxophonist John Ellis; on Wednesday the guest saxophonist is Mark Turner, who is featured on the album. The rhythm team on both nights will consist of Reuben Rogers on bass and Obed Calvaire on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)

This one will feature Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Benito Gonzalez on piano, Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Billy Hart on drums. On Thursday and next Friday only, they will be joined by the pianist George Cables and the bassist Alex Blake.

Joe Locke Quintet (Friday through Sunday) The kinetic and harmonically sophisticated vibraphonist Joe Locke draws from a ballads-centric new album, ''Lay Down My Heart'' (Motéma), with a band featuring Robert Rodriguez on piano, George Mraz on bass, Clarence Penn on drums and Kenny Washington on vocals. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $40 and $45 cover, $20 and $25 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

&#x2605; Enrico Rava Quintet: 'Tribe' (Saturday and Sunday) The eminent Italian postbop trumpeter Enrico Rava has always had good instincts for assembling a band, and he meant it when he titled a recent ECM album ''Tribe.'' He's the natural choice to close a week of programming organized by Umbria Jazz and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Saturday at 8:30 and 11 p.m., Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

&#x2605; Vision Festival (Wednesday through June 16) This independent summit of avant-garde jazz, now in its 18th year, will feature a lifetime achievement honor for the venerable drummer Milford Graves, who performs in three wildly promising groups on Wednesday: with Afro/Cuban Roots, featuring the young Cuban pianist David Virelles, the percussionist Román Díaz and others (at 7:30 p.m.); Transition Trio, with the tenor saxophonist Kidd Jordan and the pianist D.D. Jackson (at 8:30 p.m.); and NY HeART Ensemble, which consists of the tenor saxophonist Charles Gayle, the trombonist Roswell Rudd, the bassist William Parker and the poet Amiri Baraka (at 9:30 p.m.). Thursday's bill, though less of a continuum, offers its own enticements, notably in the form of the Roscoe Mitchell Trio, with Mr. Mitchell on reeds, Henry Grimes on bass and Tani Tabbal on drums (at 10 p.m.). A full schedule is at visionfestival.org.

HEADLINE: A Portent Of Peril For Muni Bondholders

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
The bankruptcy of the most populous county in Alabama moved closer to resolution this week with an agreement providing that investors will lose 20 percent of the money they invested in bonds that were rated AAA. The big loser financially is JPMorgan Chase, which underwrote many of the securities -- and paid bribes to get the business.
Large municipal bond disasters have been rare, but I suspect there will be more. The Jefferson County bankruptcy may serve as a precedent for forcing bondholders to take losses in bankruptcy. Despite lots of legal protections, loans to municipal governments can be just like loans to people and companies: if the borrower truly can't afford to pay what was promised, it won't be paid.
Jefferson County's problems involve corrupt politicians and bad luck, but they also include a longstanding reluctance to face facts about the county's sewer system -- and a bond market that failed to face the facts about the county and kept lending money long after it was prudent to do so. 
The corruption involved was breathtaking. More than 20 people, including politicians, contractors and influence peddlers, have been convicted. JPMorgan escaped criminal charges, but the Securities and Exchange Commission penalized it for paying bribes through local middlemen.
That corruption was important and no doubt raised the financing costs for the county. But the basic financial decisions about the structure of the county's debt were different only in scale from what many other municipalities did.
The disaster provides an example of how derivative securities can be oversold. Not all risks can be hedged, and certainly not at acceptable costs, but that is something Wall Street salesmen tend to overlook when they make their pitches. When such contracts are written, you can be sure that the Wall Street firm will make sure it will come out O.K., even if that increases the risk that the customer will not.
The county's sewer debt used to be long-term, fixed-rate debt. The county would have been better off if that had not changed. But Wall Street persuaded it, and a lot of other municipalities, that such debt was too costly. The county could save some money by issuing what the salesmen called synthetic fixed-rate debt.
And what is that? The county issued long-term variable-rate debt, where the interest payments would fluctuate based on short-term market rates. Just doing that would have left the county at risk if interest rates surged, so JPMorgan also entered into an interest rate swap. That provided that the county would pay a long-term rate to JPMorgan, which would pay a short-term rate to the county.
The net cost of that was a little lower than the cost of fixed-rate debt would have been.
There was an important catch: the swap payments were not based on what the county actually had to pay. They were based instead on indexes that might, or might not, move in the same way that rates moved on the county's actual debt. It was not really ''fixed rate,'' the title notwithstanding.
Another risk, probably never considered, was that the monoline insurance companies, which routinely guaranteed munis for a fee, would collapse.
Those risks were not necessarily large, and if Jefferson County had not structured 90 percent of its debt that way -- rather than the 10 or 20 percent some advisers recommend -- they might not have become crucial. But in the credit crisis, a lot happened that had not been expected.
Jefferson County issued two types of variable-rate debt, both of which blew up.
The largest was auction-rate debt. That debt paid rates that were set every week at auctions. The risk to investors was that an auction could fail and they would be stuck with the bonds. If that happened, the county would pay a penalty rate, often twice the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor.
When auctions began to fail, that penalty rate was not enough to attract investors, but it was high enough to raise the financing costs for the county significantly. The interest rate swap did not protect it because it was based on an index, not on the actual cost the county was paying. Suddenly the ''fixed rate'' went up.
The second type was known as variable rate demand bonds, or V.R.D.O.'s to the cognoscenti. Their rates fluctuated based on an index rate, but the holder had the right to sell them every week. If no one else would buy, there were banks that had promised to buy them.
The catch was that the banks were not in it for the long haul. The V.R.D.O.'s might have 30-year maturities. But if the banks were forced to bail them out and could not find other buyers, the interest rates rose and the debt turned into three-year debt. The banks were protected, but the county was not.
Turning for a moment from finance to the real world, these bonds were financing a sewer system that was managed badly for decades. Wealthier areas found ways to stay out of it. In the late 1990s, the county was forced to take over what a court-appointed receiver later called ''municipal systems that had never been properly operated and maintained.'' But it still could not force some people within its service area to hook up to its system.
Some people used the sewers without paying, and when they were caught, they were not forced to pay what they owed. When a consultant told the county commissioners a decade ago that the county would have to raise rates rapidly, the commissioners simply ignored the report and did not mention it when they borrowed more money.
And the investors were not paying much attention. They were told they did not need to because the bonds were insured by one of three monoline insurance firms, FGIC, XL Capital Associates and FSA, and therefore had AAA ratings.
The records do not show whether those monoline insurers did any real research before they issued the guarantees. If they did, they did not seem to have noticed how poorly the system was run.
The bonds were backed only by sewer system revenue, but there was a covenant in them in which the Jefferson County commissioners promised to keep rates adequate to meet the system's obligations. For many years, they ignored that promise. In 2009, after the bonds defaulted and it was obvious that rates had to be raised substantially if the county was going to meet its obligations, the commissioners did the opposite. They voted to reduce rates. In 2011, the county went into bankruptcy.
Four people who served on the five-member county commission have since been convicted of taking bribes and sentenced to prison, and a fifth was convicted of obstructing justice by lying about gifts she received from investment bankers. She received probation and testified against her former colleagues.
Under the deal disclosed this week, JPMorgan agrees not to be paid for many of the bonds it holds. Including fines, forgone fees the county owed it and forfeited bonds, this has cost the bank more than $1.5 billion before taxes. The bank has already taken losses, and a JPMorgan spokesman said the settlement would have no significant financial effect on the bank.
Under the deal, normal investors are to be offered a choice of receiving 80 cents for every dollar of bonds they own, and forfeiting the right to get any more, or 65 cents while retaining the right to receive additional payments from the monoline insurers. Two of them are paying claims now, but the other is not. The investors would probably be better off to take the 80 cents.
There is optimism that those payments can be financed by selling new bonds. Those bonds would almost certainly be rated as junk, but the presumed yields, ranging up to 6.75 percent on some bonds where the interest will not be paid until maturity decades from now, are thought attractive enough to draw in investors. Sewage rates will rise and might have to rise further if market interest rates go up before this can be completed, some months from now. But they will not rise as much as would have been necessary without forcing bondholders to take losses.
There are other municipalities where crises are looming, even without rampant corruption.
Cities and states are legally required to pay pensions to retired workers and to pay bondholders, along with paying for continuing government functions. But if there is not enough money for all of that -- and in some cases, where population is shrinking, there almost certainly will not be -- don't bet that the judges and politicians will conclude that the retirees and bondholders should face no losses while basic government operations are devastated.

HEADLINE: The Culprit Behind High U.S. Health Care Prices

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Employers are to blame for high and widely divergent prices for health care in the United States, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Elizabeth Rosenthal's eye-opening article about health care costs in The New York Times on Sunday was a reminder of how much more Americans pay for given procedures than citizens in health systems abroad. What was probably more surprising to most readers was the huge price differentials for identical procedures - not only across the United States, but even within American cities, where prices for a given procedure can vary tenfold. 
These price differentials, it should be noted, have never been shown to be related either to the cost of producing health care procedures or to their quality. 
The question, not addressed in the article, is who bears the blame for this chaotic, private-sector price system. The only fair answer is: American employers. Who else could it be? 
I have been critical of employment-based health insurance in this country for more than two decades. In the early 1990s, for example, at the annual gathering of the Business Council, I bluntly told the top chief executives assembled there, "If you want to find the culprit behind the health care cost explosion in the U.S., go to the bathroom and look in the mirror." After years of further study, I stand by that remark. 
I can imagine that some would look instead to the usual suspects - Medicare, Medicaid and possibly even the Tricare program for the military - but that would be a stretch. The argument would be that the public programs shift costs to the private sector, causing the chaos there. Few economists buy that theory.
Most health-policy analysts I know regret that employers appointed themselves their employees' agents in the markets for health insurance and health care, developing in the process the ephemeral insurance coverage that is lost to the family when its breadwinner loses his or her job. 
Employers were able to capture that agency role during World War II when they successfully walked around the prevailing wage controls simply by having Congress exempt fringe benefits from the wage cap. Employers were able to retain their agency even after the wage controls ended by having Congress exempt employer-paid fringe benefits from the taxable income of employees, a tax preference not granted Americans who purchased health insurance on their own. Retaining their tax-preferred agency role has been of great help to employers in the labor market.
Alas, in their self-appointed role as purchasing agents in health care, American employers have arguably become the sloppiest purchasers of health care anywhere in the world. The chaotic price system for health care is one manifestation of that sloppiness. 
For more than half a century, employers have passively paid just about every health care bill that has been put before them, with few questions asked. And all along they have been party to a deal to keep the chaotic price system they helped create opaque from the public and even from their own employees. Only very recently and very timidly have a few of them dared to lift the veil a little. 
Employers may protest that they rarely purchase health care for their employees directly. The actual purchases are made by the employers' agents, private health insurance carriers. But the latter are merely the conduits for the employers' wishes. When agents perform poorly, one should look first for the root cause at the principals' instructions.
One reason for the employers' passivity in paying health care bills may be that they know, or should know, that the fringe benefits they purchase for their employees ultimately come out of the employees' total pay package. In a sense, employers behave like pickpockets who take from their employees' wallets and with the money lifted purchase goodies for their employees. Far too many employees have been seduced into believing that their benevolent employer pays for most of their health care. 
The result of this untoward pas de deux is the system Ms. Rosenthal describes. 
One consequence of this opaque pricing system has been that, according to the 2013 Milliman Medical Index, the average cost of health care of a typical American family of four under age 65, and insured through an employer-sponsored preferred provider plan, is now $22,000, up from about $10,000 a decade earlier. It is a staggering amount, not only by international comparison, but also when compared with the distribution of family income in the United States, with a median income of $50,000 to $60,000.
Another result has been that, according to a recent analysis published in the policy journal Health Affairs, a decade of health care cost growth under employment-based health insurance has wiped out the real income gains for an average family with employment-based health insurance. One must wonder how any employer as agent for employees can take pride in that outcome. 
Yet a third consequence of the rampant price discrimination baked into this pricing system is that uninsured Americans with some financial means are often charged the highest prices for health care when they fall ill, exposing them to the prospect of financial bankruptcy. 
How long must the opaque and chaotic health care pricing system of employment-based health insurance in the United States persist? I can envisage two alternatives.
The first would be an all-payer system on the German or Swiss model, perhaps on a statewide basis, with some adjustments for smaller regional cost differentials (urban versus rural, for example), as is now the practice in the Medicare price schedules. In those systems, multiple insurance carriers negotiate jointly with counter-associations of the relevant health care providers over common price schedules, which thereafter are binding on every payer and every health care provider in the region (an analysis in Health Affairs offered more details). One can easily link such a system to the growth of gross domestic product. 
The second alternative would be a marriage in which the financial risks of ill health are shared up to a point and raw, transparent price competition for the remainder. In such a system, called "reference pricing," a private insurer, as agent for an employer or for a government program, would cover only the price charged for a medical procedure by a low-cost provider in the insured's market area, forcing the insured to pay out of pocket the full difference between that low-cost "reference price" and whatever a higher-cost provider in the area charges for the same procedure. 
Such a system, of course, presupposes full transparency of the prices charged by alternative providers in the relevant market area. 
Because an all-payer system is highly regulatory, I predict the private health care market in the United States will sooner or later lapse into full-fledged reference pricing. It would entail ever more pronounced rationing of quality, real or imagined, by income class. 
But such tiering has long been the American way in other important human services - notably justice and education. Why would health care remain the exception?

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Ideal Jobs Gain: Middling

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: If Friday&#8217;s report shows a spike in employment, traders expect more pressure on the Federal Reserve to step back from the stimulus programs that have driven up stocks. 

 BODY:
For most Americans, the hopes for Friday's employment report are simple: the more jobs the economy created last month, the better. 
On Wall Street, the anticipation is decidedly more complicated, and there is the possibility that the economy could have created too many jobs. 
How could a lot of new jobs be a bad thing? As is frequently the case in the markets these days, the answer goes back to the Federal Reserve. Many investors assume that if Friday's employment report shows an unexpected spike in new jobs, the Federal Reserve will feel more pressure to step back from its stimulus programs - or, as traders put it, to taper quantitative easing. 
Investors have been worried since mid-May that the Fed may be preparing to step back from its bond-buying programs sooner than many had anticipated. That is based on the statement by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank could look at slowing down its bond purchases "in the next few meetings." 
But Fed officials have said they will make changes only if the economy is showing improvement. Given the market's dependence on Fed stimulus, many on Wall Street have been left hoping that the economy does not show too many signs of improvement. 
"It's perverse," said Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research. He said that if Friday's jobs report showed a net gain of more than 200,000 jobs in May, it could end up hurting stock markets, at least in the short term. 
Mr. Yardeni said that a very low number - anything under 100,000 - would also likely be a bad thing for markets, as it would indicate that the Fed's stimulus was not working, leaving few options for fostering economic growth.
The right number, à la Goldilocks, is probably somewhere right in between. Analysts are expecting a number around 165,000. If it is close to that, investors are likely to conclude that economic growth is happening, but not at a rate that would lead the Fed to slow down its stimulus. 
"The market will conclude it's just more of the same," Mr. Yardeni said.

HEADLINE: Through the Eyes of Wall Street Interns

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Even in their first week, summer analysts are already discovering the delights and frustrations of their chosen line of work. | Elan has had to get creative in order to challenge a hostile bid from Royalty Pharma. | A debate is growing in Britain over what to do with bailed-out banks. | Raymond Lane, the former chairman of Hewlett-Packard, faces a tax headache. 

 BODY:
WALL STREET INTERNS, A WEEK IN THE LIFE | Grueling hours. Five-figure pay. And, just maybe, the hope of a job offer in the fall. Such is life for summer interns on Wall Street, many of whom began work this week. While their classmates volunteer in Africa or collect extra course credits, a number of college students are trying to get a toehold in the world of finance, where the job market remains bleak.
Even in their first week, interns, known as summer analysts, are already discovering the delights and frustrations of their chosen line of work. Some are showing signs of becoming disillusioned. Others have found solace in swag. And a few have passed the time by taking "selfies."
GETTING CREATIVE IN TAKEOVER DEFENSE | "Elan's fervent efforts to fight off Royalty Pharma's $6.4 billion hostile bid are driven by the simple fact that it is relatively defenseless. Blame Ireland," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "Elan, a developer of drugs and drug-delivery systems, is an Irish company and its stock is listed in Ireland. This means that while it has American depositary receipts listed in the United States, its primary regulator is the Irish Takeover Panel, which administers the Irish takeover code." 
Unlike in the United States, where companies can adopt takeover defenses like a poison pill, such defenses are generally prohibited in Ireland. "Instead, companies are exposed to a hostile takeover and are forced to fight these bids by lobbying shareholders directly. Faced with this difficulty, Elan has had to get creative in order to challenge Royalty Pharma's bid." 
WHITHER BAILED-OUT BRITISH BANKS? | "The archbishop of Canterbury, a former chancellor of the Exchequer and the outgoing governor of the Bank of England are unusual comrades in arms. Yet, the three stalwarts of the British establishment - Justin Welby, Nigel Lawson and Mervyn King - are all calling for the breakup of the part-nationalized Royal Bank of Scotland," DealBook's Mark Scott and Julia Werdigier report.
"They are part of a growing debate in Britain about what to do with the bank and its rival, the Lloyds Banking Group, which received more than $103 billion combined in rescue bailouts during the financial crisis."
ON THE AGENDA | The unemployment report for May is out at 8:30 a.m. Alan Greenspan is on CNBC at 7:30 a.m. Stephen A. Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, is on Bloomberg TV at 11:30 a.m. 
RAY LANE'S TAX ISSUE | Raymond Lane, the former chairman of Hewlett-Packard, has come under criticism for the disastrous acquisition of the software maker Autonomy. Now, Mr. Lane, a partner emeritus at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has another headache: the Internal Revenue Service. According to a report in Bloomberg News, Mr. Lane faces a $100 million tax bill, after the I.R.S. found in December that he participated in a "sham" tax shelter that generated improperly claimed losses to offset income. "As a director, you are being elected for your judgment, and investors have to evaluate how you apply that judgment," Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, told the news service. "If you're a public company director, your entire financial life is fair game."
Mr. Lane told Reuters that he had settled the matter, which he said stemmed from a fund that his tax advisers "put him into."

HEADLINE: Maggie and the Medium

BYLINE: GRAEME WOOD


HIGHLIGHT: A Japanese psychic interviews the late British prime minister and passes on her advice to Shinzo Abe. 

 BODY:
TOKYO - In 2002, when Margaret Thatcher announced that creeping senility was forcing her out of public life, some of her opponents whispered that nothing short of a stake through the heart could neutralize such a deft politician.
Perhaps they were right: On April 9, some 19 hours after Thatcher's death in London, the leader of Japan's Happiness Realization Party and spirit medium Ryuho Okawa interviewed the former British prime minister from Tokyo.
Okawa's party, which has a political candidate in nearly every constituency in Japan but has yet to win a seat in the Diet, is best known in the capital for its wide-eyed acolytes' enthusiastic distribution of leaflets on the streets. Much of the tracts' content is political: an odd mix of jingoistic nationalism and support for immigration and nuclear power. At its core, though, the group is a religious institution dedicated to bringing happiness to people by cultivating the six invisible souls that rule our lives. Mixing both interests, Okawa - who founded the religion in 1986 after a career as a trader in New York - claims to have spoken post-mortem to Kim Jong-il, the Prophet Muhammad and now Thatcher. 
"What? I'm still alive," she reportedly told Okawa, noticeably off her game. (Surprise and confusion are a typical first reaction among the dead, according to the Web site that published the interview.) "Japan, you said? Japan?"
Thatcher is a popular figure here, thanks to her strong leadership, working-class background and success as a woman in a male-dominated world. She is also lionized for having led a moment of nationalist revival in the 1980s, during the country's victory over Argentina in the Falklands War. Her economic policy stressed shrinking the role of government and aggressively curbing inflation.
Okawa's group fully supports Abenomics, the government's largely successful attempt so far to jump-start the economy through inflation and negative real interest rates. But in her interview with Okawa, Thatcher said that a country's economic fate ultimately depends on creating a business-friendly environment, rather than relying on an aggressive monetary or fiscal policies.
"The government only needs to assist the privatization of industries," she said. Too many laws "prohibit the growth of private companies. So set them free and educate them to fight for themselves in order to obtain prosperity."
This may appeal to the Japanese public, which has started to worry that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's inflationist policies will hurt the economy - if, that is, they have forgotten that her success also hinged on austerity policies and curbing the welfare state.
On security issues, Thatcher came across as aggressively militaristic; like Okawa, she outflanks even Abe on this. Referring to China and North Korea, she said: "Never permit an invasion! Attack them to protect your wonderful, beautiful, historical traditions and culture. Be proud of yourself!" she urged. "If we believe that it's our island, we must keep it, protect it, and attack our enemies, the invaders, and destroy them!" That "we" seemed to suggest that, in death, she identifies as Japanese.
The interview, published on Liberty Web, an online gateway for Happy Science propaganda, is just a couple of pages long. "Within 24 hours of death, a person's soul and body are still connected through what people call a silver cord," the site says. It's usually "extremely difficult to speak usually right after one's death," while the trauma is fresh. But Thatcher will always be Thatcher, and after a moment of disorientation, she came through clearly, full of energy, panache and authority.

HEADLINE: 10 Questions for Jon Huntsman

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: The former Republican presidential candidate and ambassador to China spoke with John Harwood about the U.S.-China meeting, the future of the Republican Party and the 2016 presidential race. 

 BODY:
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. has forged a rare political path. After serving as the governor of Utah, Mr. Huntsman, a fluent Mandarin speaker, became President Obama's ambassador to China - then resigned to oppose Mr. Obama's re-election with an unsuccessful run for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.
Since then, he has helped produce a report on cyberhacking that labeled China "the world's largest source of intellectual property theft." Mr. Huntsman sat down with John Harwood of The New York Times and CNBC at the Conrad hotel in New York to discuss Mr. Obama's meeting this week with President Xi Jinping of China, the future of the Republican Party and the 2016 presidential race.
What follows is a condensed, edited account of their conversation, as transcribed by Katherine L. Kreider. 
 Q. 
What did you try to do about cyberhacking as ambassador, and why didn't it work?
 A. 
What I tried to do specifically, and what I think has been tried since, is to find centers of best practices in China. Our thought was, if we can find the examples of excellence of enforcement in China, bring out the local officials and the party bosses and local state-owned enterprises who had been part of that model, and compliment them on it, and get them together with U.S. businesses and laud that good behavior, then those models will expand into something larger. It's slow going, and that's the painful part of it. You have to bring in China, and convince them that doing something about it is actually something in their long-term interest if they actually want to create an innovative and entrepreneurial society, which is their goal.
 Q. 
To what degree can this be solved by government-to-government diplomacy?
 A. 
Limited. You can create red lines, boundaries that are set. Every country assumes there are going to be national security targets that are poked at. But when China goes well beyond that, that's when it's a huge problem. The longer-term play is going to be on engaging this entrepreneurial society that's coming in China. They're coming up very quickly. They want to have name-brand, respected entities, they want to go global, they want to come to the United States.
If you carry that image and reputation as being a rip-off artist, that's going to hobble you in the marketplace. They're going to be ripped off, too. When I lived in Taiwan in the 1980s, Taiwan was an egregious violator of our intellectual property. When they created their first industrial park dedicated to technology and they had local entrepreneurs innovate and create new stuff, they then took this up as their issue, because it affected them.
 Q. 
Chinese leaders come and go, and Americans don't really notice the difference. What's different about President Xi?
 A. 
President Xi is a princeling, the son of the former deputy prime minister. He's a former governor of major provinces, which on a stand-alone basis in terms of population and G.D.P. are bigger than most countries in the world. He's somebody who gets the whole economic side, understands investment and trade and what it takes to make a marketplace work. He's sophisticated, confident.
His goal will be to keep the party in power, make sure it is the centerpiece of all things important in Chinese society, but at the same time you have to loosen things up. You have to move towards rule of law and expanded civil society, and greater certainty about investment, trade and commerce. You're going to have to figure out a role for the Internet in society. You can't block it and expect China to become an innovative and prosperous country longer-term.
 Q. 
Grade President Obama on how he's doing with the Chinese.
 A. 
Well like most presidents at this point, it's incomplete. I've watched him in action, and I think he's a very solid president as it relates to trying to understand the subject matter, forging a relationship - Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping - I think he's very dedicated to that end. So his priorities might be a little different than the rest of us, but he's doing his best. Now what is interesting here is, the rhythm of the U.S.-Chinese relationship is synchronized for the first time in recent memory. You have the rise of the fifth-generation leaders in China under Xi Jinping and an open set of possibilities here.
The president's going to have to forge a head-of-state to head-of-state dialogue. We have never really been able to do that. He'll have to begin to forge a reprioritized agenda with Xi Jinping, where things like cyber will probably poke into the top three or four priority issues.
 Q. 
Is cyber now more important than currency, which for years was what American politicians talked about?
 A. 
Currency was always a temporary and fleeting kind of issue, because they're appreciating 3 percent per year when you're factoring in inflation. They're going to have to wind up at a destination for their own purposes, so it's a nonsensical conversation. Cyber, on the other hand, is real - and it's a big dollar volume that we're losing out on as a country. I would guess it would come up as the premier economic issue that would be infused into the dialogue.
 Q. 
Should Americans be worried that a Chinese meat conglomerate just bought Smithfield Hams
 A. 
We're part of a global economy, and we need to accept that fact. And when you look at China's total investment in the U.S., it's a small percentage vis-à-vis its entire economic base. For them, the sensitivity will be if America is going to accept its investment, or if it's going to respond like it did 20 years ago with Japanese investment, which would cause a breakdown of our entire economic relationship. They still see America as the premier market anywhere in the world. We're 25 percent of the world's G.D.P., we're safe, we're predictable.
But here's the other part: they're going to have to clean up their act as well, whether it's I.P. theft, market access, greater transparency in corporate governance. They're going to have to look a whole lot different as entities as they enter the U.S. market, and that's a good thing. Let the reviews occur on the downside risk, but let's not forget that there's an upside, too.
The only way you raise those standards is to get out into the marketplace. You're forced to compete and you're forced to abide by new standards, or you lose business. And knowing China as I do, their desire will be to go up the ladder in terms of quality and value added, and global competitiveness.
So this will be part of a longer-term evolution as they engage with the world and try to improve their standards over all for trade and commerce. If you start blocking entry from this country or that country, you get to the Smoot-Hawley tariff situation of a couple of generations ago, and we all know the disaster that ensued from that.
 Q. 
What's working and what isn't working in our relationship with China right now?
 A. 
Well, we're up to $500 billion in trade. We were at zero 40 years ago. This relationship has come farther, faster than any relationship in humankind. We now have 200,000 students in this country - China just overtook India with the amount of students in America. You get the next generation learning in our schools, associating with Americans, better understanding our values. And they take that home - that's a huge deal.
Our cooperation - however slow or difficult - on Iran and North Korea is way more stepped up today than it has been in the past, because our interests are more and more in line as the top two economies in the world.
We don't have enough trust in the relationship to drill down to a level of granularity where you can, for example, talk about contingency planning on the Korean peninsula if you have a failed nation-state in the North. What do you do about the nukes? What do you do about refugees? What do you do about command and control? There isn't a road map developed yet for that kind of thing, which to me should keep policy makers up at night. It did to me in Beijing.
It's not the confrontation that I worry about - that's way overblown. What concerns them is the same thing that concerns us, and that is an implosion on the Korean Peninsula by a crazy leader that unleashes uncertainty in a region that is now close to being 20 percent of the world's G.D.P.
 Q. 
Let's go to U.S. politics. What does it say about the Republican Party that Michele Bachmann made a bigger splash in 2012 than you did?
 A. 
Politics as theater. There's a lot of entertainment value in politics, I've come to find. So if you want to talk about the big issues of the day and put forward a policy reform to deal with education, energy, foreign affairs, that doesn't get the bounce or the altitude that the political theater does. If you want to call somebody a name, if you want to give a speech with crazy content - that will sell, and that will get you on the front pages of the newspaper.
And sadly, that's where politics has become a little surreal and a little too focused on the entertainment side of things. It's bad for the candidates and it's really bad for the voters. The substance and the vision about where this country is going, rarely is that able to get to the surface.
 Q. 
Republicans seem to be rallying more around investigations of the Obama administration, as opposed to what Representative Paul Ryan is trying to do in the budget, what Representative Dave Camp's trying to do on tax reform, what Senator Marco Rubio is trying to do on immigration. Do you see any prospect this is going to change?
 A. 
Probably not. But scandal-mongering, however serious these issues are, is not a strategy. I think this illustrates the disconnect between the culture of Capitol Hill and Americans everywhere else who say, "We haven't seen this country work in a long time. Prove to us, political leader, that this nation can still work, and produce jobs, and compete, and educate the next generation and bring to the forefront an energy agenda that will allow us to become energy independent."
So, all of the things that will kind of bring this nation back on its feet, that's what Americans want to see and hear about. They want to know their country works and that their country is relevant, and sometimes that conversation isn't seen enough on Capitol Hill. Republicans need to be seen as problem solvers. You have to sit at a table, you have to grind away, you have to compromise. So long as compromise is seen as something analogous to treason, we will lose.
Phasing out the loopholes and deductions in the tax code - many have said, traditionally, even that step would constitute a tax increase. I don't know what world those folks are living on, but to me that's a way to move forward, clean up the tax code, make us more competitive, broaden the base, lower the rate and leave this nation with a much more competitive code that hasn't been addressed since 1986.
 Q. 
How are you going to go about deciding whether to run for president again?
 A. 
I think this cycle will be driven by ideas and less by personalities. People out there want to hear the ideas that will move this nation forward. And if those ideas bring somebody forward as a candidate, then I think that's probably how things are going to work. The next two years will really tell that story. I'm ready and willing and prepared to serve. But the ideas will drive that or not. If you find early on that people just really don't like your ideas, why waste your time?
The millennials are a very smart generation. They get the big issues that we're working on. I think they get the idea that unity, and appealing to a broader demographic, is the only way the Republicans are going to survive long term. So we'll see how 2016 goes.

HEADLINE: For the Markets, a Steady Outlook

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: The May jobs report appears to show little change in the general economic picture, and for Wall Street that&#8217;s not a bad thing. 

 BODY:
 2:18 p.m. | Updated with later bond trading. 
The latest jobs report appears to maintain the status quo, and for Wall Street, that's not a bad thing. 
Stocks rose on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the United States economy had created 175,000 jobs in May. In afternoon trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up almost 1 percent.
The number of jobs created in May was slightly higher than many on Wall Street had expected, but the much more important consideration for most strategists was what the number will mean for the policy makers at the Federal Reserve. 
"These days, the specifics of the report are far less important to our clients than is the effect it may or may not have on Fed activity," Dan Greenhaus, the chief strategist at the brokerage BTIG, wrote to clients immediately after the data was released.
The consensus so far is that the number isn't so low that it points to a shrinking economy, but it also isn't so high that it will force the Fed to reconsider its monetary stimulus programs. Wall Street has been worried for the last few weeks that the Fed might be looking to pull back on its stimulus sooner than had been previously expected if the economy showed signs of faster-than-expected growth. 
"Today's report, is exactly as we predicted; it does nothing to change the broader view that the Fed is set to steadily reduce its pace of asset purchases at the September meeting and that all else equal, good news should be taken as good news," Mr. Greenhaus wrote.
Because the Fed has been injecting money into the economy by buying government bond markets, those bond prices are a closely watched indication of sentiment about the Fed. In early trading on Friday morning, investors were buying United States government bonds in a bet that the Fed will be doing so as well. But later in the day that trend reversed, and the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 2.15 percent, from 2.08 percent on Thursday night.

 BODY:
As the economist Justin Wolfers pointed out on Twitter this morning, the United States is trailing many other advanced economies when it comes to reducing unemployment levels. Today's numbers won't change that story. It continues a long-term trend in which, although the United States economy is performing relatively well when measured by economic output, it isstruggling to translate that growth into new jobs.

HEADLINE: The Premium From a College Degree

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The economy feels very different depending on your level of educational attainment. 

 BODY:
 11:11 a.m. | Updated to include correct chart.
The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.6 percent while employers added about 175,000 new jobs in May, new Labor Department data showed this morning. But the economy feels very different depending on your level of educational attainment. For workers over the age of 25 who have a bachelor's degree, the unemployment rate is 3.8 percent. For workers without a high school diploma, it is 11.1 percent. 
Still, in recent years, the burden of student-loan debt has raised questions about whether college is really worth it - particularly if a given person goes to college, takes on significant amounts of debt, but does not get diploma. New research from the Hamilton Project, a research group based at the Brookings Institution, says that on average, the answer is still yes.
The so-called college wage premium - economists' fancy way of saying how much more workers with a college degree are paid than other workers without one - has widened over the last three decades. Degree-holders earn more than 80 percent more than their peers with just a high school diploma, up from about 40 percent more as of the late 1970s. 
But millions of students attend college without graduating, and the workplace does not reward them nearly as richly. Their unemployment rate is 6.5 percent. And while they tend to earn more than workers with just a high school diploma, they make less than workers with a full degree. (For a nuanced take on this issue, read my colleague Jason DeParle's long-form article from December.)
"The premium for these workers has experienced little to no growth over the last 30 years, where at the median they have about 15 percent to 20 percent higher earnings," said an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland released last year. "Collectively, these results show that over the last three decades, the value of college has increased substantially," with all of the gains going to those who actually complete the four-year degree.
Still, the Hamilton analysis argues that it's better to pay something for a little post-secondary education than it is to pay nothing for none - even given the rise in college costs. Students who go to but do not graduate from college still earn about $100,000 more over the course of their lifetimes than their high school-educated peers, the authors calculate.
The rate of return on that investment in school "exceeds the historical return on practically any conventional investment, including stocks, bonds, and real estate," find the scholars, Adam Looney and Michael Greenstone, who also is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Granted, that student is still much, much better off with a college degree. Over a lifetime of work, on average, a college graduate would earn over $500,000 more than a worker with just a high school diploma.

HEADLINE: This Time, Economy Is Overshadowed

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: The covert data miners at the National Security Agency stole the thunder of the more predictable number crunchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

 BODY:
 10:49 a.m. | Updated 
The covert data miners at the National Security Agency stole the thunder of the more predictable number crunchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday morning, when the release of the May jobs numbers drew merely a low rumble. The economy added 175,000 jobs last month, slightly more than expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.6 percent.
The numbers offer a "modest relief," said Ian Shepherdson,the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a market intelligence firm. He predicted in an e-mail, however, that the numbers in June and July would be "materially weaker than May," adding, "Talk of tapering will not be quieted by this report but still seems premature." 
Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, saw nothing but good news in the report: "While more work remains to be done, today's employment report provides further confirmation that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression." 
Posting on the White House blog, Mr. Krueger defended the increase in the unemployment rate to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent by noting an increase in the labor participation rate, "a sign that more workers felt encouraged to search for a job."
But another liberal economist, Adam S. Hersh of the Center for American Progress, was less impressed:
Hiring of temporary workers (+26k in May) still way below levels that indicate a sustained labor market expansion.
- Adam S. Hersh (@adamshersh)7 Jun 13
It's unclear whether Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, intended to create a little rhyme, but here is the first paragraph of his poetic-for-Washington statement:
We're happy that a few Americans were able to find jobs in the last month, but millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans are still waiting for the recovery President Obama promised years ago. This is the status quo-well below where our economy needs to be to grow.
Mr. Priebus continued, "Reports have come out showing he's lost control of his government: the IRS has been squandering taxpayers' hard-earned dollars on luxurious million dollar trips and conferences."
Don't like the numbers? Don't blame us, said Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, noting that the Republican-led chamber passed a jobs training bill and a measure to advance the Keystone XL pipeline in May.
But Representative Steny Hoyer, the Democratic whip, did blame the Republicans: "The best remedy Congress can provide for our economy is a big and balanced solution to deficits that replaces the irrational Republican policy of sequester."
May also featured the rekindling of a political fight over the interest rate for federally subsidized student loans, which are set to double in July unless Congress acts. An analysis by Joshua Shapiro of the economic consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., pointed to significance for that debate with a broader look at unemployment numbers from recent months, which unlike May, showed drops in the participation rate. 
"Making things worse from a social perspective," Mr. Shapiro wrote in an analysis circulated by e-mail, "the drop in the participation rate has not been due to aging baby-boomers retiring, but rather has been centered in younger workers, many of whom have given up hope of finding a decent job and are instead continuing in school and racking up enormous amounts of student debt, which has contributed to the recent surge in consumer credit outstanding."

HEADLINE: The Ammo Conspiracy

BYLINE: FRANCIS X. CLINES


HIGHLIGHT: Survivalist bloggers and lawmakers think the D.H.S. is deliberately creating a domestic bullet shortage. 

 BODY:
For over a year, survivalist bloggers have waxed apocalyptic about the Department of Homeland Security's bulk ammunition purchases for its 100,000 peace officers in its 90-plus agencies - "buying up enough ammo to wage seven-year war against the American people," as one hysteric put it. Others have charged that D.H.S. is deliberately creating a domestic bullet shortage for ordinary Americans intent on pursuing their Second Amendment rights. This concocted issue seemed like an occasion for light amusement until Wednesday evening, when the House seriously voted to block funds for future D.H.S. ammunition needs until the department submits to Congress a comprehensive report on the history and justification for its bullet requirements. 
The ammo conspiracy first bubbled up from the extremist corners of the Web and infected Capitol Hill some time ago. Last March, Representative Doug LaMalfa, California Republican, sent a letter to D.H.S. Secretary Janet Napolitano with questions about the timing and "astonishing scale" of ammunition buying. "Are these purchases being conducted in a manner that strategically denies the American people access to ammunition?" asked the congressman.
D.H.S. officials have pointed out repeatedly that bulk buying - whether ammunition, computers or stationery - is the norm for reasons of economy, and is especially sensible in the era of sequestration so zealously approved by Congress. D.H.S. says its plan to buy about 750 million rounds in the next five years - 80 percent for training purposes - is not unusual.

Nevertheless, the measure drew a bipartisan 234-to-192 vote of approval as an amendment to the forthcoming Homeland budget bill, proving, once again, that the gun issue has remarkable power to derange politics.
The Democratic Senate is often relied on to save the Republican House from such pandering excesses. But stay alert: Over in the Senate, Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican, introduced a measure called the AMMO (Ammunition Management for More Obtainability) Act. It would compel the Government Accountability Office to report on what he is convinced is strategic ammunition hoarding by the Obama administration. It would place limits on purchases if agency stockpiles were higher than in the Bush years.
As Senator Inhofe would have it, the administration will stop at nothing to achieve gun-control. He told Laura Ingraham in April: "We just denied everything that this president and the vice president are trying to do. So what are they going to do if they want to, if they want to violate our Second Amendment rights? Do it with ammo."

HEADLINE: Long-Term Jobless: Still a Bleak Picture

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: In essence, the job market has normalized for the short-term unemployed. But as the duration of joblessness grows, so does the divergence from prerecession trends of re-employment. 

 BODY:
Long-term unemployment remains a very dark shadow in the May jobs report: 4.4 million workers have been out of a job for more than six months. In essence, the job market has normalized for the short-term unemployed. But the longer you have been out of a job, the bleaker the picture gets. 
The number of people who report being out of work for less than five weeks has returned to almost the same level as in 2007. But the number of people unemployed 5 to 14 weeks is about 25 percent higher. For those out of a job 15 to 26 weeks, it is 78 percent higher. And the number of long-term jobless, those unemployed for more than 27 weeks, is a whopping 257 percent higher.

The long-term unemployed are struggling mightily to get rehired, as confirmed by recent research by Rand Ghayad and William Dickens of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Some economists have theorized that the unusually long spells of unemployment we have seen in the wake of the recession are caused by a "mismatch": The long-term jobless were in obsolete professions, with obsolete skills, and that is why they are not getting new gigs.
But Mr. Ghayad and Mr. Dickens argue that is not the case. The long-term jobless seem to be having trouble finding work across industries, for instance. Discrimination does seem to be a major factor, though: Employers simply do not want to hire the long-term jobless, as my colleague Catherine Rampell has reported and further research by Mr. Ghayad has shown.
Granted, the number of long-term jobless has come down sharply over the last three years, declining to a current level of 4.4 million from a high of 6.7 million in early 2010. Much of that reduction came about because the long-term jobless found jobs - it is not just about workers dropping out of the labor force. Still, the reality remains that the longer a worker is out of a job, the slimmer and slimmer the chance of being rehired.

HEADLINE: A Pitch to Add Ivory to the Agenda as Obama Meets His Chinese Counterpart

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A pitch to President Obama to put ivory on his China summit agenda. 

 BODY:
Needless to say, there's pressure on President Obama to address a host of issues in his weekend summit in the California desert with President Xi Jinping of China. Think computer security, trade disputes, North Korea's destabilizing behavior. 
But there's another one to add, says Dot Earth reader Margaret McCarthy: the destructive illegal trade in ivory.
McCarthy, the chief financial officer of WideOrbit Inc., made this point by e-mail and I invited her to make it a "Your Dot" contribution.
Here's McCarthy's pitch to the White House (I'ved added some links for context): 
"...here we are in the midst of one of the most tragic and outrageous assaults on our shared inheritance that I've seen in my lifetime-where an elephant's dead ivory is prized over its living condition, where corruption feeds on its body and soul, and where money only makes matters worse." - then Senator John Kerry, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, May 24, 2012.
I read with great interest the reports of the first extended meetings between President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping occurring at the end of this first week of June. The two presidents will spend several days together, along with Xi's charismatic wife, Peng Liyuan. I see an incredible opportunity for this group to address ivory consumption and elephant slaughter during their formal and informal time together.
The New York Times and others have consistently and compellingly highlighted the horrific levels of elephant poaching occurring daily. The demand for ivory is led by China, followed by the U.S. With so many concerns about the relations between China and the U.S. prominent in the news, I see an agreement between the two countries to stop their ivorytrade as a spectacular "win" for the meetings this week. Both countries participate and both countries win. How many other "low cost" efforts would accomplish so much good including
- Striking a blow against terrorism funding,
- Attacking a multi-billion dollar source of worldwide illegal trade,
- Disrupting an income source for militias plaguing African countries,
- Preserving ecotourism, a major economic force in many African countries, and
- Saving the world's largest and arguably best-loved land mammal.
And this truly is low-cost. While elephant ivory sales provide astronomical funds for criminals and terrorists, the consumer ivory market is small compared to autos, solar panels and electronics. The demand for ivory is for trinkets, for "bling" to be worn or displayed, easily satisfied by a substitute luxury good. Buy jade, for goodness sakes. The very popular first ladies alone could change the trajectory of ivory demand by joining Ms. Le Bingbing and Mr. Yao Ming in helping to make ivory ownership socially unacceptable. In the long term, that change of attitude is needed to truly save the elephants.

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Soggy Supply Line Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Porsche will halt Cayenne and Panamera production while flooding affects supply lines, and General Motors says it will offer free maintenance for new vehicles. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Porsche had to halt production of its Cayenne and Panamera models on Thursday. The plant that assembles them is in Leipzig, Germany, but the factory that builds Cayenne bodies, in Slovakia, lies on the other side of major flooding that has stopped transportation between the cities. Normally, the bodies are transported by train from the Volkswagen plant in Bratislava, Slovakia, across the Czech Republic and into the plant at Leipzig, but high water levels in the Czech Republic are making it impossible for freight trains to get through. Although bodies for the Panamera are not affected by the supply interruption, Porsche decided to shut down the factory until delivery of Cayenne bodies resumes. (Automotive News)
 General Motors announced that it would offer free basic maintenance on new Buick, Chevrolet and GMC vehicles to increase brand loyalty and sales. G.M.'s incentive program would cover vehicles for the first two years, or 24,000 miles, and is similar to what the automaker recently began offering with its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, and for a while longer with some Cadillac models. The free maintenance program will cover most G.M. vehicles, with the exception of some high performance nameplates. (Automotive News) 
 Volvo may begin exporting vehicles built in China in the future, Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo's chief executive, said on Tuesday. Li Shufu, a Chinese investor, bought the Swedish automaker three years ago, shifting much of the company's focus to high-demand China. But the company may use some of its Chinese-built vehicles to bolster Volvo's export capacity for countries in the region. Between Volvo's Chengdu, China, factory and a plant it plans to build in Daqing, China, next year, Mr. Samuelsson said the company expected to increase its production capacity in China to 200,000 vehicles per year.

 It looked like any other day at the track for Edmund Burgess on Sunday. But while the antique car collector was driving his 1924 Bugatti Type 35, the $389,000 race car tipped over and crashed, landing on top of him. Miraculously, the accident didn't hurt Mr. Burgess, who got out of the car and ordered himself a beer at a nearby bar. The car didn't fare so well: its right front wheel was bent, its steering wheel mangled and the bonnet rumpled and scraped. Still, all things considered, everything seems to have turned out well. The car even looks like it could be salvaged. (Jalopnik)
 With automaker incentive spending on the wane and new car prices rising, Wards Auto reports that an auto industry comeback may be at risk. Going by data from N.A.D.A. and J.D. Power & Associates, Wards says that median household incomes have grown slowly, but new car prices have shot up. According to J.D. Power, the average transaction price was $25,505 in 2008. That number has jumped 13 percent, to $28,831, while incentive spending per-vehicle has diminished by 5 percent. The result has been that more consumers are buying smaller, less expensive cars, as well as seeking longer loan terms that are not necessarily beneficial to customers in the long run. Automakers argue that car buyers are getting more for their money. (Wards Auto)
 The City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Harbor Commission are being sued over their plan to replace trucking from the Port of Los Angeles with rail service. In an effort to reduce congestion and increase air quality around Long Beach, Calif., where the port is located, the city approved plans to build a $500 million rail terminal in the area. Six trucking companies claim that the project will be detrimental to port-dependent local businesses and would actually worsen traffic in the area as well as have a negative impact on adjacent working-class neighborhoods. Bob Foster, the mayor of Long Beach, has also been a vocal opponent of the project, which he insists will hurt nearby low-income residents. (Courthouse News Service)
An earlier version of this post misstated the source of a statement that an auto industry comeback may be at risk. It was Wards Auto, not N.A.D.A. and J.D. Power & Associates.

HEADLINE: Weighing Fed Policy from Sturgeon Bay, Wis.

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Kasriel has a yardstick that helps him assess whether the Federal Reserve&#8217;s extraordinary stimulus will lead to economic growth. 

 BODY:
Paul Kasriel spends his days learning the bass guitar for a band he joined after he retired last year as Northern Trust's chief economist. Between practices, however, he works on an economic yardstick that many on Wall Street would find fascinating.
It is a calculation that helps him assess whether the Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus will lead to economic growth. That endlessly debated subject came to the fore again on Friday, when the Labor Department said the economy added 175,000 jobs in May. That's a solid showing, but maybe not strong enough to convince people that the Fed will taper its enormous asset purchases sooner rather than later. 
But from his vantage point in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., Mr. Kasriel says he believes the economy will start growing at a rate that should prompt the Fed to cut back its efforts. "I think the Fed should taper in the second half of the year," he said.
At Northern Trust, Mr. Kasriel gained a following for his pithy analyses that were often prescient. Not many economists predicted a slowdown in growth before the 2008 financial crisis. But Mr. Kasriel was sounding warnings throughout 2007, and as the year was coming to a close he rolled outthe Kasriel Recession Warning Indicator, which showed a 65.5 percent chance of a recession the following year.
After the crisis, in 2010, he predicted the second big round of Fed stimulus would lift the economy, and it did. Then, in 2011, when the Fed ended that effort, Mr. Kasriel predicted that the economy would suffer, and growth did weaken in 2012.
In his analyses, Mr. Kasriel pays particularly close attention to credit.
Banks effectively get to create money out of thin air as they lend to companies and individuals, and as this money gets spent, the economy benefits. This activity was severely undermined after the crisis, which is why, he thinks, the Fed had to step in and us its balance sheet to pump money into the economy. If banks aren't creating new money, the Fed has to help. Forcefully, it has to outright increase the quantity of money and credit. Hence the term quantitative easing, or Q.E., which is bandied about on Wall Street.
Mr. Kasriel's special yardstick adds together both bank credit and assets held by the Fed. When that total is going up by, say, more than 5 percent, the economy gains strength.
"Follow the money," said Mr. Kasriel, who posts intermittently to his blog, The Econtrarian.
In 2011, Fed assets and bank credit grew by a combined 6.1 percent, and the economy was expanding by over 4 percent in the fourth quarter of the year. In 2012, that total went up by 4.4 percent. In the final quarter of the year, the economy was barely growing, though it of course faced major headwinds.
Despite the uncertainty swirling in the markets today, Mr. Kasriel is getting excited about the economy. The Fed's most recent stimulus effort is causing his favored yardstick to grow again. Bank credit was up 4 percent in the first quarter and the Fed's assets jumped 12 percent. Overall, that caused Mr. Kasriel's metric to rise 6 percent in the first quarter.
"That will translate into an acceleration of private domestic spending," he said.
Mr. Kasriel was a keen critic of the Fed before the financial crisis, and he still harbors a deep skepticism toward the central bank. He suspects it will over-stimulate the economy for too long.
"From its public statements, I am not sure the Fed understands Q.E." he said.

HEADLINE: Fund Manager Settles Case in Dell Insider Trading Ring

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Victor Dosti, a portfolio manager at the Whittier Trust Company, has settled a case brought by regulators who accused him of illegally trading in Dell. He is the ninth person charged by the government related to the Dell trade. 

 BODY:
In August 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, a large bet that the shares of Dell would drop proved highly lucrative for a tight-knit group of traders. It has also proved to be bountiful for the government in its campaign to root out insider trading on Wall Street. 
On Friday, Victor Dosti, a former portfolio manager at the Whittier Trust Company, settled a civil action brought by federal securities regulators who accused him of illegally trading Dell shares. He is the ninth person charged by the government related to the Dell trade.
 Mr. Dosti and Whittier, a money manager based in South Pasadena, Calif., agreed to pay about $1.7 million to resolve the lawsuit, which was filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The S.E.C. said that Whittier earned profits and avoided losses of about $725,000 by trading on illicit tips about Dell as well as the technology companies Nvidia and Wind River Systems.
The secret information was funneled to Mr. Dosti by Daniel Kuo, a former analyst at Whittier who pleaded guilty last year to criminal charges that he was part of the insider-trading scheme of traders, analysts and corporate insiders who earned about $70 million in profits by trading on secret information that came from inside Dell and other companies.
"Time and again, Dosti received what he knew was inside information from Kuo and traded on it to generate illicit gains," Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the S.E.C.'s regional office in New York, said in a statement.
Gary Lincenberg, a lawyer for Mr. Dosti, declined to comment. Robert Anello, a lawyer for Whittier, said that his client was glad to have the matter behind it and that "the conduct engaged in by two former employees is completely contrary to the core values of this organization."
Two of the nine individuals tied to the Dell insider-trading ring are former employees of SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund that is at the center of the government's investigation. Michael Steinberg, a longtime SAC trader, was charged as part of the ring that illegally traded Dell and Nvidia. His name first surfaced last fall, when Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst, pleaded guilty to insider trading in the two technology stocks and said he shared the information with Mr. Steinberg.
Mr. Steinberg has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to stand trial on Nov. 18.
Whittier fired Mr. Dosti, 49, last January after federal prosecutors first brought charges related to the Dell and Nvidia trades. Mr. Dosti, an Albanian immigrant, received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago and worked at Northern Trust and Citigroup before joining Whittier about a decade ago.

HEADLINE: The 2014 Toyota Corolla Is Bigger, Braver and Brighter

BYLINE: DEXTER FORD


HIGHLIGHT: Toyota seems to be going for a more exciting image in its all-new 2014 Corolla, which was unveiled on Thursday. 

 BODY:
SANTA MONICA, Calif. - After a wild night filled with bungee cord-suspended gymnasts, women dancing sideways on a wall of aluminum foil and a floating clear-bottomed pool with Argentinian nymphs sliding and squishing inches over the heads of a puzzled, crowd, Toyota on Thursday unveiled its all-new 11th-generation Corolla, the latest iteration of its ubiquitous economical compact.
The car was nice, too - perhaps the debut of a more-courageous, youth-oriented, more-confident Toyota. Fully cognizant that the company had been falling behind its competitors in the affordable-car design wars, Toyota seemed determined to sharpen its image from that of a provider of reliable, affordable and sometimes forgettable machines. 
The 2014 Corolla gains about 4 inches in wheelbase, less than an inch in width and has a more-tapered aspect, with the front and rear sections stretched for a more elegant sweep of line and a more aerodynamic shape. The new lines work together well, with the car's shoulder, trunk and roof lines coming together in a sculptured C-pillar (behind the rear windows) that evokes hints of the Lexus IS250, with just a touch of Camaro. LED low-beam headlights are standard on all models. The LEDs save energy and allow a lower, more tapered front corner for lighter weight, sleeker looks and more-slippery aerodynamics.
The car's underpinnings are all new, with the wheels pushed farther into its corners for increased interior room, as well as a more athletic stance on the road. More high-strength steel should improve handling and safety performance by creating a stiffer structure, and additional sound-proofing materials in the cowl, dash and fenders will make it easier to hear the Bluetooth Entune sound system.
A new Continuously Variable Transmission (CVTi-S in Toyota-speak), adds a note of fresh technology to the design. Available in all but the lowest base model, the CVTi-S has been programmed with seven discrete virtual shift points, giving the impression of a conventional 7-speed automatic, but with better fuel efficiency. The CVTi-S is a cornerstone of a new-for-2014 LE Eco model, which also features a new 1.8-liter, 140-horsepower engine with Valvematic, a technology that more closely controls intake valve lift and timing. Non-CVTi-S models will offer a choice between a 6-speed manual transmission or the current, conventional 4-speed automatic.
The LE Eco is designed to receive a 40-mile-per-gallon E.P.A. highway rating, though the actual E.P.A. testing has not yet been completed. Other Toyota models, the L, LE and S, will be powered by the existing 1.8-liter engine, with its current 132 horsepower output.
Inside, the Corolla has been stretched, padded and pulled upscale, with the rear hip point moved back almost three inches. The changes offer improved rear leg room and a flatter rear floor because of rerouting of the exhaust system. Interior trim is tastefully utilitarian, with gloss-black and metallic panels as well as blue, black or amber pinstripe accents. There will be no animals harmed in the Corolla interior: fabric choices are cloth and SofTex, a pleatherlike substance.
With nearly 40 million Corollas sold since the car's debut in the '60s, the Corolla is as much a social movement and a vital part of the American carscape as it is a mere automobile. If the past is any guide, we can be reasonably certain that there will soon be hundreds, thousands and then millions of these 11th-generation Corollas everywhere we drive. And because of Toyota's newly emboldened designers, they could be far less forgettable than the many, many Corollas that have come before.

HEADLINE: Kentucky and New York Make Storied Rivals and Partners

BYLINE: JIM SQUIRES


HIGHLIGHT: The states&#8217; longstanding competition will gain a new chapter with Orb and Oxbow in Saturday&#8217;s Belmont Stakes. 

 BODY:
Perhaps the lone uncontested aspect of the sport of thoroughbred racing in America is that its history and its future are rooted in the states of Kentucky and New York. Their longstanding competition that will gain a new chapter with Saturday's Belmont Stakes.
Although the contest between the Kentucky Derby winner Orb and the Preakness winner Oxbow pales in comparison with rivalries like the 1989 Sunday Silence/Easy Goer battle for the Triple Crown, many of the same emotions are roiling and the outcome, however good the race, will have bittersweet consequences. 
Among Bluegrass loyalists, the Calumet Farm-owned and Kentucky-bred Oxbow is a kind of stand-in representative for a once globally dominant breeding industry reeling from downsizing forced by economics, its own shortsightedness and the rise of international competition from Europe and Asia. 
Although Orb is also Kentucky-bred, trained by the popular Kentuckian Shug McGaughey and owned by a family that has been a major force in the building of the state's reputation as the world's leading breeder of racehorses, he is still the New York horse. And not simply because the Belmont track is McGaughey's major training base and has been the home of the Phipps Racing Stable for all of its long history. 
The irony of the situation is as deep and sweeping as Big Sandy itself and far too complex to be one of NBC's Belmont story lines. To understand it fully requires an insight into the two most storied and beautiful thoroughbred breeding farms in the world: Calumet in Lexington, where Oxbow will probably go to stud, and Claiborne Farm, in nearby Paris, where Orb was born and raised. Orb may well end up in the old stall of either Secretariat or his broodmare sire Unbridled. They each died there, and their blood runs through his veins. 
In fact, family pedigree - equine and human - plays a critical role in the drama. Nothing has been more important to the rise and fame of Claiborne Farm, owned by the Kentucky Hancocks, than the magnificent broodmare band of the New York Phippses, a relationship that goes back three generations and from which have come some of the most famous horses in history. That the Hancock and Phipps families could be this close and still compete against each other, as they last did when Claiborne's Departing challenged Phipps's Orb in the Preakness three weeks ago, is hard evidence of the true sporting aspects of thoroughbred breeding. 
This is indeed the essence of the sport of kings, the most notable example of which was the exciting Triple Crown struggle between Sunday Silence, owned by Arthur Hancock, and Easy Goer, owned by the Phipps stable. After losing the Derby and the Preakness by small margins, Easy Goer returned to his home track and spoiled what many figured would be a certain Triple Crown for Sunday Silence. Though the horses were born a few miles from each other and Sunday Silence was eight lengths back at the finish line, the nature of the rivalry was signaled by the track announcer Marshall Cassidy's declaration that "It's New York's Easy Goer in front."
How despite all of Orb's local connections, Calumet's Oxbow figures as the Kentucky horse Saturday is also a family story of sorts. Being the home of eight Derby winners, eight Preakness winners and the Triple Crown winners Whirlaway and Citation, the farm is the emblem of Kentucky breeding excellence, unrivaled even by Claiborne. But as a force in breeding or racing, it has been dormant since 1978, when its star Alydar lost all three Triple Crown contests to the Florida-bred Affirmed.
 It fell into bankruptcy for a while before being bought by Henryk de Kwiatkowski, who failed to add to its legacy before dying in 2003. The expanse on Lexington's edge just inside Keeneland Race Course, was merely maintained by his heirs and a board of trust until May 2012, when it was purchased by Brad Kelley, a Kentucky native and Tennessee billionaire.
A man who owns nearly two square miles of America, a holding about the size of Rhode Island, Kelley knows what to do with land. In short order he has turned Calumet into a shining star again, exactly the kind of shot in the arm needed by the Kentucky breeding industry. The most visible and beautiful spread of Kentucky bluegrass is again awash with first-class bloodstock, all owned by Kelley, who unlike most farm owners neither needs nor wants boarders.. 
Like industry leaders of days long gone, Kelley is importing stallions from abroad and developing his racehorses like English Channel and Oxbow into sires, and he appears committed to restoring Calumet as a major breeding station and racing power. Along with the similarly inclined and fast-rising WinStar, owned by Texas transplants only a few miles away, Kelley's vision has become a beacon of hope for restoration of a declining signature industry. Many of the big stallions farms across the parkland of pastures in central Kentucky have been swallowed up by Arab, Canadian, Japanese, Irish, South African and South American investors, and more are coming. 
With Orb's stallion future and Claiborne's survival pretty much guaranteed as an American enterprise, rooting for the success of Kelley's rejuvenation of Calumet is becoming a popular Kentucky pastime, its explanation as simple as horse breeding economics. Wherever the great stallions are is where the great mares will live, and hometown owners are not likely to move them.

HEADLINE: In Bosnia, a Protest Over IDs Traps Hundreds in Parliament

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
It was a decidedly Balkan revolt and a rare explosion of people power in one of Europe's poorest and most ethnically divided countries.
About 1,500 lawmakers, government employees and foreign guests were finally freed in the early hours of Friday morning after thousands of irate protesters had formed a human chain around the Bosnian Parliament building in Sarajevo for 14 hours to demonstrate against an impasse over a law on identification documents. 
Women with babies in carriages, pensioners and students faced off with police officers deployed to the scene as foreigners trapped inside -- including about 250 foreign bankers attending a conference to examine investment opportunities -- called their embassies back home to say they had been taken hostage.
Some of the protesters held up a sign saying, ''We don't want entities, we want identities'' -- a reference to the byzantine bureaucratic system in Bosnia that has magnified ethnic enmities, entrenched political deadlock and impeded the country's progress toward joining the European Union.
At the root of the crisis is the failure of lawmakers to agree on a new law on how to determine the 13-digit identification numbers assigned to every citizen. The previous law lapsed in February, leaving all babies born since then without the identification documents necessary to travel abroad or see a doctor.
Bosnian Serbs have demanded that the identification cards have a specific number specifying their region, while the country's Muslim Bosniak and Croat legislators want the identification numbers to be random to avoid further stoking of ethnic divisions.
''The ridiculousness in Bosnia has reached new level,'' said Srecko Latal, a Balkan analyst with the International Crisis Group in Sarajevo. ''These protests show the extent to which people are fed up with economic and social stagnation and prolonged political crisis. But they may have done more harm than good, as it is very unlikely that any of these foreigners trapped will ever consider again investing in a country that behaves like this.''
The protesters were spurred to action after the parents of a 3-month-old baby posted on Facebook this week that their infant was unable to travel to get an urgent stem cell transplant in Germany because the squabble over the law had prevented the baby from getting a passport.
The 1995 Dayton accord brokered by the United States divided the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina into two entities -- a Muslim-Croat Federation and a Serbian Republic -- and ended a war in which more than 100,000 people were killed, a majority of them Muslims. But the complex power-sharing system it created has helped paralyze the country.
The international community's envoy in Bosnia, Valentin Inzko, who managed to convince the protesters to relax their human barricade after promising to work to resolve the issue, said the foreign bankers attending the finance conference had appealed to their embassies to help them get out of a ''hostage situation.'' He told Bosnian state television on Friday that the episode threatened to undermine Bosnia's international reputation.
''I received calls from Austrian and German diplomats asking to help them get out,'' he said.
The government reached an interim deal to resume issuing identification numbers for the next six months. But the protesters insist that they will continue to protest until the impasse is overcome.

HEADLINE: High Yields On Checking

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Interest rates on most savings and checking accounts remain anemic. But for those who are comfortable with electronic banking and who are active debit-card users, high-yield checking accounts offered by smaller, regional banks and credit unions can be a more lucrative option. 
The financial site Bankrate.com examined 56 ''high yield'' checking accounts across the country, and found an average yield of 1.64 percent. That's considerably lower than rates the site found last year. But it looks quite good in comparison to most interest-bearing checking accounts, which had a national average yield of just 0.05 percent.
The catch is that to benefit from the accounts, which are federally insured, users have to meet some requirements each month.
For instance, all of the accounts reviewed by Bankrate require at least 10 debit-card transactions a month, and all require that users receive their monthly statements electronically. Most also require direct deposit or automated bill payments.
The penalty for not meeting the requirements is severe -- the average interest rate drops to just 0.07 percent.
If 10 debit transactions are required a month and you make just nine, you're out of luck, said Greg McBride, senior analyst at Bankrate.
In addition, the accounts all carry balance caps -- maximum balances on which the above-market interest rate applies.
The average cap is about $17,000 (down from about $19,000 last year), but the highest-yielding accounts tend to have the lowest caps. None of the 14 best-paying accounts available nationally, for instance, have a cap above $15,000, so if you had $20,000 in the account, the additional $5,000 would not earn the higher rate.
Still, Mr. McBride notes, consumers who can handle the requirements may still benefit from the accounts, perhaps as a place to park emergency funds or other cash.
Roughly a third of the high-yield accounts that Bankrate surveyed are available nationally, although some require a visit to a branch to open the account. About 39 percent of the accounts have some geographic limitation, like in-state residency.
Ouachita Independent Bank in Monroe, La., for example, offers a 3.01 percent annual percentage yield -- but the account is available only to residents of Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi.
Do you have a high-yield checking account? Do you find it easy to meet its requirements?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Construction Improves, Yet Is Still Historically Low

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Home construction is booming in the United States, but it remains severely depressed.
That seemingly contradictory statement was illustrated by construction spending statistics issued this week by the Census Bureau. In April, spending on the construction of new houses and apartment buildings reached an annual rate of $195 billion. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, spending on home building is up 40 percent over the last year. 
That is the largest such increase since the early 1980s. In the housing boom that preceded the Great Recession, such spending never rose more than 25 percent over a 12-month period.
But that rate of spending is down more than 60 percent from the peak, reached in 2006, and is lower than spending as far back as 1997.
The figures are not adjusted for inflation. Were they so adjusted, the current level of spending would be even lower compared with the pace of building in past years.
The charts are based on three-month averages of annual rates, in an effort to smooth out fluctuations caused by weather.
Over all, total construction spending is running at an annual rate of about $861 billion, or 28 percent less than the 2006 peak.
Private construction for things other than home construction continued to expand well after home building activity turned lower in 2006, and did not fall as far during the Great Recession. But the recovery in such spending last year has faded, and the latest figures show spending in that area is falling.
But that spending is not falling as rapidly as public spending on construction, which is dominated by spending by state and local governments. The latest figures show such spending is shrinking at an annual rate of 4 percent. Not since 2009 has such spending risen on a year-over-year basis.
While home-building activity is rising rapidly, some areas of spending that were strong during the boom have still shown few signs of revival. Spending on what the government calls multiretail building, including shopping centers and department stores, remains 60 percent below the peak, and after rising last year is again declining.
The proportion of the work force employed in the financial industry has fallen to the lowest figure since 1981, and that is showing up in spending on construction of offices for financial firms. That spending is running at a rate of about $1.7 billion a year, a figure that is lower than at any time since the government began collecting the statistic in 1993.
Within public construction spending, some areas have held up better than others. Among state and local governments, spending on construction of primary and secondary education buildings is running 40 percent below peak levels, but spending on higher education buildings is down only 15 percent, although both areas are declining in the most recent reports. As a result, the higher education share of total education spending is about 37 percent. Before the recession, the share was usually under 30 percent.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Home Builders Spend Much More, While Governments Cut: Spending on housing construction in the United States is rising rapidly, but it remains at historically low levels. Other private construction spending continued to rise after housing spending began to fall in 2006, but it also fell sharply during the credit crisis. The 2012 recovery in such spending has now faded away. Public construction spending, meanwhile, did not peak until 2009, but has been declining since then and is now at the lowest level since 2007. One relatively small area of construction activity that fell sharply in the recession and has continued to decline, is construction of offices for financial companies like banks and brokerage firms.

HEADLINE: Several Rivals Surge Past U.S. In Adding Jobs

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Reporting was contributed by Catherine Rampell, Annie Lowrey and Binyamin Appelbaum.

 BODY:
The American economy may be the world's biggest, but when it comes to job creation since the recession hit at the end of 2007, it is far from a leader.
Indeed, contrary to the widespread view that the United States is an island of relative prosperity in a global sea of economic torpor, employment in several other nations has bounced back more quickly, according to a new analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The government reported Friday that the nation added 175,000 jobs in May, continuing a 32-month run of job gains. The unemployment rate moved up slightly to 7.6 percent, from 7.5 percent in April.
But overall employment in the United States remained 2.1 percent below where it was at the end of 2007, according to the statistics bureau. By comparison, over the same period, between December 2007 and March 2013, the number of jobs was up 8.1 percent in Australia; Germany, the biggest economy in the troubled euro zone, has managed a 5.8 percent gain in employment. 
''The United States is way below where it should be,'' said Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''We had a massive downturn and a tepid recovery.''
Still, Friday's jobs report appeared to be just what Wall Street was hoping for. Major stock market indexes jumped by 1.3 percent as traders bet that the modest employment gains and the uptick in joblessness meant that the Federal Reserve would be forced to keep pumping money into the economy in a bid to stimulate greater growth.
The Fed's push to keep short-term interest rates near zero and flood the economy with trillions of dollars since the onset of the recession has been credited with staving off a far deeper downturn. It also has helped stabilize the housing market and given Wall Street a major lift since the dark days of early 2009, when the Dow Jones industrial average was below 7,000. On Friday, the Dow closed at 15,248.12, more than double the recession low.
The United States economy is performing relatively well by some yardsticks -- a steady increase in economic output, a surge in corporate profits and new stock market highs -- but the robust job market that is a key focus now of Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other Fed policy makers remains out of reach.
While several European countries have fared worse, Canada, Sweden and even Britain, which is trapped in yet another recession, have enjoyed healthier job gains than the United States. In fact, of the nine countries surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only perennially-troubled Italy and Japan performed worse.
A big part of the problem, economists say, is just how big a hole the American economy fell into in the first place. Not only did the global economic downturn begin here, it also enveloped the housing market and the banking system, sectors that were largely spared in many other countries.
''Canada didn't really have much of a housing bust,'' Mr. Katz said.
A new paper by two economists from the University of British Columbia, Florian Hoffmann and Thomas Lemieux, concludes that over half of the recent variation in employment trends between the United States on the one hand, and Canada and Germany on the other, can be attributed to the construction sector.
Although the construction field gained 69,000 jobs in the first five months of 2013, with 5.8 million jobs in May, that was still nearly two million fewer jobs than in 2007, according to the Labor Department.
Other countries have generated jobs on the basis of strong exports. Germany's economy, for example, was powered until recently by shipments of machinery, cars and other products of its high-end manufacturing industries. Australia emerged largely unscathed from the downturn, thanks to booming Chinese demand for raw materials.
The German government also went to great lengths to discourage outright layoffs, instead encouraging employers to keep workers in a part-time capacity. At the same time, letting workers go in Europe is a much more costly proposition for big employers than it is in the United States.
Another challenge in the United States, Mr. Katz said, is the fiscal squeeze in the public sector, as the government continues to shed jobs at a rapid rate.
The federal government, for example, lost 14,000 jobs in May, in part because of the across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration, put in place by Congress in March. Over the last three months, the federal government has shed 45,000 jobs, not including furloughs.
The fitful recovery that began in 2009 is also different from the trend that prevailed after the deep recession of the early 1980s, said Laurence M. Ball, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. While economic growth has struggled to top 2 percent in recent years, annual gains in output briefly topped 7 percent when the economy bounced off the bottom three decades ago.
Mr. Ball noted that the weak trajectory of the labor market in the United States mirrored the pattern for overall economic output. While the Australian economy was 13 percent larger in terms of output than it was in 2007, and Canada had expanded by 6 percent, the American economy had grown by only 3 percent over the same period.
The overall employment picture in the United States remained better than many other Western countries, despite the slow pace of job creation since the recession. For example, unemployment in Spain was 27.2 percent, Italy had a jobless rate of 12 percent, and the unemployment rate in France was 10.8 percent.
Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, said that focusing on Sweden or Germany could be deceptive because of the economic carnage in other parts of the Continent. In addition, he said, the Labor Department study ''tells us more about the dip in the U.S. than the recovery. We fell into a deeper hole, faster.''
Still, at 7.6 percent in May, unemployment in the United States is half a percentage point higher than in neighboring Canada. The United States population is nearly 10 times that of Canada, yet the Canadian economy added 95,000 jobs in May compared with 175,000 in the United States.
Another sign of distress is the persistence of long-term unemployment four years into the recovery. While the number of workers who have been out of a job for less than five weeks is almost unchanged from 2007 levels, there are roughly 4.4 million Americans who have been unemployed for more than six months, a 257 percent increase since 2007.
''As the economy recovers, we are going to see growth,'' said Alexandre Mas, a professor of economics at Princeton and a former chief economist at the Labor Department. ''But we haven't fully recovered yet.''

HEADLINE: Splits Appear in Policy 'Troika' Addressing Europe Financial Woes

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and James Kanter from Brussels.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- After a series of nightlong crisis meetings on Cyprus, the European Union's economic policy chief, Olli Rehn, remarked that his wife had started complaining that he spent more time with Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, than with her.
Throughout much of Europe's seemingly unending economic crisis, Mr. Rehn and the I.M.F. chief have been an inseparable part of a curious policy-making ménage à trois known as the ''troika,'' a trio that also includes the European Central Bank.
The tensions at the heart of this intimate but unwieldy arrangement, however, have now burst into the open with an unusual bout of finger-pointing over policies that have pushed parts of Europe into an economic slump more severe than the Great Depression and left the Continent as a whole far short of even Japan's anemic recovery.
The blame game, initiated by a highly critical internal I.M.F. report released this week in Washington, has put a spotlight on a question that has lurked in the shadows throughout the troika's efforts to get a grip on Europe's economic mess: Is it time for a divorce? 
Speaking Friday at an economic conference in his home country of Finland, Mr. Rehn, the usually phlegmatic commissioner of economic and monetary affairs, sounded like a put-upon spouse in a messy breakup. ''I don't think it's fair and just for the I.M.F. to wash its hands and throw dirty water on the Europeans,'' he said.
He was responding to assertions by the I.M.F. that the European Commission, the union's executive arm, had blocked proposals back in 2010 to make investors share more of the pain by writing down Greece's debt and, more generally, had neglected the importance of structural reforms to lift Europe's sluggish economy.
Simon O'Connor, Mr. Rehn's spokesman, said the report had made some valid points, but he derided as ''plainly wrong and unfounded'' a claim that the commission had not done enough to promote growth through reform. On this issue and events in Greece, Mr. O'Connor said, ''We fundamentally disagree.''
Left-wing politicians who have long denounced the troika as an alien and unaccountable force are muttering ''told you so'' and complaining that putting policy in the hands of a triumvirate of unelected institutions could never work.
''The troika is constructed in such a way that it is untouchable, and that is the end of democracy,'' said Udo Bullmann, a Socialist member of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee from Germany and a strong critic of austerity measures that have formed the core of the troika's policy prescription for Europe's ailing economies.
''What is this troika?'' asked Mr. Bullmann. ''It has no address and no telephone number. Who do you talk to?'' He said the troika was designed to diffuse and thus dodge responsibility. ''Decisions are made in a nontransparent and nondemocratic way so that nobody has to take the blame,'' he said.
Charles H. Dallara, a former United States Treasury Department official who represented the banking industry in negotiations with the troika over Greece, said that the I.M.F. and the European Commission were never as united as they often seemed and were bound to come to blows at some point.
''It is very difficult to have three cooks in the kitchen all the time. That is just life,'' said Mr. Dallara, who now works for a private equity company based in Switzerland. ''You need one institution driving negotiations. You don't need three.''
The idea of yoking three together to address Europe's troubles dates back four years to when it became clear that Greece, the weakest member of the 17-nation zone that uses the euro, would need a bailout to stave off bankruptcy. Northern European countries, particularly Germany, demanded that the I.M.F. play a role in order to share both the cost of a bailout and the blame for imposing tough terms.
The triumvirate immediately became a lightning rod for public anger, denounced in Greece and in three other countries that later went to it for help as an agent of misery. Unemployment soared, reaching 27 percent in Greece and nearly that in Spain. Repeated assurances that recovery was just round the corner collided with reality. The European Union as a whole has now had six quarters in a row of negative growth. Greece has been stuck in a grinding recession for six years.
When the troika agreed to throw a lifeline to Cyprus in March it imposed such harsh terms, including the effective confiscation of some bank deposits, that protesters took to the streets waving placards denouncing it as the ''Fourth Reich.''
Only in Ireland have the troika's policies, anchored in budget cuts and tax increases, shown much sign of working. In recent weeks, Mr. Rehn has signaled a slow but steady retreat from these austerity measures and acknowledged that unemployment has reached unacceptable levels.
''Is the troika learning from its mistakes?'' asked Capital Economics, a British research group, in a research note released Friday. It said the I.M.F.'s admission that ''mistakes were made'' raised hope that the troika ''might be becoming more realistic about the demands that they should make of struggling euro zone members.'' But it added that the I.M.F. and its two partners differed on how far the softening of austerity should go, with the European Central Bank still championing the cause of ''fiscal consolidation.''
Disbanding the much reviled troika, or at least overhauling its crisis management strategy, will not be easy. Addressing the European Parliament last month, Jörg Asmussen, Germany's representative on the board of the European Central Bank, acknowledged that ''the setup is a bit strange'' and said it ''has to be changed.''
But he added that as long as Europe's economic crisis continued and countries remained under programs negotiated by the troika, the current state of affairs must remain in place. ''We have no alternative to it right now,'' he said.
Mr. Rehn, in an interview last month, acknowledged complaints in the European Parliament that the I.M.F., an outsider, did not have to answer to European institutions and that each of the three members of the troika had ''its own philosophy and rules and a very strong sense of independence,'' and putting them together was always going to be difficult. But, he added, ''It has worked in practice even if it might not have been possible to work in theory.''
All the same, he said, change is still needed, particularly in relation to decision-making in the 17-nation euro zone. One big problem, he said, is that when finance ministers of countries using the euro meet to discuss a possible bailout, they must agree unanimously before anything can be done. ''By definition the rule of unanimity makes decision-making much less effective and efficient than it should be,'' he said.
The 50-page I.M.F. report released Wednesday did not provide a general survey of what had gone wrong in Europe, but focused on mistakes in Greece's first bailout in 2010, which totaled about $143 billion. A major error, it said, was not to force investors holding Greek bonds to accept losses from the start -- instead of waiting until late 2011 -- so as to reduce the pressure on the government to cut spending. One reason this did not happen, according to the I.M.F., was opposition from the European Commission.
Though cast in part as a mea culpa by the I.M.F., the document has hit a raw nerve in Brussels, where officials have mostly refrained from criticizing the fund despite quarrels behind closed doors. There have been frequent tensions within the troika, with some European officials aghast at what they regarded as the I.M.F.'s insistence on unrealistic debt targets for Greece. Negotiations over what to do about Cyprus also created friction, particularly over a quickly aborted initial plan that involved seizing a portion of insured bank deposits held by savers with less than 100,000 euros in their accounts.
The European Central Bank has mostly stayed out of this week's public fracas. Mario Draghi, the head of the bank, said in Frankfurt on Thursday that his institution had no plans to issue its own mea culpa. ''In fact, one good thing, as far as I understand, about this I.M.F. paper is that the E.C.B. is not being criticized,'' said Mr. Draghi.
Instead of reviewing past errors, he said, Europe should ''take stock of the extraordinary progress made and the positive path that has been taken.''

HEADLINE: Investors Keen on Myanmar See Inching Progress

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar -- Foreign executives who flew into this dirt-poor country over the past year to tap into what is described as Asia's last major frontier market often came away skeptical, befuddled or outright disappointed.
''Look, listen, learn -- and leave'' was the catch phrase that described trips here by executives who saw first-hand the lack of electricity, terrible roads, eager but very undereducated work force and overwhelmed government officials. 
Now, two years after Myanmar's civilian government came to power, the country appears to be moving into another stretch of its journey from military dictatorship to democratic market economy. Flirtations by foreign investors are turning into commitments, vague promises into dollars.
Some of the world's most prominent multinational companies -- Coca-Cola, Unilever, General Electric, Philips, Visa -- have started doing business in the country.
''We're prepared to be very patient,'' said John G. Rice, a vice chairman of General Electric, who attended a World Economic Forum conference of foreign executives in Naypyidaw that concluded Friday. G.E. has leased aircraft and sold medical machinery and turbines in Myanmar in recent months and announced it would donate $7 million worth of training to engineers and health care workers.
The overall scale of the company's investment remains small. G.E. opened an office earlier this year with considerable fanfare but it has only two employees in the country.
''The world is getting used to the fact that Myanmar is no Shangri-La,'' said Peter Maher, the head of Southeast Asian operations for Visa. ''This is frontier stuff,'' he said. ''We take it on faith that there will be a market here.''
Since December, when automatic teller machines were reintroduced into the country, the number of A.T.M.'s accepting international credit cards has gone from zero to 160 and spending by foreign cardholders in the country has totaled about $7 million. But as a measure of the still tiny size of the market here, in neighboring Thailand, which has a similar population but a much more developed economy, foreign cardholders spent 400 times as much during the same time period -- about $3 billion, Mr. Maher said.
Companies from China and other Asian countries have long had a strong presence in Myanmar, but with the lifting or suspension of European and American sanctions, Myanmar is increasingly turning to the West for assistance in building a country that was impoverished by five decades of military rule.
One of the biggest tests of the country's ability to attract investors is the auction for mobile phone licenses scheduled to be completed later this month. Fewer than 10 percent of the people in Myanmar have mobile phones, compared with 80 percent in neighboring Bangladesh.
Jaspal Bindra, the group executive director of Standard Chartered Bank, said the winners of the mobile phone licenses would need to invest billions of dollars.
''That's where you will see investment dollars quicker than later,'' he said.
Companies selling food and other consumer goods are also moving quickly. For decades, packaged food and drinks have been imported -- and smuggled -- into the country from Thailand and China; companies are now seeking to move production here.
Daniel Sjogren, managing director of Carlsberg Myanmar, is presiding over the construction of a brewery in Bago, a city an hour and a half outside the country's commercial capital, Yangon.
With annual consumption of beer in Myanmar about five liters, or little more than one gallon, per person, compared with 20 liters per person in a more developed territory like Hong Kong, the brewer anticipates years of growth.
But Carlsberg's investment plans also underline some of the challenges foreign companies face in setting up operations. Yangon, where Mr. Sjogren is moving with his family, is strained by the influx of foreigners. He had difficulty getting his two young children enrolled in an international school and the house he has rented in Yangon is only marginally less expensive than the apartment he is leaving in Hong Kong, one of the world's most expensive cities.
''If you want a decent house in an area of Yangon with secure electricity, you're talking $10,000 a month,'' he said.
Electricity supply is also an issue at the planned brewery in Bago -- the company must install its own electricity supply.
U Soe Thane, a minister and key aide to President Thein Sein, does not hesitate when asked the most frequent complaint by foreign investors: ''Electricity,'' he replies. Only 13 percent of households have access to electricity, according to a report released earlier this month by McKinsey, the international consulting firm.
''Without electricity it's just talk,'' said Mr. Rice of G.E. ''Just about everything you do requires a plug.''

HEADLINE: Fund Manager Settles Case in a Far-Reaching Dell Insider Trading Ring

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
In August 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, a large bet that the shares of Dell would drop proved highly lucrative for a tight-knit group of traders. It has also proved to be bountiful for the government in its campaign to root out insider trading on Wall Street. 
On Friday, Victor Dosti, a former portfolio manager at the Whittier Trust Company, settled a civil action brought by federal securities regulators who accused him of illegally trading Dell shares. He is the ninth person charged by the government related to the Dell trade.
Mr. Dosti and Whittier, a money manager based in South Pasadena, Calif., agreed to pay about $1.7 million to resolve the lawsuit, which was filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The S.E.C. said that Whittier earned profits and avoided losses of about $725,000 by trading on illicit tips about Dell as well as the technology companies Nvidia and Wind River Systems.
The secret information was funneled to Mr. Dosti by Daniel Kuo, a former analyst at Whittier who pleaded guilty last year to criminal charges that he was part of the insider-trading scheme of traders, analysts and corporate insiders who earned about $70 million in profits by trading on secret information that came from inside Dell and other companies.
''Time and again, Dosti received what he knew was inside information from Kuo and traded on it to generate illicit gains,'' Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the S.E.C.'s regional office in New York, said in a statement.
Gary Lincenberg, a lawyer for Mr. Dosti, declined to comment. Robert Anello, a lawyer for Whittier, said that his client was glad to have the matter behind it and that ''the conduct engaged in by two former employees is completely contrary to the core values of this organization.''
Two of the nine individuals tied to the Dell insider-trading ring are former employees of SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund that is at the center of the government's investigation. Michael Steinberg, a longtime SAC trader, was charged as part of the ring that illegally traded Dell and Nvidia. His name first surfaced last fall, when Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst, pleaded guilty to insider trading in the two technology stocks and said he shared the information with Mr. Steinberg.
Mr. Steinberg has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to stand trial on Nov. 18.
Whittier fired Mr. Dosti, 49, last January after federal prosecutors first brought charges related to the Dell and Nvidia trades. Mr. Dosti, an Albanian immigrant, received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago and worked at Northern Trust and Citigroup before joining Whittier about a decade ago.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Istanbul's Heart, Leader's Obsession, Perhaps Achilles' Heel

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- On a normal day, Taksim Square is a mess of buses and crowds, a tangle of plazas, streets, shops and taxi horns. Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is determined to clean it up and make it into a pedestrian zone, with a new mall, mosque and tunnels for traffic to move underground.
The outrage in response has filled the square with noisy, angry, determined protesters. At midday, the muezzin's call to prayer now mixes with the chants of union workers and bullhorn speeches from the Anti-Capitalist Muslims. At night, drummers and singers agitate the throngs until dawn.
After Tahrir Square in Egypt and Zuccotti Park in New York, Taksim is the latest reminder of the power of public space. The square has become an arena for clashing worldviews: an unyielding leader's top-down, neo-Ottoman, conservative vision of the nation as a regional power versus a bottom-up, pluralist, disordered, primarily young, less Islamist vision of the country as a modern democracy. 
''Taksim is where everybody expresses freely their happiness, sorrow, their political and social views,'' said Esin, 41, in a head scarf, sitting with relatives on a bench watching the protest in the square. She declined to give her surname, fearing disapproval from conservative neighbors. ''The government wants to sanitize this place, without consulting the people.''
So public space, even a modest and chaotic swath of it like Taksim, again reveals itself as fundamentally more powerful than social media, which produce virtual communities. Revolutions happen in the flesh. In Taksim, strangers have discovered one another, their common concerns and collective voice. The power of bodies coming together, at least for the moment, has produced a democratic moment, and given the leadership a dangerous political crisis.
''We have found ourselves,'' is how Omer Kanipak, a 41-year-old Turkish architect, put it to me, about the diverse gathering at Gezi Park on the north end of Taksim, where the crowds are concentrated in tent encampments and other makeshift architecture after Mr. Erdogan's government ordered bulldozers to make way for the mall.
And there's the hitch. The prime minister has emerged as the strongest leader Turkey has had since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded the republic -- but he remains not much of an architect or urban planner. Like other longtime rulers, he has assumed the mantle of designer in chief, fiddling over details for giant mosques, planning a massive bridge and canal, devising gated communities in the name of civic renewal and economic development. The goal is a scripted public realm. Taksim, the lively heart of modern Istanbul, has become Mr. Erdogan's obsession, and perhaps his Achilles' heel.
And it's no wonder. Taksim's very urban fabric -- fluid, irregular, open and unpredictable -- reflects the area's historic identity as the heart of modern, multicultural Turkey. This was where poor European immigrants settled during the 19th century. It was a honky-tonk quarter into the 1980s, a haven to gays and lesbians, a locus of nightclubs, foreign movie palaces and French-style covered arcades. Gravestones from an Armenian cemetery at Taksim demolished in 1939 were used to construct stairs at Gezi Park, a republican-era project by the French planner Henri Prost that is like the jumble of high-rise hotels, traffic circles and the now-shuttered opera house on the square, named after Ataturk. It is a symbol of modernity.
The prime minister's vision of a big pedestrian plaza, with buried traffic, is intended to smooth out the square -- to remake it into a neo-Ottoman theme park. Mr. Erdogan has lately backed away from installing a mall in the faux Ottoman barracks that will go where Gezi is now. But he intends to raze a poor neighborhood nearby called Tarlabasi and build high-end condominiums. Yet another of his projects envisions a hygienic parade ground on the southern outskirts of the city, designed for mass gatherings as if to quarantine protests: the anti-Taksim. The real Taksim is an unruly commons in the middle of the city. Mr. Erdogan has already demolished a beloved cinema and old chocolate pudding shop on Istiklal (Independence) Avenue, the main street and neighborhood backbone into Taksim.
This is why it has come as little surprise to many Turks that Gezi Park was the last straw. ''We need free places,'' Pelin Tan, a sociologist and protester, explained.
''Public space equals an urban, cosmopolitan identity,'' is how Gokhan Karakus, an architecture critic here, phrased it. ''That's exactly what the prime minister doesn't like. Turkish people who have taken over Gezi Park in protest feel it is truly theirs, not something awarded to them by their leaders, so in that sense the move to destroy it has backfired on him.''
Maybe. Mr. Erdogan has doubled down on demolishing the park, saying he regretted only that police brutality escalated the protests. ''These actions that turned into vandalism and lawlessness must stop immediately,'' he warned, as thousands of his supporters cheered him. Gezi has meanwhile evolved into a festive village with tent settlements, general stores distributing free food and clothing, a day care center, a library and an infirmary, even a veterinary clinic and community garden, nasturtiums where the bulldozers ripped out the first trees. The architecture is tactical urbanism: bare-bones and opportunistic, tin lean-tos, and spare concrete bollards and crates used to make picnic tables. The park has spawned its own pop-up economy as well, street vendors hawking Turkish meatballs, vinegar (for the tear gas) and Guy Fawkes masks.
A poll published in the Hurriyet Daily News on Thursday revealed that 70 percent of the protesters insisted they did not ''feel close'' to any political party. Politics in the 21st century is about private freedoms and public space. Esin, watching the protest in the square, added that her conservative parents think Mr. Erdogan goes too far by banning alcohol and scolding couples for kissing on subways.
Near the statue of Ataturk in the middle of Taksim Square, now festooned with protesters' banners and flags, I found a 24-year-old photography student who identified herself as Kader, from northern Turkey. ''I come to hang out here because there are all kinds of people and it's fun,'' she told me. As she spoke, a Turkish couple, arm in arm, the woman in head scarf, passed by. ''The prime minister is treating the place as his private property,'' Kader wanted to make clear.
Mr. Erdogan's plan for removing buses and taxis and installing a single, vast pedestrian zone at Taksim, stripped of its gritty and unpredictable energy, turned into a polite shopping area, will sap the square of its pedestrian vitality, not make it pedestrian-friendlier. After several days with few cars or buses getting into Taksim because of the barricades, the illogic of Mr. Erdogan's tunnel is obvious. There has been no great traffic crisis.
''We know from the 1960s that pedestrianizing everything doesn't work,'' agreed Hashim Sarkis, who teaches architecture and urbanism at Harvard. ''Managing the balance is better. There is much to be said for loose, indeterminate places like Taksim. Its changeability is its strength, which is the threat perceived by authorities. It's too loose and open.''
I hailed a taxi to check out the Dolmabahce Tunnel, another of Mr. Erdogan's renewal projects, which is akin to the tunnel now being devised under Taksim, where people would descend for buses and taxis. It was no place for pedestrians to go. My driver, Erdal Bas, 42, volunteered that it had also done nothing to reduce traffic jams. ''It just adds another road into them,'' he said.
We drove on to Sulukule, a neighborhood hard by the ancient city walls, where the Roma have lived for more than a thousand years. Mr. Erdogan's government forced many of them out a few years ago to clear land for a condo complex, which opens shortly. I found what is left of the old streets alive with families and children playing. The new buildings next to them, sterile three- and four-story concrete, glass and wood townhouses with duplex and triplex apartments, had all the charm of a suburban office park.
Back at Gezi, a placard quotes an old poem by Nazim Hikmet:
I am a walnut tree in Gulhane Park
neither you are aware of this, nor the police.
Mr. Kanipak, the architect, told me that the threat of Mr. Erdogan's architectural intervention at Taksim ''has for the first time helped to break down the walls of fear about opposing an autocratic state.'' That said, tensions are swiftly rising after Mr. Erdogan's latest speeches.
The conflict over public space is always about control versus freedom, segregation versus diversity. What's at stake is more than a square.
It's the soul of a nation.

HEADLINE: Hiring Rises, but Pace Remains Sluggish

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Hiring in the United States is inching up -- but not quickly enough to put much of a dent in the backlog of nearly 12 million unemployed workers left stranded by the recession and its aftermath.
American employers added 175,000 jobs in May, almost exactly the average monthly job growth over the last year, the Labor Department reported Friday, and wages remained basically flat. Economists were relieved that the numbers were not worse, given a string of other disappointing data in recent weeks, but noted that current job trends still left the economy far short of what it is capable of if Americans were more fully employed.
At the current pace of job and labor force growth, it would take nearly five years to get the economy back to the low unemployment rate it had when the recession officially began in December 2007.
''I feel hopeless, and that just makes it hard,'' said Sherry Lockhart, 53, of Enumclaw, Wash., who was laid off by the state's liquor control board a year ago, when voters privatized liquor sales. Now, her jobless benefits are about to be slashed as a result of federal spending cuts. ''I just feel I've done my best over the years, and I feel like I haven't failed the system. The system has failed me, and millions more.'' 
By contrast, Wall Street was pleased with the latest report because the steady but modest gains suggest that the Federal Reserve will not feel comfortable tightening monetary policy anytime soon, as some had feared would be the case if the job market suddenly started showing major improvement. The Dow Jones industrial average and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index each closed up for the day by more than 1 percent.
''It's a decent report, but it's not by any means robust,'' said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at RDQ Economics, a research firm. ''It's certainly not strong enough to get the Fed to make any significant changes at its meeting in June.''
The unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in April. The cause behind the uptick in the unemployment rate, at least, was also mildly encouraging: more people joined the labor force, perhaps indicating that Americans who have been sitting on the sidelines believe that they finally have a chance to find a job. This labor force participation rate is still low by historical standards, however.
Consumers have also been relatively upbeat recently. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted May 31 to June 4 found that 39 percent of respondents believe the condition of the economy is very or fairly good, the highest share saying this both since President Obama took office and since the recession began in December 2007.
Despite signs of optimism from consumers and investors, other indicators of the health of the economy and the job market have been mixed. Average weekly hours and average hourly earnings, for example, have shown little improvement in recent months, according to the Labor Department. Wages are up just 2 percent from a year earlier, which leaves most Americans treading water, barely outpacing the rate of inflation.
''The wage gains are very disconcerting, and particularly strange when you see these surveys of employers who say they have positions they can't fill,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ''That means they should be bidding up wages.''
Wage growth may be held back by the composition of jobs being created, he said, as there are many jobs being added in low-paying sectors like retail. Restaurants and bars, for example, have added 337,000 jobs over the last year; that category now makes up about 7.6 percent of all payroll jobs, its largest share on record.
The other big industry to add jobs in May was professional and business services, particularly temporary help services. Temp services employment has been growing for six consecutive months, and as of May, about 2 percent of all American jobs were in the sector.
The federal government, on the other hand, lost 14,000 jobs in May, partly because of the across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequestration, enacted by Congress in March.
''With the recovery gaining traction, now is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy,'' Alan B. Krueger, President Obama's chief economic adviser, said in a statement. ''The administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to create middle-class jobs, such as by rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing.''
Over the last three months, the federal government has lost 45,000 jobs, not including the furloughs that many federal employees are being placed on. The Pentagon, for example, has said that it plans to furlough 680,000 civilian workers starting in early July, with most workers losing about one paid day a week.
Though difficult to measure, the sequestration has probably been dragging on the private sector as well, both because government contractors are laying off workers and because laid off or furloughed public workers have had less money to spend at their local businesses.
''There's surely some sequester effects in there, but that's something that will be disentangled in years to come,'' Mr. Shepherdson said.
The recession in Europe and slowdown in Asia are also creating headwinds for American manufacturers, which have lost jobs for the last three months. The length of the average workweek for manufacturing workers rose slightly, to 40.8 hours in May from 40.7 hours in April.
''If you're a manufacturer and you're uncertain about demand for your products because things in Europe aren't getting better, you might be more inclined to try to make more with what you have than to add permanent workers,'' Mr. DeQuadros said.
In addition to causing layoffs, the sequestration could also be affecting those who already have lost their jobs through cuts to social safety net services like Meals on Wheels, housing subsidies and job training programs.
As of May, there were 11.8 million people unemployed, 4.4 million of whom had been out of work for at least six months.
Almost every state has cut its unemployment insurance benefits as a result of the sequestration, according to the National Employment Law Project, a labor-oriented research and advocacy organization. Some states, like Florida and Maine, are cutting the number of weeks for which jobless workers will continue receiving benefits, and others, like Illinois, are reducing the size of the weekly benefit checks. Some states, like Washington and Idaho, are also laying off employees who work in the labor agencies that help workers apply for benefits and find jobs.
North Carolina is ending its federally funded extended unemployment benefits on July 1 because reductions in its state benefits left it ineligible for the federal money.
''I'm having a hard time finding somebody who will give a 50-year-old with a few health problems a chance,'' said Dwayne Fields of Goldsboro, N.C.
He was let go from his warehouse manager job of 12 years last October for ''poor job performance'' after he told his boss about some health problems, including a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, hypertension and sleep apnea. He said he had since received treatment that has put him back into good working shape, but no one responds to his job applications. His $212 weekly jobless benefit checks are about to end.
''I'm probably too old to flip burgers and deliver pizzas,'' he said. ''But if worse comes to worst, I'll do it. I've got an old lady and an 11-year-old kid to support.''

HEADLINE: Trying to Divine Intent Of Fed, Wall St. Climbs

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Investors cannot read minds.
Yet many of them are spending a lot of energy trying to get inside the head of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and making bets on what they think he sees.
Stocks, bonds and currencies around the globe had a chaotic week as traders and strategists reassessed how Mr. Bernanke viewed the economy and whether those views would prompt the central bank to pull back on the bond buying that has supported markets in recent years.
''The market is looking at every piece of incoming data through Fed sunglasses,'' said Rebecca Patterson, the chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust. ''It's not what does this data mean, it's what you think the Fed thinks about this data.''
The middling jobs report on Friday appeared to soothe the nerves of investors for the moment. 
Many on Wall Street agreed that the 175,000 jobs created in May was strong enough to keep the economy on a steady path but not so strong as to encourage the Fed to let up on its stimulus sooner than expected. The Fed can afford to be patient.
With this interpretation prevailing, stocks rose in trading on Friday. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up 1.28 percent to close out a week that also experienced one of the worst days of the year.
The sharp movements in stocks, bonds and currencies this week reflect the peculiar anxiety felt by investors. There is confusion over when and by how much the central bank may withdraw its support. But even if there were clear signals about a pullback, there is little precedent for what kind of effect those policies will have on the markets. A decision to pare back the stimulus could be a good thing if the economy is growing fast. But it could also throw markets into disarray given the degree to which investors have come to rely on the Fed's bond-buying programs over the last five years.
All of which suggests that the markets could be in for a bumpy summer.
''This hasn't really been seen at this scale ever,'' said James Swanson, the chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston. ''We don't know how they will get out of it,'' he added, referring to Fed officials.
Central-bank watching is not a new sport on Wall Street. But for most of the last few years, many other events, including the European debt crisis and the prospect of a double-dip recession in the United States, have been at least as important as the Fed in driving markets. What's more, the Fed had been steadily ramping up its bond-buying programs, not looking at cutting back.
The prospect of a reversal came to the fore on May 22, when Mr. Bernanke said in Congressional testimony that he and his colleagues might consider paring back their bond-buying programs ''in the next few meetings'' if the economy is showing signs of improvement.
As investors have speculated on what exactly Mr. Bernanke meant, and what might prompt him to act, the markets have been on a wild ride. The S. & P. 500 experienced two consecutive weeks in the red for the first time this year as investors prepared for a future without support from Mr. Bernanke.
The bond market has experienced more violent swings because the Fed has supported the economy by buying government and mortgage bonds. In anticipation of the Fed buying fewer bonds, investors sold off all kinds of bonds, pushing up interest rates to their highest level in over a year.
Concerns over a Fed pullback persisted on Friday. Bond prices slumped, pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, on the benchmark 10-year Treasury to 2.18 percent from 2.08 percent on Thursday.
Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues have made it clear that they are not planning to suddenly stop the bond-buying programs that have been so important to investors. Instead, they are likely to ''taper'' back the $85 billion in bond purchases they are making each month, and could step back up if the economy shows signs of flagging.
There is still significant disagreement on Wall Street about whether the economy will improve enough for Mr. Bernanke to begin this process.
Mr. Swanson said the economy was likely to remain in its current trajectory of slow growth, which will only bring the unemployment rate down slowly. That, Mr. Swanson said, could lead the Fed to keep its foot on the gas for another year.
''This is kind of one of those sweet spots where it is not too fast,'' Mr. Swanson said.
More pessimistic analysts have contended that the Fed's policies are failing to generate any real economic growth. That view gained some support last week when a few economic reports pointed to sluggishness in the manufacturing sector and labor market. The data led to a few disappointing days for stocks.
The dangers involved in central bank intervention have been apparent in the Japanese market recently. The Japanese stock market went almost straight up at the beginning of this year after the central bank there followed the Fed's lead in trying to reverse two decades of economic stagnation. But in the last few weeks, investors have begun to doubt whether the policies will work and the Japanese stock market has plunged.
On Wall Street, the growing consensus after Friday's jobs report was that the economy is growing at a fast enough rate to allow Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues to begin slowly winding down their bond buying at some point between their meetings in September and December.
''The stock market is open-minded to the idea that they might be able to make a smooth transition if the economy continues to perform better,'' said Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research.
Stock markets around the world jumped on Friday after the employment numbers were released. Leading indexes finished the day up 1.9 percent in Germany and 1.2 percent in England.
The Dow Jones industrial average on Friday finished up 1.38 percent, or 207.50 points, at 15,248.12. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.32 percent, or 45.16 points, to 3,469.22. The S. & P. 500 climbed 1.28 percent, or 20.82 points, to 1,643.38.
But Mr. Yardeni said there were still big questions about what the economy would look like when the Fed actually starts drawing back on the stimulus. Mr. Bernanke is likely to move cautiously, communicating even small moves far in advance. But if interest rates continue to rise, that could make it harder for prospective homeowners to take out a mortgage, potentially choking off one of the greatest recent sources of economic growth. Then there is the possibility for the type of irrational plunge that the markets in Japan have recently been through.
''Basically everyone is putting up their hands and saying, 'I don't know how this plays out,' '' Mr. Yardeni said.

HEADLINE: Fine Print and Red Tape In Long-Term Care Policies

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
One of the big reasons people buy long-term care insurance is to avoid burdening a spouse or grown children when they can no longer care for themselves.
But some family members are shouldering another type of burden: one that involves piles of paperwork and repeated phone calls, as they are forced to navigate a labyrinth of requirements to collect benefits that the insured spent many years paying.
''There is no possible way an elderly person who is ill and needs help can possibly do this work,'' said Fiona Havlish, who coordinated her father's home care in Pottstown, Pa., before he died last year, a week after his 90th birthday. ''It took six to eight weeks to get the insurance into place, and this was working on it every single day. It was an incredible amount of work.'' 
Ms. Havlish, a former nurse who now works as a life coach in Boulder, Colo., said she first had to find a home care agency that was not only covered by the long-term care policy but one that she felt comfortable entrusting with her father's care. Later, she had to follow up continually with the aides and doctors to make sure they were filing the proper paperwork so that they insurer would pay. ''Three months after he was gone,'' she added, ''I was still fighting with them over paper.''
At least the bill for her father's care was eventually paid. In other cases, families have had to fight to overturn denials, and have gone as far as hiring lawyers to file suit. Many Americans now in their 80s and 90s who are collecting benefits -- or trying to -- bought their policies decades ago when the policies were more restrictive than now. On top of that, many insurers have since left the business after mispricing the policies and failing to judge the economics of the industry, which has made collecting payments even more difficult.
''Everything is not rosy,'' said Jesse Slome, director of the American Association for Long Term Care Insurance. ''When insurers stop selling or exit the business, many of them hire these third-party administrators to adjudicate claims and that is where interpretations don't seem to be as liberal.''
Insurance agents who have specialized in long-term care policies for a couple of decades, however, told me that most of the top-rated insurers pay claims without issue. And clearly, claims worth billions are paid each year: An estimated 264,000 people received long-term care benefits at the end of 2012, according to Mr. Slome, and $6.6 billion in benefits were paid that same year.
Still, ''the process can be pretty daunting for people,'' said Bonnie Burns, a policy specialist at California Health Advocates, an education and advocacy group.
If you need to file a claim on behalf of a loved one, it helps to know why claims are denied and where filers tend to get tripped up. Here's what I gathered, from longtime brokers, consumer advocates and lawyers who do battle with insurers on these issues:
DEDUCTIBLES In the long-term care world, deductibles work a bit differently than typical insurance policies. The policies have waiting periods, or elimination periods, and they are typically measured in days: 30, 60, 90 or 100 days. So if your policy covers $150 a day for in-home care, and you have a 60-day waiting period, you will typically owe the first $9,000 -- 60 times $150 a day -- before the policy kicks in.
But the way the waiting periods are counted is critical, too. ''If a person is getting home care a few days a week, and the company only counts those days of care toward the waiting period, the total time needed to satisfy the waiting period will be much longer than 60 days,'' Ms. Burns said. ''So it isn't just the $9,000, but the total time that has to be satisfied.''
With certain older policies, meanwhile, the insured person must also spend three days in the hospital before the policy will pay any benefits. ''Some of these older policies have requirements that most states don't allow today,'' Ms. Burns said. ''But these requirements must still be met in these older policies.''
ELIGIBILITY To become eligible for benefits, patients must be expected to need ''substantial assistance'' for at least 90 days, either because they are suffering from a form of dementia, for instance, or because they can't perform two basic daily activities from a list of six, including items like bathing, getting dressed and eating. (This applies to certain policies written after 1997.)
''What we are finding today is that when people are getting assessed, they fire on 8 or 10 cylinders on some days and they will trick people,'' said Brian I. Gordon, president of MAGA, a long-term care insurance agency in Riverwoods, Ill. ''They want to become Superman the day the assessor comes out. And then the insurer may deny the claims.''
Glenn R. Kantor, a lawyer in California whose firm focuses on insurance claims, said he represented a woman, blind from severe macular degeneration who was receiving benefits for home care. But when the representative from the insurer asked her if she could bathe by herself, the woman told the company she could as long as her aide led her into the shower and gave her soap and a washcloth. Shortly thereafter, the insurer cut off her payments.
Then, ''they sent her to collections to get the money back,'' Mr. Kantor said, because the caregiver was not within arm's length but left the bathroom to go into the next room while the woman bathed. The insurance company settled, but the terms were confidential so Mr. Kantor could not divulge the insurer or the exact amount it paid.
LICENSED CAREGIVERS Depending on where a patient lives and the type of policy, a licensed caregiver for home care services will probably have to be hired (though some policies, known as cash plans, will let you spend the money with fewer restrictions and pay a grandchild or a neighbor for care, for instance). ''If they are not licensed, those types of people may not be covered under most long-term care policies today,'' Mr. Gordon said.
But that's not the case everywhere. In California, for instance, the state insurance law prohibits insurers from imposing this requirement, Mr. Kantor said. ''So we are seeing a number of people have their claim denied by the carrier saying your caregiver isn't licensed.''
ASSISTED LIVING Many of the policies that benefit people today were written before assisted-living facilities came into vogue, experts said. So some families will find out that only a ''skilled nursing facility'' is covered. ''Then you have the daughter wandering around the state with the contract trying to find a place that meets the policy's requirements,'' Ms. Burns added.
Mr. Gordon said that many carriers could still pay for assisted-living facilities as long as they met certain conditions, including being licensed by the state, providing care by a licensed doctor and 24-hour nursing services, among other items. Ultimately, however, it ''may or may not be covered after the claim is submitted,'' he added.
Even once you think you have found the right type of facility, be sure to read the fine print. Some policies will require that a facility have a nurse on duty 24 hours a day. ''But some of them will have a nurse there for 12 hours and on call for 12 hours,'' Mr. Gordon said. And if that's the case, the coverage may be denied.
Mr. Slome, of the trade organization, said that many insurers did not anticipate the new types of facilities. And while he has heard insurance claims directors say that they don't officially provide coverage, they will. ''The squeaky gear gets the grease,'' he added.
ALTERNATE PLAN OF CARE Some policies have provisions for what they call ''alternate plans of care,'' which experts said implied a certain degree of flexibility. ''People read those and say, 'Look, it says they will do this,' '' said Ms. Burns. In reality, ''they will consider something different, but the insurer makes the ultimate decision.''
Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of the CNA Financial Corporation, sold policies with a similar provision, which could potentially allow the insured to receive benefits for care, say, in the home instead of a nursing home, Mr. Kantor said. But since the CNA unit stopped selling the policies in 2003, he said they were making a habit of no longer honoring those provisions. ''The insurance company is insistent that they have the right not to approve the plan,'' said Mr. Kantor, who is representing a woman with Alzheimer's disease whose request for an alternate plan was not even considered. ''But it was not sold that way.''
A spokeswoman for CNA declined to comment on the specific case, but said ''an alternate plan of care may be mutually agreed upon between CNA and the claimant. However, the alternate plan of care benefit was never intended to confer a general right to home health care that the optional rider provides.''
DOCUMENTATION For Ms. Havlish, the Pennsylvania woman who handled her father's claims, documentation was one of the most frustrating parts of the process. ''Every time the agency billed the insurance company, it would get sent back as not paid because they did not chart properly,'' she said, referring to documentation kept by caregivers.
And some insurers have been known to deny claims on that basis. Harvey Rosenfield, a lawyer and founder of Consumer Watchdog, recently represented Dr. William Hall, a man who filed suit against Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania (formerly known as Conseco Senior Health Insurance Company) for failing to pay long-term care benefits for eight months. The insurer required an inordinate amount of forms and documents that were not referred to in or required by the policy, according to the lawsuit complaint. The two parties ultimately reached a settlement last month.
''With all of the hurdles, trying to get a claim paid can be like an Olympic event,'' Mr. Rosenfield said. ''The bottom line is that practices vary widely from company to company and state to state. And whether you can trust the company depends on regulation in that state -- and most states have limited regulation.''

HEADLINE: How To Monetize Plagiarism

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
This is a column about Jonah Lehrer, the 31-year-old disgraced former New Yorker writer who recently -- sigh -- landed a contract for a book about love. (Yes, love.) But I want to start by recalling another disgraced former magazine writer: Stephen Glass.
Glass was once a Washington wunderkind, who wrote remarkable articles filled with fabulous scenes and quotes. It turned out, of course, that many of the scenes and quotes were figments of Glass's imagination, and that 42 of his articles, spanning two-and-a-half years, were either partially or entirely fabricated. 
The New Republic, his primary employer, fired him. Other magazines that had published his work announced investigations. And, to complete his humiliation, a movie was made about how Glass's fabrications had been exposed by The New Republic's editor at the time, Charles Lane.
In the decade and a half since he was quite properly drummed out of journalism, Glass has led an exemplary life. After his disgrace, he vowed to live honorably and honestly, and he has. He underwent years of psychotherapy to come to terms with what he did. He asked for forgiveness from those whom he had betrayed.
And, in 2004, he went to work as a paralegal for a lawyer in Los Angeles who often represents the homeless. For years, Glass has been trying to get admitted to the California bar, but the bar association has been fighting him, saying that he lacks the appropriate character to be a lawyer. Yet I can't think of anyone more deserving of a second chance than Stephen Glass.
And I can't think of anyone less deserving of one than Jonah Lehrer.
It hasn't even been a year since the first of Lehrer's journalistic sins was uncovered: He was routinely recycling previously published work for a pop science blog he had begun at The New Yorker. (His works seems consciously modeled on Malcolm Gladwell's.) Then, Michael Moynihan, writing in The Tablet magazine, dropped a bombshell: In his best-selling book, ''Imagine: How Creativity Works,'' Lehrer had made up quotes attributed to Bob Dylan. Moynihan followed up with examples of good old-fashioned plagiarism in an earlier Lehrer book. Several people who had been quoted by Lehrer said that they had never uttered the words he attributed to them. Inevitably, The New Yorker and Wired, where Lehrer also wrote, cut their ties with him. At which point Lehrer was left to ... well, what exactly?
He certainly didn't spend his time atoning. After he was exposed, he issued a statement saying that ''the lies are over now,'' and that he was sorry for what he had done. Then he went dark. I tried to reach him several times; I was intensely interested in why someone with his talent and future would risk it all by doing things that could so easily be found out. He never responded.
In February, he popped up at the Knight Foundation -- ''the nation's leading journalism funder'' -- where he gave a speech entitled ''My Apology.'' (Knight paid him $20,000, for which it later had to apologize itself.) The speech was anything but an apology. Rather, it was structured like one of his typical mini-Malcolm articles, with discursions into a big forensic mistake made by the F.B.I., the research of a cognitive neuroscientist and the work of a behavior economist. His central point was that for whatever reason, he couldn't trust himself to do the right thing, so he needed a structure -- a ''standard operating procedure'' -- that would force him to do the right thing. As apologies go, it was both arrogant and pathetic.
Now comes his book on love, which was revealed earlier this week by Julie Bosman of The New York Times, who got ahold of his 65-page proposal. It is more of the same. Although the first seven paragraphs are about ''my fall,'' (''I have been found out. I puke into a recycling bin. And then I start to cry.''), the book is no memoir. Like his previous books, it is intended to be a work of pop science, an exploration into why and how we love. His chapter outline includes catchy phrases intended to move product. His attempts at sincerity come across as precious and phony. There is not much doubt about what is really going on here: Instead of atoning for the disgrace he brought on himself, Lehrer is trying to monetize it.
Although I was unable to speak to Lehrer, I did reach his editor at Simon & Schuster, Jonathan Karp, whom I've known and respected for years. ''He knows he can't screw up again,'' Karp told me. ''I'm not defending what he did, but I think we ought to have a little compassion here. He's not a journalist. He's a writer, and an unusually talented one. Everyone deserves a second chance.''
Actually, they don't. People who make a big mistake and want a second chance need to earn it. That's the difference between Stephen Glass and Jonah Lehrer.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Power Plant in Limbo Decides to Close

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The owners of the San Onofre nuclear power plant in Southern California, which has been shut since January 2012, said on Friday that they would close it permanently because of uncertainty over when it could be reopened.
The two reactors at San Onofre had not run since a small amount of radioactive steam escaped from new tubes damaged by vibration and friction. Coming months after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in Japan, the event prompted a wave of public opposition and set off a legal and regulatory battle that included Southern California Edison, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which manufactured the parts that leaked.
Those parts, called steam generators, cost more than $600 million. In the end, uncertainty over the plant's fate ''was not good for our customers, our investors, or the need to plan for our region's long-term electricity needs,'' said Theodore F. Craver Jr., chief executive of the utility's parent company, Edison International. 
The decision delighted nuclear opponents. ''I approach today with a good deal of joy,'' said S. David Freeman, who shut down construction on several reactors when he ran the Tennessee Valley Authority, and who ran the Sacramento Municipal Utility District after it retired the Rancho Seco nuclear plant two decades ago.
''I think this is a step in the right direction, another move toward the renewable revolution that is under way in the state of California,'' Mr. Freeman said, adding that closing the reactors opens up the market to use the renewable power that will follow. For now, though, the replacement power source is natural gas.
The nuclear industry has had a difficult year as it tries to compete with cheaper, abundant natural gas. San Onofre's two reactors are the third and fourth reactors to be retired so far this year in the United States.
''It's no secret that power markets have been radically changed by the development of shale gas,'' said John Reed, an investment banker who specializes in nuclear reactors. ''That changes the economics of any other power supply option, including nuclear.''
Dominion shut its reactor in Wisconsin in May because of unfavorable economics, and Duke said in February that it would not restart Crystal River 3 because mechanical problems were too expensive to fix.
The loss of San Onofre has already pushed up electricity prices in Southern California, to about $4.15 a megawatt-hour higher than prices in Northern California. Those higher prices are an inducement to developers to build new generation, either natural gas or renewable energy, according to Marie Rinkoski Spangler, an electricity analyst at the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration.
Ms. Rinkoski Spangler said that since June 2012, California has added slightly more generating capacity than it will lose with the retirement of the reactors, in the wrong places.
''Geography really matters,'' she said. ''The generation itself is not enough, because of where San Onofre sat'' near Los Angeles and San Diego.
At the California Independent System Operator, the company that runs the power grid in most of the state, Steve Berberich, the chief executive, said that most of the replacement power had come from natural gas, and that if California's goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt-hour, ''you're moving in the wrong direction.''
But in the longer term, he said, retiring San Onofre would encourage the replacement of older power plants with newer ones that would produce more electricity with the same amount of fuel. And the newer ones could increase and decrease their output faster, he said, making them useful to balance a system with a lot of wind and solar generation, which is highly variable.
San Onofre 2 and 3 entered commercial operation in August 1983 and April 1984. A third reactor was mothballed in 1992.
Many nuclear plants around the country have won permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to run 20 years beyond their initial 40-year licenses, but in a conference call with reporters, Mr. Craver of Edison International said that the prospects for license renewal were uncertain, following the three meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in March 2011, and the demand by regulators for a re-evaluation of San Onofre's vulnerability to earthquake.
Edison had been seeking to restart one of the units at 70 percent power, a level it thought the steam generators could tolerate, but when plant opponents persuaded a panel of three administrative law judges at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that this would require a public hearing, the company concluded that the proceedings could stretch to the end of next year or longer. Operation and maintenance expense at the plants, which employ 1,500 people are roughly equal whether it is running or not, he said, and if the plant could not reopen by December, retiring it would be cheaper.
The company has $2.7 billion saved up for decommissioning, which is about 90 percent of what is required, he said. Edison shares ownership with San Diego Gas & Electric, which owns 20 percent, and the city of Riverside, which owns 1.79 percent.
Edison has about $2.1 billion invested in the plant, the fuel and related assets. Division of costs between Edison's shareholders and ratepayers, its insurers and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which supplied the heat exchangers, has not been determined.
As for the plant's workers, the closure will be felt in the area. ''When 1,100 people lose their jobs, there will certainly be an impact,'' said Bob Baker, the mayor of the nearby city of San Clemente. ''San Onofre changed San Clemente when it opened, and it's going to change San Clemente now that it's closing.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Remarks on Health Care and Surveillance

 BODY:
The following is a transcript of President Obama's remarks about the health care overhaul and response to a question about electronic surveillance in San Jose, Calif., as provided by the White House:
MR. OBAMA: Good morning, everybody. It is wonderful to see all of you, and I want to thank everybody who is here. I think there's only one problem, and that is that my remarks are not sitting here. People! (Laughter.) By Friday afternoon, things get a little challenged.
QUESTION: Will you answer a question in the --
MR. OBAMA: I'm going to have a -- I'm going to answer a question at the end of the remarks, but I want to make sure that we get the remarks out. People! Oh, goodness. (Laughter.) Oh, somebody is tripping. Folks are sweating back there right now. (Laughter.) 
Well, good morning everybody. This afternoon, I'm going to be in Southern California to meet with President Xi of China. But before I leave Northern California, I wanted to take a minute to address something that's happening with the Affordable Care Act in this state, and I wanted to meet with a group of people who are doing some very important work on behalf of California's middle-class families.
These leaders from California's government, the California Endowment, and major Spanish language media outlets have joined together to help implement the Affordable Care Act here in California and to educate folks about how to sign up and shop for quality, affordable plans. And their efforts have already shown some excellent results in the biggest insurance market in the country.
There are two main things that Americans need to know when it comes to the Affordable Care Act and what it means for you.
First of all, if you're one of the nearly 85 percent of Americans who already have insurance, either through Medicare or Medicaid or your employer, you don't have to do a thing. You've just got a wide array of new benefits, better protections and stronger cost controls that you didn't have before, and that will, over time, improve the quality of the insurance that you've got; benefits like free preventive care -- checkups, flu shots, mammograms and contraception.
You are now going to be able to get those things through your insurance where they previously were not -- didn't have to be provided. Protections like allowing people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parent's health care plans, which has already helped 6 million Americans, including [1 million] young Latino Americans.
Cost controls like requiring insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of the money that you pay in premiums in your actual health care costs, as opposed to administrative costs or CEO pay -- not overhead, but that money has to be spent on you. And if they don't meet that target, they actually have to reimburse you. So in California, we're already getting reports that insurers are giving rebates to consumers and small business owners to the tune of $45 million this year. So already we're seeing millions of dollars of rebates sent back to consumers by insurance companies as a consequence of this law.
All of that is happening because of the Affordable Care Act. All of this is in place right now, already, for 85 percent of Americans who have health insurance. By the way, all of this is what the Republican Party has now voted 37 times to repeal, at least in the House of Representatives. And my suggestion to them has been, let's stop refighting the old battles and start working with people like the leaders who are on stage here today to make this law work the way it's supposed to.
We're focused on moving forward and making sure that this law works for middle-class families. And that brings me to the second thing that people need to know about the Affordable Care Act.
If you're one of nearly 6 million Californians or tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, you'll soon be able to buy quality, affordable care just like everybody else.
And here's how. States like California are setting up new, online marketplaces where, beginning on October 1st of this year, you can comparison shop an array of private health insurance plans side-by-side, just like you were going online to compare cars or airline tickets. And that means insurance companies will actually have to compete with each other for your business. And that means new choices.
See, right now, most states don't have a lot of competition. In nearly every state, more than half of all consumers are covered by only two insurers. So there's no incentive to provide you a lot of choices or to keep costs down. The Affordable Care Act changes that.
Beginning next year, once these marketplaces are open, most states will offer new private insurance choices that don't exist today. And based on early reports, about 9 in 10 Americans expected to enroll in these marketplaces live in states where they'll be able to choose between five or more different insurers. So for example, here in California, 33 insurers applied to join the marketplace. Covered California then selected 13 based on access, quality, and affordability, four of which are brand new to your individual market.
So what's happening is through the Affordable Care Act, we're creating these marketplaces with more competition, more choice, and so the question is, what happens to cost?
Now, a lot of the opponents of the Affordable Care Act, they had all kinds of sky-is-falling, doom-and-gloom predictions that not only would the law fail, but what we'd also is costs would skyrocket for everybody. Well, it turns out we're actually seeing that in the states that have committed themselves to implementing this law correctly, we're seeing some good news. Competition and choice are pushing down costs in the individual market just like the law was designed to do.
The 13 insurance companies that were chosen by Covered California have unveiled premiums that were lower than anybody expected. And those who can't afford to buy private insurance will get help reducing their out-of-pocket premiums even further with the largest health care tax cut for working families and small businesses in our history. So about 2.6 million Californians -- nearly half of whom are Latinos -- will qualify for tax credits that will, in some cases, lower their premiums a significant amount.
Now, none of this is a surprise. This is the way that the law was designed to work. But since everybody has been saying how it's not going to happen, I think it's important for us to recognize and acknowledge this is working the way it's supposed to. We've seen similar good news, by the way, not just here in California but in Oregon and Washington. In states that are working hard to implement this law properly, we're seeing it work for people -- for middle-class families, for consumers.
Now, that's not to say that everything is going to go perfectly right away. When you're implementing a program this large, there will be some glitches. There are going to be some hiccups. But no matter what, every single consumer will be covered by the new benefits and protections under this law permanently.
So the bottom line is you can listen to a bunch of political talk out there -- negative ads and fear mongering geared towards the next election -- or alternatively you can actually look at what's happening in states like California right now. And the fact of the matter is through these exchanges, not only are the 85 percent of people who already have health insurance getting better protections, and receiving rebates, and being able to keep their kids on their health insurance until they're 26, and getting free preventive care, but if you don't have health insurance and you're trying to get it through the individual market and it's too expensive or it's too restricted, you now have these marketplaces where they're going to offer you a better deal because of choice and competition.
And if even at those lower rates and better insurance that you're getting through these marketplaces you still can't afford it, you're going to be getting tax cuts and tax credits through the Affordable Care Act that will help you afford it. And that's how we're going to make sure that millions of people who don't currently have health insurance or are getting a really bad deal on their health insurance are finally going to get it.
But -- and here's my final point -- to take advantage of these marketplaces, folks are going to need to sign up. So you can find out how to sign up at HealthCare.gov, or here in California you can sign up at CoveredCA.com. Because quality care is not something that should be a privilege, it should be a right. In the greatest country on Earth, we've got to make sure that every single person that needs health care can get it. And we've got to make sure that we do it in the most efficient way possible.
One last point I'm going to make on this, because there are a lot of people who currently get health insurance through their employers -- the 85 percent who are already out there -- and they may be saying, well, if this law is so great, why is it that my premium still went up? Well, part of what's happening across the country is in some cases, for example, employers may be shifting more costs through higher premiums or higher deductibles or higher copays, and so there may still be folks who are out there feeling increased costs not because of the Affordable Care Act but because those costs are being passed on to workers or insurance companies, in some cases. Even with these laws in place, they're still jacking up prices unnecessarily.
So this doesn't solve the whole problem, but it moves us in the right direction. It's also the reason why we have to keep on implementing changes in how our health care system works to continually drive better efficiency, higher quality, lower cost. We're starting to do that. Health care cost inflation has gone up at the lowest rate over the last three years that we've seen in many, many years. So we're making progress in actually reducing overall health care costs while improving quality, but we're going to have to continue to push on that front as well. That's also part of what we're doing in the Affordable Care Act.
But the main message I want for Californians and people all across the country -- starting on October 1st, if you're in the individual market, you can get a better deal. If you're a small business that's providing health insurance to your employees, you can get a better deal through these exchanges. You've got to sign up: HealthCare.gov, or here in California at CoveredCA.com.
All right? So thank you very much.
QUESTION: Mr. President?
MR. OBAMA: I'm going to take one question. And then, remember, people are going to have opportunities to also -- answer questions when I'm with the Chinese President today. So I don't want the whole day to just be a bleeding press conference. But I'm going to take Jackie Calmes' question.
QUESTION: Mr. President, could you please react to the reports of secret government surveillance of phones and Internet? And can you also assure Americans that the government -- your government doesn't have some massive secret database of all their personal online information and activities?
MR. OBAMA: Yes. When I came into this office, I made two commitments that are more important than any commitment I made: Number one, to keep the American people safe; and number two, to uphold the Constitution. And that includes what I consider to be a constitutional right to privacy and an observance of civil liberties.
Now, the programs that have been discussed over the last couple days in the press are secret in the sense that they're classified. But they're not secret in the sense that when it comes to telephone calls, every member of Congress has been briefed on this program. With respect to all these programs, the relevant intelligence committees are fully briefed on these programs. These are programs that have been authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.
And so, I think at the outset, it's important to understand that your duly elected representatives have been consistently informed on exactly what we're doing. Now, let me take the two issues separately.
When it comes to telephone calls, nobody is listening to your telephone calls. That's not what this program is about. As was indicated, what the intelligence community is doing is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls. They are not looking at people's names, and they're not looking at content. But by sifting through this so-called metadata, they may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism. If these folks -- if the intelligence community then actually wants to listen to a phone call, they've got to go back to a federal judge, just like they would in a criminal investigation.
So I want to be very clear -- some of the hype that we've been hearing over the last day or so -- nobody is listening to the content of people's phone calls. This program, by the way, is fully overseen not just by Congress, but by the FISA Court -- a court specially put together to evaluate classified programs to make sure that the executive branch, or government generally, is not abusing them, and that it's being carried out consistent with the Constitution and rule of law.
And so, not only does that court authorize the initial gathering of data, but -- I want to repeat -- if anybody in government wanted to go further than just that top-line data and want to, for example, listen to Jackie Calmes' phone call, they would have to go back to a federal judge and indicate why, in fact, they were doing further probing.
Now, with respect to the Internet and emails -- this does not apply to U.S. citizens and it does not apply to people living in the United States. And again, in this instance, not only is Congress fully apprised of it, but what is also true is that the FISA Court has to authorize it.
So in summary, what you've got is two programs that were originally authorized by Congress, have been repeatedly authorized by Congress, bipartisan majorities have approved on them, Congress is continually briefed on how these are conducted. There are a whole range of safeguards involved, and federal judges are overseeing the entire program throughout. We're also setting up -- we've also set up an audit process, when I came into office, to make sure that we're, after the fact, making absolutely certain that all the safeguards are being properly observed.
Now, having said all that, you'll remember when I made that speech a couple of weeks ago about the need for us to shift out of a perpetual war mindset, I specifically said that one of the things that we're going to have to discuss and debate is how are we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy? Because there are some tradeoffs involved.
I welcome this debate. And I think it's healthy for our democracy. I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate. And I think it's interesting that there are some folks on the left but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who weren't very worried about it when there was a Republican President. I think that's good that we're having this discussion.
But I think it's important for everybody to understand -- and I think the American people understand -- that there are some tradeoffs involved. I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs. My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of safeguards. But my assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. And the modest encroachments on the privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content, that on net, it was worth us doing. Some other folks may have a different assessment on that.
But I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society. And what I can say is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity. And the fact that they're under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and that they do not involve listening to people's phone calls, do not involve reading the emails of U.S. citizens or U.S. residents absent further action by a federal court that is entirely consistent with what we would do, for example, in a criminal investigation -- I think on balance, we have established a process and a procedure that the American people should feel comfortable about.
But, again, these programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional reauthorization and congressional debate. And if there are members of Congress who feel differently, then they should speak up. And we're happy to have that debate.
Okay? All right. And we'll have a chance to talk further over the course of the next couple of days.
QUESTION: Do you welcome the leaks, sir? Do you welcome the leaks? Do you welcome the debate?
MR. OBAMA: I don't welcome leaks, because there's a reason why these programs are classified. I think that there is a suggestion that somehow any classified program is a ''secret'' program, which means it's somehow suspicious.
The fact of the matter is in our modern history, there are a whole range of programs that have been classified because -- when it comes to, for example, fighting terror, our goal is to stop folks from doing us harm. And if every step that we're taking to try to prevent a terrorist act is on the front page of the newspapers or on television, then presumably the people who are trying to do us harm are going to be able to get around our preventive measures. That's why these things are classified.
But that's also why we set up congressional oversight. These are the folks you all vote for as your representatives in Congress, and they're being fully briefed on these programs. And if, in fact, there was -- there were abuses taking place, presumably those members of Congress could raise those issues very aggressively. They're empowered to do so.
We also have federal judges that we put in place who are not subject to political pressure. They've got lifetime tenure as federal judges, and they're empowered to look over our shoulder at the executive branch to make sure that these programs aren't being abused.
So we have a system in which some information is classified, and we have a system of checks and balances to make sure that it's not abused. And if, in fact, this information ends up just being dumped out willy-nilly without regard to risks to the program, risks to the people involved -- in some cases, on other leaks, risks to personnel in a very dangerous situation -- then it's very hard for us to be as effective in protecting the American people.
That's not to suggest that you just say, trust me; we're doing the right thing; we know who the bad guys are. And the reason that's not how it works is because we've got congressional oversight and judicial oversight. And if people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution, due process and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems here.
But my observation is, is that the people who are involved in America's national security, they take this work very seriously. They cherish our Constitution. The last thing they'd be doing is taking programs like this to listen to somebody's phone calls.
And by the way, with respect to my concerns about privacy issues, I will leave this office at some point, sometime in the last -- next three and a half years, and after that, I will be a private citizen. And I suspect that, on a list of people who might be targeted so that somebody could read their emails or listen to their phone calls, I'd probably be pretty high on that list. It's not as if I don't have a personal interest in making sure my privacy is protected.
But I know that the people who are involved in these programs, they operate like professionals. And these things are very narrowly circumscribed. They're very focused. And in the abstract, you can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amuck, but when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
Thank you very much, guys.

HEADLINE: U.S. Drone Strike Kills at Least 7 in Pakistan as New Prime Minister Announces Cabinet

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD; Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- At least seven people were killed late Friday when an American drone fired three missiles at a house in northwestern Pakistan, according to an intelligence official, hours after the country's new prime minister announced his cabinet. 
During his campaign, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif often criticized the United States for using drone aircraft to kill militants.
The drones that struck Friday targeted a house in Mangroti village in the Shawal area of North Waziristan, the tribal region straddling the border with Afghanistan. The identities of the victims were not immediately known, but an intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described them as militants.
Shawal links North Waziristan with the South Waziristan tribal region and is a stronghold of militants of all stripes.
Hours before the strike, Mr. Sharif announced his 25-member cabinet, a team of close aides who will work to solve Pakistan's entrenched economic, social and security problems.
President Asif Ali Zardari swore in the 16 federal ministers and 9 ministers of state.
Two women were among the new cabinet members: Anusha Rehman Khan, a lawmaker, will serve as a state minister for information technology and telecom; Saira Afzal Tarar has been appointed as a minister of state for health sciences regulation and coordination.
Mr. Sharif kept the crucial portfolios of defense and foreign affairs for himself while naming Sartaj Aziz, a senior leader of his party, the Pakistan Muslim League, as adviser on national security and foreign affairs.
Ishaq Dar, a certified accountant and a relative of Mr. Sharif's, was given the finance portfolio, a critical job in a country suffering from sharp economic decline that is likely to require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund this summer. Mr. Dar has served as finance minister twice before.
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, an influential politician with a reputation for tough talk, was appointed interior minister, and the new minister for water and power, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, was charged with addressing an urgent energy crisis that has caused widespread misery and economic distress in Pakistan.
Pervez Rashid, a soft-spoken senator who previously led the state television channel, was chosen as minister for information and broadcasting. Zaid Hamid is the new law minister.
Ahsan Iqbal will lead the Ministry of Planning and Development, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will take charge of petroleum and natural resources, and Kamran Michael is the minister for ports and shipping.
''They are very smart and able people,'' Sheikh Waqas Akram, a former minister, said in an interview. ''But they are facing huge challenges.''

HEADLINE: For Puerto Ricans, a Parade of Questions

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
In the 1950s, before they became a prominent part of New York City's tapestry, Puerto Ricans often found themselves unwelcome as they tried to carve out a place for themselves: sometimes beaten by their neighbors, given the lowest-paying jobs and even at times disenfranchised from voting by English-only literacy tests.
So, in 1958, Puerto Rican leaders decided to hold a modest parade where they could march arm in arm with pride through the heart of Manhattan. Fathers taught their children about their roots by pointing to floats dedicated to Puerto Rican towns known for coffee beans, bananas or sugar cane. Mothers tapped their feet to the African-inspired drum music that evoked memories of growing up on the island.
Today, the parade is a star-studded televised extravaganza, with 80,000 marchers, 2 million spectators and a fleet of corporate sponsors. This Sunday, Chita Rivera will be the grand marshal leading the parade down Fifth Avenue. 
But even as the National Puerto Rican Day Parade has become one of the nation's largest and best-known ethnic celebrations, its organizers have come under scrutiny over how they manage the event and spend the money it generates, some of which is supposed to finance scholarships for children of Puerto Rican heritage.
More broadly, many Puerto Ricans complain that the parade has become an embarrassing spectacle that encourages bad behavior, gives their culture a black eye and is as much a marketing opportunity for big corporations as it is a celebration of what they have achieved.
''It hurts me in my heart when I see this parade,'' said Ildefonso Rivera, 57, a carpenter who as a boy used to wait by the curb with his father to watch the floats. ''I don't see the floats with our culture. I see the floats for Coors. Today, it's just one big commercial.''
Such criticisms intensified recently when elected officials and activists protested a commemorative Coors Light beer can for the parade that included the Puerto Rican flag and a modified version of the parade's logo, saying it was insulting and sent the wrong message when the theme this year was dedicated to health. The can is no longer being distributed, but the furor aggravated tensions between many Puerto Rican leaders and elected officials and the parade's organizer, National Puerto Rican Day Parade Inc., a nonprofit organization overseen by a volunteer board.
Despite highly visible sponsorships by MillerCoors, Goya Foods and others, the parade and its related activities, including a gala banquet and a pageant, have operated at a loss every year since at least 2005, tax filings show. The parade's organization reported that it raised a total of about $460,000 in revenues in 2012, but spent over $620,000 on the parade and related activities, leaving a deficit of about $159,000.
Eric T. Schneiderman, the state's attorney general, who has legal oversight of nonprofit organizations, is investigating the parade's financial dealings and has raised questions about how organizers are protecting the parade's reputation. Elected officials and activists rail about what they call missteps and a lack of accountability.
''They're treating the parade like their own banana republic,'' said Gerson Borrero, 62, a columnist for El Diario. ''The last thing on their mind is to instill pride. In fact, they have shamed us.''
But Madelyn Lugo, chairwoman of the parade since 2006, defended the organization's practices, saying critics are misinformed. As the parade has grown into a national event, so have expenses, she said. In 2012, expenses included broadcasting costs for the parade ($103,875); insurance ($43,232); sound, music and lights ($9,000); and portable toilets ($1,600).
At the same time, Ms. Lugo said, corporate sponsorships have dried up in tough economic times, falling by more than half to $300,000 in 2012, down from $800,000 a decade ago. Donations by community groups alone, she said, would not cover the parade's expenses, which include many free activities. ''We're spending what's necessary to do what we need,'' she said. ''We're giving back to the community.''
Despite the deficit, Ms. Lugo said the parade had continued to raise at least $10,000 to $20,000 every year for scholarships from sponsors, including MillerCoors, who make donations to students on the parade's behalf, or through the Diversity Foundation, a program started by the parade's business and marketing agent, Carlos Velasquez. This year, the foundation helped Hostos Community College in the Bronx award $11,500 in scholarships to 23 students.
This is not the first time controversy has marred the parade. In 2000, in one of the event's darkest moments, the procession was followed by attacks on dozens of women in Central Park. At the same time, supporters have accused some business owners along the route of racism because they choose to close on the day of the parade.
The parade's finances have also been called into question. They were once controlled by Ramon S. Velez, who grew wealthy running a network of social services in the South Bronx that was repeatedly investigated and that earned him the title of ''poverty pimp'' from Edward I. Koch.
In 1978, a court barred Mr. Velez from serving on the parade's sponsoring committee and handling its finances, but he was later permitted to return to the parade after claims against him were dismissed.
Joaquin Del Rio, a journalist and one of the parade's founders, said Mr. Velez sought to find ways to profit from the parade that tarnished its spirit. ''I am angry because this is not what we created,'' he said. ''We created an organization to promote the positive things of our community and culture. Now everything is business.''
Though Mr. Velez died in 2008, he is honored with a banner hanging on the wall of the parade's office in the Bronx, and many of the people he mentored and worked with, including Ms. Lugo, continue to run the parade.
Mr. Velasquez, who has also been involved with the parade for decades, has come under criticism because his marketing contract allows his company to keep 27 percent to 35 percent of the money that he raises for the parade, according to a copy of the contract. In 2012, even as the parade recorded an overall loss, Mr. Velasquez's company was owed $103,108, tax filings show. He did not return phone calls.
Ms. Lugo said other marketing companies requested a 50 percent commission. She said that she would like to give more scholarship money if the parade's finances improved and that expenses were being reduced.
Some parade-goers said the criticisms were overblown.
Venus Perez, 35, a stay-at-home mother, said the celebrities and the big floats added glamour to the parade. ''I love the parade,'' she said. ''It's always going to be what it is. People need to stop judging it.''
But April Andino, 24, a waitress, stopped going to the parade, saying she was bored with the corporate displays and an overly rowdy crowd. ''There's no excitement anymore,'' she said. ''And there's a lot of fighting and people getting drunk. Nobody wants to see that.''

HEADLINE: A Bond Market Plunge That Baffles the Experts

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
As if it wasn't bad enough for the millions of Americans scraping by on paltry interest payments, now they face another threat: the loss of principal on their bonds and other fixed-income assets.
The month of May, and this first week of June, were terrible for many fixed-income investors who have spent the last few years reaching for higher yields.
If there was an index for fixed income with the status of the Dow Jones industrial average or Standard & Poor's 500 index for stocks, the carnage in fixed-income markets would have been a big story and we'd all be talking about a bear market in bonds.
Consider the damage: mutual funds that invest in long-term United States Treasury bonds lost an average 6.8 percent in May, according to Morningstar, with the loss in principal wiping out years of interest payments. But that's not the worst-hit sector. Higher-yielding bonds and fixed-income securities, to which investors have turned in droves in recent years, have suffered even more, especially mortgage-backed securities and emerging market debt, as well as just about anything that uses borrowing to increase returns. 
Many individual securities and funds were hit much harder than the averages.
Vanguard's Extended Duration Treasury Index fund was down more than 6 percent in the last month. In the mortgage area, Annaly Capital Management, a popular real estate investment trust that invests in mortgages, fell 8.7 percent, and an iShares mortgage exchange-traded fund lost 10.4 percent. Pimco's Corporate Opportunity Fund, which is managed by the star analyst Bill Gross and which invests in a mix of corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities and uses some borrowing, lost nearly 13.4 percent. Annualized, such declines are off the charts.
''There are many closed-end bond funds and mortgage funds that were just annihilated in May,'' said Anthony Baruffi, a senior portfolio manager at SNW Asset Management in Seattle, which specializes in fixed-income assets.
This week, the bond markets' jitters spilled into the stock market, with major indexes gyrating around the globe. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 200 points on Wednesday, only to bounce back Thursday and Friday.
High-dividend stocks, which many bond investors also looked to in their quest for income, were pummeled. Shares of Procter & Gamble dropped more than 6 percent the last week in May.
The severity of the market reaction shows how skittish investors have become about ultralow interest rates. Bond prices fall when interest rates rise, with longer-maturity, higher-yielding and riskier bonds the hardest hit -- the very assets that the Federal Reserve's ultralow interest rate policy has encouraged income-seeking investors to embrace.
Fixed-income funds are where investors have traditionally looked for safety and low volatility, unlike stocks, and such precipitous moves are rare. To put this in perspective, the recent plunge in prices of fixed-income securities had analysts reaching back to 1994, when the Fed began raising rates and 10-year Treasury rates rose two and a half percentage points. That year, Orange County, Calif., had to declare bankruptcy after its bond portfolio plunged in value.
The sudden recent moves in the markets have left many experts scratching their heads, because, on the face of things, not much has changed in the overall economic outlook. This week's employment number -- American employers added 175,000 new jobs in May -- was the average rate for the last year, suggesting slow but steady growth in the economy. Other measures released in May, like consumer confidence, consumer spending, and personal income, were generally positive, but nothing to suggest any imminent surge in economic growth.
''Last week's sell-off was very indiscriminate,'' said Jonathan A. Beinner, chief investment officer for global fixed income and liquidity at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Added Mr. Baruffi, ''I was surprised at how severe the market reaction was.''
After all, the Fed hasn't actually raised rates, as it did without any advance warning in 1994. But all it took this time was the merest hint from the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the Fed's quantitative easing policy might be tapering off sooner than expected.
In the latest round, the Fed announced last December that it would buy billions of dollars of long-term Treasury bonds as well as mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to keep longer-term rates low. With the federal funds rate at 0.25 percent, it has already lowered short-term rates about as far as they can go. The question for investors since then has been: How long will the Fed keep rates so low?
Maybe not much longer. ''We've been talking about the fact that eventually this interest rate cycle has to come to an end for the better part of six-plus months,'' Gary D. Cohn, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, told me this week. ''People need to be reminded of the inverse correlation between interest rates and bond prices. The moves in interest rates may seem small, but they're pretty powerful. There can be a dramatic impact on prices.''
The sell-off in fixed income began slowly on May 10, an otherwise uneventful day with no obvious catalyst for any change in sentiment. It picked up steam when Fed sources didn't step forward to calm markets. Then, in comments to Congress on May 22, Mr. Bernanke said, ''We could in the next few meetings take a step down in our pace of purchases.''
That set off alarm bells, in contrast with his prepared text, which gave no suggestion that the Fed's policy would change so soon. And then, the minutes of the Fed's May meeting suggested that some Fed governors were prepared to start tapering off bond purchases as soon as the Fed's next meeting, which will be June 18 and 19. Near-panic selling in some markets ensued.
''When you get a fundamental shift in interest rates, which doesn't happen very often, the initial move is always pretty dramatic,'' Mr. Cohn said. ''It's a move from a lower rate world to a higher rate world, and people try to get ahead of it.''
Mr. Beinner added: ''The concern is that the Fed is taking away the punch bowl and taking liquidity out of the market. The increase in liquidity has been a big driver of these markets, and as the market gets its head around these things, it follows that those markets will weaken.''
That said, ''The magnitude of the moves was extreme in some cases,'' Mr. Beinner said. ''It wasn't based on fundamentals, and may have been a liquidity-driven event, with hedge funds'' selling when prices fell to target levels.
Whether or not the current sell-off continues, the plunge has startled investors who may not have realized how much risk was embedded in their portfolios. ''The only thing I guarantee for sure is that someday we will have high interest rates again,'' Mr. Cohn said.
''It may take 50 years, but rates are going to go higher. We have an entire generation of investors who have never experienced a rising rate environment.''
Mr. Beinner said investors need to reconsider their traditional fixed-income allocations, nearly all of which carry interest rate risk. ''It's an asset class with a negative expected return without any other positive offsetting properties. So why have it as a part of your portfolio?''
He said the simplest and safest approach is simply to park funds in a low-volatility money market fund and accept near-zero returns. There are also floating-rate funds, which invest in floating-rate bank and corporate loans as a way to protect against rising interest rates, at least in theory. But there has been a recent rush into these funds, and the risks may not be clear to investors. Their track records are relatively brief, and it's not clear how they'd react in another financial crisis.
Hedging by taking short positions in interest rate futures is too expensive and complicated for most individual investors, and so-called inverse funds, which use leverage and take short positions, are too speculative for many investors.
There are also so-called unconstrained bond funds, like Goldman's Strategic Income Fund, of which Mr. Beinner is a manager. His fund uses hedging strategies to minimize interest rate risk and can seek opportunities around the globe. (He says he thinks emerging market debt is undervalued.) But returns on such funds depend on the skills of their managers.
''I've been hearing from a lot of worried baby boomers,'' Mr. Baruffi said. He recommends a cautious approach, which means accepting low returns for now in return for safety. ''People need to be patient,'' he said. ''This is no time to reach for yield. What people need is a bomb shelter. There's no return on those, but if the market continues to drop, you'll be happy and you can reinvest at lower prices.''

HEADLINE: Obama and Xi Tackle Cybersecurity as Talks Begin in California

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Jane Perlez contributed reporting from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- President Obama, midway through much-anticipated weekend talks with President Xi Jinping of China, said Friday night that there was no parallel between the cyberattacks on American businesses and government interests that it blames on China and the United States government's surveillance of phone and Internet traffic to foil terrorists.
Mr. Xi sidestepped a question from a reporter about whether China was complicit in the hacking of America systems, and countered that his country was also a victim of cyberattacks. Both presidents said their countries and others must work to develop what Mr. Obama called ''common rules'' for cybersecurity to protect economies and militaries globally.
''In some ways these are uncharted waters, and we don't have the kind of protocols that have governed military issues and arms issues, where nations have a lot of experience in trying to negotiate what's acceptable and what's not,'' Mr. Obama added. 
The two presidents spoke to reporters after three hours of relatively informal discussions at a secluded desert retreat here and before a working dinner. They are to meet for a final session on Saturday morning, completing an unusually informal get-together that reflects the personal ties each leader is trying to foster.
Officials said the first session was focused on the security issues that bedevil both leaders and one -- North Korea's nuclear threat -- that the United States sees as a chance to foster greater cooperation with China. On Saturday, the presidents plan to delve into economic issues, a category that includes cybersecurity because of businesses' concerns about actual and threatened theft of their commercial secrets and other intellectual property.
Before the talks began, both leaders pledged to use their meetings to take the relationship between their countries to a new, more cooperative level despite new tensions over cybersecurity.
Mr. Xi proclaimed ''a new historical starting point,'' 40 years after the opening of relations.
Mr. Obama said, ''I think that both of us agree that continuous and candid and constructive conversation and communication is critically important to shaping our relationship for years to come.'' .
He added, ''The United States welcomes the continuing peaceful rise of China as a world power and that, in fact, it is in the United States' interest that China continues on the path of success, because we believe that a peaceful and stable and prosperous China is not only good for Chinese but also good for the world and for the United States.''
Mr. Xi, reflecting his country's increasing sense of its global power as it defines its stance toward the United States, said the question they face is: ''How can our two nations join together to promote peace and development in the world? These are things that not just the people in our two countries are watching closely, but the whole world is also watching very closely.''
''We need to think creatively and act energetically so that working together we can build a new model of major-country relationship,'' he added.
After their opening statements, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi, along with their interpreters and closest aides, retreated to the comfort of the sprawling Sunnylands estate in nearby Rancho Mirage, built by the publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg. But Mr. Obama could not completely escape the domestic controversy over the federal government's surveillance of domestic phone records and foreign Internet traffic, despite his attempt early on Friday to dampen the furor with an emphatic public defense of the antiterrorism tactics.
White House officials said they did not know why someone had leaked details about the surveillance programs, though they said they did not think they were timed to sabotage the Obama-Xi talks here. A spokesman for Mr. Obama, Josh Earnest, dismissed suggestions from reporters flying with the president to Palm Springs that the surveillance flap would undercut Mr. Obama's efforts to pressure his counterpart on human rights and civil liberties within China.
Mr. Earnest even suggested that the intensity of the current debate in the United States could serve as a good example to the Chinese. ''This is a pretty good illustration of type of conversation we want to have about respecting civil liberties and protecting the constitutional rights of the people that you govern,'' he said.
The surveillance limits and privacy protections that Mr. Obama instituted when he took office, Mr. Earnest added, ''constrained his own ability, constrained his own authority.''
''I think that is a testament to the strength of our system of government,'' he said.
The reaction from China, where Internet surveillance is a basic fact of life, seemed muted. Some Chinese dissidents who view the United States as a symbol of political tolerance were initially surprised but also said they understood the reasons cited for the American surveillance.
''I think the main difference is that in China surveillance is done for the interests of the Communist Party, with no legal basis or limits at all, to monitor dissidents,'' said Hu Jia, a prominent dissident in Beijing who often uses Skype, Twitter and other Internet tools. ''In the U.S. case, I think this was used to fight terror.''
Chen Yongmiao, a rights advocate and former lawyer in Beijing, said he would not be any more worried about using the Internet now. ''I think these days all governments do this kind of thing, and it's a matter of whether there are any limits or legal restraints,'' he said. ''Of course, the use of government powers should be transparent and accountable, and when the U.S. government isn't and it's exposed, then the government will pay a price. On the other hand, China does not have any mechanisms like that.''
Another issue expected to figure prominently in the talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi is the tension with North Korea that has been inflamed this year by a series of belligerent statements and actions from the North's young leader, Kim Jong-un. The Obama administration has welcomed what officials have described as a growing impatience in China -- on the part of Mr. Xi in particular -- with its longstanding ally in Pyongyang. That has raised administration hopes of new cooperation.
China voted with the rest of the United Nations Security Council to impose new sanctions on North Korea after it tested a nuclear device in February. And when a close adviser to Mr. Kim visited China last month, Mr. Xi bluntly told him that North Korea should resume international negotiations intended to force it to abandon its nuclear arsenal.
Mr. Xi also appears to have invested heavily in the meetings here with Mr. Obama. Mr. Xi, who took office in March, told Mr. Obama's departing national security adviser, Tom Donilon, who arranged the meetings, that the relationship between the United States and China had reached a critical juncture and that he wanted to develop ''a new type of great power relationship.''
Some Chinese diplomats had grumbled that Mr. Xi should not have agreed to meet in California since it was Mr. Obama's turn to visit China, according to a person who attended a briefing at China's Foreign Ministry ahead of the meeting. But Mr. Xi himself dispensed with the strict protocol of alternating leaders' visits.
China also offered its own gestures in advance of the Sunnylands summit meeting on one of the prickliest issues with the United States: its treatment of human rights. On Friday, only hours before the two leaders met, China granted passports to the mother and brother of Chen Guangcheng, the blind lawyer and activist whose flight from China last year turned into a diplomatic drama between the two countries.
The day before, Mr. Chen had joined the relatives of prominent imprisoned dissidents and 30 American and international rights organizations in Washington in calling on Mr. Obama to appeal vigorously for their release and to press Mr. Xi more broadly to respect democratic freedoms.

HEADLINE: Expansive Setting for Obama's Meeting With Xi

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. -- It was Leonore Annenberg's wish that the sumptuous winter home that she and her billionaire husband, Walter H. Annenberg, built in the Southern California desert would become, after their deaths, ''Camp David West'' for American presidents -- a place both to relax and to parley with world leaders, preferably those from Pacific powers.
And both Annenbergs, associates say, wanted their Sunnylands estate to shed its reputation as a retreat only for Republican elites. 
Now, nearly 11 years after Mr. Annenberg's death and four years after his wife's, President Obama begins to realize the couple's dream by welcoming President Xi Jinping of China at Sunnylands on Friday. By its unusual informality, the presidents' two-day meeting is already being interpreted as a milestone in their nations' often tense and generally stilted four-decade diplomatic history. Mr. Obama will sleep at the estate, presumably in the canary yellow master bedroom where speakers pipe in the songs of the birds outdoors; Chinese officials and their leader, reportedly fearful of eavesdropping bugs, have opted for a nearby hotel.
''This meeting fits the Annenbergs' conception to a T,'' said George P. Shultz, who as a member of both the Nixon and Reagan cabinets often joined those presidents at Sunnylands, along with their spouses and celebrities like Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra.
Yet as properties go, Sunnylands is no Camp David.
Camp David, the wooded retreat of presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the Maryland mountains near Washington, is plenty nice for those who favor rustic chic and cabins. Sunnylands, by contrast, is a 25,000-square-foot structure of postwar Modernist design near Palm Springs, with 22 guest bedrooms and a sprawling living room with walls of windows that look out to the surrounding San Jacinto Mountains. The house sits on 200 acres that include a nine-hole golf course, 11 artificial lakes, three guest cottages, a tennis court and landscaped grounds with sculptures and groves of olive trees.
Inside, and certain to make the guests from Beijing feel more at home, are ancient Chinese porcelain, sculptures and cloisonné pieces. But there also are paintings by Picasso and sculptures by Rodin and Giacometti, among others. The home's 52 Impressionist and post-Impressionist works, by Cezanne, Manet, Monet and more, are digitized copies of the real things; the originals are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art because of a billion-dollar bequest from the Annenbergs after Mr. Annenberg's death.
Sunnylands remains much as it was in past decades, Mr. Shultz said. ''It's a magical place, and a wonderful place to sit and talk,'' he added.
But he and Mr. Reagan were on their feet and golfing one year, he said, playing their traditional pre-party New Year's Eve game, when the president asked Mr. Shultz, his secretary of state, if he had any good economic policy ideas. Mr. Shultz, who had been Treasury secretary to Mr. Nixon, passed along a tax proposal he had heard from a friend. That was the idea that led to the landmark 1986 law overhauling the tax code.
The Annenbergs broke ground for Sunnylands 50 years ago, and it was three years under construction before the couple, who also had residences in Pennsylvania, New York, Washington and Sun Valley, Idaho, began spending the winter months at the desert oasis. When they were in residence, so were others: Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower enjoyed post-presidency getaways. Richard M. Nixon, who is still revered in China for opening relations between the two countries, was a frequent guest and escaped here after his resignation as president, writing in the Annenbergs' guest book, ''When you're down, you find out who your real friends are.'' Gerald and Betty Ford visited repeatedly, as did George and Barbara Bush.
In 1975, Mr. Annenberg, who had been Mr. Nixon's ambassador to Britain, wrote to Margaret Thatcher, who was then the opposition leader in the House of Commons, to arrange a meeting with Mr. Reagan at the latter's request; it soon took place in London, just a few years before each would take power and forge a trans-Atlantic alliance. Mrs. Thatcher, the former prime minister, who died in April, visited Sunnylands a number of times, as has Queen Elizabeth.
The first President Bush set the precedent for incumbent world leaders conferring at Sunnylands, 22 years before the estate would open for that purpose in 2012. In 1990 he held a state dinner for Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, and the two men had talks to avert a trade crisis.
In 1988, a casually dressed Mr. Reagan signed the first free-trade pact with Canada in Mr. Annenberg's office at Sunnylands, communicating by phone with the Canadian prime minister. According to Geoffrey Cowan, the president of the Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands, the office is now called ''the president's office,'' and, he added, ''It will be President Obama's office.''
Mr. Obama will be the eighth president to stay at the estate, and the third Democrat. Both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have been guests, if not such frequent visitors and Annenberg friends as the Republican presidents. Both Annenbergs ''really liked the Clintons,'' Mr. Cowan said, ''and that I know from my own conversations with them.''
A 21-minute video created for the trust, called ''A Place Called Sunnylands,'' is rich with footage of the estate's Republican heritage. But it closes with Mr. Clinton, who expresses hope that Sunnylands will become a meeting place for world leaders in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Is New Blow To Nashville Symphony

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
For a while, the Nashville Symphony Orchestra seemed to have everything going for it. After a triumphant Carnegie Hall debut in 2000, it began to make compact discs prolifically, winning a handful of Grammys and a reputation for its championship of contemporary American music along the way. And it opened a sumptuous new concert hall, the 1,844 seat, $123 million Schermerhorn Symphony Center, in 2006.
When the Louisiana Symphony was flooded out by Hurricane Katrina, the Nashville Symphony invited the New Orleans musicians to Nashville to play a benefit concert, offering its own players to fill in gaps in the Louisiana string section. 
Now this feisty, can-do orchestra's future is imperiled. On Wednesday, independent auditors submitted a review in which they questioned whether the orchestra could ''continue as a 'going concern.' ''
And on Thursday, after months of negotiations about how the orchestra can repay an $82.3 million loan for the construction of the hall, the Bank of America began foreclosure proceedings, announcing that the hall would be put up for auction on June 28.
The orchestra's management has kept its audience abreast of developments with a series of open letters and updates on its Web site, and officials said they hoped to avert foreclosure, perhaps by filing for bankruptcy if necessary.
''At the moment, we are continuing what I believe is a very productive negotiation with the lender group,'' Kevin Crumbo, the treasurer of the orchestra's board of directors and the chairman of its financial restructuring committee, said on Friday, ''and we remain hopeful of reaching an out-of-court resolution.''
The orchestra's problems stem from a string of reversals in recent years. A flood in Nashville in May 2010 caused about $40 million in damages to the hall. The economic downturn has taken its toll as well, as gifts to the orchestra dropped to $10.6 million last year from a high of just over $39 million in 2008, and investment income dropped to $2.2 million in 2012 from $6.4 million in 2011, according to the orchestra.
Though the orchestra points out that this decline was partly offset by 2011 flood recovery funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, it contributed to a shortfall of $11.7 million for the fiscal year that ended last July -- and a total shortfall of $39 million since 2009.
To some extent, the foreclosure notice may be the bank's latest move in a high-stakes chess game that began in April, when the orchestra's board voted not to renew the letter of credit that was backing the loan.
That, as Mr. Crumbo explained, made the orchestra's debt come due immediately, though it was clear that it did not have the means to pay it, which contributed to the auditors' doleful conclusion. The board reasoned that its action would force the bank to restructure the debt with more favorable terms. That restructuring is the subject of the current negotiations between the orchestra and the bank.
Bank of America had nothing to add beyond a terse statement:
''The bank group has been in discussions for some time with the orchestra to help it resolve its debt on an acceptable basis and operate at a sustainable level,'' Shirley Norton, the bank's spokesman, wrote in an e-mail. ''Left with no other alternative the bank group has been forced to file for foreclosure, always a last resort.''
Mr. Crumbo said foreclosure postings were unsurprising in negotiations of this sort, as an attempt to ''move negotiations forward.'' He said the bank could extend the foreclosure deadline.
''The symphony,'' he added, ''could also head off a foreclosure by filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. We're prepared to do that if it becomes necessary, but our preference is to continue the negotiations, and stay out of court.''
Alan D. Valentine, the orchestra's president and chief executive, noted that the orchestra was finding new ways to produce income, including presenting pop and jazz concerts in the hall and making the hall available for rentals. He said ticket income has been increasing by 30 percent a year.
Mr. Crumbo added that Nashville's new Music City Center, a large convention space, has just opened about a block and a half from the hall, and will attract visitors to Nashville who may also buy tickets and support the orchestra.
''I don't think our prospects have ever been brighter than they are now,'' Mr. Crumbo said, sounding surprisingly upbeat for someone who has just been served with a foreclosure notice. ''We have a growing downtown area. Surely we can wrap up these negotiations and move on with developing that.''

HEADLINE: British Employers See Value in Europe-Wide Labor Pool

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- With several big construction projects under way in Britain, the multinational company CH2M Hill spent six months searching for a qualified tunneling engineer.
Only a few weeks ago did the company find a candidate, in Portugal. CH2M Hill quickly made plans to bring him north -- no visa or work permits were required, thanks to a European Union policy that allows the free flow of labor across the borders of the 27-country bloc.
With signs that Britain might seek an exit from the European Union, businesses like CH2M Hill are starting to focus on what they might lose in the labor force if the country does leave. 
For non-Europeans, securing a work permit can take three months, so the labor law is a huge help, said Michael I. Glenn, CH2M Hill's director of international operations.
''These programs and projects that we do are of a scale that we have to move our expertise around,'' he said.
Continental Europe provides a nearby pool of potential employees with the qualifications needed to work in Britain, added Andrea Laws, the company's director of international recruitment.
Britain, with 61.9 million people, has about 40.6 million people of working age. But together, the 27 countries in the European Union, population 494.9 million, represent a labor pool of about 329.7 million. (Only citizens of Romania and Bulgaria are restricted from working freely in Britain, and they will gain that right in January when temporary restrictions imposed by Britain lapse.)
Despite Britain's unemployment rate of 7.8 percent, many businesses say that without access to the European Union's labor pool, filling all sorts of jobs would be difficult, either because they cannot find enough people with the right skills in Britain or because there are some jobs that Britons are reluctant to do.
A report this month from the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry concluded that Britain's leaving the European Union would directly affect ''firms' ability to do business,'' ''their access to skills'' and, therefore, the British government's tax revenue.
The report also said the 2.2 million European Union immigrants were ''much more likely'' to be employed and less likely to be reliant on public welfare benefits than either British citizens or immigrants from outside the European Union.
But as in the United States, where immigration legislation has been hotly debated for months, migrant labor remains a contentious issue in Britain. A growing populist force, the U.K. Independence Party, blames Europe for allowing hundreds of thousands of workers outside the country to settle here.
''The business perspective, broadly speaking, clashes with the No. 1 concern about the European Union from the public,'' said Mats Persson, director of Open Europe, which favors a looser relationship between Britain and the European Union.
British opponents of open borders point to the large influx of workers from the former Communist states of Eastern Europe in the last decade. When Poland and seven other ex-Communist countries joined the European Union in 2004, the British government underestimated the scale of migration and chose not to impose temporary work restrictions.
Yet in the chamber report, a director of a promotional merchandise company said ''a number of our suppliers use Polish or Baltic workers to do quite menial tasks because they cannot get local people to do them.''
Big British employers of foreign labor include service businesses like hotels because, the report said, part of the problem with such sectors ''is their poor image and the belief that they do not offer career progression opportunities.''
Still, many British business leaders criticize what they consider meddlesome employment rules by the European Union, like rules on maximum working hours and workplace rights for staff members on temporary contracts.
But the European Commission takes a different view. To expect access to the European Union's single market without abiding by its social and employment legislation is ''not realistic,'' said Jonathan Todd, a commission spokesman.
For many employers, the advantages of a Pan-European work force outweigh bureaucratic vexations.
Consider Z-Card, which sells information and advertising materials mostly in the form of pocket-size foldout cards. The company is privately held, with annual revenue of about £6 million, or $9.3 million, and has a staff of 34. Only 16 are Britons. The rest are mainly from other countries in the European Union.
While Britain is the company's biggest individual market, 70 percent of its business comes from other European Union countries, with clients like the German airline Lufthansa and the Vatican. (Z-Card produced a foldout brochure of tourist information for the Vatican Library.)
The likelihood that a Briton could have secured the Vatican contract, the company's managing director, Liz Love, said would have been ''absolutely zilch.''
For CH2M Hill, which has 28,000 employees and made $7 billion in revenue last year, the hiring challenge is less a question of culture than of capabilities. Needing to recruit at least 500 people in Britain this year for construction jobs it has already won, the company is constrained by a shortage of engineers, partly because engineering has not been a popular field of study in the country's universities.
Ms. Laws said the company was in a global ''war for talent.''
Construction booms in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America are pulling experienced engineers away from Europe, she said.
Mr. Glenn said the European Union not only enabled CH2M Hill to hire for Britain from the Continent but also let the company easily move employees to other European countries once projects were finished. That helps it retain skilled engineers.
''The skills base we are talking about and the scale of the programs require us to be able to move folks around,'' he said. ''The visa issue is significant.''

HEADLINE: In U.S., News of Surveillance Effort Is Met With Some Concern but Little Surprise

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood from Cambridge, Mass.; Robbie Brown from Atlanta; Dan Frosch from Denver; Emily Gogolak, Mona El-Naggar and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York; Ian Lovett from Los Angeles; Kim Severson from Mount Airy, N.C.; and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The string of revelations over the past 48 hours about sweeping government surveillance of American telephone records and Internet activity by foreigners, including e-mail, stirred expressions of concern across the country on Friday -- along with something of a collective national shrug.
It was not that people were not upset to learn that the government might be tracking their telephone calls, Facebook posts and Yahoo accounts. It was that in this age of ''Homeland,'' and in a culture that encourages people to share photos and minute-by-minute activities and opinions on public Web sites, the news that the government might be looking in too was often something short of a surprise.
''It stinks,'' said Steve Talley, 64, a retired state worker in Mount Airy, N.C., a small, conservative town near the border with Virginia.
''I don't mean to be cynical, but this is nothing new,'' Mr. Talley said. ''If people think the government hasn't been monitoring whatever they want to, whenever they want to they are sorely mistaken.'' 
At the Harold Washington Library Center in Chicago, Cedric Hudson, 55, an unemployed machine technician, said he was resigned to these kinds of governmental intrusions.
''It doesn't bother me because the government is going to do what they're going to do regardless of what anyone thinks,'' he said. ''There's nothing we can do about it.''
In Atlanta, Mike Brooks, 65, a construction worker, said he lived his life assuming that he was being watched. ''Anything and everything you say, they could be privy -- that's what I assume,'' he said. ''If you're dumb enough to put this online, then it's your stupidity.''
And Molly Flores, 28, a fashion designer walking in Midtown Manhattan, said she was neither surprised nor concerned by the surveillance.
''Personally, I have nothing to hide, so it's not really affecting me,'' she said. ''It's not like they're invading my privacy. I worry about New York because it's such a target.''
Across the country, people began absorbing what was proving to be at times a confusing barrage of disclosures on precisely what the government was doing. Initially, it appeared that the government was doing extensive data mining -- looking at photos, videos, e-mail and postings -- on all sorts of social media. But American officials, in acknowledging the existence of the data mining program over the past seven years, said its target was limited to foreign figures.
And while the disclosures drew heavy criticism from civil rights advocates and some members of Congress, many Republicans and Democrats expressed their support for a program that they had voted for, and reauthorized, in the sweep of national security legislation passed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
The expansion of federal surveillance power was pushed first by President George W. Bush and embraced by President Obama, meaning that this debate, at least so far, has lacked the clear and polarizing partisan intensity that has marked most battles in Washington these days.
The reaction was sharp in some circles. In downtown Denver, Sean Swallow, 39, who works for his brother's private lending firm, said it affirmed his fears that the government had seized too much power after the Sept. 11 attacks.
''They certainly have taken advantage of it, that's for sure,'' he said, adding: ''It's very Orwellian. It shows that you give them a little bit, and they'll take it as far as they can.''
Matt Barad, 27, who works at a publishing house in Manhattan, called it ''an extreme intrusion of privacy.''
''To be completely honest, it's almost scary to think that the government, especially the U.S. government, which is seen throughout the world as a protector of our freedom, is doing this,'' he said.
And Amy K. Lowe, an administrative assistant at a construction firm in Michigan, Ind., called it a ''a blatant disregard for our constitutional rights.''
''They don't need to know at all times what we're doing,'' she added. ''I avoid certain apps because of this reason. I never check in on Facebook. I don't use OnStar. I don't think it's the government's business to know.''
This year, news that Harvard University had searched faculty e-mail accounts -- ostensibly to gather information on so-called metadata by looking at subject lines, as well as the sender and recipient -- set off an uproar among faculty members. They also expressed concern at the government's surveillance.
''If this is accepted as a reasonable interpretation of what the law permits, then we really do have to expect that the government is watching all of our activity online,'' said Harry R. Lewis, 66, a professor of computer science at Harvard and a former dean of Harvard College. ''I don't think it's what most of us thought was going on, and it's not something that I, personally, feel should be happening.''
But Reginald Raye, 26, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said he saw both sides of the issue.
''Clearly the federal government is overstepping some constitutional bounds, but clearly there's also a need to monitor what's happening outside our borders,'' he said.
Anne Maguire, 20, a Harvard undergraduate, said she was more torn about the merits of the surveillance. ''On one hand I think it's extremely invasive, but am I surprised? Do I think it's right, no. Do I think it's necessary -- that's where I'm kind of undecided.''
''You have a right to privacy,'' she said. ''But at the same time there are some crazy people in the world.''
By every indication, the continued concern about domestic terrorism has colored the way Americans are reacting to intrusions on their privacy.
Rob Johnson, 21, a University of Iowa graduate who moved to Chicago to develop a smartphone app, said he considered it an appropriate trade-off in a post-9/11 world.
''I'd rather have them track who we're talking to if it saves American lives,'' he said. ''I think it's O.K. for them to be that invasive.''
In Los Angeles, Wynanda Armas, an intern, said she was ''appalled'' to learn what was going on. ''It's a complete invasion of privacy,'' she said.
Asked if she was surprised, she responded: ''By this administration? Absolutely.''
Paul Bologna, 21, a student at Northeastern University in Boston, said the disclosure had shaken his confidence and decision to vote for Mr. Obama.
''I expected a change in domestic surveillance from the Bush administration,'' he said. ''So this is really disappointing.''
But not surprising. ''It's what I have been expecting,'' he said. ''We all heard about this six or seven years ago, and now we are finding out the details.''

HEADLINE: Restaurant Chains Try to Woo a Younger Generation

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
From sun-dried tomato wraps to agave-sweetened smoothies, restaurant chains are working to court an exceptionally particular generation -- the millennials.
For reasons as varied as the economic downturn and a heightened interest in local foods, a significant shift in eating patterns is under way among the millennials, those 18 to 30. Oddly, at least by historic trends, they are eating out less than the baby boomers did at that age. Many in the restaurant business worry that it may be impossible to reverse the decline, which affects 50 million to 60 million young people.
The statistics alone are stark. Restaurant visits among millennials have fallen 16 percent over the last four years, according to research by the NPD Group, a consumer marketing firm, and have failed to pick up as the economy has improved.
''The outlook for the restaurant industry over the next 10 years is dismal,'' said Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst at NPD. 
Over all, sales are expected to grow less than 4 percent in the next decade, a troublesome projection for not only burger chains like McDonald's but for the newer ''fast-casual'' dining businesses like Chipotle. McDonald's stunned investors last month when it announced that its sales in stores open at least a year had fallen 1.2 percent after rising every quarter for almost the last decade.
And so far, restaurant chains have failed to benefit from the steady improvement in the overall economy.
''The informal eating out industry is either flat or declining in many markets around the world,'' the chief executive of McDonald's, Don Thompson, told investors last month.
It is true that restaurant chains like Chipotle, which has a devotion to explaining the origins of its ingredients that brings to mind the ''Portlandia'' sketch about a chicken dinner, and Subway, where customers plan their own sandwiches and watch them being assembled, are doing better among the millennials than traditional sit-down restaurants and fast-food chains.
But between the proliferation of artisanal food trucks and items like cupcakes made of Valrhona and Callebaut chocolates and topped with a fondant daisy for $2.75 at Georgetown Cupcake, or Fresh Direct's offering of ''heritage'' pork from the Flying Pigs Farm in upstate New York, millennials tend to spend their dining dollars sparingly and in a more calculated way.
''This was the group hardest hit by the economic crisis, and there's a debate right now about whether their purchasing behavior has changed fundamentally as a result,'' said Tony Pace, chief marketing officer for Subway. ''I think, personally, that there appears to be a structural change. There isn't a single point -- ta-da! -- that points to it, but there are a lot of little things that do.''
Vera Chang, 26, who lives in Vermont, is one of those consumers who pays attention to the ingredients on the menu and the origins of the food they favor. She says she rarely eats at chain restaurants, finding places instead through Edible Communities, which gives advice on restaurants, chefs and food, or the local newspaper, which tells her about the chef and the provenance of the foods served.
''I like to know the story about the places I eat,'' Ms. Chang said. ''I think it's key to feed one's heart in addition to one's stomach when going out.''
She said it was harder for chain restaurants to tell stories about the people behind the food they served and about themselves.
David Palmer, who follows the restaurant industry for UBS, underscored Ms. Chang's points, noting how particular the younger clientele could be, especially during tough economic times. ''The austere crowd has cut back, and pretty significantly,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''It's partly that they're economically challenged by the job market and student loans, but they also want authenticity in ingredients and the ability to customize meals in restaurants.''
According to NPD, it is not that millennials have abandoned fast food altogether: Hamburger chains like McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King get nearly 28 percent of the millennials' fast-service patronage. They just tend to eat there less often, or they have switched to other burger places like Shake Shack, Mooyah, In-N-Out Burger and Smashburger.
Pulin Modi, 32, said he preferred newer concepts like Protein Bar, a ''quick service'' restaurant with 12 locations in the Chicago area and Washington, where he works. He said newer chains tended to offer more choices for vegans like himself.
''They're not all vegetarian or vegan,'' Mr. Modi said of Protein Bar, ''but they have so many options that will work for vegetarians and vegans, like quinoa, tofu and smoothies made with almond milk or soy.''
He also frequents the new juice bar in a Walgreens near his office. And he has been eating more at home.
''When you're 18 years old, it may not sink in how much the cost adds up when you eat out compared to when you bring your own lunch or have a friend over for dinner,'' he said. ''I've learned how to eat healthier and within a certain budget.''
Of course, cyclical challenges like bad weather, higher gasoline prices and the end of the federal payroll tax cut have also hurt restaurant sales.
Additionally, comparisons to last year's sales are tough because the weather was warmer a year ago, and people were eating out more.
''This winter was longer, and I think I went out less because of that,'' said Adriana Villasenor, 32, of New York.
Even Chipotle eked out a mere 1 percent sales gain in the first quarter this year. The chief financial officer, John R. Hartung, told analysts that the low level of sales growth threatened to erode the company's traditional profit margins.
Several companies told analysts they would effectively buy customers with promotions and other price strategies to try to keep traffic through their stores stable, which would also eat into profit margins. Olive Garden, for example, is now promoting a three-course Italian dinner for $12.95, a special price.
''All of them are behind last year,'' said Malcolm M. Knapp, an adviser to the restaurant business who compiles data used by Wall Street and others to gauge sales. ''It all came to a head in February, when consumers were feeling shock, anger and betrayal over payroll taxes and the weather wasn't all that good, either.''
He said comparable store sales fell 5.2 percent that month after slumping 0.6 percent in January. Sales picked up in March but not enough to offset the declines in the previous months.
In an internal memo obtained by Advertising Age, McDonald's said it was not in the top 10 restaurants among 18- to 32-year-olds, and it calculated that without its new Premium McWraps, it could lose 22 percent of those customers to Subway. To appeal to the millennials' tastes for exotic flavors, McDonald's also features blueberry pomegranate smoothies and Fish McBites, a limited offer that met a desire for healthier choices.
Subway, which is privately held, reported sales in the United States of $12.1 billion last year, compared with $11.4 billion in 2011.
Mr. Pace of Subway pointed to some of the strategies his company has used to appeal to millennials, like offering an avocado add-on when the fruit is in season, or its Smokehouse BBQ Chicken sub, a limited offering that weighs in at just 380 calories.
''People have talked about health and food for a long time, but I think millennials are acting on that information in different ways,'' Mr. Pace said. ''They want healthy food, but it also has to be interesting food that tastes good.''
And Darden, which operates sit-down restaurant chains like Olive Garden and Red Lobster, saw its comparable-store sales drop 4.6 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the company had expected.
The company is experimenting with things like Seaside Express, a fast-serve lunch option from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in two of its Red Lobster restaurants in Orlando. Customers place orders at a counter or the bar and fill their own plastic cups, then take a seat to wait for their orders. They can choose from among new, less expensive menu items like shrimp salad and lobster grilled cheese sandwiches, which range from $6.99 to $8.99.
Ms. Riggs from NPD said the biggest opportunity for restaurants now is among the baby boomer generation, which unlike aging generations before it, is eating out more as it gets older. ''The growth of the morning meal at restaurants is almost entirely supported by boomers,'' she said. ''They're holding the industry even at this point.''
To cover that base, McDonald's has a new egg white McMuffin.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about efforts by fast-food restaurants to attract customers in the 18-to-30-year-old range described the In-N-Out Burger chain incorrectly. It was founded in 1948; it is not a ''newer'' burger place.

HEADLINE: Following Up on Poverty Coverage in The Times

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: Some commentary and resources for those interested in a troubling topic, poverty. 

 BODY:
I heard from many readers after I wrote last Sunday about The Times's coverage of poverty. I've rarely received more feedback on a column, and I appreciate the many thoughtful comments and e-mails.
A number of those who wrote noted that last year was the 50th anniversary of the publication of Michael Harrington's landmark book, "The Other America," which was so influential in helping to raise awareness and create political action. And many urged The Times to play a leading role in taking on this pervasive problem with sustained coverage and a sense of urgency.
Michael Jonathan Grinfeld, an associate professor at the University of Missouri's journalism school, offered this provocative view: 
I remember a time when "the war on poverty" was a more central issue challenging the American conscience than the recent "wars" we've fought. Each election cycle, I bemoan the fact that politicians focus on the "middle class," while avoiding altogether the social, economic, political and psychological barriers that keep those suffering in poverty out of the public consciousness. It's a failure of our watchdog role as journalists that we let this happen.
Several readers offered more information, and I'd like to share some of it here:
1. Max Rose of Durham, N.C., wrote to inform me of a journal article that he and Frank R. Baumgartner, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published this year. It used the last 50 years of poverty coverage in The Times as its primary data. One finding was that, in the late 1960s, The Times wrote frequently - as often as three times a day - about poverty, "but after the War on Poverty, that coverage dipped rapidly." In the past 40 years, it has continued a slow decline.
The study also found a huge shift, Mr. Rose said, from a focus on structural and economic problems to a focus on the personal characteristics of low-income people. There is, he wrote, "the potential for The Times to be a leader in changing the amount and the way we talk about poverty."
2. A representative of The Nation, Caitlin Graf, wrote to point out the magazine's weekly feature by Greg Kaufmann, "This Week in Poverty." The inaugural post, "This Week in Poverty: TANF Is Broken," about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, gives a sense of the feature's intended purpose - posted on Friday mornings, it is part of The Nation's "continuing coverage of an issue editor Katrina vanden Heuvel calls 'the shame of our nation.'"
The blog, Ms. Graf says, keeps track of statistics that are too often ignored; provides updates on legislative efforts at the national, state and local levels; reports on the efforts of community activists; summarizes studies and proposals offered by antipoverty experts and organizations; highlights must-read articles, successful programs and opportunities for action; and busts myths.
3. While I was writing mostly about news coverage, I should have noted that, on the opinion side of The Times, two regular online features address economic inequality. They are "The Great Divide," which is new, and "Fixes," which has been around for several years. Both are well worth readers' time and are strong contributions to The Times's overall efforts on this subject.

HEADLINE: Mr. Hot Stuff's Career Switch Pays Off Handsomely

BYLINE: JOE CLANCY


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Hot Stuff, who ran in the 2009 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes but had only one win in flat racing, is rising through the steeplechase ranks. 

 BODY:
When Mr. Hot Stuff had placed in two graded stakes and was being pointed for classics, the habit was funny, cute, good to lighten any mood around the barn. When he'd lost 6, 7, 8, 10 races in a row, the trick was no longer cute.
"He'd get a big mouthful of hay from the back of his stall, come up front and just throw it in the shedrow," the former owner Bill Casner said of Mr. Hot Stuff, the ultra-handsome son of Tiznow who washed out as a flat horse and is now rising through the steeplechase ranks. "We'd all laugh and think it was funny when he was a Derby horse."
Mr. Hot Stuff, who runs in Saturday's Zeke Ferguson Memorial at Colonial Downs, did the trick one day after he was beaten (at 3-2) at Golden Gate Fields and somebody said, "I hate that horse." 
The person didn't really, but Mr. Hot Stuff was frustrating. Big, beautiful, obviously talented, he wound up 1 for 18 with WinStar and the trainer Eoin Harty. His claims to fame were thirds in the Sham Stakes and the Santa Anita Derby and starts in the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes in 2009. He finished 15th behind Mine That Bird in the Derby and eighth behind Summer Bird in the Belmont.
Less than a year later, Mr. Hot Stuff, the winner of just one race, was sold to the steeplechase trainer Jack Fisher. Much as he did in his flat career, Mr. Hot Stuff started slowly for the owner Gill Johnston, losing twice early in 2011. But he got it together for back-to-back wins in May and June. After missing 2012 with a tendon injury, he returned in 2013, as a 7-year-old, to win the $75,000 Marcellus Frost Stakes for novices at Nashville last month.
He makes his first start in open company Saturday - four years since that Belmont Stakes try. As always with Mr. Hot Stuff, a dark bay gelding and a full brother to the Grade I winner and sire Colonel John, opinions are high.
"As good as he'd like to be," Fisher said when asked how good Mr. Hot Stuff was. "He's got talent, loads of talent. He just never applied himself or found something he really wanted to do. I think horses that try the Derby or some of those other races and try really hard, if things don't go right, they get beaten and then they don't want to try that hard after that."
Racing over jumps, at a slower pace, going longer distances, on the turf, makes a difference to some, and it's helped Mr. Hot Stuff. It doesn't hurt that he's built for it. The horse is tall, thin, athletic, leggy, with a huge stride.
"He's a beautiful horse, he's well put together, he's an athlete," Fisher said. "And he showed he had talent on the flat. The favorite in that race Saturday, Decoy Daddy, never ran in the Kentucky Derby, never ran in the Belmont Stakes."
Unlike Mr. Hot Stuff, Decoy Daddy is also not on Facebook and Twitter.
Whether it's his name, his good looks or his potential - surely it's all three - Mr. Hot Stuff has a following. He owes at least part of his fame to a Colorado ski trip, where Casner's son-in-law Clark Anderson skied with reckless abandon while wearing a pink "Hot Stuff" hat. Anderson was a good enough skier to get away with it, but he took plenty of ribbing. 
Casner and his wife, Susan, joked about naming a horse in honor of the trip. Hot Stuff was taken, but Mr. Hot Stuff was available, and so began a career path Casner compared to that of Paris Hilton. A Saratoga restaurant named a dish after the horse, famous for being famous. Mr. Hot Stuff apparel, pink of course, sold well in WinStar's online store. YouTube videos set to music were made. Search "Mr. Hot Stuff horse."
"He might have been the most fun horse we had," said Casner, whose wife picked out Mr. Hot Stuff's dam Sweet Damsel at Keeneland. "People oohed and aahed over him everywhere; he was just a big touting horse. He won his maiden race and looked pretty impressive. We thought we had the one."
They didn't.
Mr. Hot Stuff would run similar races, featuring a late charge at the end as he ran past tiring horses and finished second a few times, third a few times, sixth a few times. He lost 13 in a row after that February 2009 maiden win and sold to Fisher, first for the Virginian Nick Arundel. When Arundel died, Johnston bought the horse and left him with Fisher. Now she's hooked like everyone else. As part of Mr. Hot Stuff's recovery from the tendon injury, he spent time on Johnston's farm in Chattanooga, Tenn.
"He's a really laid-back horse, easy to do anything with and no problem to work around," she said. "He always had his head hanging way out of the door looking for attention. I used to think they were pretty high stall doors until he looked out over them."
Johnston doesn't go for social media, but she laughed at her horse's popularity.
"He's got a secret admirer somewhere," she said. "A lot of people think he's still flat racing, and now he might be a superstar over jumps. I think it adds a little something extra because of who he is, and even people who don't know his story pay attention because of his name. People hear that and they want to look at him, pay attention to him and see him. It's a great story."
It's also a great example. Mr. Hot Stuff, like many thoroughbreds, ran out of options on the flat. He was briefly good enough to be among the elite and was lucky to be owned by a high-level operation, but he faced a life of declining ability, weaker competition and lesser tracks. In a better economy, his bloodlines may have helped him become a stallion (he wasn't gelded until after the sale), but it would have been a stretch. Instead, his good looks, long stride and innate stamina got him noticed and got him out of flat racing and on to a second career.
"They've been bred for 400 years for their athleticism, and as we well know, that comes in every shape and size," said Casner, who left WinStar in 2010 and now operates Casner Racing from a base in Texas with his wife. "Every thoroughbred needs a job; it's bred into them. All they ask from us is a little feed, some care, a warm stall on a cold night and to find them that job. They'll work their hearts out for you if you find them the right job."
Casner couldn't be happier that Mr. Hot Stuff found his.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Surveillance

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at the weekly addresses and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
A thwarted plot to carry out backpack bombings in New York City's subway system is the kind of success that President Obama seemed to be referring to when he defended the National Security Agency's stockpiling of the public's telephone call logs and accessing of e-mail from Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and other companies, Eric Schmitt, David E. Sanger and Charlie Savage report.
 

        
While Mr. Obama was trying to reassure Americans that he had not abused government authority by mining telephone and e-mail data, another disclosure was made hours later about secret contingency plansto target other countries for possible cyber attacks, Peter Baker and David E. Sanger write. The revelations made his get-together with President Xi Jinping of China later in the day all the more awkward, because cyber attacks by the Chinese are high on the American agenda.
 Weekly Addresses 

        
President Obama avoided any talk of the newly revealed surveillance programs in his weekly address, choosing instead to focus on the immigration legislation that will soon be debated in the Senate. "Our out-of-date immigration system has actually harmed our economy and threatened our security," he said. "But if we're going to truly fix a broken system, we need Congress to act in a comprehensive way. And that's why what's happening next week is so important." Though he acknowledged that it would not be perfect, the legislation would provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, in addition to improving security and attracting highly skilled workers who lawmakers expect to help strengthen the economy. "In the end, that's what this is all about. Men and women who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story, just like so many of our ancestors did," he said. "And it's how we'll make sure that America's best days always lie ahead."

        
Representative Luke Messer of Indiana delivered the Republican address this week, focusing on the student loan interest rate that is scheduled to double on July 1. "No one wants this to happen, especially in a job market where millions of recent grads are having a hard time finding full-time work," he said. He chided the president for denouncing the Republican plan to address the coming increase, saying that it was "yet another example of the arrogance of power that has taken root" in the White House. "Student loan relief is just one example of the solutions Republicans have put forward to get our economy back on track and give our next generation their opportunity to live the American dream," he said. "Working together, we can."
 Happenings in Washington 

        
The 38th annual Capital Pride Parade will march through the District on Saturday and is expected to attract more than 100,000 spectators.

HEADLINE: Just Tap Here

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Goodbye, plastic hotel room key. So long, wallet. Farewell, camera.
These days you don't need any of the above to unlock a hotel room, buy a mojito or snap a vacation photo. All you need is, well -- you. At hotels like Alma Barcelona in Spain, a scan of your fingertips opens the door to your room. At Ushuaïa Ibiza Beach Hotel in the Mediterranean, you can buy suntan lotion and a sarong with a tap of two fingers. On some Disney Cruise Line ships, facial recognition technology enables onboard photographers to easily group every candid picture they take of you so that you can later browse (read: buy) them. 
Like it or not, we are living in an age of human holograms that welcome us to airport security checkpoints and luggage tags capable of texting us when our bags are lost. Technology and travel are becoming ever more fused, even at hotels where for centuries the basic demand has remained unchanged: a safe place to lay one's head. Today, your head could spin from some of the amenities. At Hotel 1000 in Seattle the rooms have infrared signals that scan and detect body heat to ensure that the housekeeping staff doesn't knock or barge in, while at Starwood's Aloft Hotel chain, radio frequency identification allows you to skip the front desk and check in with your smartphone instead (the chain said that more than 10,000 guests have already tried it).
Arguably, the most compelling and unnerving of these technologies is biometrics -- the measurement of physical or behavioral traits to verify identity. Once strictly in the realm of spy novels and science fiction flicks, biometrics are increasingly being used by real-world hotels, resorts and cruise ships. For some travelers, it signals a new era of convenience: no more inadvertently demagnetizing your room key or hiding your wallet in your shoe at the pool. For others, it's yet another zone that Big Brother is penetrating (not to mention making ''Mad Men''-style rendezvous less clandestine).
Biometric technology has been around for decades. Hotels in chains like the Four Seasons and Hyatt have used it to track their employees' hours and whereabouts, and to increase security on their properties. And a handful of hotels in the vanguard -- Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Murano Resort and Kube, both in Paris -- introduced biometric room keys years ago. (In Boston, Kimpton's Nine Zero Hotel has a penthouse suite that opens with a flash of your iris.) Even so, many travelers were unaware that biometrics were being deployed.
Now, after years in the background, biometrics are slowly becoming a part of everyday life, popping up in stores, clubs, gyms. One of the most visible travel examples is evident at airports: frequent fliers who have undergone background checks as part of United States programs like Global Entry and Clear can now be seen sailing through security after pausing at kiosks to verify their biometric information through fingerprint and iris scans. Millions of travelers who want to be fast and unfettered have willingly paid the price, both in terms of money ($100 for five years for Global Entry; $179 a year for Clear) and privacy (the applications require personal information like your passport number, fingerprints and photos).
Indeed, the technology has consumer advocacy groups and data privacy experts worried about civil liberties and the protection of personal data. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, for one, has outlined half a dozen areas of concern about biometrics, including how the data is stored and how vulnerable it is to theft or abuse (available at Epic.org/privacy).
Still, new research from the World Economic Forum and the Boston Consulting Group suggests that biometric identification will only become more prevalent as accuracy improves, eventually giving rise to a ''fully automated'' check-in, security, border-control and smart-visa system that could improve security and whittle down long lines at airports and borders. ''Check in for a flight would be expedited by replacing paper documents with an electronic passport,'' explains a summary of the innovations laid out in the report, ''as well as biometric traveler identification through fingerprints, facial recognition, or an iris scan.''
Hotels, too, are embracing technology, and not simply by placing iPads in their rooms and lobbies. One of the most eager to adopt biometrics is the Ushuaïa Ibiza Beach Hotel. If you think an island vacation ought to consist of a quiet afternoon sprawled on a beach towel and unplugged from the world, don't bother making a reservation there. Last year, the hotel was using wristbands with radio frequency identification technology, or RFID, which relies on electromagnetic waves, to allow guests to instantly update their Facebook status by swiping the bands against sensors around the property. New this year: biometrics status updates. Guests input their fingerprints at kiosks and from then on, sensors in the ''Facebook pillars'' around the property allow them to tap two fingers to update their status with messages like, ''Hanging out at the Ushuaïa Ibiza Beach Hotel ... Jealous?''
As Linda Scaperotto, director of marketing for the Palladium Hotel Group, which owns Ushuaïa, put it: ''We can't disconnect from social media even when we're on a beach in the Mediterranean.''
The pillars, positioned in envy-inducing spots like by the beach and on a rooftop, can take your photo and post it to Facebook, too. Signs remind guests of the raison d'être: ''Don't forget to make your friends jealous.''
But that's not all you can do by tapping your fingers. ''You can pay for your mojito with your fingerprint,'' Ms. Scaperotto said. Registering for a cash-free payment system called PayTouch enables guests to buy anything they like -- again, with a tap of two fingertips. To use the system, you input your credit card information and your fingerprints into a registration kiosk, and PayTouch links your prints to your card. Voilà, you're able to buy food, drinks (yes, at the swim-up bar) and souvenirs by swiping your fingertips not only throughout the resort but also at local bars, restaurants and shops.
These sorts of high-tech amenities (which travelers who are concerned about privacy don't have to use) are not just emerging in far-flung Saturnalias. One of the most prominent players in travel technology is Walt Disney World Resorts, which has been using finger recognition scanners at its park entrances for more than a decade. The finger scanners associate you with your ticket (a plastic card) the first time you use it, which the company said is to help to prevent fraud and make it easier to re-enter the parks. (You can opt out though, and show photo identification instead.) The card is also your room key, and a charge account if you so choose.
But something new is on the horizon: Disney is testing -- and later this year will begin rolling out -- ''MagicBands'' at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida: radio frequency technology-enabled wristbands that when flicked across mouse ear ''touch points'' throughout the resort allow you to unlock your room, enter the theme parks, use FastPasses and PhotoPasses, and pay for meals and merchandise (the latter is optional). You can read more about the radio frequency technology and your privacy at Disneyworld.disney.go.com.
Used in conjunction with the My Disney Experience Web site and app, the wristbands will also help personalize various other aspects of your theme park experience. For example, you could register online for a meet-and-greet with a Disney character and input your child's name. Then, as you approach that character in the park, the MagicBand enables little Bobby or Ella to be greeted by name. Later, the kids can breeze back into the hotel room using their wristbands, never having to ask Mom or Dad for help unlocking the door.
Then again, couldn't they also go buy themselves $500 worth of Disney memorabilia? As it turns out, no. A PIN will be required for all purchases, and parents can set a spending limit on children's bands, ensuring that the magic goes only so far.

HEADLINE: Kane Finishes Hat Trick, and Kings, in a Thriller

BYLINE: By BEN STRAUSS

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Three minutes into Saturday night's game, Duncan Keith found himself with room inside the Los Angeles Kings' blue line and fired a slap shot. When it slipped between the legs of Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick, Keith, who had been suspended for the previous game because of a high stick to the face of Jeff Carter, pumped his fists and let loose a scream so powerful that his mouth guard flew out like a projectile.
Keith and his Blackhawks teammates would eventually celebrate a win, but only after the Kings mounted a stirring comeback and turned what had looked to be a sure Chicago win into a playoff classic. 
Patrick Kane scored his third goal of the night 11 minutes 40 seconds into the second overtime -- a one-timer off a pass from Jonathan Toews on a two-on-one rush -- to give Chicago a 4-3 victory and send the Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup finals.
Chicago will host the Boston Bruins in Game 1 on Wednesday night at United Center.
''It's nice to win first and foremost, but to contribute the last couple games, I think any player would be lying to you if he said it isn't nice,'' Kane said.
Saturday's game went to overtime after the Kings' Mike Richards deflected a shot from Anze Kopitar past goaltender Corey Crawford with less than 10 seconds to play in regulation. Richards, playing for the first time since having concussion symptoms after Game 1 of the series, saved the Kings' season just as it appeared to have surely slipped away. Kane had scored with 3:52 left in a frantic third period.
''I honestly don't think there's a worse feeling in hockey when you're nine seconds away,'' Toews said. ''You know you have to get the puck out, and two little bounces go against you and next think you know it's in the net. Your heart sinks pretty quick.''
Before the puck dropped, Blackhawks players referred to Saturday's Game 5 as essentially a Game 7. Fuzzy math aside, the reasoning was that allowing the Kings, the defending champions, a spark -- even in a series they trailed by three games to one -- could produce a full-blown fire.
True to that mind-set, the Blackhawks came out as the aggressors. Two minutes after Keith opened the scoring, Kane collected a rebound in front of the Kings' net and beat Quick top shelf to give Chicago a 2-0 lead and send the home crowd into a frenzy.
The Kings did not record their first shot until 10:42 into the first period, by which point the Blackhawks already had seven. But the Blackhawks let their foot off the gas, and Los Angeles broke through to cut the lead in half with a short-handed goal by Dwight King at 9:28 of the second period.
After Bryan Bickell went to the penalty box for boarding early in the third, Crawford could not smother a shot from Carter, and Kopitar stuffed the rebound home to tie the game at 2-2.
The Blackhawks' advice to themselves would prove sage in the end. As the teams skated back and forth in overtime, the crowd hanging on every pass, every rush and every shot, the night did have the unmistakable feel of a Game 7 -- even if only one team faced elimination.
When the longest game in the Kings' history was finally over, Quick had stopped 31 of 35 shots. Crawford saved 33 of the 36 attempts he faced.
Chicago was tested by the Detroit Red Wings in a grueling seven-game series in the conference semifinals, at one point trailing by three games to one. Despite their league-best 77 points during the regular season, the Blackhawks entered the series against the Kings considered underdogs by some, faced with the task of solving Quick, the reigning most valuable player of the playoffs.
But the Blackhawks proved equal to the challenge, even chasing Quick during a 4-2 Game 2 win. The Kings had allowed more than two goals in just 2 of 13 playoff games entering the series. The Blackhawks scored three or more in three of the five games, eliminating the Kings in rather economical fashion.
''Coming back from that deficit against Detroit gives us a lot of confidence,'' Toews said. ''We have a great chance to go back to where we want to be, and there's going to be some more tough moments and we'll have to battle through it.''
Now Chicago will turn its attention to Boston. The Bruins swept away the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins and their high-powered offense Friday. The showdown will feature two Original Six franchises and two teams firing on all cylinders.
The Blackhawks have another distinction: they will attempt to become the first Presidents' Trophy winner to raise the Stanley Cup since Detroit in 2007-8.

HEADLINE: Only Children: Lonely and Selfish?

BYLINE: By LAUREN SANDLER. 
The author of the forthcoming book ''One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child and the Joy of Being One.''

 BODY:
CALL me a terrible mother. I have an only child. For now at least, I'm planning to keep it that way, for my happiness and for hers. But the notion that an only child might be a happy one contradicts strong cultural beliefs. According to these, children like mine will end up rotten with selfishness and beset by loneliness.
And negative assumptions about parents who deprive their child of siblings strengthen the general opprobrium against only children. If a child doesn't have siblings, it's generally assumed that there's a hush-hush reason for it: we don't like being parents (because we are selfish), we care more about our status -- work, money, materialism -- than our child (because we are selfish), or we waited too long (because we are selfish). When have you heard someone say an only child is better off? 
A general picture emerges that only children are loners, misfits and always, always selfish. I don't buy it. As an only child, with one of my own, and as someone who has just spent three years writing about the subject, I'm convinced that if, by dint of will or biology, you have an only child, you can stop worrying about it.
Don't take my word for it. Consider the data: in hundreds of studies during the past decades exploring 16 character traits -- including leadership, maturity, extroversion, social participation, popularity, generosity, cooperativeness, flexibility, emotional stability, contentment -- only children scored just as well as children with siblings. And endless research shows that only children are, in fact, no more self-involved than anyone else. It turns out brutal sibling rivalry isn't necessary to beat the ego out of us; peers and classmates do the job.
Nor are only children lonelier. Toni Falbo at the University of Texas and her colleague Denise Polit are among the many researchers who have explored the question of whether only children are lonelier than those who have siblings. Their findings suggest that solitude is not synonymous with loneliness and often strengthens character. As one psychotherapist explained to me, only children tend to have stronger primary relationships with themselves. And nothing provides better armor against loneliness.
An Ohio State survey of more than 13,000 children found that only children had as many friends as anyone else; many of the only children I interviewed had cherished and nurtured friendships that they often regarded with a familial sense of permanence and loyalty.
The differences between only children and those raised with siblings tend to be positive ones. Ms. Falbo and Ms. Polit examined hundreds of studies in the 1980s and found that only children had demonstrably higher intelligence and achievement; only children have also been found to have more self-esteem. These findings, which have been confirmed repeatedly in recent years, hold true regardless of whether parents of only children stayed together and regardless of economic class.
Researchers like the sociologist Judith Blake believe these qualities result from the fact that parents who have just one child are able to devote more resources -- time, money and attention -- to them than parents who have to divide resources among more children.
The idea that only children are precocious persists and may, as Ms. Blake suggests, be connected with the fact that only children are often raised in richer verbal environments and share meals and other activities with adults. (I love it that an artist friend still brags that my daughter was 2 when she insisted that a crayon was ''magenta, not pink.'')
My research suggests that only children experience more intensely emotional family lives. The parental gaze is more focused; the love more concentrated. This intensity can be enriching, and also suffocating. Many adult only children told me that they wanted their first child to have a sibling precisely because this kind of intensity was too much for them.
At the end of their parents' lives, only children are sometimes said to be burdened in ways that children with siblings aren't. Data from the National Alliance for Caregiving show that, in fact, the closest living sibling most often shoulders responsibility for elder caretaking. Still there is something existentially troubling about the idea of facing one's parents' mortality alone; in my interviews with hundreds of only children, I found that this was the issue people felt most viscerally about when deciding whether they wanted to have one or more children.
Given that about one in five American families now have just one child, this seems like a good time to question the misconceptions about only children and the dangers of raising a child without siblings. For one thing, one-child families make obvious sense in a time of diminishing resources. This may explain recent studies showing that parents who have one child tend to be happier. (In a recent study at the University of Pennsylvania, for example, Hans-Peter Kohler surveyed 35,000 sets of twins and found that of those women who had children, the happiest ones were those who had just one child.) Call me selfish but, as the mother of one child, I enjoy more time, energy and resources than I would if I had more children. And it is hard to imagine that this isn't better for my family as well as for me.
Most people say they have their first child for themselves and the second to benefit their first. But if children aren't inherently worse off without siblings, who is best served by this kind of thinking? Instead of making family choices to fulfill breeding assignments we imagine we've been given, we might ensure that our most profound choice is a purely independent, personal one. To do so might even feel like something people rarely associate with parenting: it might feel like freedom.

 BODY:
In last Sunday's Big City column, Ginia Bellafante visited Marcus Garvey Village in Brownsville, Brooklyn. The 1970s complex was meant to show that low-rise development would reduce crime in public housing.It went on to prove the opposite. Below is a selection of reader responses from nytimes.com.I LIVED THROUGH THE '70Sas a teen and recall reading about these revolutionary housing concepts in the newspapers. I sup-pose city leaders were driven by a desire to help. 
But the pseudo-scientific social research that came up with terms like ''defensible space'' had no scientific back-ground. It was just the brain child of a hubristic city planner whose ideas went unchecked. Unfortunately, it coincided with the rise of the crack epidemic in the late '70sand '80s. And this architecture formed a perfect cocoon to incubate the drug gangs. COMMON SENSE, NEW YORK HIGH RISE, LOW RISE,it doesn't matter. Water (crime) will find away to flow through even a crack if it needs a place to go. It goes to demonstrate that society cannot outpace or eliminate criminality simply with architectural design,so to speak. That was, I believe,simplistic thinking but it also predated the drug-selling era.ROUGHINIT, SEOUL, KOREAIT'S NOT A QUESTION of low- or high-rise; lack of economic and cultural diversity is the problem.Forcing poor blacks (or poor whites, for that matter) into urban/suburban reservations and depriving them of a meaningful role in civic society has reaped nothing but misery and despair for generations. OTB, CHICAGO, ILNO ONE IS FORCING people to live in what you describe as ''urban/suburban reservations.'' How about obtaining employment, having kids only if you can afford them, and renting or purchasing a home outside the ''reservation?''RICHARD CARDINALE, BROOKLYN, NYI GREW UP DECADES AGO in a city housing project in Flushing. It was back then a civilized, well-maintained, safe atmosphere,populated for the most part by white, working-class intact families. It's tempting to focus blame on the influx of poor people of col-or for the steady deterioration of public housing sites into the dangerous horror they've become,but the real causes of this inhuman descent are intractable poverty, demographic South to North migrations, gradual family disintegration and destruction of communal values, drugs, the rise of gangs, rampant violence, and the reactionary, woefully inept response of authorities to this crisis,in most respects cracking down hard, and in the process stealing the dignity and hope of residents.STONECUTTER, BROWARD COUNTY,FLORIDAI THINK THE AUTHOR of this article (as well as the architects/planners mentioned and some of those posting comments, as well) greatly misunderstand what Oscar Newman wrote in ''Defensible Space.''Newman's most famous study compared two NYCHA housing projects across the street from each other. One was a high-rise,one was a low-rise, and both were run by NYCHA and had tenants drawn from the same pool. The housing police kept amazingly detailed statistics as to crime, so he was able to plot where crimes occurred, etc. So it was a good natural experiment.In his studies he basically found that residents had a harder time defending themselves in high-rises. Especially problematic were elevators, double-loaded corridors, scissor stairs and building shaving many apts per entrance.The explanations were commonsense. Scissor stairs provide great hiding places for criminals, for in-stance.Newman did not say/imply that any low-rise development is going to be defensible/safe, etc. In fact,in one of his books, I forget which,he discusses unsafe low-rise developments & details approaches for making them safe too. He is not saying that physical design prevents crime, only that certain designs make it easier/harder for criminals/crime.BENJAMIN HEMRIC, NEW YORK, NY

HEADLINE: U.S. Helps Allies Trying to Battle Iranian Hackers

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has begun helping Middle Eastern allies build up their defenses against Iran's growing arsenal of cyberweapons, and will be doing the same in Asia to contain computer-network attacks from North Korea, according to senior American officials.
The American officials would not say which countries in the Persian Gulf have signed up for help in countering Iran's computer abilities. But the list, some officials say, includes the nations that have been the most active in tracking Iranian arms shipments, intercepting them in ports and providing intelligence to the United States about Iranian actions. The three most active in that arena are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
In Asia, the countries most worried about being struck by North Korean computer attacks are South Korea and Japan.
The Defense Department's assertive new effort in the gulf and Asia is the latest example of how the Obama administration is increasingly tailoring its national security efforts for a new era of digital conflict, in this case assuring the defense of computer networks and, if necessary, striking back against assaults. 
A directive signed by the president that surfaced Friday -- the third in a series of leaked documents published by the newspapers The Guardian and The Washington Post -- underscored how the Obama administration is trying to prepare itself and its allies. The leaks also revealed how the Obama administration has put in place a large Internet surveillance operation to identify terrorism threats.
The presidential directive included the declaration that the United States reserved the right to take ''anticipatory action'' against ''imminent threats,'' a reference, it seemed, to the kind of crippling infrastructure attacks that Iran appears to be working on against American and allied targets.
The new help for strengthening computer-network defenses for allies, which has not been publicly announced, closely parallels earlier efforts by the Obama administration in two volatile parts of the world. In recent years it has helped install advanced missile-defense systems and early-warning radars in Persian Gulf nations to counter Iran's missile ability, and it has done something similar in Asia in response to North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
But deterring cyberattacks is a far more complex problem, and American officials concede that this effort, which will include providing computer hardware and software and training to allies, is an experiment. It has been propelled by two high-profile attacks in the past year. One was against Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest, state-run oil producer, and according to American officials it was carried out by Iran. That attack crippled 30,000 computers but did not succeed in halting production. The other, an attack on South Korea's banking and media companies this spring, was later attributed to North Korea. It froze the ability of several banks to operate for days.
''The Iranian attack on the Saudis was a real wake-up call in the region,'' said one senior administration official, who would not speak on the record about the American efforts to counter Iran. ''It made everyone realize that while the Iranians might think twice about launching a missile attack in the region, they see cyber as a potent way to lash out in response to sanctions.''
The administration is capitalizing on the fear created by those attacks to build on the de facto alliance against Iran that it has constructed in the region. The Pentagon is drawing up proposals for providing advanced hardware and software for computer-network defense that could be sold throughout the Persian Gulf, much as American aircraft and missiles are sold to Arab allies. Training programs are being put together to teach computer security to military and law enforcement in the region, and to collaborate with private companies.
And, just as the Pentagon conducts naval exercises in the Persian Gulf to practice ways of keeping the Strait of Hormuz open, officials say future joint war games would include simulated cyberattacks, similar to the one Iran conducted against Saudi Aramco.
The idea is to give American and allied forces practice carrying out their missions with their networks under duress, officials said.
The new interagency effort in Washington comes at a time when Israeli and American intelligence officials have been concerned by Iran's swift advances in its computer weaponry, particularly its ability to disrupt existing infrastructure. As one former senior American military commander said recently, ''They have startled everyone with the speed at which their capabilities have increased.''
But one continuing point of dispute is whether Iran and North Korea are working together on the development of cyberweapons, the way they have worked together for years on the development of missile technology.
A senior Israeli military official said Israel had evidence that Iran and North Korea were beginning to collaborate on developing cyberweapons. He declined to cite the specific evidence.
Although there is concern in Washington that cooperation between Iran and North Korea could spread to computer tools, American officials say there is no proof of such collaboration.
A senior Defense Department official said the program to develop computer skills among allies would focus solely on defending against disruptive and destructive attacks on networks for the military and critical infrastructure. The United States will not share its growing arsenal of offensive cyberweapons, which, like nuclear arms, can be deployed only on presidential order.
Those have been used in only one major case: the American and Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear enrichment system, part of a covert program called Olympic Games that delayed, but ultimately failed to destroy, Iran's nuclear ability.
Officials pledge that computer hardware and software eventually provided to allied nations will be evaluated to avoid providing the type of defensive systems that also can be used for domestic surveillance or to punish political opponents.
This new focus on adding computer-warfare skills to a global effort the Pentagon calls ''building partner capacity'' -- and usually refers to more traditional training of conventional forces -- is another indication of the high level of concern in Washington about the growing danger of computer-network attacks from Iran or North Korea.
After the attacks on energy firms in the Persian Gulf, ''we recognized that we really need to bolster our working relationships with key allies in the region,'' said one senior Defense Department official. ''We made a very conscious strategy decision to make that a priority, both in the gulf and also in Asia.''
Iran, in particular, is viewed as having greatly accelerated its computer efforts. The advancements appear to be the result of carefully focusing the work of a domestic computer sciences and hacking community.
The emerging Iranian program is far more disciplined and mature than Tehran's previous efforts, which had focused on social media to coax American military personnel based in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region to sign up for dating and travel services, or chat rooms. The goal was to obtain the online information from American military personnel to find back doors into military computer systems.
In addition, American officials say Iran now is believed to be hiring foreign computer programmers associated with Internet criminal activity, some from Russia.
And, perhaps most worrisome, Iran and other nations now are able to purchase powerful malware that, while costly, is available on the black and gray markets -- and can quickly advance the potency of a nation's destructive ability across computer networks.
In the rankings of computer powers, Iran and North Korea are far lower in ability than the United States, Israel, Britain, Russia and China.
China and Russia, however, have strong incentives to limit the destructiveness of their attacks; they are so tied into the global economy that anything truly disruptive to financial or energy markets would backfire. But North Korea and Iran, especially in times of rising tensions, would be less prone to show restraint, American officials say.

HEADLINE: Looking Down on the Empire State

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Not since builders stuck a dirigible mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, eclipsing the Chrysler Building as the world's tallest tower, have developers been engaged in the type of skyscraper war that New York City is now witnessing.
But unlike the rivalries of the early 20th century, when buildings pierced the clouds to house corporate headquarters, this one involves no fewer than three alpine condominiums with penthouses on the 90th floor and higher, which are being built to woo big-spending American hedge funders, Chinese magnates and Russian oligarchs. Two of them will rise above the 1,250-foot-high Empire State Building, by 300 feet and 146 feet, respectively (although the Empire State Building officially tops off at 1,454 feet when its lighting rod is included).
Constructing the world's tallest towers is not for the faint of heart, and for modern-day building barons it might be the ultimate statement of ego. Call it an edifice complex, and think Donald J. Trump, whose name is plastered across his properties (and who in fact held the record for tallest residential building for a decade until recently). 
New York is a business town, however, and for developers, economics play as big a role as their desire to leave a mark on the skyline. ''It is really an economic proposition, a business plan that has to have logic behind it,'' said Carol Willis, the founder and director of the Skyscraper Museum. ''This is not some irrational fad.''
So while the marketing for these towers might have you believe that it's all about which living room can reach farthest into the sky, the reality is more nuanced. For a skyscraper project to succeed, many pieces of the development puzzle have to fall perfectly into place.
There is the often arduous and lengthy process of buying up air rights -- or unused development rights -- from adjacent properties; borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars in financing; and engineering architecturally unique structures that can rise 90 stories or more. The construction, meanwhile, includes costly techniques to prevent the towers from swaying in the wind, and thicker support walls and columns that can scuttle some layout plans. Then there is the pure physicality of hoisting materials and laborers 1,000 feet into the air, sometimes creating safety hazards and delays.
Considering these complexities, and the fact that the real estate market is just now recovering from one of its biggest crashes in decades, the pace of this skyscraper competition is breathtaking. Trump World Tower, opening in 2001 at 861 feet high -- its black edifice looming above the East River on First Avenue -- held the title of city's tallest residential building until 2011, with the opening of 8 Spruce Street, the 870-foot undulating rental building at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. Since then, developers have begun six separate projects that will shatter 8 Spruce's record.
And even those that don't quite break that record are marketing their height as a selling point. At 56 Leonard Street, for example, the Herzog & De Meuron-designed condominium is just 821 feet in height, but it has made much of the fact it will be the tallest residential building in TriBeCa, charging as much as $50 million for a penthouse. The competition is even spreading beyond Manhattan, with the tallest tower in Queens, a 50-story condominium in Long Island City, now under way.
It is not surprising that in a city known for its outsized personalities, many of these projects involve New York's most conspicuous developers. Harry B. Macklowe, for example, is developing 432 Park Avenue, the 96-story condominium in Midtown that, at 1,396 feet, will be the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere when it is completed in 2015. Best known for his buccaneering style, Mr. Macklowe is a poster child for the last real estate boom and bust, mostly because at the cycle's pinnacle in 2007, he spent an astounding $7 billion to acquire seven Midtown towers, only to lose them in the crash.
Mr. Macklowe began envisioning 432 Park in 2006, when he bought the former Drake Hotel. But he loaded the property with debt and was soon facing foreclosure. CIM Group, a private equity firm, eventually stepped in to save him, although he remains a co-developer. More than one-third of the units are now in contract for nearly $1 billion in potential sales, including a $95 million penthouse that could set a price record if it closes.
Seemingly a success, 432 Park has faced its challenges, said Mr. Macklowe recently during an interview at the condominium's sales office; he was dressed in a tailored navy suit. ''It looks easy,'' he said, ''but that is like seeing Ted Williams or Joe DiMaggio hit a home run and saying it looks easy.''
The sales office, on the 21st floor of the GM Building on Fifth Avenue, sits 100 feet shy of the lowest floors of 432 Park's condominium residences, giving potential buyers just a hint of the views to come. But the housing of the sales office there was in some ways a curious choice. In 2003, Mr. Macklowe broke a record in buying the GM Building for $1.4 billion, then used it as collateral on that spectacular $7 billion real estate bet that soured; he rents his offices there.
Where Mr. Macklowe is brash -- he performed in the Off Broadway show ''Old Jews Telling Jokes'' and sometimes reverts to a period accent while telling stories -- Gary Barnett, the developer of the tower that may eventually eclipse 432 Park for the Western Hemisphere record, is understated.
Mr. Barnett is by some measures the city's most active developer. Indeed One57, the 90-story, 1,004-foot-tall tower he is building at 157 West 57th Street, was to have taken the hemisphere record until it was supplanted by 432 Park. But he may yet reclaim the title with his planned 227 West 57th. Just west of One57, the tower has enough air rights to rise 1,550 feet; a feature will be the city's first Nordstrom department store.
Born Gershon Swiatycki on the Lower East Side, Mr. Barnett, an Orthodox Jew who has 10 children, has always been a mercurial character in New York real estate circles. Formerly a diamond trader in Belgium, he rose to prominence in 2005, when he unsuccessfully challenged Bruce Ratner with a rival bid for Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. A key to his success has been his quiet ability to amass large parcels from individual property owners in prime Manhattan locations. The process can take years, and requires slow and deliberate strategizing. For One57, for example, Mr. Barnett began buying the air rights some 16 years ago.
''Building tall is not about bragging rights,'' he said recently, during a conversation in the nondescript conference room of his offices on Third Avenue; he was wearing slacks and a mock turtleneck. ''What drives the building is design, the views, the economics.'' He built One57 to its full height ''because we couldn't get in all the air rights any other way -- once you have it, the ability to build it, I didn't want to just throw it away.''
Still, deciding a building's height is a judgment call, and ''there have been times that I had air rights but I didn't end up using them,'' he said. Extreme height adds time and uncertainty to a project, as well as construction costs. One57, for instance, was waylaid when Hurricane Sandy snapped off a crane boom and left it dangling far above the street. Mr. Barnett is weighing these considerations for his Nordstrom property, he said, and said he may choose to forego the full 1,550 feet.
Perhaps the biggest factor in determining height is the views. As Ms. Willis put it, ''Views are the reason to capitalize on the sky -- they are the thing that allows you to ask very high prices.'' And the most desirable views in New York are of Central Park, which is one reason many of these towers are clustered in and around 57th Street.
Zoning in Midtown also helps, since it can allow for extremely tall buildings. In the case of 432 Park, for example, the floor plate was 8,500 square feet and Mr. Macklowe had some 500,000 square feet to utilize. ''So the height was just a matter of arithmetic,'' he said.
''We didn't start out by saying we wanted to build the tallest residential building in Manhattan,'' he added, ''but as we got there, and saw it was within the zoning, we went for it. It was only later that we recognized the significance of using this as a tag line.''
''It isn't as if tall towers are some great statement of testosterone, or some masculine symbol,'' summarized MaryAnne Gilmartin, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, which developed 8 Spruce. ''It has been proven time and again that height and views are one of the great attributes of city living. If you can live in the sky, then why not?''

HEADLINE: Divisions Aside, U.S. and China Moving Closer

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. -- Even as they pledged to build ''a new model'' of relations, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China ended two days of informal meetings here on Saturday moving closer on pressuring a nuclear North Korea and addressing climate change, but remaining sharply divided over cyberespionage and other issues that have divided the countries for years.
Although the leaders of the world's two biggest powers made no public statements on their second day of talks, their disagreements -- over cyberattacks as well as arms sales to Taiwan, maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and manipulation of the Chinese currency -- spilled into the open when senior officials from both countries emerged to describe the meetings in detail.
From the outset, the White House said the purpose of the meetings here was not to announce new deals or understandings -- ''deliverables,'' in diplomatic parlance -- but to create a more comfortable relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi, who took full power in March, that could avoid plunging the two nations into escalating conflict. 
Even so, the White House announced that the two countries had reached at least one concrete accord that environmentalists welcomed as a potential step in combating climate change. China and the United States agreed to discuss ways to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, known as HFCs, that are used in refrigerants and insulating foams.
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, one of several senior Democrats who urged Mr. Obama to raise the issue in these talks, praised the announcement. ''A global phase-down of HFCs would eliminate more heat-trapping gases by 2050 than the United States emits in an entire decade,'' he said in a statement.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi also found areas of agreement over North Korea, which under pressure from China has muted a flurry of belligerent statements after nuclear and missile tests this year. After suspending nearly all contact with South Korea, the North has in recent weeks reversed course, and on Sunday officials of the two countries are to meet at a border village to arrange the first cabinet minister-level meeting in six years.
Mr. Obama's administration has welcomed China's new assertiveness with its neighbor and ally, believing that it reflects a new calculation that a constant state of crisis on the Korean Peninsula is destabilizing for the Chinese as well. The two presidents held a long discussion on North Korea over what Tom Donilon, Mr. Obama's departing national security adviser, called ''a very lively dinner'' on Friday, and he said that they agreed that dealing with the country's nuclear arsenal was a promising arena for ''enhanced cooperation.''
''They agreed that North Korea has to denuclearize, that neither country will accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state'' and that their two nations would work together to achieve that through pressure on Pyongyang, Mr. Donilon said.
The two presidents met for nearly eight hours beginning Friday evening, and appeared eager to redefine the relationship in a way that would allow their countries to overcome their economic, political and diplomatic differences, rather than letting new -- or old -- crises derail progress across the spectrum of issues.
On the most contentious issue in recent months -- American accusations that Chinese corporations linked to the military had pilfered military and economic secrets and property in cyberspace -- the officials seemed to speak past each other. That dominated Saturday's talks here at a secluded estate, but ended without a clear acknowledgment by Mr. Xi of any culpability.
China's state councilor, Yang Jiechi, said China strongly opposed hacking and cyberespionage and was itself a victim, while Mr. Donilon warned that the threat from China threatened to constrain the spirit of partnership Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi publicly declared they wanted.
Mr. Obama warned that if the hacking continued, Mr. Donilon said, it ''was going to be a very difficult problem in the economic relationship.''
In remarks during a joint appearance on Friday night, Mr. Obama at least publicly softened his language and spread the blame for the hacking and theft of business, financial and military information. ''Those are not issues that are unique to the U.S.-China relationship,'' the president said. ''Those are issues that are of international concern. Oftentimes it's nonstate actors who are engaging in these issues as well.''
He added, ''We're going to have to work very hard to build a system of defenses and protections, both in the private sector and in the public sector, even as we negotiate with other countries around setting up common rules of the road.'' And, Mr. Obama said, China would face similar threats as its economy develops -- Mr. Xi suggested it already had -- ''which is why I believe we can work together on this rather than at cross-purposes.''
Secretary of State John Kerry, who attended the meetings, has previously announced that the two countries would discuss the matter as part of the annual meetings known as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, to be held in Washington in July.
Mr. Yang said that the two discussed a host of contentious issues and ''did not shy away from differences.'' Mr. Xi called on the United States to end its arms sales to Taiwan, he said, and reasserted its territorial claims, while pledging to resolve them peacefully. Mr. Yang also defended China's control of its currency and said it was not the core trade issue between them.
Broadly, though, both leaders urged cooperation, not conflict. Mr. Obama called for joint efforts to address climate change, including through sharing clean-energy technologies, and to establish better military communications so ''that we each understand our strategic objectives at the military as well as the political levels.''
Mr. Xi agreed. ''China and the United States must find a new path,'' he said, ''one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past.''
The Chinese president, who as a young man lived for a time with a family in Iowa and visited again during a trip to the United States last year as vice president, said he and Mr. Obama would keep ''close communication'' through letters, phone calls, bilateral meetings and visits, adding, ''I invited President Obama to come to China at an appropriate time for a similar meeting like this.''
''Both sides have the political will to build this relationship,'' Mr. Xi said.
For all the advance talk of the informality of the meetings, they largely followed well-established diplomatic routine, and the necessary translations limited spontaneity. The two leaders sat opposite each other at a conference table, flanked by their senior aides and interpreters. When they appeared before journalists, briefly, they selected one American and one Chinese reporter to ask a question each. According to White House officials, they then continued their discussion until 10:44 p.m. over a dinner that lasted almost two hours -- including lobster tamales, porterhouse steak and cherry pie, prepared on site by the celebrity chef Bobby Flay.
Mr. Obama stayed overnight at the Sunnylands retreat, a 25,000-square-foot Modernist mansion that was the winter oasis of the billionaire publisher and Republican patron Walter H. Annenberg, but the Chinese party chose to stay at a nearby hotel.
After breakfast on Saturday, the two presidents resumed discussions. They emerged first from the main house at Sunnylands and strolled across a bucolic expanse of grass and over a pedestrian bridge with the San Jacinto Mountains as a spectacular backdrop. Wearing shirts open at the neck and no jackets, they were accompanied only by their interpreters, and their discussion could not be discerned.
While their talks on Friday evening delved into security and geopolitical issues, the meetings on Saturday focused on economic and trade issues.
Mr. Obama, Mr. Xi and their all-male attendants forsook ties, which was just as well, since the room at the Annenberg estate where they met seemed uncomfortably hot at times. But perhaps understandably, given the personalities of both leaders, there was little sign of backslapping bonhomie in what administration officials had advertised as an ''unscripted'' setting.
After the talks ended on Saturday, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi had tea with Mr. Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan, a famed singer and major general, and Madame Ni, the wife of the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations. The Chinese delegation left the retreat about noon. For Mr. Xi, it ended a trip that last week had him in Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Mexico -- another sign of Beijing's global ambitions and search for new energy sources.
Mr. Obama planned to stay another night at Sunnylands. After Mr. Xi's departure, he golfed on the estate's nine-hole course -- one Republican presidents since Dwight D. Eisenhower have played -- with three friends from his high-school days in Hawaii, despite temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.

HEADLINE: Emirates Balk At Activism In Region Hit By Uprisings

BYLINE: By BEN HUBBARD

 BODY:
RAS AL KHAYMAH, United Arab Emirates -- The white mosque, soccer field and wedding hall are still there.
But Islah, the Islamist group that once ran the social complex at the entrance to this city, is all but gone.
Its entire board has been replaced by government decree, scores of its members have been put on trial and even its name has been changed.
The government of the United Arab Emirates has moved aggressively to shut it down, charging 94 of its members with conspiring with another Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, to overthrow the government. The defendants, facing up to 15 years in prison, include prominent jurists, academics, even relatives of one of this country's royal families, who say they were not looking to overthrow the leadership, but asking for democratic reform and a more Islamic government.
''It's a social organization, not political or economic, and it worked with the people for the goal of preserving the Emirates as a Muslim country with an Arab character,'' said Khalid Alroken, whose brother is a prominent lawyer and among those on trial. ''The authorities saw our activities as the first link in a chain towards toppling the government and weakening the state.'' 
For the Emirates, the case is unprecedented in the gravity of the charges and the prominence of the defendants. But it is also part of a broader trend in the region, where kingdoms that dodged the calls for democracy that inspired the Arab Spring have moved aggressively to stamp out hints of political activism.
The Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf have long used petrodollars to placate calls for political change, and are once again relying on the threat of prison to silence dissent. In Qatar, a poet was sentenced in February to 15 years for a subversive poem. Saudi Arabia has suppressed protests by its Shiite minority and prosecuted rights activists.
The case in the Emirates -- a federation of seven dynasties that has rocketed to prosperity thanks to vast oil wealth and business-friendly policies -- is perhaps the most sweeping, where the government is trying to quash calls for change among Islamists and others. All three countries are American allies, important as oil suppliers and as regional counterweights to Iran.
Even while calling for reforms elsewhere, the United States has largely remained silent on the gulf monarchies' profoundly undemocratic governments, and few observers believe their leaders will voluntarily share control.
''I see no reason these governments are going to willingly take significant steps by themselves to open their systems and hand power to someone else, be it a parliament or whomever,'' said David Roberts, director of the Qatar office of the Royal United Services Institute, a research group based in London.
The crackdown began in 2011 after the start of the Arab uprisings. There were no protests in the Emirates, and in March 2011 the government announced $1.6 billion in infrastructure projects for less developed areas, widely seen as part of an effort to avert discontent.
That month, more than 130 activists, including academics and a few dozen Islah members, submitted a petition to the ruling sheiks calling for Parliament, controlled by the sheiks, to be freely elected and given full legislative powers. A month later, five prominent activists and government critics, most of whom had not signed the petition, were arrested and tried on charges of insulting the rulers. All got prison terms but were pardoned the next day.
The most prominent, Ahmed Mansoor, says that since then he has been beaten up twice, his car has been stolen and about $140,000 has disappeared from his personal bank account. He accuses the government of trying to intimidate him and says it refuses to return his passport. The government has not commented on his case, but says it uses legal means to uphold stability.
In mid-2011, the crackdown turned to Islah, which had operated legally in the country since 1974. In 1994, its headquarters in Dubai were shut down, so the group's leaders moved here to Ras al Khaymah.
But starting in 2011, seven of its members were stripped of citizenship and scores were arrested, many held incommunicado for months without charge, according to Human Rights Watch and family members. The government dismantled the group, changing its name and appointing a new board.
The arrests mounted, including, in April 2012, that of Sultan bin Kayed al-Qassemi, Islah's chairman and a cousin of the ruler of Ras al Khaymah.
Finally, in January, the attorney general said why. The detained, he said in a statement, ''launched, established and ran an organization seeking to oppose the basic principles of the U.A.E. system of governance and to seize power.''
At first glance, the Emirates appear an unlikely home for an Islamist revival. Its leaders have used wealth, economic openness and foreign labor to become a regional hub. The nation is a top importer of American goods, and its ports host many American Navy ships.
But political openness has not followed. Political parties are banned, and most citizens cannot vote. Half of Parliament is appointed by the ruling sheiks; the other half is elected by a body chosen by those sheiks.
''We are not a democratic country, but we are progressive on various issues, on women and on what I would call tolerance,'' said Anwar Gargash, minister of state for foreign affairs. The government emphasizes prosperity over political development, he said, adding, ''We think 20 percent politics/80 percent development, and I think that is healthy.''
Many Emiratis agree, and fear that groups like Islah threaten a stability that has made their country of 5.5 million wealthy, safe and peaceful.
''It is apolitical, and that is why this country works,'' said Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi, a writer. ''It is a political Islamist-free zone. We don't want your political Islam here. Go mess up another country.''
But the rush toward modernization has set off a debate about identity, with many asking what it means to be Emirati in a country just 42 years old, where foreigners outnumber locals four to one.
One vision is Dubai, the nation's largest city, where locals are rare, alcohol is widespread and women in miniskirts flirt with men in public. The competing view, advocated by Islah, is prevalent in the less affluent northern emirates where traditional social codes prevail.
Many from the latter group believe the Emirates have changed for the worse. ''There used to be alcohol, but not like now,'' said Mr. Alroken, whose brother is on trial. ''There used to be prostitution, but not like now. And we didn't have beaches where the women are almost naked. Islah says we need to protect the society by preserving its Islamic, religious principles.''
But this is the kind of talk that the leadership will not tolerate. It is perhaps paradoxical that the uncertainty, and in some cases chaos and war, that followed the Arab Spring has increased support for the government's view.
''I worry that a democratic transition in this period for a state like the U.A.E. would put us in the throes of reactionary conservatism, probably for the next 30 or 40 years,'' said Mishaal Al Gergawi, a political analyst. ''I look at what is happening in Egypt and other places, and I wonder, do I need that kind of transition?''
The verdict is expected on July 2.

HEADLINE: As Home Sales Heat Up Again, Buyers Must Resort to Cold Cash

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Bidding wars sound almost quaint. These days, the only way for would-be buyers to secure a home, it often seems, is to offer all cash and be ready to do so within hours, not days.
The bursting of last decade's housing bubble feels like ancient history here, where first-time home buyers are competing with investors to get into single-family homes with prices approaching $1 million.
''It's everyone from a kid out of law school to an investor from China, walking around with thousands to spend,'' said Kameron Eliassian, a Los Angeles real estate agent. ''I don't know where it's coming from, and I don't care. Just show me proof that it's there, and we're good.''
After saving money for years, waiting for the residential real estate market to hit bottom, buyers all over the country appear eager to get back in, lured by low interest rates and the prospect of a good deal. 
But with the number of homes for sale at historically low levels and large investors purchasing thousands of properties, buyers are facing a radically changed market and prices are quickly rising.
The percentage of homes bought with cash has shot up in many markets across the nation. Nearly a third of all homes purchased in Los Angeles during the first quarter of this year went for all cash, compared with just 7 percent in 2007. In Miami, 65 percent of homes sold were for cash deals, compared with 16 percent six years ago.
The prices on all-cash deals are also rising significantly. In Los Angeles, the median price on an all-cash home this year is about $351,000, compared with $230,000 in 2009. Over the same period, the median price over all increased to $410,000, up $85,000. In fact, last month, home prices in Southern California hit their highest level in the last five years.
All-cash buyers, typically investors eager to renovate and quickly resell or rent out homes, are making it more difficult for first-time buyers, who typically rely on mortgage loans that can take weeks or months to materialize. More California homes have been flipped in the last year than in any year since 2005.
And while Los Angeles may be a center of the frenzy, it is not an anomaly. Buyers in Boston are offering $100,000 more than the asking price or placing offers on homes they have spent only minutes in. In San Francisco, Miami and Phoenix, sellers are looking at dozens of offers within days of putting their home on the market, often accompanied by letters from would-be buyers professing their love for the property. New York City has seen similar drops in inventory, and prices have been rising steadily since 2009.
Shortly after Andres Alvarez, 36, got married last fall, he began to look for a home with his wife, figuring that their steady jobs, savings and good credit would make them the perfect buyers in Los Angeles. They were ready to spend $700,000. Their optimism deflated quickly.
''We thought we were the cream of the crop, but anything that was in our price range and move-in ready, there was this insane competition,'' Mr. Alvarez said. They put in nearly a dozen bids, often losing to cash buyers, before finding a two-bedroom home for $650,000. ''It might be a great time to buy, but it's a horrible time to be a buyer,'' he said.
Dick and Susan Yost can vouch for that. They wanted to downsize while leaving their home in Cambridge, Mass., to their son and his family. ''We bid on eight places before we finally got one,'' Mr. Yost said. ''The worst we bid was $85,000 over the asking price, and we didn't get it.''
Even unappealing homes, he said, had ''people all over them.''
Still, there are plenty of skeptics wondering how long the sharp price increases can last.
''People are realizing we've probably hit bottom, but the kinds of spikes we're seeing in places like California seems like history is repeating itself,'' said Daren Blomquist of RealtyTrac, which monitors residential sales. ''That's not sustainable for the long term, at least not for the regular home buyer, so I think there are some warning flags there.''
For agents who spent the last several years scrounging for business, the change is welcome. When Mr. Eliassian listed a three-bedroom home in the Hollywood Hills for $699,000 this year, he worried that the current renters would make it difficult to schedule prospective buyers. But with just two open houses -- one meant only for other agents -- nearly 300 people came through.
''I had to turn the phone off to avoid people asking to see the place,'' Mr. Eliassian said.
Within the week, he had six offers, and the home sold for $745,000. He said he had represented and sold homes to more cash buyers in the last year than at any other time in his career.
Lewis Legon, a developer in Salem, Mass., jumped into the Boston market after he saw how many people were showing up at open houses. ''It was like Times Square,'' he said of one open house, at a property listed for $1.5 million. He beat out two dozen other bidders by offering $1.8 million in cash, not the first time he had made an all-cash offer.
''The first time I was ready to have a heart attack,'' he said of all-cash buy. ''But it makes you a more attractive buyer and helps you stand out.''
He also waived the inspection clause, an increasingly common practice. While offers have typically included appraisal clauses, allowing buyers to back out if the home was valued below what they were willing to pay, offers today are more likely to include escalation clauses, saying buyers will pay an additional amount over the highest bid.
''Buyers are taking a lot more risks than they ever would before,'' said Dana DeSimone, a Boston real estate agent who called the current market an ''insane asylum.'' ''I don't know that I've ever heard of waiving the inspection contingency on a 150-year-old brownstone until now.''
Now, agents say their biggest challenge is potential sellers who are wary of putting their home on the market because they fear they cannot find a place to buy.
Jeff and Lorena Leininger considered moving from their suburban Los Angeles home over the last several years, but they feared they would not get as much as they paid for it. But this year, with their youngest child getting ready for kindergarten, they decided it was time. Three days after showing the home, they had nine offers.
''It felt as crazy as it was back when we bought 10 years ago,'' Mr. Leininger said. ''But it was much worse on the other side. We would show up to an open house, and it was already sold. The clear message was: be ready to move fast or just get left out.''
Even in Florida, where the market was once swamped with foreclosures, there are signs of the latest boom, with cash purchases fueled in part by international investors and retirees awash in cash after selling their homes elsewhere.
Don Faught, a manager with Alain Pinel Realtors near San Francisco, said the current market is turning buyers to desperation, particularly because the turnaround has come so quickly.
''A year ago, people didn't want a deal, they wanted a steal,'' he said. ''Sellers were listing homes for less than what they originally paid for them and offering all these concessions. Now, the only concessions are coming from the buyers.''
His office has begun to track the number of offers clients make before landing a property. The current record: 27 offers, nearly all at or above asking price.

HEADLINE: When Presidential Words Led to Swift Action

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- These days it is hard to imagine a single presidential speech changing history.
But two speeches, given back to back by President John F. Kennedy 50 years ago this week, are now viewed as critical turning points on the transcendent issues of the last century.
The speeches, which came on consecutive days, took political risks. They sought to shift the nation's thinking on the ''inevitability'' of war with the Soviet Union and to make urgent the ''moral crisis'' of civil rights. Beyond their considerable impact on American minds, these two speeches had something in common that oratory now often misses. They both led quickly and directly to important changes.
On Monday, June 10, 1963, Kennedy announced new talks to try to curb nuclear tests, signaling a decrease in tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Speaking at American University's morning commencement, he urged new approaches to the cold war, saying, ''And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity.''
''In the final analysis,'' he continued, ''our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.'' 
The next evening, Kennedy gave an address on national television, sketching out a strong civil rights bill he promised to send to Congress. For the first time, a president made a moral case against segregation. He had previously argued publicly for obedience to court orders and had condemned violence, but not the underlying system.
''We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution,'' Kennedy said. ''The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.''
Action followed. An agreement to establish a hot line between Washington and Moscow came in a few days, and a limited nuclear test ban treaty in four months. In just over a year, the 1964 Civil Rights Act became the most important American law of the 20th century. Kennedy, of course, did not live to see the comprehensive civil rights legislation, a crowning achievement of his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Republican leaders like Representative William M. McCulloch of Ohio and Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois.
Robert Dallek, Kennedy's leading biographer, said the two speeches were ''not just two of his best speeches, but two of the better presidential speeches of the 20th century.''
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania and a scholar of political discourse, said the two ''compelling'' speeches invited the country ''to see the world differently, expanding our concept of basic rights and propelling action vindicated by history.''
They are underappreciated as oratory, she said, because neither had a ''simple central phrase'' like ''Ich bin ein Berliner,'' which Kennedy said later that month, or ''Ask not what your country can do for you,'' from his inaugural address.
Though Theodore C. Sorensen, the president's main speechwriter, was the principal writer of both speeches, they were prepared in very different ways.
The American University speech was a month in the making, growing out of Kennedy's sense that if some progress on controlling arms was to be made, it had to happen in 1963, not in the election year of 1964, and from signals from the Kremlin that new talks might be productive. But it was kept secret from the Pentagon, because of fears that generals might object to any steps toward conciliation.
In contrast, the civil rights speech was written in a few hours and was almost not given.
Mr. Dallek said the American University speech reflected Kennedy's ''real passion'' about his presidency, the goal of building ''not merely peace in our time but peace for all time,'' as Kennedy put it that morning.
To achieve it, Kennedy said, it was necessary to ''examine our attitude toward peace itself.''
''Too many of us think it is impossible,'' Kennedy said. ''Too many think it unreal. But that is a dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable -- that mankind is doomed -- that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.
''We need not accept that view. Our problems are man-made -- therefore, they can be solved by man.''
Another step was to ''re-examine our attitude toward the Soviet Union.''
He said that while it was ''sad'' to read Soviet propaganda insisting that the United States was planning many wars so it could dominate the world, ''it is also a warning -- a warning to the American people not to fall into the same trap as the Soviets, not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats.''
He said Americans should understand that ''no government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements -- in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of courage.''
Reminding his audience that at least 20 million Soviet citizens died in World War II, Kennedy said, ''Among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have in common, none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of war.''
''Today, should total war ever break out again -- no matter how -- our two countries would become the primary targets. It is an ironic but accurate fact that the two strongest powers are the two in the most danger of devastation. All we have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the first 24 hours.''
On June 11, Kennedy had planned to speak about civil rights if there was trouble in Tuscaloosa, Ala., where Gov. George C. Wallace had vowed to stand in the way to prevent the integration of the University of Alabama. But Wallace simply made a statement and then stepped aside, and the process went smoothly. The speech seemed unnecessary.
Sorensen, who had labored over the Monday speech, went home, only to be summoned back at midafternoon when the president's brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy persuaded Kennedy to go ahead. Sorensen finished his draft with only minutes to spare, and Kennedy ad-libbed concluding paragraphs.
The president had come to the civil rights issue only ''grudgingly,'' as Mr. Dallek put it. He thought segregation wrong and the Southerners who defended it ''hopeless.'' But for more than two years in the White House, he had treated the issue as a distraction from not only foreign policy but also tough domestic issues like a tax cut to spur the economy. Moreover, Mr. Dallek said, Kennedy and his brother thought the issue would cost him the Southern states he won in 1960 and could bring his defeat in 1964.
Still, by late spring in 1963 the spread of civil rights demonstrations, and the brutality used in Birmingham and elsewhere to suppress them, forced his hand. And while he had fitfully used the word ''moral'' in civil rights statements, he had not made it a cause.
He told the nation: ''One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.''
Kennedy said: ''If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay?''
He was not addressing just the South, or even just Congress. ''It is not enough to pin the blame on others, to say this is a problem of one section of the country or another,'' he said.
''A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all. Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality.''
This ''moral crisis,'' he said, ''cannot be met by repressive police action. It cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the streets. It cannot be quieted by token moves or talk. It is a time to act in the Congress, in your state and local legislative body and, above all, in all of our daily lives.''
In between the two speeches, another critical issue arose. At a busy intersection in South Vietnam's capital, Saigon, a Buddhist monk named Thich Quang Duc set himself on fire. That set off the political developments that led to the ouster and murder of President Ngo Dinh Diem just three weeks before Kennedy's own assassination.

HEADLINE: Fixing the Digital Economy

BYLINE: By JARON LANIER. 
A computer scientist and the author of ''Who Owns the Future?''

 BODY:
TWO big trends in the world appear to contradict each other.
On the one hand, computer networks are said to be disrupting centralized power of all kinds and giving it to the individual. Customers can bring corporations to their knees by tweeting complaints. A tiny organization like WikiLeaks can alarm the great powers with nothing but encryption and net access. Young Egyptians can organize a nearly instant revolution with their mobile phones and the Internet.
But then there's the other trend. Inequality is soaring in rich countries around the world, not just the United States. Money from the top 1 percent has flooded our politics. The job market in America has been hollowed out; unpaid internships are common and ''entry-level'' jobs seem to last a lifetime, while technical and management posts become ever more lucrative. The individual appears to be powerless in the face of tough prospects.
Both trends are real, and they are related. The disruption and decentralization of power coincides with an intense and seemingly unbounded concentration of power. What at first glance looks like a contradiction makes perfect sense once one understands the nature of modern power. 
It isn't clear when the Egyptian revolution will lead to better government in Egypt, but it is already clear that the Arab Spring increased the power and wealth of the networking companies used by Arab activists.
How did we get here? A healthy middle class is essential to both business and politics. Markets cannot function without customers, and government cannot remain democratic if wealth is overly concentrated.
Technological change might sometimes seem to be an automatic threat to the middle class. Operating a motor vehicle is easier than dealing with horses; people love to drive. So why should a truck driver or cabby be paid? People are still needed to do that driving, even if they suffer less than their equestrian forebears did. Unions fought for pay and working conditions that turned driving jobs into middle-class ones. In this century, however, we have forgotten that wisdom and decided that when it comes to digital networks, more and more people will not be paid for what they do even though what they're doing is needed.
Jobs involving communication and expression (music, journalism and so forth) are suddenly much harder to come by, because information is now held to be free. Naturally, a 19th-century trope, the Horatio Alger story, has reappeared. With enough hard work, opportunity is said to be around the corner for young journalists and musicians. Alas, there are only a few genuine success stories. Almost everyone else in the game lives on false hope, accepting the benefits of an informal economy -- reputation and barter -- while helping a small, distant elite build real wealth. Instead of a bell curve, the distribution looks like a razor-thin skyscraper dragging an emaciated ''long tail'' behind it.
The fate of journalism and music awaits every other industry, and every kind of job, unless this pattern is undone. As this century unfolds, technology will continue to evolve. More and more activities will be operated by software. Instead of Teamsters, there will be robotic trucks. Where there had once been miners, there will be mining robots. Instead of factories, there will be 3-D printers in every home. Experimental robots have already outperformed many a white-collar worker, including the legal researcher, the pharmacist and the scientific investigator.
All forms of automation ultimately rely on data that come from people, however. There is no magical ''artificial intelligence.'' When a big, remote computer translates a document from English to Spanish, for instance, it doesn't understand what it is doing. It is only mashing up earlier translations created by real people, who have been forgotten because of the theater of the Internet.
There are always real people behind the curtain. The rise of inequality isn't because of people not being needed -- more precisely, it's because of an illusion that they aren't even there.
DISSECT almost any ascendant center of power, and you'll find a giant computer at the core. In the past, power and influence were gained by controlling something that people needed, like oil or transportation routes. Now to be powerful can mean having the most effective computer on a network. In most cases, this means the biggest and most connected computer, though very occasionally a well-operated small computer can play the game, as is the case with WikiLeaks. Those cases are so rare, however, that we shouldn't fall into the illusion of thinking of computers as great equalizers, like guns in the Wild West.
The new class of ultra-influential computers come in many guises. Some run financial schemes, like high-frequency trading, and others run insurance companies. Some run elections, and others run giant online stores. Some run social network or search services, while others run national intelligence services. The differences are only skin deep. I call this kind of operation a ''Siren Server.''
Siren Servers are usually gigantic facilities, located in obscure places where they have their own power plants and some special hookup to nature, like a remote river, that allows them to cool a fantastic amount of waste heat.
Siren Servers calculate actions for their owners that reduce risks and increase wealth and influence. For instance, before big computers and cheap networking, it was hard for health insurance companies to gather and analyze enough data to be tempted to create a ''perfect'' insurance business, in which only those who need insurance the least are insured. But with a big computer it becomes not only possible, but irresistible.
Giant financial schemes are similarly tempting. It is commonly believed that deregulation motivated financial adventurism, but it can also be argued that Moore's law, which holds that computing becomes better and cheaper at an accelerating rate, guaranteed that sooner or later the temptations of using computation to displace risk would become irresistible.
Financiers caught the seductive whiff of digital perfection in the 1970s. The first major market crash at least partially attributable to automated trading came in 1987. Big computer-centric schemes like those hatched by Long Term Capital Management and Enron, laid down a pattern that continued with the Great Recession of 2007-9.
Since networking got cheap and computers became enormous, the financial sector has grown fantastically in proportion to the rest of the economy, even though it has done so by putting the rest of the economy at increased risk. This is precisely what happens naturally, without any evil plan, when someone has a more effective computer than anyone else in an open network. Your superior calculation ability allows you to choose the least risky options for yourself, leaving riskier options for everyone else. If the economy were infinite, it would be able to absorb the radiated risk. The inevitable massive public bailouts were needed not because the schemes didn't make sense, but because they eventually made impossible demands on the world outside of the scheme.
A hip trope holds that privacy is passé, but the loss of one's privacy to a Siren Server means more than the loss of one's credit card or Social Security number to a petty online thief. An ordinary person's choices in music, friends, purchases, reading material and travels in the course of the day are just some of the streams of data that feed into algorithms that compare and correlate the activities of everyone being spied upon.
The motivation for the omni-ogling is that it leads to effective behavioral models of people. These models are far from perfect, but are good enough to predict and manipulate people gradually, over time, shaping tastes and consumption in more effective and insidious ways than even subliminal advertisements do.
MANIPULATION might take the form of paid links appearing in free online services, an automatically personalized pitch for a candidate in an election or perfectly targeted offers of credit. While people are rarely forced to accept the influence of Siren Servers in any particular case, on a broad statistical basis it becomes impossible for a population to do anything but acquiesce over time. This is why companies like Google are so valuable. While no particular Google ad is guaranteed to work, the overall Google ad scheme by definition must work, because of the laws of statistics. Superior computation lets a Siren Server enjoy the magical benefits of reliably manipulating others even though no hand is forced.
Even friendly, consumer-facing Siren Servers ultimately depend on spreading costs to the larger society. Siren Servers can function profitably only if people aren't paid for the data that is used to calculate their statistical schemes.
Siren Servers drive apart our identities as consumers and workers. In some cases, causality is apparent: free music downloads are great but throw musicians out of work. Free college courses are all the fad, but tenured professorships are disappearing. Free news proliferates, but money for investigative and foreign reporting is drying up. One can easily see this trend extending to the industries of the future, like 3-D printing and renewable energy.
A Siren Server gains influence through self-effacement. There is a Zen quality to it. A big computational-finance scheme is most successful when the proprietors have no idea what they finance. The whole point is to make other people take risks, and knowledge means risk. The new idea is to have no idea whether the security you bundled is fraudulent or not.
YouTube doesn't take responsibility for checking if a video, before it's uploaded, violates a copyright. Facebook isn't culpable if a tormented teenager is driven to suicide.
The point is to be a computational actor -- the more meta, the better -- but without seeming, or behaving like, an actor. The digital pursuit of reward without risk happens automatically, at arm's length. Documents are signed by ''robosigners,'' and prices are set by ''price bots.''
Once this principle is understood, the seeming contradiction -- that power is being more and less concentrated at the same time -- melts away. An old-fashioned exercise in power, like censoring social network expression, would reduce the new kind of power, which is to be a private spying service on people who use social networking.
Indeed, Sirenic schemes often offer an upfront treat. Insanely easy and cheap mortgages; free music, video, Web search and social networking: all are examples of the trinkets dangled to lure initiates into answering the call of a Siren Server.
And yet I am optimistic.
Ted Nelson was the first person, in the 1960s, to describe how people might use digital networks for collaboration or expression. His work foresaw both the problems we face and the potential solutions to them. A Nelsonian solution might look like this: Institute a universal micropayment system. Keep track of where information came from. Pay people when information that exists because they exist turns out to be valuable, no matter what kind of information is involved or whether a person intended to provide it or not. Let the price be determined by markets.
I have become used to eyes rolling. How could such a system ever come about? Would it be too complicated? Would it create barriers for the poor or disadvantaged? Could it really work, or would it just create a new theater of unfairness?
Opportunities for testing new economic ideas are coming along at a rapid pace. For instance, 3-D printing is already a hobbyist craze. People are printing out all varieties of tchotchkes in these magical chambers instead of buying them in stores. Currently, designs for 3-D objects are shared free, in the way that music files are moved around free. Small communities of influential programmers usually set the pattern for how new consumer information services will be used, and the idea that information should be free is deeply entrenched in software culture.
Why not stage an experiment? We techies could set up a trial system in which people pay each other for their printable designs. If it's already too late for 3D printing, other opportunities will come along. We need to experiment; to learn how to nurture a middle class that can thrive even in a highly automated society.
Person-to-person information markets might lead to a simpler and clearer online world. Because our information systems are designed to initially forget who provided information, services like Google and Bing must constantly scrape the global network to reconstitute the context of data. Siren Servers know who links to your data, but you don't.
EVEN today's titanic Siren Servers would benefit from a more monetized information economy, because it would be a healthier-growing economy. The information economy cannot exhibit the long-term growth it ought to if information coming from ordinary people is forever declared to be off the books. (Though I do research for Microsoft, it does not vet my writing and this essay represents only my point of view.)
Skeptics sometimes reveal hidden and unfounded wells of elitism. These surface in comments like: ''Most people wouldn't contribute very much.'' But there are already empirical hints to counter such pessimism.
In networks with a central point of control, like YouTube or the Apple Store, we do see a Horatio Alger pattern in the distribution of outcomes, where there are very few viable winners and an unbounded number of hopefuls. But in more directly and thickly connected networks like Facebook, we see people typically exposed to a large number of other people, rather than just a few stars. Therefore, if Facebook users paid one another, they would see a less elite distribution of economic benefits.
Another potential benefit of monetized information is to balance the power of government. When information is free, there is no cost to gathering information about citizens. I would like the government, or anyone else, to pay each person each time that person is tracked by a camera. The government should be able to use cameras for security purposes, but in a limited, not unbounded way. Similarly, candidates should not be able to win elections by having the best Siren Servers, but that's only a problem if the information is free. Citizens should not lose the power of the purse.
The Internet has often been compared to the Wild West, with its dreamers and schemers, its glimmering promise of free land (primarily accessible, of course, through a monopolized railway). We have evolved out of these something-for-nothing schemes before, and we can do so again.

HEADLINE: In 2005 Video of Nadal, Bare Shoulders and Fewer Tics

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Sunday's all-Spanish duel between Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer will be the eighth French Open final in nine years for Nadal.
He has yet to lose one, including his first final, back in 2005, when he had just turned 19 and the opponent was the one-Slam wonder Mariano Puerta, who was barred from the sport later in the year because of his use of a stimulant.
''He's going to become a legend,'' Puerta said of Nadal after the match.
So it has turned out, and with footage provided by NBC and analytical support from the two-time French Open champion Jim Courier, we looked back at Nadal's first final at Roland Garros. 
The first conclusion: Nadal looked very different. He had a bit more chub in his cheeks and quite a bit less stubble. He had hair down to his shoulders, which were bare, of course, because of the sleeveless shirt that has long since been abandoned as a tennis wardrobe staple by the major clothing companies.
There were also the pirate pants, corsair pants, clam-diggers or whatever one preferred to call them. They were white in 2005 and would have just about covered the white surgical tape below the left knee that has become Nadal's 2013 sartorial statement.
''Rafa loved the pirate swagger, but it's pretty tough to sell that to the country club set,'' said Courier, the United States Davis Cup captain, working here as a consultant for the British network ITV.
On Friday, in his epic semifinal victory against Novak Djokovic, Nadal wore a short-sleeved shirt and red shorts that were shorter than most.
''After a certain age, you've got to be careful about your look; you can quickly become ridiculous,'' joked Toni Nadal, his uncle and coach, in an interview with L'Equipe.
As for his nephew, Nadal now wears wristbands and a very expensive watch, one so dear that it has raised hackles in recession-racked Spain. The only major style carryover from 2005 is the headband, even if it has brightened up considerably from its regulation white in 2005.
Now for the most striking change: The myriad mannerisms that have come to define Nadal's serving motion were largely absent in 2005.
Serving in the first set against Puerta, he might clean the line with his foot, might tuck his hair behind one of his ears and might, of course, tug at the seat of his pants But that was where it ended.
''Wow, just one ear,'' Courier said as he watched the footage.
Eight years ago, Nadal's obsessive attention to water bottle positioning was already in place, but serving was as simple as walking to the baseline, bouncing the ball a few times with his right hand and delivering a serve with his left.
Contrast that with his opening service game against Djokovic.
Nadal cleaned the line with his foot, examined the three balls in his hand, discarded one and then put another ball in his pocket.
He then did the following: reached for the back of his shorts with his right hand and tugged while bouncing the ball off the clay with his racket face; adjusted his left shirt sleeve with his right hand; adjusted his right shirt sleeve with his right hand; ran his right hand across his brow under his headband; touched his left ear; lightly pinched the bridge of his nose; and touched his right ear.
Only then did Nadal stop bouncing the ball with his racket face (nine bounces in all) and switch the ball to his right hand for five more bounces. Only then did he prepare in earnest to toss the ball and deliver a serve.
No wonder he is now facing risks of time violations. On Friday, he was warned and then docked a point in the third set by the chair umpire Pascal Maria for repeatedly exceeding the 20-second limit between points.
Nadal said Friday that he did not like the rule but respected it, yet it was never an issue for him in 2005 -- and not simply because tennis officials were less concerned with enforcement. There are stages of that final when he takes less than 15 seconds between points.
Courier has reviewed footage of Nadal when he played in the prominent under-14 junior tournament Les Petits As in Tarbes, France.
''He had none of the mannerisms at all,'' Courier said.
Is the change because of the stress of trying to stay one step ahead of the Federers and the Djokovics?
''Maybe,'' Courier said. ''It's a white-hot spotlight. A lot of players need rituals to feel comfortable in the environment. It makes them feel at home. That would be my guess.''
What is clearer to Courier is that Nadal is a much better tennis player now than in 2005.
''Without a shadow of a doubt,'' Courier said.
The serve preparation may have more tics, but the motion itself is new and improved with more leg drive, more back rotation and a more power-oriented grip.
His one-handed sliced backhand is crisper and less defensive. His two-handed drive backhand looks more effective down the line and more imposing when flattened out crosscourt (just ask Djokovic). And Nadal's whipping forehand -- the linchpin of his game on any surface -- is more compact with a shorter backswing.
''That's probably because the game has gotten faster, and he's had to compress it,'' Courier said. ''At this stage in 2005, he wasn't as confident and comfortable on hardcourts, hadn't played quite as much on them, so the swings are bigger. You see that with a lot of juniors: their games compress over time on tour.''
What also is striking is the apparent difference in swing speed. Comparing the demands of a match with Puerta in 2005 with those of a match with the elastic, explosive Djokovic in 2013 may not be apples to apples. But the difference in pace and risk seems evident. The first set against Puerta was full of relatively neutral shots, many of which landed short and went unpunished.
''It's like watching the thing in slow motion, isn't it?'' Courier said. ''You can still get away with neutral shots today against players who are not as accomplished, but in the latter rounds against the better players, you cannot. Because the other guy will blast away if you do not.''
It is a given that Nadal now plays closer to the baseline in general. But the surprise is that in the 2005 final, Nadal was several feet closer to the baseline to return serve than at Roland Garros this year. ''In 2005, he's standing closer in and then moving backward,'' Courier said. ''Now he starts deeper and as the server is going he takes microsteps back, but once he sets, he doesn't go backward anymore. He holds his ground.''
He is also less prone to celebration -- in a concession to his knees, the scissor kicks of 2005 have gone the way of the pirate pants -- and slightly more prone to projecting negative emotion.
What remains is Nadal's natural ease of movement on a surface that is widely and misleadingly considered a defender's paradise.
''While it's easy to move on for your body, it's really tough to play defense on,'' Courier said. ''People get a misconception that this is a great surface these days for people who are retrievers. It's much easier to be a great retriever on a hardcourt, because you have more to push off on. You can wrong-foot people on this surface more than any other.''
But Nadal, now 27, clearly has not put many feet wrong in Paris. Since his arrival at Roland Garros in 2005, he is an astonishing 58-1, and an eighth title here would give him more titles than any man has ever won in singles at the same Grand Slam event in the Open era.
''This is time-capsule stuff,'' Courier said as he watched Nadal manhandle Puerta. ''And we've been in a time-capsule era for a while.''

HEADLINE: For Retirees, a Million-Dollar Illusion

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
A MILLION dollars isn't what it used to be.
In 1953, when ''How to Marry a Millionaire'' was in movie theaters, $1 million bought the equivalent of $8.7 million today. Now $1 million won't even buy an average Manhattan apartment or come remotely close to paying the average salary of an N.B.A. basketball player.
Still, $1 million is more money than 9 in 10 American families possess. It may no longer be a symbol of boundless wealth, but as a retirement nest egg, $1 million is relatively big. It may seem like a lot to live on.
But in many ways, it's not. 
Inflation isn't the only thing that's whittled down the $1 million. The topsy-turvy world of today's financial markets -- particularly, the still-ultralow interest rates in the bond market -- is upending what many people thought they understood about how to pay for life after work.
''We're facing a crisis right now, and it's going to get worse,'' said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ''Most people haven't saved nearly enough, not even people who have put away $1 million.''
For people close to retirement, the problem is acute. The conventional financial advice is that the older you get, the more you should put into bonds, which are widely considered safer than stocks. But consider this bleak picture: A typical 65-year-old couple with $1 million in tax-free municipal bonds want to retire. They plan to withdraw 4 percent of their savings a year -- a common, rule-of-thumb drawdown. But under current conditions, if they spend that $40,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, there is a 72 percent probability that they will run through their bond portfolio before they die.
Suddenly, that risk-free bond portfolio is looking risky. ''The probabilities are remarkably grim for retirees who insist on holding only bonds in the belief that they are safe,'' says Seth J. Masters, the chief investment officer of Bernstein Global Wealth Management, a Manhattan-based firm, which ran these projections for Sunday Business. ''Because we live in this world we tend to think of it as 'normal,' but from the standpoint of financial market history, it's not normal at all,'' Mr. Masters said. ''And that's very clear when you look at fixed-income returns.''
Several rounds of intervention by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, aimed at stimulating a moribund economy, have helped to suppress rates, and so has low inflation. Low rates have led to cheaper mortgages and credit cards, helping to balance family budgets.
But for savers, low rates have been a trial. The fundamental problem is that benchmark Treasury yields have been well below 4 percent since early in the financial crisis. That creates brutal math: if your portfolio's income is below 4 percent, you can't withdraw 4 percent annually, and add inflation adjustments, without depleting that portfolio over time.
And with rising life expectancies, many people will have a lot of time: the average 65-year-old woman today can be expected to live to 86, a man to 84. One out of 10 people who are 65 today will live past 95, according to projections from the Social Security Administration.
''If you're invested only in bonds and you're withdrawing 4 percent, plus inflation, your portfolio will decline,'' said Maria A. Bruno, senior investment analyst at Vanguard. ''That's why we recommend that most people hold some equities. And why it's important to be flexible.'' In some years, investors may need to withdraw less than 4 percent, she said, and in some years they can take more.
Clearly, such flexibility depends on individual circumstances. Billionaires can afford to be very flexible: just 2 percent of a $1 billion portfolio is still $20 million. With economizing, even a big spender should be able to scrape by on that. But $20,000 -- the cash flow from a $1 million portfolio at 2 percent -- won't take you very far in the United States today.
And if you're not close to being a millionaire -- if you're starting, say, with $10,000 in financial assets -- you've got very little flexibility indeed. Yet $10,890 is the median financial net worth of an American household today, according to calculations by Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. (He bases this estimate on 2010 Federal Reserve data, which he has updated for Sunday Business according to changes in relevant market indexes.)
A millionaire household lives in elite territory, even if it no longer seems truly rich. Including a home in the calculations, such a family ranks in the top 10.1 percent of all households in the United States, according to Professor Wolff's estimates. Excluding the value of a home, a net worth of $1 million puts a household in the top 8.1 percent. Yet even such families may have difficulty maintaining their standard of living in retirement.
''The bottom line is that people at nearly all levels of the income distribution have undersaved,'' Professor Wolff said. ''Social Security is going to be a major, and maybe primary, source of income for people, even for some of those close to the top.''
Professor Munnell said that in addition to relying on Social Security, which she called ''absolutely crucial, even for people with $1 million,'' other options include saving more, spending less, working longer and tapping home equity for living expenses. ''There aren't that many levers we can use,'' she said. ''We have to consider them all.''
THE bond market has always been a forbidding place for outsiders, but making some sense of it is important for people who rely on bond income.
Low bond yields have been a nightmare for many investors, but that's not the only issue. Today's market rates aren't stable. Steve Huber, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said, ''Current yields are an anomaly when you consider where rates have been over the last decade or more.''
Rates are expected to rise. While that will eventually mean more income for bond buyers, it will create a host of problems. Already, the market has been rattled by speculation that after years of big bond-buying, the Fed may soon begin to taper its appetite. In May, a half-point climb in the yield of 10-year Treasury notes produced the biggest monthly bond market losses in nine years. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions.) Yet yields remain extraordinarily low on a historical basis. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is just under 2.2 percent, compared with more than 6.5 percent, on average, since 1962, according to quarterly Bloomberg data.
And bond investing is likely to remain challenging for years to come. Investors may face a double-whammy -- low yields now and the prospect of significant losses as yields rise. On Friday, after the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate edged up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent, yields rose further, amid uncertainty about the Fed's intentions.
Despite this market instability, bonds tend to be the investment of choice as people retire, because they throw off steady income. But as the projections from Bernstein Global Wealth Management suggest, over-reliance on bonds leads to financial quandaries.
These projections, based on proprietary market and economic forecasts and portfolio analyses, as well as on standard actuarial and tax data, estimate future probabilities for investors. That's a quixotic task at best, intended to illustrate possible outcomes rather than to provide precise forecasts, said Mr. Masters at Bernstein.
Still, they are worrisome. Consider again the 65-year-old couple who are starting to draw down $1 million in savings this year: if they withdrew 3 percent, or $30,000, a year, rather than that standard rate of 4 percent, inflation-adjusted, there is still a one-in-three chance that they will outlive their money, under current market conditions.
There are ways to improve these outcomes, but they have their own hazards. Adding stocks to a portfolio is an obvious counterbalance. And there is now a broad consensus among asset managers and academics that stocks have an unusually high likelihood of outperforming bonds over the next decade. That was the finding of a recent study by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The Bernstein projections concur that adding stocks to a portfolio reduces the risk of outliving your savings. But it also increases the risk of big losses.
Assume, for example, a diversified portfolio that is 80 percent invested in stocks and 20 percent in bonds -- a much higher stock-to-bond ratio than advisers typically suggest for someone near retirement. In that situation, under current market conditions and at a 4 percent withdrawal rate, the probability of running out of money drops to 14 percent. That's mainly because of higher expected returns for stocks. At a 3 percent withdrawal rate, the probability of outliving the portfolio is only 4 percent.
But then stock market risk comes into play. Over the long term, stocks tend to outperform bonds, but typically fluctuate much more wildly. There's a good chance that at some point, stock investments will produce major losses that many people simply can't tolerate.
''We find that people tend to think of losses in their portfolios based on the peak value they've ever had,'' Mr. Masters said. So Bernstein calculates the probability of what it calls a ''peak-to-trough loss'' of at least 20 percent in its sample portfolios.
For those with an 80/20 mix of stocks and bonds, it found a 60 percent probability of such a loss over the investors' lifetime. And, of course, some market declines far exceed 20 percent.
''Large losses may not be something that people are willing to live with, even if they are associated with higher returns over the long term,'' Mr. Masters said. ''Which is why we'd recommend holding some stocks, but not as much as 80 percent, for most people.''
Bonds would fare better in an economic environment more typical of the past, with higher interest rates, among other factors, Bernstein projections show. Should those conditions return one day, investment choices would be less stark. Under ''normal'' conditions, Bernstein projects, at a 4 percent withdrawal rate, inflation-adjusted, a portfolio 100 percent invested in bonds would have a 38 percent chance of running out in an investor's lifetime; at a 3 percent withdrawal rate, the chances drop to 14 percent.
Other investment companies modeling similar problems come up with different numbers, although the broad implications are reasonably close. ''We're operating in the same ballpark,'' said Ms. Bruno at Vanguard.
T. Rowe Price projections -- which don't differentiate between current conditions and a historically normal environment -- include different stock and bond indexes, and don't include the effect of taxes. That outlook finds that a 65-year-old couple who invested entirely in bonds have a 21 percent chance of outliving their portfolio. That's much more favorable than the Bernstein projections.
Still, Jim Tzitzouris, quantitative analyst at the asset allocation group of T. Rowe Price, said, ''In the current environment, it's worth being quite concerned about the effects of low interest rates on a retirement portfolio.''
ASIDE from recalibrating a portfolio, what can be done to improve a would-be retiree's financial situation? One answer is to work longer and retire later. Yet many people can't do that, often because they are physically unable to do so or can no longer find a suitable job.
Still, the expectation of working longer seems to be the trend. An annual survey for the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that in 1991, only 11 percent of workers expected to retire after age 65, while this year, 36 percent said they would retire after 65 -- and 7 percent said they didn't plan to retire at all.
Working longer improves your financial prospects, and one reason is morbid: you won't have as long to live on your savings.
Working longer helps in a happier way, too. Professor Munnell notes that by delaying retirement, monthly Social Security benefits rise substantially. For example, if you delay claiming benefits past what the government calls your ''full'' retirement age -- 66, for people retiring this year -- your monthly benefits increase by 8 percent a year until you reach 70.
Compared with current bond yields, that's a fabulous rate of return, for people who can afford to delay starting the Social Security income stream, she said.
It's also a much better return than a commercially available annuity will provide. Vanguard estimates that a basic fixed annuity that ends at death will produce an annual inflation-adjusted payout of only 3.7 percent if bought today for a healthy 65-year-old couple. (But the money is definitely gone when they die; there would be no surplus to pass on, as there could be in an investment portfolio.)
Paying close attention to Social Security benefits is likely to be meaningful for retirees at nearly all income levels, Professor Wolff said. ''Even at the millionaire level, for most people, Social Security is going to be very important.''
The maximum Social Security benefit for a retiree at 66 this year is $31,000 -- about the equivalent of drawing down 3 percent a year on a portfolio of $1 million.
Still, even $61,000 or $71,000 a year -- the combined Social Security and cash flow from the $1 million portfolio -- isn't likely to be enough for most people who have grown accustomed to living on $150,000 or more a year. And $150,000 is the median income of a typical household in the top 10 percent, roughly the ranking of a family with $1 million in net assets, Professor Wolff says.
Without another source of income, perhaps from traditional pensions from either or both spouses, he adds, a household like this won't come close to replacing 80 percent of its pre-retirement income -- often considered an acceptable target level.
And, he says, if Social Security is important for the relatively affluent, it's all the more so for those with less income and wealth, especially with the decline of traditional pensions. ''Social Security needs to be strengthened, not cut,'' he says.
Professor Munnell says this might be accomplished simply by raising the maximum taxable income level for Social Security payroll taxes. Currently, that level is $113,700. ''Social Security has done its job and it can easily be made solvent in the future,'' she said.
There are a few steps that people can take on their own, she said. ''When you're younger, and have a lot of human capital, you can save more and put a lot of the savings into stocks,'' she said. And then you can gradually shift into bonds as you age, fully understanding that the bond income may be quite limited. ''When you're in your 50s,'' she continued, ''you can try to save as much as you can, and try not to get accustomed to a lifestyle that you won't be able to afford later on.''
You can also try to pay off your mortgage, so you have the option of tapping home equity if you need to supplement your income later. And, she suggested, if you're lucky you'll find work that you like and can stick with for a long time -- until 70, at least.
That might not be the way you imagined your life. But the numbers suggest that even if you're a millionaire, you might have to start.

 CHART: Retirement Risks of Bonds: Conventional wisdom says people should hold more bonds as they age. But ultralow interest rates have left many would-be retirees with a big problem: the chance that they will exhaust their bond portfolios before they die. The outlook is worse for people who retire earlier and withdraw more. Adding stocks to a portfolio increases the risk of big losses, but it also reduces the risk that you'll outlive your money.

HEADLINE: Meet the New Landlord

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
A lot of people were surprised by the upsurge in home sales and prices last year, especially in some of the nation's most depressed markets. Nationwide sales prices rose 7.3 percent last year, according to one major index, while prices in hard-hit Phoenix surged 23 percent. Other trouble spots, including Las Vegas and Riverside County, Calif., have also had double-digit gains. 
As it turns out, the surge was not mainly the result of first-time buyers or growing families or job relocators. Rather, as Nathaniel Popper reported in The Times, Wall Street investors -- including the Blackstone Group and other private equity firms -- have been big buyers in the troubled areas where prices have been rising the fastest. Those gains, in turn, have propelled rising home prices nationwide, in part by reducing supply and in part by fostering a shift in perceptions about the housing market that has drawn some potential home buyers off the sidelines.
But is the housing rebound durable?
Most of the Wall Street players, who have not traditionally invested in homes, are renting out the properties for now and planning to sell later at a profit. Their presence in the market is not so much confirmation that housing has revived as a bet that the economy will recover enough in the coming years to justify the investment.
They could be wrong. In many regions with the biggest housing rebounds, house prices have outstripped the growth of the local economies, suggesting that price gains are not sustainable. Or they could be right, and make a lot of money. But even if their bets pay off, certain distressing trends in the housing market are likely to persist.
For starters, homeownership, now at an 18-year low of 65 percent, is likely to stay low by historical standards for a long time. Investors are buying rental properties because the bust has turned many people into renters, including those who lost homes to foreclosure and those who would have bought homes but for job loss and high debt. Given the traditional role of homeownership in building wealth, fostering communities and driving the economy forward, a lower rate of homeownership is a troubling development.
The emergence of Wall Street investors also reflects the continued failure of public policy to deal with the housing bust. The decline in homeownership and the loss of home equity could have been stanched if Congress and the Obama administration had aggressively pursued efforts to keep financially troubled borrowers in their homes, including bankruptcy reform and principal reduction loan modifications. But the banks did not want that, because it would have slowed their return to profitability. As a result, a glut of cheap homes and a ready supply of renters are available for Wall Street's taking.
Even now, Wall Street's involvement will complicate efforts by troubled borrowers to obtain loan modifications. After all, if there are Wall Street buyers for distressed homes, it is bound to be more advantageous for the bank that services the loan to steer homeowners into foreclosures or short sales.
The housing bust may be over. But the pain and damage lingers.

HEADLINE: The Seasoning Of Student Chefs

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
In the 21st-century economy, the path from a degree to a job is, for many fields of study, no longer as clear as it once was. But everybody has to eat, right? So the numerous people who think they can cook might think culinary school is the way to go educationally. Yet a serious cooking school is not all sugar and spice, as it were, as the students profiled in ''The Freshman Class'' find out. 
The series, which starts on Monday night on the Cooking Channel, notes that nearly 30,000 Americans start culinary school each year, then introduces four freshmen at the Louisiana Culinary Institute representing a range of backgrounds. The institute, they find, is no-nonsense about what it does.
''How many of you have ever had a food-borne illness?'' the instructor of a class on sanitation asks. Two raise their hands. ''Two?'' he says. ''Great. The other 29 of you need to go out and get one so that you know what your customers will go through if they contract a food-borne illness from food that you cook.''

HEADLINE: Tinker With Social Security? Sure, but Use the Right Wrench

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.

 BODY:
SOCIAL SECURITY is expected to run out of reserves by 2033 -- a mere 20 years from now. With the public apparently opposed both to tax increases and to benefit cuts, the main politically feasible way to avoid such a fate seems to involve some monkeying with obscure aspects of the definition of benefits.
Congress seems to want a ruse to disguise a cut in benefits as something else -- like the discovery of a technical error that, once corrected, would let the government write smaller checks without taking the blame for cutting benefits.
In a spirit of compromise, President Obama has proposed changing how inflation is measured in benefit calculations. In his 2014 budget proposal released in April, he proposed that retirees' Social Security benefits be indexed to something called the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or C-CPI-U, rather than the current benchmark, the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. 
This seems to correct a real technical error. Economists have argued that the current index overstates the actual inflation rate, and that a switch to the C-CPI-U would make the inflation indexing more accurate, seemingly justifying the resulting gradual reduction in benefits. (And it would be a reduction, to the point that someone retiring today would be receiving about 5 percent less in 20 years.)
But here is the rub: the proposal solves the wrong problem and, in doing so, undermines the integrity of the Social Security system.
The purpose of Social Security is to help families. It reinforces the intergenerational sharing that families already -- though imperfectly -- provide. It helps retirees by stabilizing their income, and it helps their grown children, who are relieved of any excessive burden of supporting them. This purpose strongly suggests that the Social Security benefits should be indexed to some measure of the available, aggregate economic pie. That means a formula that looks completely different from the ones being discussed today.
Clearly, something needs to be done: if nothing changes, and the trust fund runs out in 2033, the system would be able to pay only about 75 percent of promised benefits.
The issues are complex, as economic theorists like Henning Bohn at the University of California, Santa Barbara, have shown. But now that an index change is on the table, we should take this opportunity to get it right.
One alternative that we should consider is a different kind of index switch, linking retirees' benefits to gross domestic product per capita, in current dollars. This measure responds to inflation just as the C-CPI-U does, but, in contrast, it also responds to changes in the nation's resources, as measured by real G.D.P. There could also be corrections for other factors, like the dependency ratio, which compares the number of ''dependents'' (retired people and children) to the number of working adults.
Such an index switch, however, has received hardly any public discussion, and that fact alone will make some people think that something is wrong with it. But political talk is limited; it is too focused on the identified problem of somehow fixing the projected Social Security insolvency. While this new idea won't solve insolvency -- we may need to raise Social Security contributions to do that -- it would support the principle that one generation shouldn't be more burdened than another.
Before 1972, Social Security wasn't indexed at all, and there was little public talk about tying it to inflation despite periodic, inflation-induced disasters for retirees. Congress simply made occasional, ad hoc, upward adjustments in the benefit formula. Proponents of these adjustments often justified the increases as offsetting the rising cost of living. But at the same time, they also described retirees as needy, suffering hardships and deserving dignity. While there were no explicit references to G.D.P., it's plausible that their sense of ''needy'' was influenced by comparison with the rising American standard of living for working adults. As a matter of fact, total Social Security benefits more than kept up with the rapid G.D.P. growth in the couple of decades before they were indexed to inflation.
Now that inflation indexing has been in place, some people see the formula as always providing the scientifically ''right'' amount of benefits. They don't think much about other factors that might enter into the determination of benefits. And, in fact, since 1982, Social Security benefits as a fraction of G.D.P. have generally been falling, at least until the latest recession.
The fact is that per capita G.D.P., in current dollars, has grown 1.2 percent faster a year, on average, than the CPI-W in the last 20 years, despite the Great Recession. If we indexed Social Security benefits to G.D.P. per capita, and not to the C-CPI-U, people who retire today and live 20 additional years would get a third more in real, inflation-corrected benefits -- provided, of course, that the next 20 years are like the last.
If the economy grew unusually rapidly, however, they might get 50 or 60 percent more, in real terms. But even that wouldn't break the budget of the Social Security system, because contributions would be higher, too, in response to the greater economic growth. And if the economy stagnated in a deep depression in the next 20 years, retirees might see no growth at all, or conceivably even a decline, in real terms. That's O.K., too, because everyone else would be suffering as well. We have other programs, like Medicare, that deal with any extreme hardships that some older Americans with special conditions might encounter.
THE point of G.D.P. indexing is to align the interests of the retired with society as a whole. Older Americans should share both the windfalls and the losses with other generations -- with working adults, and with children. It shouldn't be otherwise. If the system's rules force us to maintain the real benefits of retirees at all costs, we may find ourselves, in difficult times, taking excessively from our children via cuts in education, or from our working adults. Why should retired people feel no effect at all from the recession while younger people are left suffering? They should be sharing the hardships, if we have familial feelings for one another.
The issue is especially salient today because the demographics have shifted: the aging of the baby boomers will create many retirees relative to adults who are still working. This huge shift could not have been foreseen by Social Security's designers.
Achieving the right benefit formula while fixing Social Security's solvency problem might require increasing the contribution rate -- now in the form of 6.2 percent taxes on employees and employers. But so be it. We need to say what is right, keeping our eyes on the integrity of Social Security, which is crucial to our identity as a civil society.

HEADLINE: China's Export Growth Slows Amid Concern of Slowdown

BYLINE: By GERRY MULLANY and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Chinese exports showed only modest growth in May, rising just 1 percent from a year earlier, officials said Saturday, an increase that was much lower than analysts' expectations. 
In April, the increase was 14.7 percent, a figure that was believed to have been artificially inflated. Before Saturday's figure came out, analysts expected Chinese exports to have risen at least 7 percent in May.
Concern is rising about the sputtering Chinese economy and tightening liquidity. The European Union, China's biggest trading partner, remains mired in a stubborn economic downturn, while in the United States, China's next-largest export market, the Federal Reserve has recently been sending signals it may start curtailing its stimulative monetary policies.
China's figures showed it had a trade surplus of $20.4 billion in May, up from $19.3 billion, as imports declined 0.3 percent, the Customs Administration said. The drop in imports -- however slight -- was a possible sign of weakness in the domestic economy.
Chinese stocks declined last week, their first weekly decline in six weeks, amid signs of tightening liquidity within China. A clearer picture of the Chinese economy is expected Sunday, when the government releases data on retail sales, industrial output and inflation.
Economists had expected the May figures to show a slowdown, as the government has begun a campaign to prevent companies from overstating their exports. Many businesses are believed to have done so in March and April as a way to bypass currency controls and bring more money into the country to speculate on further appreciation of China's renminbi.
The main evidence for such strategies lay in official statistics showing soaring exports to Hong Kong and bonded export zones on the mainland even as exports to the rest of the world from these places remained weak.
Louis Kuijs, an economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland, had estimated in May that more than half of the officially reported growth of 14.7 percent in April from a year earlier was the result of companies' manipulating their statistics to place bets on the Chinese currency. The true rate of export growth in April, without the effects of these strategies, was more like 5.7 percent.
The sharp slowdown in export growth in May ''in part reflects the impact of a clampdown by the government on firms dressing up financial inflows as exports,'' Mr. Kuijs said in an e-mail on Saturday.
Chinese customs data compiled by CEIC Data in Hong Kong showed that the mainland's exports to Hong Kong were up only 7.7 percent in May from a year earlier. In April, they had been up 57.2 percent from the same month last year, and in March they had been up 92.9 percent.
Changing expectations about China's currency -- fewer businesspeople now expect further appreciation -- may have also reduced the incentive for companies to overstate exports, Mr. Kuijs said.

Danny Hartzell grew up near Pittsburgh, the son of an alcoholic father who left him largely unsupervised. His wife, Ronale, was also raised by parents who were alcoholics, and her mother drank rubbing alcohol when the other kind wasn't available. Often they lived out of their car, and Ronale went to bed hungry when her mother was too drunk or unable to feed her.
Danny and Ronale met and fell in love in Tampa. Both dropped out of high school. When the recession hit in 2008, Danny was laid off from his $10-an-hour job at a factory that made plastic bags. He was in his late 30s, short, overweight, deaf in one ear and missing several teeth. His voice was loud and hoarse. Ronale was also obese and missing teeth. She suffered from diabetes. 
They were fiercely attached to each other and to their children, but had few connections beyond that. As George Packer writes in ''The Unwinding,'' a gripping narrative survey of contemporary America, the Hartzells were ''estranged from their surviving relatives, most of whom were heavy drinkers. They had few friends, and no church (though they were Christian) or union (though they were working class) or block association (though they wished the area was safe enough for the kids to go trick-or-treating). They hardly gave a thought to politics.''
In the spring of 2009, their daughter was found to be suffering from bone cancer in her left leg. The next 18 months were consumed by her treatment. Cockroaches infested their apartment. Ronale stopped cooking, and they lived off pizza, Velveeta Cheesy Skillets and Salisbury steaks, which were $2.28 for a package of six. Danny got a part-time job at Target, but one morning he was told to come in when his daughter had a doctor's appointment. He didn't bother to call to get the day off. He just didn't show up and ended up losing his job.
Finally, Danny and Ronale decided to get false teeth. They went to the dentist and had their gums taken care of and some residual teeth pulled, which left them completely toothless. Each was fitted with a gleaming set of new teeth. But Ronale left the dentist's office in pain. She took the teeth out and never put them back in. Danny stopped using his too.
Danny got a job at Walmart, but he hated it. Packer summarizes his views: ''He hated the superior attitude of the managers, . . . the customers who interrupted him while he was shelving stock to ask where the frigging bananas were, the fact that he was an 'associate' instead of an old-school 'employee.' '' He complained loudly to his colleagues, and one day a manager warned Danny about his bad attitude. His pride injured, Danny stopped showing up and lost that job too.
The Hartzells are just one of the families scraping their way through the modern economy in Packer's deeply affecting book. He's giving us the story of the nation's economic transformation from the ground up.
Packer has clearly modeled this book on the novels of John Dos Passos' ''U.S.A.'' trilogy (1930-1936), which came out in the pit of the Great Depression. Dos Passos followed the scattered lives of a dozen or more fictional characters, interspersing their stories with short biographies of real historic figures, stream-of-consciousness passages and ''newsreels'' -- collages of modern headlines and song lyrics to evoke the spirit of the times. He enveloped it all in his fervent left-wing politics; the trilogy was, for all its avant-garde style, meant to arouse working-class consciousness and protest.
The characters in Packer's book are real, not fictional. Packer is a staff writer for The New Yorker who produced some of the finest journalism about the Iraq war (including an outstanding book called ''The Assassin's Gate''). But like Dos Passos, he too includes newsreels and short biographies of major figures. His book is also infused with a strong left-wing economic populism. He paints an admiring portrait of the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, whose political views seem to coincide with his own.
He seems to be disappointed in or critical of Democrats whom he regards as too close to the financial establishment, like Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Larry Summers, Tim Geithner and Robert Rubin. He seems to sympathize with anti-establishment outsiders, whether they are Occupy Wall Street organizers, the writer Raymond Carver or even the libertarian renegade Peter Thiel. He seems to regard members of the American establishment like Oprah Winfrey, Colin Powell, Jay-Z, Alice Waters and Sam Walton as soulless, hypocritical, pathetic or opportunistic. He seems to dislike Republicans and especially Tea Party types, who are portrayed spitting out their words, practicing mustard gas politics and motivated by blind hatreds.
I use the word ''seems'' a lot because Packer rarely comes out and says what he thinks. This is a book of nearly pure narrative, and his meanings are embedded in the way he portrays people, those he likes (outsiders) and those he doesn't (bankers, the political class). There are some passages of outright analysis in this book to show that America is ''unwinding,'' that the structures of everyday life are crumbling, that the nation's leaders have ''abandoned their posts,'' that the void has been filled with ''the default force in American life, organized money.'' But I doubt the analytic passages together would fill more than a few pages of this 434-page book.
The stories that do fill its pages are beautifully reported. There are a few dominating figures who pop in and out, like Jeff Connaughton, the perfect political No. 2, who in the early 1980s hitched his wagon to Joe Biden and became an aide, a fund-raiser, a lobbyist and a Washington insider. But during the financial crisis Connaughton grew disillusioned with politics, and he gives Packer an absolutely brutal portrait of Biden as a coldblooded operator, a staff-abuser and a people-user, who cares about nothing but his own presidential ambitions. (This portrait is cartoonishly overdrawn.)
There is Dean Price, a young go-getter who opened a chain of truck stops and then fell for some crackpot suggestions that the world was about to run out of oil and moved off into biodiesel. After being the political flavor of the month for a while with his speeches on energy, he was charged with not paying his taxes, his company tanked and things ended badly.
There is Tammy Thomas, a woman from Youngstown, Ohio, who worked hard in the city's auto parts plants and took an early retirement buyout as the local economy crumbled around her. She lost a large chunk of her savings in a Ponzi scheme. Outraged at the changes around her, she has become an activist and community organizer.
To repeat, Packer does an outstanding job with these stories. ''The Unwinding'' offers vivid snapshots of people who have experienced a loss of faith. As a way of understanding contemporary America, these examples are tantalizing. But they are also frustrating. The book is supposed to have social, economic and political implications, but there is no actual sociology, economics or political analysis in it.
By ''the unwinding,'' Packer is really referring to three large transformations, which have each been the subject of an enormous amount of research and analysis. The first is the stagnation of middle-class wages and widening inequality. Depending on which analyst you read, this has to do with the changing nature of the information-age labor market, changing family structures, rising health care costs, the decline of unions or the failure of education levels to keep up with technology.
The second is the crushing recession that began in 2008. Depending on which analyst you read, this was caused by global capital imbalances, bad Federal Reserve policy, greed on Wall Street, faulty risk-assessment models or the insane belief that housing prices would go on rising forever.
The third transformation is the unraveling of the national fabric. Depending on which analyst you read, this is either a gigantic problem (marriage rates are collapsing; some measures of social connection are on the decline) or not a gigantic problem (crime rates are plummeting, some measures of social connection are improving).
Packer wants us to understand these transformations, but ultimately, narrative and anecdotes are not enough. They need to be complemented with evidence from these long-running debates and embedded in a theoretical framework and worldview.
To the extent that Packer offers a framework, it is that the nation's elites have failed. The organized money class has captured Barack Obama and rigged the game for itself: ''The statesmen and generals had become consultants and pundits. The Army was composed of professionals, not citizens. The public schools were leaving the children of the whole people semiliterate.''
Anybody who covers Washington and Wall Street knows there is an awesome amount of self-dealing in America's power centers, most of it perfectly legal. But in what sense has this elite -- which comes from the finest universities and is the most diverse and equal-opportunity elite in history -- failed? This is the sort of question ''The Unwinding'' doesn't help answer.
Moreover, this rot-at-the-top theory doesn't really explain wage stagnation, inequality, the Great Recession or changes in social capital. It doesn't fully cohere with many of Packer's complex, rich stories. For example, it doesn't really help us understand how much the Hartzells should be held responsible for their own decisions -- dropping out of school, not using their new teeth, quitting jobs because a customer occasionally asked where to find the bananas.
I wish Packer had married his remarkable narrative skills to more evidence and research, instead of just relying on narrative alone. Combine data to lives as they are actually lived.
When John Dos Passos wrote the ''U.S.A.'' trilogy, the left had Marxism. It had a rigorous intellectual structure that provided an undergirding theory of society -- how social change happens, which forces matter and which don't, how society works and who causes it not to work. Dos Passos' literary approach could rely on that structure, fleshing it out with story and prose.
The left no longer has Marxism or any other coherent intellectual structure. Packer's work has no rigorous foundation to rely on, no ideology to give it organization and shape. But the lack of a foundational theory of history undermines the explanatory power of ''The Unwinding,'' just as it undermines the power and effectiveness of modern politics more generally.

HOMEWARD BOUNDWhy Women Are Embracing the New Domesticity
By Emily Matchar272 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.BOOTSTRAPPERFrom Broke to Badass on aNorthern Michigan FarmBy Mardi Jo Link257 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.95.
Have you ever bought a handmade trifle on Etsy? Browsed homegrown produce at a farmers' market? Read one of the many recent memoirs in which the heroine ditches her adrenalized urban professional life to raise animals and plant vegetables in the country? Or perhaps watched an episode of ''Portlandia'' (artisanal knots, anyone?), a show that pokes gentle fun at such precious activities? If so, you are probably aware that a cultural change is afoot: people increasingly want experiences and artifacts that feel natural, simple and untainted by consumerism. 
In ''Homeward Bound: Why Women Are Embracing the New Domesticity,'' the journalist Emily Matchar diagnoses this ''collective nostalgia and domesticity-mania'' and coins a term for it: New Domesticity. Not surprisingly, since we live in a time of distaff trend-peddling -- opting out, leaning in, feminist housewifery -- she pins this mania on women. The female members of Generation Y, she argues, are rejecting the careerism, corporatism and convenience foods of their Baby Boomer mothers in favor of ''a more eco-conscious, family-centric, D.I.Y. lifestyle.'' ''New Domesticity,'' Matchar writes, is ''the re-embrace of home and hearth'' by women, and a handful of men, with the financial means to do so. Hallmarks of the New Domesticity are a yearning for a scaled-down, more sustainable life and nostalgia for labor-intensive, hands-on endeavors: ''Young women who, had they been of age in the 1990s, might have been boozing it up'' in Manhattan's meatpacking district ''are now spending Saturday nights baking cupcakes and photographing them for their food blogs.''
Matchar traces this return to domesticity through a series of thematically discrete chapters. Each one reads like your standard, mid-pH newsmagazine trend story complete with corny prose (''Now the cupcake has been turned on its little frosted head''), on-beat quotes from scholar-experts, and numerous interviews with geographically diverse but blandly described women that the mind can't help conflating (''Rebecca, 37, an Ohio-based part-time professor and hobby farmer who is an avid blog reader''). Matchar explores the ''artisan economy'' that has emerged on Etsy, where women hope to profit from a crafting habit. She details the rise of ''hard-core foodism,'' whose adherents romanticize the culinary ways of the past and treat cooking like a moral pursuit. She introduces us to proponents of ''D.I.Y. parenting'': home-birthers, home-schoolers, carriers of cloth-diapered children in slings, who shun day care, vaccines and jarred baby food. And to ''neo-homesteaders'' whose ''self-sufficient, home-focused, frugal, slowed-down lifestyle'' is the epitome of New Domesticity.
Matchar provides a blizzard of detail -- it's as though she cites every manifestation of her theory she has ever noticed, every article on the topic she has ever read -- but unfortunately it's far more pleasurable to ogle online pictures of ''owl throw pillows'' and ''felted baby bootees'' than to read about them. She takes pains to demonstrate that the phenomena she writes about have not arisen in a vacuum. ''New Domesticity is, at heart, a cry against a society that's not working,'' she writes. But because many of the practitioners mentioned have more or less similar motivations, the book grows numbingly repetitive. A reader can, however, rest assured she or he will leave with a deep comprehension of the underpinnings of this trendlet. To wit: the abysmal state of the economy; environmental concerns; a mistrust of government, business and the industrial food system; disenchantment with the contemporary workplace and its lack of family-friendly policies and creatively satisfying jobs. As Matchar puts it, ''a sense that the American dream has turned out to be a big fat toxin-laden, environment-destroying nightmare.''
Of course, arguably the most fundamental factor at play here -- the how if not the why -- is the rise of the Internet, which, Matchar shows, has enabled women to blog about their unplugged domestic lives, sell their old-fashioned handmade wares online and receive validation for tasks that previously went unsung. ''This lifestyle wouldn't work if women were raising their perfect, happy locavore children in the middle of the woods with no Internet connection,'' Marcie Cohen Ferris, an American studies professor at the University of North Carolina, says in the book.
Yet a subtle cultural recalibration is a far cry from a legitimate sociological shift, one in which women were quitting their jobs and retreating to the domestic sphere in extraordinary numbers. Only that would have the sort of consequences Matchar spends a fair amount of time fretting about: that we could return to a ''gender essentialism'' not unlike the 19th-century cult of domesticity, wherein women are viewed as instinctive nurturers and homemakers and little else, or that women might ''cut back on their ambitions en masse.''
Matchar includes plenty of obliquely relevant statistics (women make 93 percent of all food purchases; only 27 percent of female bloggers work full time) but we get far too much anecdotal evidence gleaned from her peers: ''Dozens of my own friends and acquaintances -- ambitious, educated women who might have turned up their noses at anything domestic had they been born a generation earlier -- have blogs dedicated to cupcakes or knitting or vintage home décor.'' Or: ''With the recession, everyone was talking about frugal housekeeping and reclaiming the self-sufficiency skills of our grandmothers.''
Actually, during the recession, everyone I knew was talking about struggling to make the house payments. It's in a similar situation that we meet Mardi Jo Link, a freelance writer and editor, occasional waitress and soon-to-be-single mother of three boys, who is desperately trying to hold on to her six-acre homestead. Link's memoir, ''Bootstrapper: From Broke to Badass on a Northern Michigan Farm,'' chronicles her first year divorced from a man she sarcastically calls ''Mr. Wonderful.'' Link narrates her misadventures as she scrapes by month to month -- driving her boys around to scrounge for unclaimed firewood, winning a year's worth of free bread in a zucchini contest with giant rogue squashes that were growing in her untended yard.
''Bootstrapper'' would seem like the quintessential example of New Domesticity. But it's rather more of an anti-example, and Link an antiheroine. This is not Matchar's ''organized, stylish picture of domestic bliss'' but one of barely controlled chaos. Link reveals the dreary underside of the domestic fantasy; running a self-sustaining farm, even a small one, is costly, unpredictable, back-breakingly laborious -- and nearly impossible to do alone.
As impressive as Link's ingenuity and resourcefulness are, her writing frequently exasperates. Mr. Wonderful is evoked only as a pot-smoking cipher, and even her ever-present boys remain hazily sketched. Ultimately, ''Bootstrapper'' amounts to a series of hokey anecdotes that don't add up to a cohesive, crafted story. Still, the book glints with Link's raw, willful energy, and there are emotionally honest moments: ''It's impossible to appreciate the solitude when all I feel is the loneliness,'' she writes.
Link's story possesses that rare, elusive, but much sought-after feeling of authenticity that is, at root, what the current craze for domesticity is about. It's something that a book like Susan Gregory Thomas's ''In Spite of Everything'' has, and Caitlin Flanagan's ''To Hell With All That'' -- in which the author glorifies domestic skill but admits to employing a maid herself -- does not. Like Thomas, Link clings to her rustic world not in order to write about it, but because she must.
While some of Matchar's interviewees cite financial motives, a number of women in ''Homeward Bound'' talk about ''reclaiming'' domesticity as a feminist act of empowerment and rebellion. ''What could possibly be more feminist than to embrace the natural female quality of nurture?'' says a blogger named ''Calamity Jane,'' expressing a typical sentiment.
To her credit, Matchar skeptically suggests that rhetoric of this stripe is a way of rendering stay-at-home motherhood a more ''palatable option'' for women whose actual reasons for embracing domesticity have more to do with the lack of structural support for working mothers in this country, like maternity leave and affordable child care, as well as a disenchantment with a round-the-clock corporate culture that makes ''work-life balance'' as elusive as a mythical creature. Yet Matchar's very worthwhile point is couched in such an excess of moralistic admonishing that it can feel infantilizing. And her earnest, often didactic discussions of sociological implications (the final chapter is titled ''Take-Home Points for the Homeward Bound: Lessons of New Domesticity'') grow ponderous. How problematic is it, really, that women can now enjoy -- and what's more, make money from -- tasks that were once silent drudgeries of the domestic sphere?
In any case, Matchar needn't worry too much. To paraphrase the cultural critic Lewis Mumford: Every generation revolts against its mothers and makes friends with its grandmothers. Don't be surprised if women of the next generation look askance at biodynamic vegetables and hand-knit scarves, don suits made of synthetic fibers, drink big cups of toxins and head to work in soulless skyscrapers.

THE YONAHLOSSEE RIDING CAMP FOR GIRLSBy Anton DiSclafani
390 pp. Riverhead Books. $27.95.
The year is 1930 and the country has slid into the Great Depression. Fifteen-year-old Thea Atwell has been ejected from her family home in Florida for doing something very, very bad. Her punishment: to be remanded to the Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. A child of privilege, Thea has grown up in near isolation on a citrus plantation, with her twin brother, Sam, and 16-year-old cousin, Georgie, as her closest companions. Once deposited and uniformed, Thea comes to realize that Yonahlossee isn't just an elite summer camp but a year-round school and -- cue ''Hotel California'' -- she's not going anywhere for a long time. 
This is the promising opening of Anton DiSclafani's ambitious first novel, which positions a world of horseback riding, romance and Southern snobbery against the backdrop of the country's worst economic trial. It's not an easy pairing, imagining girls in polished riding boots sneaking liquor and enjoying liaisons while people in surrounding Appalachia struggle just to find enough to eat. As DiSclafani writes, the school is ''an island of rich girls in the middle of the poorest.'' Not only that, there are girls at Yonahlossee ''who refused to believe or at least admit that the North had claimed victory in the War Between the States.''
One has to respect DiSclafani's enterprise, even if her efforts fall flat. A former equestrian competitor, she is best when describing equine pedagogy, the minutiae of tack and hoof care, the talk of fetlocks and forelocks, leading her readers to understand why teenage girls can be so enthralled with horses: they require care but also serve as empowerment symbols, providing a shield against fear as well as a socially sanctioned metaphorical outlet for sexual urges. Unfortunately, there's just so much of this you can handle if you're not a teenage girl and crazy about horses.
Thea only gradually lets the reader in on all the details of her terrible secret. This coyness prevents us from getting to know and like her, and it makes DiSclafani's attempts to create drama feel contrived. Throw in the distant mother who has banished Thea, the isolated childhood, the girls in their all-white uniforms and the underlying suggestion of incest and taboo, and everything gets very ''Flowers in the Attic.'' A further hindrance is DiSclafani's not always careful prose, as when Thea describes the joy of riding her horse fast on a moonlit night: ''I could do this forever, was how I felt; and what else is there to say about galloping?''
While some of DiSclafani's descriptions of teenage sexuality seem credible, most are either awkward or too vivid for their particular context. At one point, Thea fantasizes about her friend Sissy and Sissy's secret paramour, Boone: ''I thought of Boone gently and urgently kneading her breasts.'' Which sounds to me like a bad mammogram, a really bad third date or instructions for how to make gnocchi.
The good news is that the novel finally achieves some forward motion in its muddied final laps, heroically unscrambling a host of plot lines. In the course of all this, Thea will engage in more bad behavior, without exhibiting any remorse or sense of conflict, rendering her even less likable. ''I had wanted something very badly,'' she calmly explains, ''and then I had gotten it, and the getting kept getting better.'' She sounds like a middle-aged madam rather than the independent young woman DiSclafani presumably intended.
The book is a cinematic, image-heavy exercise: DiSclafani presents us with luscious visuals like the Yonahlossee girls riding in their radiant uniforms under the tutelage of their German riding coach -- or taking silent baths in a room filled with nothing but steamy tubs, each girl in her own tub, servant at the ready with clean white towels. You can practically see the trailer for the Sofia Coppola movie.
There's a saying in the horse world, often grumbled by parents whose bank accounts have been emptied by the sport's high cost but who are relieved by the knowledge that their teenage daughters are more obsessed with horses than they are with boys: Horseback riding is the world's most expensive form of birth control. Apparently, Thea Atwell never got the memo.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: A New School Schedule?

 BODY:
Readers react to a proposal for a longer school year and day.
To the Editor:
As schoolchildren around the country begin or approach their summer vacation, let's evaluate the point of this extended, yet outdated, interruption.
Our schools operate as though we remain in an agricultural age. No longer do kids need the summer off to be home to help the family with the crops. The typical American school day, from 7:30 or 8 a.m. to 2 or 3 p.m., is unnecessarily short and designed for an era that required children to run home to assist on the family farm. It's an absurd schedule from a time when a parent (and let's be real -- it was Mom) was home waiting for the kids.
We should lengthen the school day to be in line with the schedule of working parents. With schools ending at 5 p.m., we could reintroduce all the ''specials,'' like art and music and dance, that have been removed over time. More recess and arts programs, not more Common Core curriculum. No more homework, because the important learning and teaching would be done in school with professional teachers. 
Take away the overly long summer ''vacation,'' when kids lose ground in all subjects. Summer break invariably forces parents to scurry around finding summer camps and agonizing about how to pay for them.
But year-round schooling is not what I'm proposing. Schooling should be on a four-quarter schedule. Teachers would cover the topic quickly and interestingly, and remove the busywork and lackluster curriculum of the elongated school year we now have. Between quarters, students and teachers would have two or three weeks off. Teachers would get professional development and a rest. Students would get a brief brain break.
These reforms would cost money. But we must ask ourselves: What cost do we pay for not truly reforming our education system to equip our learners for these modern times?
MEG STEWART Poughkeepsie, N.Y., June 3, 2013
The writer is an education technology consultant.
Readers React
However wonderful one imagines one's schools to be, the fact is that the average American school system is not producing a high-school graduate with competent skills in reading, writing, math and technology.
The idealist in me heartily endorses Ms. Stewart's recommendation for restructuring the school year. The pessimist yells about unions, teachers' salaries, physical plant costs and the generally anti-intellectual nature of American culture. The pragmatist wants to look at the math.
One hundred eighty six-hour school days offer at best 900 hours of active learning time (with an hour off for lunch and breaks). Factor in days lost to catastrophic weather, preparation for standardized testing, the taking of standardized tests, school festivals, and family demands or illness, and the typical child probably gets something more like 170 days (850 hours) of learning. Subtract another week for making up ground lost over the summer, then the hours of active learning fall to 825. And I think this number is optimistic.
Ensuring that students receive the full measure of education needed for a productive life and gainful employment means lengthening the school year to a minimum of 200 days. Broken into 10-week quarters, this leaves 3-week breaks between quarters.
Ms. Stewart may be recommending too much too fast, but she is looking in the right direction. American is clinging to a system that served us adequately in the past. What we need is a system that serves us well now and will serve us even better in the future.
ELLEN B. CUTLER Aberdeen, Md., June 5, 2013
The writer is an adjunct professor of art history at the Maryland Institute College of Art.
Ms. Stewart's argument makes perfect sense and is supported by much of the emerging education literature. The contrary opinion is thin by comparison, but I cling to it: a thing called childhood.
Think back to the last day of school in the fourth grade, when summer loomed infinite. Those halcyon days afforded something special that cannot be equaled by two to three weeks off.
As the exigencies of modern-day living trickle down to childhood, we lose, even though her argument makes so much sense. Maybe a compromise would be for kids to skip a quarter every now and then.
RICHARD ROTHENBERG Atlanta, June 5, 2013
I could not agree more with Ms. Stewart's letter advocating extending instructional days and the school year. Movement in that direction has already occurred in many charter and private schools that are liberated from arcane rules (including union-driven ones) that limit the school year and day.
I've run schools from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with all the electives, gym and creative arts during the last 90 minutes -- a wonderful way to end the day.
Extending the school day and year makes educational sense. It also makes social policy sense and will particularly benefit lower-income families that do not have the resources for after-school day care, after-school enrichment programs, summer camps and so on.
But for this to happen we have to invest more in education -- perhaps 25 to 35 percent more -- to cover the cost of additional salaries and activities. Given reductions in education budgets, this seems unlikely.
GABRIEL MALDONADO New York, June 5, 2013
The writer is executive director of PROEA, an educational consulting service.
While I find Ms. Stewart's arguments for extending both the school day and year interesting, I think they are impractical. I am a teacher and worked in a ''year round'' school for four years.
We started Aug. 1 and had a two-week fall break, a three-week winter break, and a two-week spring break. After each break, the students had a difficult time adjusting to being back in school and didn't remember what we were working on before the break. When new students transferred in, they were completely lost, as our curriculum was set up differently from that of their former schools.
The parents ended up hating the new schedule because it still left them with chunks of time to ''figure out'' child care during the school year. They eventually opted to return to the regular school schedule.
Another point to consider: Not all schools have the luxury of air-conditioning. It's nearly impossible to encourage a child to think when it's blazing hot in the classroom!
We don't need to keep the children in school until 5 p.m. either. It is not my job to keep your child while you are at work. It is also not my job to keep young children focused from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. That isn't developmentally appropriate, nor should it be.
Education definitely needs an overhaul, but not simply to accommodate parents' work schedule.
ANN L. KUHLMAN Chicago, June 5, 2013
There's an efficient, proven and less expensive way to accomplish what Ms. Stewart describes. Research shows us that quality after-school programs, like the ones already serving millions of kids across the United States, help them succeed in school and out.
After a full day of coursework, kids are ready for something different, and that's just what after-school offers: hands-on learning; exposure to local businesses, mentors, artists, scientists and other experts; opportunities for exercise, music and art; and much more. Along the way, kids are exposed to activities they might not encounter otherwise -- caring for a community garden, applying art and physics lessons in designing a skateboard, or building literacy skills by writing and producing a play.
After-school programs complement and supplement, but don't replicate, in-school learning, and provide students with the social and emotional learning and leadership opportunities so necessary to succeed. Rather than simply adding extra classes, we would be better off with quality after-school programs available until at least 6 p.m. that engage kids in a range of hands-on, sleeves-rolled-up activities that address a variety of subjects and skills.

Ms. Stewart perfectly demonstrates the issue with summer vacation by labeling it an ''interruption.'' Summer break should not be viewed as a mandated break in which students must halt their learning for three months. Instead, summer vacation should be seen as an opportunity for students to pursue outside interests, develop vital practical skills and apply their hard-earned knowledge in enriching experiences.
Summer break is often the first time that older students participate in jobs and internships. Cutting summer vacation into shorter, spaced-out vacation blocks will virtually eliminate these internship opportunities.
Ms. Stewart argues that we need to prepare our students to participate in the modern world. I completely agree. We need innovators, thinkers, those who can come up with ideas of their own, not merely memorize the ideas of others. During summer vacations students can discover where their true passion lies.
We can, and should, get rid of the idea of summer ''break.'' Let's replace it with a term worthy of our students and their talents; let's cherish their summer ''enrichment.''
EMILY COX Fairfax, Va., June 5, 2013
The writer is a high school junior.
Ms. Stewart says that our schools have summers off because, in former times, farm children were needed to help the family with crops. My research on Michigan schools suggests that this is a widespread myth.
Except for year-round daily chores, the work of children was not much needed during summer months when crops were growing. In the 1800s, before mechanization of agriculture, crops had to be planted and harvested by labor-intensive means. Thus traditional American rural schools typically had six weeks off in spring for planting, and six weeks off in fall for harvesting, when the assistance of children was more needed.
The summers-off school pattern originated in the burgeoning American cities of the mid- and late-19th century. Dirt roads, lots of horses (with manure, urine and flies), few large trees for shade, and many buildings blocking cooling winds created cities that were hot, dusty, smelly, insect-filled, uncomfortable places to live in summer. Better-off families left the cities for cooler country or lakeshore homes during July and August.
By 1900, as cities came to socially and economically dominate their hinterlands, rural districts started changing to the summers-off pattern of the cities.
Today a majority of the nation's classrooms still lack air-conditioning. Thus summertime heat and discomfort, which caused the summers-off pattern of city schools in the 1800s, remain relevant issues.
ROBERT J. THALER Bay City, Mich., June 6, 2013
The writer is president of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts and Letters.
I was an advocate for lengthening the school day for some time. After digging into the topic, though, I found that the United States actually has one of the higher totals of instructional time. Here is a nice summary from the Center for Public Education, citing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: ''According to the O.E.C.D., the hours of compulsory instruction per year in these countries range from 608 hours in Finland (a top performer) to 926 hours in France (average) at the elementary level, compared to the over 900 hours required in California, New York, Texas and Massachusetts. Of particular note, no state requires as few hours as Finland, even though Finland scores near the top of nearly every international assessment.''
Of course, one could argue that Finland has a much different demographic than our schools, but these numbers are still intriguing. Finland recruits teachers from the top of graduating classes. They are doing more with better teachers and less time in class. Do we honestly think that our solution is to put our kids into school for longer days with subpar teachers?
I do like the idea of being a bit more in line with parents' working schedules, but more so at the end of the day. There is abundant research showing that students perform better when they have slept sufficiently. We should entertain the idea of having middle and high school starting later in the day and ending later in the evening. There may be some merit to a quarterly schedule, but some pretty crafty curriculum planning and scheduling would need to be in order.
COREY SAVAGE Dracut, Mass., June 5, 2013
The writer is a Ph.D. student in educational policy at Michigan State University and a former high school biology teacher.
Some students may need more time in school, but spare my children. I want them to be able to roam the woods, ride their bikes, build stuff and, above all, be in charge of their lives for a few precious hours a day. And while we are at it, reduce much of the nonsense called homework so they can spend the evening hours reading books of their own choosing.
As for summer vacation, I want those weeks so they can visit the grandparents farm, roam the pasture, smell the fresh air and swim in the local pond. And, yes, read more books when they tire of those wonderful activities. I truly resent the school day and year taking over more and more of their lives.
WILLIAM J. OEHLKERS Barrington, R.I., June 5, 2013
The Writer Responds
When I talk with other parents of school-age children, there is a level of dissatisfaction with the school system, and all have ideas for ''fixing'' it. I wrote my letter with hopes of generating discussion on a topic I care deeply about.
Some letter writers yearn for the days of their youth. Mr. Rothenberg and Mr. Oehlkers think back fondly to a time of cutoffs, fresh air and grandma's farm. I had that, too. The childhood they recall is sweet in our memories but was crafted around a community in which an adult was always around to keep an eye on things.
I agree with Ms. Cutler that the United States is clinging to an antiquated system, a system that is seeing our nation's boys fall through the educational cracks at alarming rates. And Finland would be a nice nation to emulate, Mr. Savage, if we could wrap our minds around thinking of our best and brightest college graduates as future teachers, with pay and respect on par with that of medicine, the law or banking.
Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Kuhlman need to talk. I'm interested in hearing more about full-day and year-round implementations that worked and failed. My sense from the letters is that the current educational system is far from perfect, and evaluated tinkering is needed.
Though I can appreciate the after-school programs that Ms. Grant and Mr. Paul discuss, my fear would be codifying a system in which some kids go to after-school programs and others opt out. I wish to see all kids, regardless of means, participating in the full breadth of literacy and hands-on offerings.
This is not about taking away our children's precious childhood. We are medicating kids to sit still and pay attention, so that they can put a laserlike focus on materials that are less than invigorating. Can we try something new, adding more physical activity and different types of curriculum to stimulate different learning pathways?

B-C Bunsen Burner
When burned, every element of the periodic table produces a unique color -- a fingerprint of fire. Boron burns as a bright Kelly green. Calcium is brick red. Today we know the Bunsen burner best for its role in high-school chemistry classrooms, but it's also the tool that led to the fine chemical analysis made possible by spectroscopy. Other laboratory burners had been made earlier, but Robert Bunsen's, first built in 1855, produced a steady, very hot and, most important, colorless flame by allowing someone to control the mix of flammable gas and air. The change allowed scientists to more easily identify substances, and in smaller quantities than before. Bunsen himself used the burner to help discover two new elements this way, cesium and rubidium -- and, according to legend, to test Cuban tobacco, which burns with a dark crimson flame. Maggie Koerth-Baker
Cat Videos 
On May 9, 2006, ''Sanchey'' uploaded a choppy 69-second video to YouTube, ''Puppy vs. Cat,'' showing a cat facing down golden retriever puppies. The first comment expressed wordless perplexity: ''... ...?'' But it clearly filled a need. To date, the video has been viewed more than 15 million times.
A Google trend analysis of the term ''cat video'' reveals that searches for the phrase peaked two months before ''Puppy vs. Cat'' appeared. But that hasn't stopped millions of cat videos from being uploaded to YouTube. The most viewed, ''Surprised Kitty,'' has been watched more than 69 million times. Last year, the first cat-video festival at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis attracted 10,000 fans.
Amusing footage of cats predates YouTube. Two of them were filmed swatting each other while wearing boxing gloves in 1894 at Thomas Edison's studio, and an unemployed graphic designer named Charlie Schmidt recorded his cat Fatso playing a keyboard in 1986. It wasn't until 2009, however, that Fatso -- by then deceased -- gained fame on YouTube as ''Keyboard Cat,'' inspiring dozens of remixes and becoming his own meme. Schmidt, who now presides over a Keyboard Cat marketing empire, explains the appeal: ''The Internet is about randomness,'' he says. ''And cats are random by nature.'' Dashka Slater
Cleats
In the United States, the baseball cleat is nearly as old as the sport itself, showing up in the 1860s. Football cleats arrived around the same time. (An employee at Spalding named George Pierce is recognized for inventing the cleated baseball and football shoe for mainstream commercial use; they were sold for 30 cents a pair.) But as an idea, the cleat begins with soccer. Henry VIII wore the first soccer shoes of record; in 1526, his boot inventory included 37 velvet pairs, two sets for fencing and a leather pair for soccer. By the mid-1800s, British factory workers were apparently playing soccer in their heavy steel-toed work boots; it was said that they hammered rounded-metal studs into the soles. Several soccer-shoe manufacturers sprang up in Europe in the early 20th century, but cleats got their biggest boost in Weimar Germany, when two brothers, Adolf and Rudolf, founded the Dassler Brothers shoe factory in 1924, in their mother's laundry room in Bavaria. Among their signature wares were soccer shoes that accommodated different studs for different playing conditions. After a bitter feud between the brothers reached fever pitch in 1943, during an Allied bomb raid, Adolf founded Adidas, and Rudolf founded Puma. The rival companies drove innovations in the soccer cleat for the rest of the 20th century. The Puma Super Atom football boot of the 1950s, for example, revolutionized the cleat with screw-in plastic or rubber studs. Lindsay Crouse
Could a ''linen cloth made to fit the glans'' block syphilis? In the mid-1500s, the Italian doctor Gabriello Fallopio claimed he tested such a sheath on 1,100 men and that not one became infected. By the 18th century, Europeans were making condoms from animal intestines and using them as contraception as well as to prevent disease. (The Chinese tried oiled silk paper, the Japanese fine leather or tortoiseshell.) According to his memoirs, Casanova entertained ladies by blowing up his condoms like balloons.
Condoms became cheap and widely available after the companies Hancock and Goodyear began vulcanizing rubber in 1844. Concerns about variable quality eased after liquid latex manufacturing techniques improved in the 1930s and the Food and Drug Administration started imposing uniform standards: Condoms were now ready for mass promotion. During World War II, the United States Army required the stores on its bases to stock them. A generation earlier, with only restraint to protect the troops, the military had lost nearly seven million days of active duty to sexually transmitted diseases. Emily Bazelon
Cuisinart
Carl Sontheimer, the founder of Cuisinart, didn't invent the food processor -- credit for that most likely belongs to a German company, Electrostar, whose Starmix was introduced in the 1940s. And the Cuisinart, which came out in 1973, was actually a modified version of the Magimix, made by the French company Robot-Coupe. Sontheimer's genius was to market his own device so effectively that only ''Cuisinart'' is a household name, synonymous with ''food processor.''
Sontheimer was an engineer -- he invented a microwave direction finder used on a NASA moon mission -- who at age 53 sold his electronics company, planning to retire. Instead, he kept inventing. Greatly impressed by the food processors that he saw in France, he focused on making a high-performing, great-looking product. To many American consumers it seemed at first like an overpriced blender. It wasn't until Sontheimer lined up endorsements from celebrity chefs like Julia Child and James Beard that the Cuisinart became a must-have for any serious home cook. James Vlahos

HEADLINE: Currency

BYLINE: By JACOB GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
Around 600 B.C., the rulers of the Asia Minor kingdom of Lydia had a problem. They had a whole lot of electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, but not the technology to regulate the proportion of the two precious metals. So Lydian officials began stamping images on bean-size lumps of electrum, helping guarantee the value of each. And with that, the first pieces of Western currency entered circulation.
The Greeks, who had long been trading precious metals, like other civilizations, were impressed by the Lydian system. Soon, virtually every Greek state was minting silver. Over the millenniums that followed, currency became easier to exchange and more abstract until people didn't have to exchange anything physical at all. 
COWRIE SHELLS
Cowrie shells ''have been used as money for at least as long, and in at least as many parts of the world, as coins have,'' Catherine Eagleton, a curator at the British Museum, says. The thumbnail-size shells -- Latin name: Cypraea moneta -- were used in China as far back as the 16th century B.C., as well as in India and Africa. Cowries have a lot going for them as money: they're uniform, they're a convenient size, they're hard to counterfeit. They were a relatively stable currency in Africa until the 19th century, when another cowrie shell, the Monetaria annulus, appeared in huge quantities, helping to trigger massive inflation that all but wiped out what remained of the shell economy.
GIANT STONE DISCS
Many hundreds of years ago -- no one knows exactly when -- people from Yap, a tiny island in the South Pacific, started sailing in canoes to another island hundreds of miles away to carved giant stone discs, some as tall as themselves, from limestone quarries. The discs were hard to take home (canoe, open ocean, giant stone disc, etc.), but for those who succeeded, the stones became a kind of protomoney. ''They might be given for a marriage gift,'' says Scott Fitzpatrick, a University of Oregon archaeologist who has studied the island. ''If there was a raid on the village and you lost a warrior, you might pay the other village some stone money to get the corpse back for a proper burial.''
CASH
In what is now Sichuan Province in China, in the late 900s, coins were made of iron. This was a major hassle. If you wanted a pound of salt, says Richard Von Glahn, a historian at U.C.L.A., you needed a pound and a half of iron coins. An ounce of silver ran more than 90 pounds of iron coins. In a landlocked region surrounded by mountains, hundreds of years before the invention of mechanized transport, it was more than slightly inconvenient.
Eventually, local merchants began to create their own ''exchange bills,'' a kind of paper money, to create receipts for consumers who needed to transport their money. In 1024, the government stepped in and started issuing notes in standard denominations, which showed that paper money could be viable.
CIGARETTES
Cigarettes were used as prison currency at Stalag VIIA, a P.O.W. camp in Nazi Germany. On exchange boards in the barracks, prisoners listed what they wanted to buy or sell, with the price presented in cigarettes. Traders bought bread with cigarettes on the day rations came in, when food was abundant and cheap, and sold the bread for more cigarettes a few days later, when provisions were scarce. You could buy on credit (four cigarettes for treacle, five if you couldn't pay until the next week) and there was even a futures market (pay today to get bread next week). One prisoner bought up rations of coffee, tea and chocolate and started a coffee stall -- hot drinks, two cigarettes a cup. He paid people in cigarettes to gather fuel so he could boil the water.
CACAO BEANS AND COTTON CLOTH
The Aztecs, who ruled present day Central Mexico in the 15th century, used two kinds of currency: cacao beans for everyday shopping and cotton cloth for big-ticket items. ''If you wanted to buy a taco at the marketplace, you'd use cacao beans,'' Michael E. Smith, an archaeologist at Arizona State University, says. An avocado cost three cacao beans; a turkey cost 100. The system worked because beans didn't grow in the central part of the empire, so for the most part, people couldn't grow their own money.
A piece of cloth was worth about 100 times as much as a cacao bean, and cotton money was used for things like jewelry (25 pieces of cotton could buy a pair of gold lip plugs) and paying taxes. Cotton, like cacao, didn't grow in the Aztec capital, though Smith found evidence of cotton production in settlements not too far from the center. ''These people were spinning like mad, because they could get ahead,'' he said.
ELECTRONIC MONEY
In 2007, Vodafone, the British telecom giant, and Safaricom, a Kenyan mobile operator, worked together on a program called M-Pesa that ultimately allowed people to make payments and transfer money with their mobile devices. The collaboration essentially propelled millions of people across hundreds of years of currency development -- from an era without institutionalized banking to the digital economy. Before M-Pesa, it took
some parents in rural areas three days to pay school fees: one to get to their bank to get money; another to deposit it at the school's bank; and a third to bring the receipt to the school. Now, the day before school starts is one of the busiest period for M-Pesa transactions. Six years later, more than 15 million Kenyans have M-Pesa accounts. Even in a country where only about 30 percent of the population is on the power grid. Currency has become an abstraction -- nothing more than numbers entered on a computer.
WAMPUM
Native Americans in the Northeastern United States exchanged wampum -- polished beads, typically made from shells and strung together -- and early European trappers started bringing wampum to use as part of their trade with the Indians. Before long, colonists in New Amsterdam and New England were using wampum as money among themselves. ''It was small change,'' says Louis Jordan, of Notre Dame, an expert on early American money. ''When you were buying a loaf of bread, you would use wampum.''
WHEAT
Samuel Willis, Harvard class of 1653, paid most of his tuition in wheat. So did a lot of his classmates. After all, hard currency could be tough to come by in the colonies, and commodities literally became money. In the Massachusetts Bay Colony, for example, standard prices were assigned to bushels of wheat, corn and grain.

P PB&J
''Try making little sandwiches . . . of three very thin layers of bread and two of filling, one of peanut paste, whatever brand you prefer, and currant or crab-apple jelly,'' Julia Davis Chandler wrote in November 1901 in The Boston Cooking-School Magazine of Culinary Science and Domestic Economics. ''The combination is delicious, and, so far as I know, original.'' This is the earliest reference to peanut butter and jelly, and it appeared before the ingredients were widely available -- you might have had to grind your own peanuts. It would be a while before the sandwich became a hit among those it's most associated with: children. That happened later, after peanut butter became available in jars in supermarkets and was marketed to children in the 1930s. (The invention of sliced and packaged bread in 1928 also increased the sandwich's popularity.) 
Jon Krampner, the author of ''Creamy & Crunchy,'' a history of peanut butter, says that PB&J satisfies three American desires: it's sweet, it's nutritious and it's quick. That combination of qualities might be what prompted New York board of education officials, through a W.P.A. project in the late 1930s, to provide peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as part of a free-lunch program in schools. Maya Lau
Pop-Up Store
Russ Miller did not invent the temporary store when he opened Vacant in January 2003, during fashion week in New York. But his pop-up store, as the type was sometimes called, was something different. It didn't peddle Christmas knickknacks or vacation accessories or closeout goods; it didn't promise to return next year. The merchandise -- shoes, clothes, even some artwork -- was stylish and the setting exciting, or at least novel: its appearance was a surprise, and it vanished quickly. It was an experience as much as a transaction.
Miller took his inspiration from stores he saw in Tokyo in 1999 -- shops that drew long lines of customers with limited-edition merchandise, sold everything in stock and then closed until more goods arrived. Miller's first pop-up, in London in 2001, ''was very extremely difficult to pull off,'' he says. But the idea clicked on 43 Mercer Street two years later. Through its 30-day run, the store trafficked in the separate thrills of discovery and exclusivity -- you either came upon it by chance or shared in a secret.
The mystique wasn't sustainable when Miller began opening more elaborate pop-ups for well-known brands: with more money at stake, companies weren't eager to keep their stores secret. Now of course there are pop-up restaurants, pop-up hotels, even pop-up parks. Miller, however, doesn't seem particularly interested in the phenomenon, which has diluted his idea. '' 'Pop-up,' '' he says, ''has become such a buzzword now.'' Robb Mandelbaum
Previously On . . .
Previously on TV . . . there was no need for the ubiquitous preshow clip reels that remind television audiences what happened in previous weeks. Shows from ''Bonanza'' to ''The Love Boat'' were constructed to be watched as one-offs, and the rare series that wanted to catch audiences up used a hodgepodge of phrases: in the early '60s ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' began, ''In our last episode . . .''; in the mid-'70s ''The Rockford Files'' used, ''This is James Garner, and the following scenes are from . . .''; and Susan Harris's late-'70s sitcom ''Soap'' started with ''In the last episode . . . .''
This syntactically chaotic approach ended in 1982, when Steven Bochco's seminal police series ''Hill Street Blues'' began using the awkward but versatile ''Previously on . . .'' midway through its second season. The impetus for the phrase wasn't to make the show more comprehensible to new viewers but to assure regular ones they weren't watching a rerun. ''We thought, If you're tuning in and you've seen the previous week's episode, we don't want you to think you are just seeing it again,'' Bochco says. ''So we came up with 'Previously on.' '' Bochco didn't imagine it would become a permanent addition to the TV lexicon. ''It just seemed like the most economical way to do it,'' he says. Willa Paskin

HEADLINE: Looking Down on the Empire State

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Not since builders stuck a dirigible mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, eclipsing the Chrysler Building as the world's tallest tower, have developers been engaged in the type of skyscraper war that New York City is now witnessing.
But unlike the rivalries of the early 20th century, when buildings pierced the clouds to house corporate headquarters, this one involves no fewer than three alpine condominiums with penthouses on the 90th floor and higher, which are being built to woo big-spending American hedge funders, Chinese magnates and Russian oligarchs. Two of them will rise above the 1,250-foot-high Empire State Building, by 300 feet and 146 feet, respectively (although the Empire State Building officially tops off at 1,454 feet when its lighting rod is included).
Constructing the world's tallest towers is not for the faint of heart, and for modern-day building barons it might be the ultimate statement of ego. Call it an edifice complex, and think Donald J. Trump, whose name is plastered across his properties (and who in fact held the record for tallest residential building for a decade until recently). 
New York is a business town, however, and for developers, economics play as big a role as their desire to leave a mark on the skyline. ''It is really an economic proposition, a business plan that has to have logic behind it,'' said Carol Willis, the founder and director of the Skyscraper Museum. ''This is not some irrational fad.''
So while the marketing for these towers might have you believe that it's all about which living room can reach farthest into the sky, the reality is more nuanced. For a skyscraper project to succeed, many pieces of the development puzzle have to fall perfectly into place.
There is the often arduous and lengthy process of buying up air rights -- or unused development rights -- from adjacent properties; borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars in financing; and engineering architecturally unique structures that can rise 90 stories or more. The construction, meanwhile, includes costly techniques to prevent the towers from swaying in the wind, and thicker support walls and columns that can scuttle some layout plans. Then there is the pure physicality of hoisting materials and laborers 1,000 feet into the air, sometimes creating safety hazards and delays.
Considering these complexities, and the fact that the real estate market is just now recovering from one of its biggest crashes in decades, the pace of this skyscraper competition is breathtaking. Trump World Tower, opening in 2001 at 861 feet high -- its black edifice looming above the East River on First Avenue -- held the title of city's tallest residential building until 2011, with the opening of 8 Spruce Street, the 870-foot undulating rental building at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. Since then, developers have begun six separate projects that will shatter 8 Spruce's record.
And even those that don't quite break that record are marketing their height as a selling point. At 56 Leonard Street, for example, the Herzog & De Meuron-designed condominium is just 821 feet in height, but it has made much of the fact it will be the tallest residential building in TriBeCa, charging as much as $50 million for a penthouse. The competition is even spreading beyond Manhattan, with the tallest tower in Queens, a 50-story condominium in Long Island City, now under way.
It is not surprising that in a city known for its outsized personalities, many of these projects involve New York's most conspicuous developers. Harry B. Macklowe, for example, is developing 432 Park Avenue, the 96-story condominium in Midtown that, at 1,396 feet, will be the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere when it is completed in 2015. Best known for his buccaneering style, Mr. Macklowe is a poster child for the last real estate boom and bust, mostly because at the cycle's pinnacle in 2007, he spent an astounding $7 billion to acquire seven Midtown towers, only to lose them in the crash.
Mr. Macklowe began envisioning 432 Park in 2006, when he bought the former Drake Hotel. But he loaded the property with debt and was soon facing foreclosure. CIM Group, a private equity firm, eventually stepped in to save him, although he remains a co-developer. More than one-third of the units are now in contract for nearly $1 billion in potential sales, including a $95 million penthouse that could set a price record if it closes.
Seemingly a success, 432 Park has faced its challenges, said Mr. Macklowe recently during an interview at the condominium's sales office; he was dressed in a tailored navy suit. ''It looks easy,'' he said, ''but that is like seeing Ted Williams or Joe DiMaggio hit a home run and saying it looks easy.''
The sales office, on the 21st floor of the GM Building on Fifth Avenue, sits 100 feet shy of the lowest floors of 432 Park's condominium residences, giving potential buyers just a hint of the views to come. But the housing of the sales office there was in some ways a curious choice. In 2003, Mr. Macklowe broke a record in buying the GM Building for $1.4 billion, then used it as collateral on that spectacular $7 billion real estate bet that soured; he rents his offices there.
Where Mr. Macklowe is brash -- he performed in the Off Broadway show ''Old Jews Telling Jokes'' and sometimes reverts to a period accent while telling stories -- Gary Barnett, the developer of the tower that may eventually eclipse 432 Park for the Western Hemisphere record, is understated.
Mr. Barnett is by some measures the city's most active developer. Indeed One57, the 90-story, 1,004-foot-tall tower he is building at 157 West 57th Street, was to have taken the hemisphere record until it was supplanted by 432 Park. But he may yet reclaim the title with his planned 227 West 57th. Just west of One57, the tower has enough air rights to rise 1,550 feet; a feature will be the city's first Nordstrom department store.
Born Gershon Swiatycki on the Lower East Side, Mr. Barnett, an Orthodox Jew who has 10 children, has always been a mercurial character in New York real estate circles. Formerly a diamond trader in Belgium, he rose to prominence in 2005, when he unsuccessfully challenged Bruce Ratner with a rival bid for Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. A key to his success has been his quiet ability to amass large parcels from individual property owners in prime Manhattan locations. The process can take years, and requires slow and deliberate strategizing. For One57, for example, Mr. Barnett began buying the air rights some 16 years ago.
''Building tall is not about bragging rights,'' he said recently, during a conversation in the nondescript conference room of his offices on Third Avenue; he was wearing slacks and a mock turtleneck. ''What drives the building is design, the views, the economics.'' He built One57 to its full height ''because we couldn't get in all the air rights any other way -- once you have it, the ability to build it, I didn't want to just throw it away.''
Still, deciding a building's height is a judgment call, and ''there have been times that I had air rights but I didn't end up using them,'' he said. Extreme height adds time and uncertainty to a project, as well as construction costs. One57, for instance, was waylaid when Hurricane Sandy snapped off a crane boom and left it dangling far above the street. Mr. Barnett is weighing these considerations for his Nordstrom property, he said, and said he may choose to forego the full 1,550 feet.
Perhaps the biggest factor in determining height is the views. As Ms. Willis put it, ''Views are the reason to capitalize on the sky -- they are the thing that allows you to ask very high prices.'' And the most desirable views in New York are of Central Park, which is one reason many of these towers are clustered in and around 57th Street.
Zoning in Midtown also helps, since it can allow for extremely tall buildings. In the case of 432 Park, for example, the floor plate was 8,500 square feet and Mr. Macklowe had some 500,000 square feet to utilize. ''So the height was just a matter of arithmetic,'' he said.
''We didn't start out by saying we wanted to build the tallest residential building in Manhattan,'' he added, ''but as we got there, and saw it was within the zoning, we went for it. It was only later that we recognized the significance of using this as a tag line.''
''It isn't as if tall towers are some great statement of testosterone, or some masculine symbol,'' summarized MaryAnne Gilmartin, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, which developed 8 Spruce. ''It has been proven time and again that height and views are one of the great attributes of city living. If you can live in the sky, then why not?''

D-I Insider Trading
Making money by trading on information that only insiders have is as old as trading itself. But the laws that make insider trading illegal are much younger. Depending on where you live, the crime may only be a few decades old (in Britain and other Western European countries). In some developing countries, it hasn't even been outlawed yet. 
In the U.S., the illegality of insider trading was first thrust on the national stage after a skirmish in 1904 between two reprobate jerks. Francisco Gutierrez Repide, a director of the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, an all-but-defunct firm, was quietly negotiating a deal for the Philippine government to pay a premium for its land when he bought 800 shares of the company from the wife of Richard P. Strong. Needless to say, Repide didn't mention the impending deal, and he got a sweet price. Strong and his wife, Eleanor, learned of the deceit only after the land was sold and their former shares skyrocketed. (By that point, Strong, an American scholar of tropical diseases, was conducting experiments that killed 13 Filipino prisoners of war.) In 1909 the Supreme Court returned his shares, but insider trading remained rarely prosecuted for decades. It wasn't until the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 that the government created a strong punishment for the crime. Offenders can now be fined triple the damages of their insider-trading scheme and receive jail time as well.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the S.E.C. has prosecuted more than 250 cases of insider trading, including that of the hedge-fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam. That's far more than the 150 defendants charged in relation to the actual crisis. But this doesn't mean that the government views insider trading as a greater financial threat than banks peddling toxic securities. According to Marc Steinberg, who wrote the standard account of insider-trading law, securities violations are very complicated to explain to juries. Insider-trading cases, though, have, for better or worse, become easier to explain in court. Adam Davidson
Dog Park
When the City of Berkeley demolished a swath of houses in the late 1970s to build the Bay Area Rapid Transit system underground, residents began to gather in the space that had been cleared. Many of them were neighbors, who also brought their dogs, and before long a woman named Doris Richards encouraged the group to turn the space into a dog park. ''There were 'No Dogs' signs all over the place,'' Gail Green, part of that original cohort, says of Berkeley at the time. ''We needed to have a place to go and let the dogs run.''
What started as an experimental dog park in 1979 became officially incorporated in 1986. Letters from admiring dog owners in other cities poured in, requesting advice on how to start their own parks.
In 2002, the Parks Department erected a monument to thank Richards for her vision. ''It's a genuine fire hydrant painted blue and put next to a tree where chasing dogs won't run into it,'' Richards wrote in 2008, the year before she died. ''People said, 'Doesn't she know what they'll do to this?' I think it's funny, and it's fitting.''Jessica Gross
Fast Fashion
In the spring of 1964, a 25-year-old fashion illustrator in London named Barbara Hulanicki designed a pink gingham dress inspired by one in which Brigitte Bardot had been photographed. A friend of Hulanicki's, an editor at The Mirror who wanted to do a feature about inexpensive fashion, told her she would include the design as long as it cost no more than 25 shillings. Hulanicki agreed, and within 24 hours of publication she received close to 4,000 orders. That success paved the way for Biba, a store that Hulanicki and her husband opened in Kensington in the fall of that year. Biba (which eventually expanded, moved several times and then closed, in 1976) pioneered the model of cheap, youthful designs, with a quick turnaround time -- Greek tailors a few neighborhoods away did the work -- and a steady supply of fresh inventory. ''We had daily deliveries, like bagels,'' Hulanicki, now an interior designer, says. Twiggy, a regular customer, helped make the mod designs a defining look of the era. Shoppers traveled from all over Europe to buy ''bales of clothing,'' Hulanicki says, because of the unusually low prices. ''We had this market that was very, very greedy for clothes,'' Hulanicki says. ''And we were the only ones who were doing it at knockoff prices.'' Susan Dominus
Gay Marriage
After Nero married a man in a public ceremony and accorded him the honors of an empress, same-sex unions continued in Rome for more than three centuries -- until 342, when, under the rising influence of Christianity, ''exquisite punishment'' was the fate for same-sex couples. In the 1970s, gay couples in Minnesota, Kentucky, Washington and Ohio sought marriage licenses and were rejected. Courts upheld those decisions ''because of the nature of marriage itself.'' Andrew Sullivan challenged that premise in 1989, in a cover essay for The New Republic. Sullivan argued that abiding by the mainstream conventions of matrimony would point the way toward equality for gay people. Now it sounds obvious, but at the time Sullivan was fiercely at odds with both the right and the left. As he observed, ''It's one of the richest ironies of our society's blind spot toward gays that essentially conservative social goals should have the appearance of being so radical.''
Gay rights activists were slow to come around. ''I might as well have been speaking Swahili,'' Sullivan wrote recently in a blog post about the reception he received in the early 1990s. Then, in 1996, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman only, barring gay couples from receiving federal benefits. The act proved Sullivan's point: The inability to marry made gay people separate and unequal.
That's the position the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court took in 2003. ''Without the right to marry -- or more properly, the right to choose to marry -- one is excluded from the full range of human experience and denied full protection of the laws,'' Chief Justice Margaret Marshall wrote. Her order granting gays the right to wed in the state completed Sullivan's act of invention. By this summer, gay marriage is expected to be legal in 12 states, Canada and parts of Europe.

Glass Ceiling
Eventually it would come to define how a generation of women viewed their working lives, but when Marilyn Loden used the expression extemporaneously at a Women's Action Alliance conference in May 1978, she says it fell on deaf ears. Loden was a manager in New York Telephone's human-resources department, where she had seen reams of company data showing that gender bias had stymied the careers of women there. ''I used to say that there are so many capable women here, and they're hitting their heads on the ceiling,'' she recalls today. Then, when she happened to be on that panel listening to relatively powerful women repeat the conventional wisdom of the day, she says, she grew frustrated and sharpened her language. ''Because we were talking about self-image and what you see in the mirror'' -- the panel's title was ''Mirror, Mirror on the Wall'' -- ''the whole glass metaphor kind of came to me. It's not what we see in ourselves but what we don't see. It's not what's in front of us, but what's above us.''
The other panelists, among them the editor of Working Woman magazine, ''thought that I was out of my mind,'' says Loden, who has been a consultant on workplace diversity since 1981. ''I didn't walk out of there thinking I really said something important.'' Whether or not she coined the phrase, it didn't take hold until it appeared in a Wall Street Journal headline eight years later -- and not until, according to Loden, there was a critical mass of frustrated women saying to themselves: ''I went to all the training, I checked off all the boxes, I threw out my whole wardrobe and here I am: executive assistant.'' Robb Mandelbaum
Guitar Solo
During the electric guitar's toddler days in the early 1930s, its players were largely tasked with carrying the rhythm while brass and reed instruments soloed in the spotlight. The Smithsonian's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation credits Eddie Durham with the first amplified guitar solo on record -- he spins some wry lines on the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra's 1935 swing number ''Hittin' the Bottle.'' But it took Charlie Christian to advance the form toward its perpetual brash adolescence.
''A handful of guys played electric guitar solos before Charlie,'' says G.E. Smith, the former lead guitarist for Bob Dylan and bandleader for ''Saturday Night Live,'' ''but he was the first to understand the capabilities of electricity. His phrasing, his sustain, the way he pushed the amp to the edge of distortion and had this cocky attitude -- Charlie knew exactly what instrument was in his hands.''
Born in Bonham, Tex., in 1916, Christian came to fame in Benny Goodman's band, and his solos first appeared on records in 1939. But it's a series of after-hours recordings made at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem in 1941 that most anticipate future guitar heroes. Christian's spiraling choruses on ''Stompin' at the Savoy,'' for example, crackle with the confidence of a musician unwilling to strum away behind a trumpeter. ''If you dropped Charlie Christian into the '60s,'' Smith says, ''he would've made music like Hendrix. He was that advanced.''
Christian presaged the soloing guitar wizard in another more unfortunate way: He died young, from tuberculosis, when he was 25. David Marchese

HEADLINE: How Much Would You Pay to See Michael Bolton?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, I met Barry Arakelian a minute after he got scammed at a Tom Petty concert. Arakelian had paid a scalper $375 for two tickets (face value: $135) outside the Beacon Theater in Manhattan. The tickets, however, turned out to be fakes, and Arakelian, who was getting the evil eye from his girlfriend, approached a nearby police officer for help. But the officer said that he couldn't do anything unless Arakelian could locate the scalper in the crush of people. By that point the scalper was long gone; Arakelian was embarrassed. Naturally, a minute later, he turned and shouted to no one in particular, ''Who's got two tickets?'' 
Within a few moments, a massive man in a Mets hat offered him two tickets for $450. It seemed like a lot, but Arakelian accepted almost immediately. And as I watched him enter the Beacon -- these tickets worked -- I was struck by the economic oddness of the whole experience. Tom Petty is a scalper's dream. He may still be able to sell out Madison Square Garden, but he often prefers smaller venues like the Beacon, where there is a large demand for a shorter supply of tickets. Petty also insists on keeping tickets below market price. And while I can see why a veteran artist would try to accommodate his fans, I also wondered why Petty and his promoter would price tickets so low when there were clearly people willing to pay much, much more.
Few products are so underpriced that an entire subsidiary industry exists to take advantage of the discrepancy. When there is excess demand for a new car or phone, some people might sell theirs at a markup on eBay, but there's nobody across the street from the dealership or Best Buy offering it right away for double the sticker price; there certainly isn't an entire corporation built on exploiting companies' failure to properly price items initially. Yet concerts and sporting events consistently price their tickets low enough that street scalpers risk jail time to hawk marked-up tickets, and StubHub makes hundreds of millions a year in revenue.
Most concertgoers don't usually consider ticket prices as incredibly low. After barely keeping up with inflation for decades, concert prices have risen wildly since 1996, or around the time when baby boomers, who helped start the industry, aged into a lot more disposable income. (It was also around this time that Internet piracy made the music industry more reliant on concert revenues.) These days, prices can seem incredibly high. Barbra Streisand, who charged more than $1,000 for some seats at a concert in Rome, inspired so much anger that she canceled the show. Yet to an economist, the very existence of scalpers and companies like StubHub proves that tickets are far too cheap to balance supply and demand. Pascal Courty, an economist at the University of Victoria, in Canada, who has spent the better part of 20 years studying the secondary-ticket market, has identified two distinct pricing styles. Some artists, like Streisand and Michael Bolton, seem to charge as much as the market will bear -- better seats generally cost a lot more; shows in larger cities, with higher demand, are far more expensive, too. (If you want to catch Bolton on the cheap, head to Western New York.) The second group comprises notable acts, like Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam, that usually keep prices far below market value and offer only a few price points. An orchestra seat to see the Boss in Jersey costs only about $50 more than the nosebleeds in Albany.
Springsteen's style might seem more altruistic, but performers who undercharge their fans can paradoxically reap higher profits than those who maximize each ticket price. It's a strategy similar to the one employed by ventures like casinos and cruise ships, which take a hit on admission prices but make their money once the customers are inside. Concert promoters can overcharge on everything from beer sales to T-shirts, and the benefits of low-priced tickets can accrue significantly over the years as loyal fans return. In part, this explains why artists like Springsteen and Petty are content to undercharge at the gate while others, perhaps wary of their own staying power, are eager to capitalize while they can.
But by leaving money on the table, Springsteen and his ilk might be doing their fans an inadvertent disservice. Jared Smith, the president of Ticketmaster North America, told me that the artists who charge the least tend to see the most scalping. Springsteen and others have angrily denounced scalping at their shows, but their prices are guaranteeing the very existence of that secondary market, which has become ever more sophisticated over the years. Many scalpers now use computer programs to monopolize ticket buying when seats go on sale, which forces many fans to buy from resellers. One of the surest ways to eliminate scalping, Smith told me, is to charge a more accurate price in the first place.
As an industry leader, with access to nearly limitless data, Ticketmaster can determine fairly precisely just how much fans are willing to pay for every kind of show. Generally speaking, Smith says, artists who charged a lot more for the best 1,000 or so seats would reduce the incentive for scalpers to buy these tickets; it would also allow artists to charge even less for the rest of the seats in the house. Kid Rock told me that on his forthcoming tour, he is planning on charging a lot more than usual for ''platinum seating'' so that all other seats -- including those in the first two rows -- can be around $20. ''It's a smart thing for me to do,'' he said. ''We're going to make money; I'm going to make money. I want to prove there is a better way to do this.''
Smith, meanwhile, spends much of his time these days trying to persuade artists that increasing the price of their top tickets to near the point where supply meets demand is not greedy but equitable for their fans. ''Every time I convince an act, we get three more artists to sign up,'' he says. ''There's more and more acceptance.''
The impact is already being felt on the street. Outside the Petty show, one scalper told me that, back in the '80s and '90s, he made more than $70,000 a year reselling tickets. But now he is lucky to clear $30,000. ''A $300 night is a home run now,'' he said. His business has suffered tremendously since 2007, when New York State legalized ticket reselling and helped supply meet demand. ''StubHub is killing us,'' he said. Indeed, Internet-based ticket reselling has doubled in the past five years and is now projected to be a roughly $4.5 billion business. After fighting the secondary market for years, some have surrendered. The Mets, like 27 other baseball teams, have signed a deal with StubHub, and the Yankees recently signed one with Ticketmaster, to create a formal secondary market. The organizations might as well get a piece of the action.
This doesn't seem to bother fans. Barry Arakelian told me that he had a great time at the Petty show, regardless of the fact that he paid $825 to see a show that should have cost about $200. He would have paid even more, he said, if he knew the money was going to an artist he admired. ''And if I paid the higher price,'' he said proudly, ''you'd shut out the scalpers.''
Deep thoughts this week:
1. It seems as if scalping shouldn't exist in a rational economic world.
2. The easiest way to encourage scalpers is to keep prices low.
3. So who is greedier: Streisand or Springsteen?

CORRECTION-DATE: June 9, 2013

 CORRECTION:
The ''It's the Economy'' column on Page 16 this weekend, about ticket scalping, misstates the number of baseball teams that have signed a deal with StubHub. It is 28 total, not the Mets and 28 other teams.

HEADLINE: Aiming for the Hybrid's Sweet Spot

BYLINE: By BRADLEY BERMAN

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif. -- Using electricity as an automotive fuel, to most Americans, seems as alien as powering a car by Higgs bosons. Electricity, they'd say, might be fine for fueling exotic sport machines made by California start-ups -- or for tiny Japanese mobility pods -- but not the family sedans of America's highways.
What, then, should we make of Ford Fusions and Honda Accords suddenly sprouting plugs and growing battery packs? Both of these mainstream, top-selling cars have recently arrived as plug-in hybrids, expanding their maker's existing lines of gas-only models and conventional hybrids.
You can think of a plug-in as an overachieving hybrid, a vehicle that runs largely on electrons for local miles and then mostly on gasoline for longer trips. That combination -- a broadly appealing solution that splits the difference between petroleum power and purely electric cars -- has the potential to make battery propulsion acceptable to motorists put off by matters like limited driving range. 
The Ford Fusion Energi, however, is less about the blending of electrons and hydrocarbons for power and more about the car's dual nature: the ability of a handsome family sedan to switch, superhero-style, from one driving persona to another.
When its 7.6 kilowatt-hour battery pack is fully charged -- that takes about 2.5 hours from a 240-volt source -- the driver can invoke the car's jazzy smooth electric-vehicle self. In the first two days of a week with the sedan, I used a button near the gearshift to select the EV Now mode, which keeps the car driving almost exclusively on its battery. In 36 miles of driving punctuated by frequent electric top-ups, I was effectively operating a spacious 3,913-pound zero-emissions electric sedan, not using a drop of gasoline.
The car's roomy interior, comfortable ride and taut steering were a welcome change from the toylike robotic feel of the Nissan Leaf compact E.V. that is my usual transportation. Among sedans that can operate on battery power, in my view, the Fusion Energi is surpassed in size and style only by the Tesla Model S.
Both cars appropriated Aston Martin's signature grille to inject some James Bond flair in their four-door profiles. But don't take the similarity too far: compared with the rip-roaring Model S, the Fusion Energi has swallowed a dose of Xanax. It glides sedately through city streets. The acceleration on highway on-ramps is adequate, but when driving solely on electricity, the car is not even as zippy as a Leaf.
Things change about 17 or 18 miles down the road, when Dr. Electric transforms into Mr. Combustion. With gasoline supplying power via Ford's 2-liter 4-cylinder engine, and assisted by the electric motor and battery pack that had been operating solo in E.V. mode, the car's output jumps to 188 horsepower. It feels like twice the oomph.
Ford has perfected smooth transitions between gas and electric power sources, so passengers have little evidence of the handoff. The cabin of the Ford Fusion Energi is also among the quietest I have experienced. Close the door and you feel practically vacuum-sealed, buffered from engine noise or vibration. Noise-cancellation technology is used to counteract any whine from electrical components.
After the switch from E.V. to hybrid operation, there is an obvious sign that hydrocarbons are powering the Fusion: the planted feel on the road now takes on a sporty quality. It becomes a fun family cruiser, especially shining on the highway, territory not usually associated with E.V. prowess.
An 80-mile round-trip drive between Berkeley to San Jose -- usually an anxious experience in my Leaf requiring a 55 m.p.h. pace to conserve energy -- was carefree in the Fusion Energi, which offers a total range of 620 miles.
Yet the Transformer-like shift has an impact on efficiency. There were several days early in the week when I frequently charged throughout the day, and therefore remained all E.V. As a result, fuel economy broke past 100 miles per gallon of gas (not including the electricity you put in the battery). The E.P.A. pegs average combined city-highway fuel at 100 m.p.g.e. A Toyota Prius plug-in, for reference, is rated at 95 m.p.g.e.
Trips that started all-electric for the first 20 miles or so but continued on for another 50 or miles registered around 75 m.p.g. And the day's travel to San Jose and back -- when I tested the limits of legal highway speeds, with air-conditioning and audio blasting -- fuel economy was a respectable 38 miles per gallon. Over the course of 227 miles, the Fusion Energi averaged 55 m.p.g.
For all of Ford's success in turning the Fusion into a 100 m.p.g. vehicle and making it a joy to pilot, its engineers made a critical mistake: they did not find a good spot for the E.V. battery pack, shoehorning it between back seat and trunk, reducing the trunk space to 8.2 cubic feet, from 12. The resulting odd dimensions leave room for about two carry-on suitcases and little else.
The 2013 Accord Plug-In, which I drove for a few days right after the Fusion, has the same problem of filling its trunk with batteries -- an even more drastic reduction from 15.5 cubic feet in the gas-powered Accord Touring model down to 8.6 cubic feet.
The Accord offers no mode to enforce E.V.-only driving. The battery can deliver the equivalent of 55 horsepower, so the gas engine is programmed to come on with very little provocation. This ''blended'' approach puts the Accord in the league of conventional hybrids like the Prius. The gas engine, electric motor, or both, are used in whatever way the car's computer decides is the most efficient.
The combination of power and fuel efficiency is impressive: the Accord Plug-In Hybrid delivered 49 m.p.g. on my three-day 188-mile trip around Southern California, during which I had little access to a charging plug.
With an E.P.A. rating of 115 m.p.g.e., the Accord Plug-In is the most fuel-efficient sedan in America, Honda says. That may clinch the deal for some shoppers, but others will conclude that the exterior styling, which hardly stirs emotions, is reason enough to shop elsewhere.
The Accord is a generic-looking car. Its interior is a hot mess of competing chromes, and the dashboard graphics reflect a Y2K aesthetic -- not good for a high-tech car. The wheel covers, added to improve aerodynamics on the plug-in Accord, are ultra-plastic. The charging port door wobbled on its hinge. The key fob on my test car malfunctioned, failing to open the trunk.
The plug-in Accord is the first to use Honda's two-motor hybrid system. It takes a generation or two to calibrate these systems for smoothness, and Honda is not there yet.
Neither is Ford, if the goal of the Fusion Energi is to win customers by bringing plug-in technology to the brand's best-selling passenger vehicle.
A car may be perfectly executed in almost every way, but all is for naught if it is marred by one major flaw. Engineers at Ford and Honda alike need to figure out how to offer game-changing plug-in hybrid technology in its most popular models without shrinking the trunk in the process.
Trying to understand the economics of these plug-in vehicles could quickly short-circuit your brain, considering the dazzling number of trim options on comparable gas versions and the available federal tax credits and state rebates.
Here are the basics: The Honda Accord Plug-In, sold only in California and New York, starts at $40,570. After incentives, the price is about $1,000 above the gas-only V-6 278-horsepower Accord Touring, which comes with leather upholstery rather than the plug-in model's bland ''bio-foam'' interior.
The Ford Fusion Energi, available nationwide at select Ford dealers, is offered at $39,495. After incentives, it still costs over $1,000 more than the 47-m.p.g. Fusion Hybrid Titanium. The Titanium model brings along sharper 18-inch aluminum wheels, a more powerful audio system and goodies like a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Gas savings over a few years will chip away at the extra expense.
Even with at their premium prices, the Fusion Energi and Accord Plug-In Hybrid could have been satisfying to mainstream consumers looking for a middle-of-the-road vehicle that can run on electricity. But their pipsqueak trunks kill the deal.

Because automakers load up plug-in cars with amenities, better cost comparisons are between fuel-sipping plug-in models and the upscale gas or hybrid versions of the Fusion and Accord. After incentives, the Ford Fusion Energi is still over $1,000 more than the 47-m.p.g. Fusion Hybrid Titanium (with nicer 18-inch aluminum wheels and a better audio system). After incentives, the price of the Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid is about $1,000 higher than the gas-only 278-horsepower V-6 Accord Touring model with leather seats. (AU5)

HEADLINE: Progress At Work, But Mothers Still Pay a Price

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE COONTZ. 
Stephanie Coontz, a guest columnist, teaches at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.

 BODY:
HERE'S an old riddle: a boy and his father are in a car crash and the father is killed instantly. The boy is airlifted to the best hospital in the region and prepped for emergency surgery by one of the top surgeons in the country. The surgeon rushes in, sees the boy, and says ''I can't operate on this patient. He's my son.'' Who is the surgeon?
When I heard this riddle as a teenager back in 1962, I was totally stumped. Had the boy been adopted, and the surgeon was the birth father? 
It never occurred to me that the surgeon might be his mother.
How far we have come. Last month I attended my son's graduation from medical school, where more than half the members of his graduating class were female.
And yet last year, when the Boston University researchers Mikaela Wapman and Deborah Belle posed the same riddle to students there, 86 percent of those who had never heard the riddle still could not figure out that the surgeon was the boy's mother! It is an ironic indication of how far we have come in another direction that a higher number of students guessed that the boy had two gay fathers.
There is no denying that we have made great progress toward gender equality. Tomorrow is the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act, which was signed into law on June 10, 1963. At that time, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, women earned less than 60 percent of what men made. According to Philip Cohen, a University of Maryland sociologist, a female college graduate at that time, working full time year round, made less than the average male high school graduate.
Today women earn about 80 percent of what men make for full-time work, and education now outweighs gender as a determinant of wage rates. Because women now earn the majority of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees, we can expect the wage gap to narrow further in the future.
But it's not all good news, according to a report released Friday by the Council on Contemporary Families, of which I am co-chairwoman. It is a collection of papers assessing the progress toward gender equity in the last half-century. In one, by the economist Heidi Shierholz, we learn that more than a quarter of the convergence in wages has been a result of men's wage losses rather than women's wage gains. Even so, according to the economist Stephanie Seguino, the remaining wage gap means that on average, a woman has to work 52 years to earn what a man makes in 40 years. And at every educational level, women continue to earn less than men with the same credentials.
New calculations by the sociologist Leslie McCall show that most of the recent wage progress for women has occurred in the top 20 percent of earners (although they remain greatly underrepresented in top corporate leadership positions, as the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg reminds us).
Much of the progress that women have made in income parity has gone to childless women. Motherhood, writes the sociologist Joya Misra, is now a greater predictor of wage inequality than gender in the United States. According to her research, conducted with Michelle Budig at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, motherhood imposes about twice the earning penalty in the United States compared with what women face in countries that have expansive publicly financed child care systems.
But the motherhood penalty is not just related to the tendency of mothers to cut back their work hours because of lack of child care or other family support systems that allow them to continue working full time. The sociologist Shelley Correll at Stanford University points out that mothers earn 5 percent less per hour, per child, than comparable workers who are childless women. They are also less likely to be hired if they leave or try to change jobs.
Between 2004 and 2006, Professor Correll, then at Cornell, with her colleagues there sent fake résumés to employers who advertised high-status job openings. When a résumé indicated that the applicant was an officer in an elementary school parent-teacher association, thereby implying that she was a mother, employers were half as likely to call her back.
Today issues of gender equity are more complex than the blatant discrimination that the Equal Pay Act and its follow-up legislation addressed. We still lack comparable work legislation, so that jobs traditionally held by females are paid less even when they involve equal or more skills and training than traditionally male jobs. Both men and women still doubt women's capabilities, as the responses to the riddle show.
But we also face increasing inequality among women, so we need to not just hammer against the glass ceiling but also to raise the bottom floor on which so many low-income women remain stuck.

HEADLINE: Who's Minding the Schools?

BYLINE: By ANDREW HACKER and CLAUDIA DREIFUS. 
Andrew Hacker is an emeritus professor of political science at Queens College, City University of New York. Claudia Dreifus is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. They are working on a book about mathematics.

 BODY:
IN April, some 1.2 million New York students took their first Common Core State Standards tests, which are supposed to assess their knowledge and thinking on topics such as ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and a single matrix equation in a vector variable.
Students were charged with analyzing both fiction and nonfiction, not only through multiple-choice answers but also short essays. The mathematics portion of the test included complex equations and word problems not always included in students' classroom curriculums. Indeed, the first wave of exams was so overwhelming for these young New Yorkers that some parents refused to let their children take the test.
These students, in grades 3 through 8, are taking part in what may be the most far-reaching experiment in American educational history. By the 2014-15 academic year, public schools in 45 states and the District of Columbia will administer Common Core tests to students of all ages. (Alaska, Nebraska, Texas and Virginia have so far held out; Minnesota will use only the Common Core English test.) Many Catholic schools have also decided to implement the Common Core standards; most private, nonreligious schools have concluded that the program isn't for them. 
Many of these ''assessments,'' as they are called, will be more rigorous than any in the past. Whether the Common Core is called a curriculum or not, there's little doubt that teachers will feel pressured to gear much of their instruction to this annual regimen. In the coming years, test results are likely to affect decisions about grade promotion for students, teachers' job status and school viability.
It is the uniformity of the exams and the skills ostensibly linked to them that appeal to the Core's supporters, like Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Bill and Melinda Gates. They believe that tougher standards, and eventually higher standardized test scores, will make America more competitive in the global brain race. ''If we've encouraged anything from Washington, it's for states to set a high bar for what students should know to be able to do to compete in today's global economy,'' Mr. Duncan wrote to us in an e-mail.
But will national, ramped-up standards produce more successful students? Or will they result in unintended consequences for our educational system?
By definition, America has never had a national education policy; this has indeed contributed to our country's ambivalence on the subject. As it stands, the Common Core is currently getting hit mainly from the right. Tea Party-like groups have been gaining traction in opposition to the program, arguing that it is another intrusion into the lives of ordinary Americans by a faceless elite. While we don't often agree with the Tea Party, we've concluded that there's more than a grain of truth to their concerns.
The anxiety that drives this criticism comes from the fact that a radical curriculum -- one that has the potential to affect more than 50 million children and their parents -- was introduced with hardly any public discussion. Americans know more about the events in Benghazi than they do about the Common Core.
WHAT became the Common Core began quite modestly. Several years ago, many organizations, including the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, whose members are top-ranking state education officials, independently noticed that the content and scoring of high school ''exit'' tests varied widely between states. In 2006, for instance, 91 percent of students in Mississippi passed a mathematics exit exam on the first attempt, while only 65 percent did so in Arizona. At the same time, students' performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress often differed from the state results.
This was not just embarrassing: it looked unprofessional. The governors and the school chiefs decided to work together to create a single set of standards and a common grading criteria. Private funding, led by some $35 million in grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, allowed the coalition to spread its wings. Aligning tests became an opportunity to specify what every American child should know.
In 2009, an education consultant named David Coleman was retained to help develop the program, and he and other experts ended up specifying, by our count, more than 1,300 skills and standards. Mr. Coleman, a Rhodes scholar and the son of Bennington College's departing president, is known as a driven worker as well as for his distaste for personal memoir as a learning tool. Last year, he was selected to lead the College Board, which oversees A.P. exams and the SATs.
Of course, the 45 states that have decided to implement the Common Core did so willingly. While federal agencies did not have a role in the program's creation, the Obama administration signaled to states in 2009 that they should embrace the standards if they hoped to win a grant through the federal program known as Race to the Top.
For all its impact, the Common Core is essentially an invisible empire. It doesn't have a public office, a board of directors or a salaried staff. Its Web site lists neither a postal address nor a telephone number.
On its surface, the case for the Common Core is compelling. It is widely known that American students score well below their European and Asian peers in reading and math, an alarming shortfall in a competitive era. According to the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment, the United States ranks 24th out of 34 countries in ''mathematics literacy,'' trailing Sweden and the Czech Republic, and 11th in ''reading literacy,'' behind Estonia and Poland. (South Korea ranks first in both categories.) Under the Common Core, students in participating states will immediately face more demanding assignments. Supporters are confident that students will rise to these challenges and make up for our country's lag in the global education race. We are not so sure.
Students in Kentucky were the first to undergo the Common Core's testing regimen; the state adopted the standards in 2010. One year later, its students' scores fell across the board by roughly a third in reading and math. Perhaps one cannot blame the students, or the teachers -- who struggle to teach to the new, behemoth test that, in some cases, surpasses their curriculums -- for the drop in scores.
Here's one high school math standard: Represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and conjugation of complex numbers geometrically on the complex plane; use properties of this representation for computation. Included on New York state's suggested reading list for ninth graders are Doris Lessing, Albert Camus and Rainer Maria Rilke. (In many parts of the country, Kurt Vonnegut and Harper Lee remain the usual fare.)
More affluent students, as always, will have parental support. Private tutoring, already a growth industry, will become more important if passing scores on the Common Core are required for graduation. Despite worthy aims, the new standards may well deepen the nation's social divide.
The Common Core is not oblique in its aim: to instill ''college and career readiness'' in every American teenager -- in theory, a highly democratic ideal. In the past, students were unabashedly tracked, which usually placed middle-class students in academic courses and their working-class peers in vocational programs. New York City had high schools for cooking, printing and needle trades. (There was even one in Brooklyn called Manual Training.) Indeed, the aim of these schools was to prepare a slice of society for blue-collar life. Since the 1960s, this has been seen as undemocratic. Today, students are typically required to take algebra, so they will have more options upon graduation (should they graduate). The irony -- and tragedy -- is that students who don't surmount these hurdles now fall even further.
Already, almost one-quarter of young Americans do not finish high school. In Utah and Oklahoma, roughly 20 percent don't; the proportion rises to 32 percent in South Carolina and 42 percent in Nevada. What does the Common Core offer these students?
The answer is simple. ''College and career skills are the same,'' Ken Wagner, New York State's associate commissioner of education for curriculum, assessment and educational technology, told us. The presumption is that the kind of ''critical thinking'' taught in classrooms -- and tested by the Common Core -- improves job performance, whether it's driving a bus or performing neurosurgery. But Anthony Carnevale, the director of Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workforce, calls the Common Core a ''one-size-fits-all pathway governed by abstract academic content.''
IN sum, the Common Core takes as its model schools from which most students go on to selective colleges. Is this really a level playing field? Or has the game been so prearranged that many, if not most, of the players will fail?
Debate is now stirring within partisan circles. Glenn Beck sees the Common Core as ''leftist indoctrination.'' The Republican National Committee calls it ''an inappropriate overreach to standardize and control the education of our children.'' Republican governors and legislators in Indiana, Kansas, Georgia and several other states are talking about reconsidering their participation. Yet conservative scholars at the Manhattan and Fordham institutes laud it as promising ''a far more rigorous, content-rich, cohesive K-12 education.'' Some corporate C.E.O.'s favor it because they say it will upgrade the work force. Mr. Duncan is one of the lone liberal voices in support of the program. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, supports the plan, which she calls ''revolutionary.'' That said, she has called for a moratorium on judging teachers and schools by the first round of assessments, which she fears are sometimes being implemented hastily and without needed support.
For Diane Ravitch, a historian of education and former assistant education secretary, the program is predicated on ''the idea that you can't trust teachers.'' If we want our children taught from standardized scripts, she told us, let's say so and accept the consequences.
For our part, we're tired of seeing teachers cast as scapegoats, of all the carping over unions and tenure. It is time teachers are as revered in society as doctors or scientists, and allowed to work professionally without being bound by reams of rules.
Still, there's an upside to the Common Core's arrival. As the public better appreciates its sweep, there is likely to be much discussion about schools and what we want them to do. Ideally, this will involve a reconsideration of the contours of knowledge and the question of how we can become a better-educated nation.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Immigration Reform

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
Passage of immigration reform could be a boon to the real estate and mortgage markets over the next decade.
So says the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals in San Diego. If Congress approves legislation providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the organization expects the country's pool of home buyers to swell by three million, generating some $500 billion in new mortgages.
The estimates are based on the assumption that some six million unauthorized immigrants would probably pursue legalization if given the opportunity. That's a little more than half of the total number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, which the Pew Research Hispanic Center estimates to be 11.1 million. Almost 60 percent of those are Mexicans. 
The association calculated that about three million of those who would pursue legalization would also buy homes, based on previous rates of homeownership among foreign-born households, said Gary Acosta, the chief executive of the real estate association.
The $500 billion in real estate transactions would also generate $25 billion in mortgage origination and refinance income, and $28 billion in commission income to real estate professionals, the association says.
''It's not what we expect to happen in a year or two, but over 5 to 10 years,'' Mr. Acosta said. ''These are people who can't get mortgages right now, and they're primarily living in the shadows.''
The association did not try to break down the economic benefits by region, but Mr. Acosta said the effects would be concentrated in states with large Hispanic populations. More than 60 percent of the country's Hispanic residents are concentrated in a handful of states, among them New York, though Mr. Acosta notes that Hispanic populations are growing rapidly in ''nontraditional'' states like North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah.
Hispanic households are already a strong force in the nation's housing market. A previous report from the association found that from 2000 to 2012, the net growth in new-owner Hispanic households was 58 percent, versus 5 percent for the rest of the American population.
Mr. Acosta attributed the growth to several factors. The Hispanic population is a ''younger demographic that's just moving into prime-home buyer years.'' Their household makeup tends toward two-parent families, making them more likely to buy. And in surveys, Hispanics report a ''fundamental desire to participate in homeownership,'' Mr. Acosta said.
New York's five boroughs would most likely see a rise in housing demand should Congress pass an amnesty measure. Right now, the homeownership rate among the 30 percent of the population that is Hispanic is just 15 percent, half the citywide rate, according to Josiah Madar, a research fellow at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
Mr. Madar hasn't studied what share of the city's Hispanic population is undocumented, but the low rate of homeownership suggests that legal status plays a role. ''There might be a lot of prospective homebuyers in that population,'' he said.
The share of home purchase mortgages issued to Hispanic borrowers in New York peaked in 2006, just over 16 percent, according to data provided by Mr. Madar. It then declined sharply, and as of 2011 stood at just under 10 percent.
The fate of the immigration reform measure in Congress is uncertain. Mr. Acosta says his organization believes that a legal path to immigration should be a ''required component'' of any reform measure.

HEADLINE: Who Made That?; A-B

BYLINE: By PAUL TULLIS, PAUL LUKAS, LINDSAY CROUSE, SUSAN DOMINUS, ADAM STERNBERGH, WILLY STALEY, MARNIE HANEL and MAYA LAU

 BODY:
A Air Bag
In 1952, a retired industrial engineer named John W. Hetrick experienced a near miss in his Chrysler and spent the rest of the ride wondering how he could soften an accident's impact. A year later, he received a patent for a ''cushion assembly . . . arranged to be inflated responsive to sudden slowing.'' Easier patented than done. It would be years before anyone could figure out how to get the thing to inflate fast enough, in the right circumstances and without doing what it was designed to prevent -- injuring the occupant. The crucial advance came in the late 1960s, when Allen Breed, who had designed safety and arming devices for the military, came up with an inexpensive sensor: a magnet holding in place a metal ball that, when freed by a certain force, would complete an electrical circuit and trigger the air bag's inflation. Later engineering enabled nitrogen gas to fill the bag more quickly than the compressed air of Hetrick's design. 
In the early '70s, Ford and G.M. began offering cars with air bags, but G.M. discontinued the option for its 1977 model year, citing lack of consumer interest. Ford and G.M. spent years lobbying against air-bag requirements, saying that they were not practicable or appropriate. It wasn't until the early '90s that air bags became widespread in American cars. Paul Tullis
Ant Farm
Milton Levine was at a picnic one day in 1956 when the sight of some ants inspired him with this thought: He enjoyed watching ants on his uncle's farm as a child; other children would no doubt enjoy watching them, too. Within a few months, Levine, a toy salesman who specialized in mail-order novelties like toy soldiers and shrunken heads, and his brother-in-law, Joe Cossman, had a product. Each ant ''farm'' kit included plastic housing, white sand for the ants to tunnel in and a coupon for consumers to redeem by mail for a vial of live ants. After clearing some early hurdles -- finding a glue that wouldn't kill the ants -- the kit soon became the first massively popular ant farm, a hit with both teachers and children. By 2002, more than 20 million had been sold. Levine died in 2011, but his company, Uncle Milton Industries, still sells the Ant Farm, along with other educational toys. Paul Lukas
A.T.M.
The first mechanical cash dispenser was installed in New York in 1939. Its inventor, Luther George Simjian, envisioned it as a ''hole-in-the-wall machine'' that would allow customers to get money without entering the bank. But no one used it except a small number of gamblers and prostitutes, and it disappeared after six months. Barclays Bank in North London began the real push to eliminate the human bank teller in 1967, introducing a ''robot cashier'' that let customers swap paper vouchers for £10 notes. But the true breakthrough came in 1969, when Donald C. Wetzel developed an automated teller machine for a company called Docutel, which was installed at Chemical Bank in New York. A 1969 ad heralded the moment: ''On Sept. 2, our bank will open its doors at 9:00 and never close again!'' To deter thieves, the machine was encased in stainless steel five-eighths of an inch thick that would take eight hours to cut through. Four years later there were 2,000 A.T.M.'s in the U.S., each costing $30,000 to make and deploy; today there are more than 400,000. Lindsay Crouse
Band-Aid
Josephine Dickson, a New Jersey housewife prone to nicking herself in the kitchen, inspired her husband, Earle, a 28-year-old cotton buyer, to find an efficient way to protect her frequent injuries. He took a strip of gauze, laid it down on the sticky side of some surgical tape and over both laid a strip of crinoline so the whole could be rolled up and not stick to itself. Thereafter, whenever his wife cut herself, she could cut off a ready-made bandage, instead of having to resort to the standard remedy of 1920: a strip of rag or gauze held in place with string. At the time, Dickson was working for Johnson & Johnson, which was already marketing sutures, bandages and hygiene products. He presented his innovation to higher-ups, who immediately recognized its utility. When Band-Aids did not sell well in their first year or two, the company started distributing them free of charge to a demographic that had an even greater need than housewives -- Boy Scouts. Susan Dominus
B Bike Share
The central obstacle to bike-sharing programs has never been getting people to use the bikes -- it's getting people to bring them back. This conundrum sank the first experimental urban bike-sharing program, a kind of utopian art prank undertaken in Amsterdam in 1965 by Luud Schimmelpennink and the anarchist group Provo, which scattered ''White Bikes'' around the streets for anyone to freely enjoy. Despite an inauspicious debut -- the White Bikes were mostly stolen or trashed -- the concept spread across Europe over the next 30 years, accompanied by innovations to ensure the return of the bikes: deposits, annual memberships, tamper-resistant cycles, smart cards, mobile-phone access. The caricature of bike sharing as some kind of Euro-hippie conspiracy persists, although the modern form of bike sharing -- at least in the U.S. -- was born draped in bunting. The first large-scale U.S. urban program made its debut in Washington in 2008, followed quickly by temporary Freewheelin' programs staged at the Democratic and Republican conventions in Denver and Minneapolis/St. Paul, respectively. The largest program in the U.S. now belongs to New York City, where CitiBike started in May, with 6,000 bikes stored at computer-controlled docking stations and available for short-term rentals, paid for by debit or credit cards. Adam Sternbergh
Bottle Service
Two promoters at the Tunnel in Chelsea, Mark Baker and Jeffrey Jah, changed the downtown club scene in New York in the early '90s by selling whole bottles of liquor at V.I.P. tables; they imported the notion from a club in Paris where Baker says bottles of Polish military vodka were passed off as brand-name booze. In other words, the price gouging has long been part of the idea, even before the 1,000 percent markups, the 20 percent gratuities and the multi-thousand-dollar minimums to reserve tables. (One Las Vegas club offers $250,000 bottle service that includes a 100-pound, 30-liter bottle of Jay-Z's favorite Champagne.) In its early days in New York, though, bottle service ''was an amenity, not a moneymaker,'' Jah says. A bottle was priced for the number of cocktails it could pour. Willy Staley
Brannock Device
Charles F. Brannock was born in 1903 in Syracuse, where his father was a part owner of a shoe store. Most shoe-sizing devices in those days were little more than yardsticks. Seeking to come up with a way to measure length, width and arch length at the same time, Brannock spent much of his spare time in college tinkering with drawings and prototypes. By 1928, he had patented his invention, which swiftly rendered all other shoe-sizers obsolete and has remained largely unchanged. Because almost nobody knows what it's called, the Brannock Device has achieved the dual distinction of being simultaneously ubiquitous and anonymous -- a good fit for its creator, who reportedly hated publicity and attention. He died in 1992 in Syracuse. Paul Lukas
B Breath Mint
The ancient Egyptians placed pellets of boiled honey, frankincense, myrrh and cinnamon on their tongues. The Romans chewed parsley. Medieval men sucked fig-size gobstoppers made of clove and cardamom. Victorians favored Sen-Sen, licorice bits marketed as ''breath perfume.''
But mint lozenges were reserved for medicine. Altoids, invented in 1780, were sold as a stomach calmative through the 1800s, for example, and Formamint, a ''germ-killing throat tablet'' from Europe, arrived in America in 1911. (The sham medicine was named for its active ingredient: formaldehyde.) The breath mint was truly born in 1912, when a candymaker in Ohio named Clarence Crane used a drugstore's pill press to create a candy for summer. He punched a hole through the middle of his confections and named them for their nautical look-alikes, Life Savers. The first flavor, Pep-O-Mint, was advertised ''for that stormy breath.''
Samira Kawash, the author of the coming book ''Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure,'' attributes the success of Life Savers to Edward J. Noble, a onetime traveling book salesman. With J. Roy Allen, a friend whose mother partly footed the bill, Noble bought Crane's business in 1913 and pushed the candy eagerly. ''It was a genius of product presentation,'' Kawash says. ''The prohibition movement was gaining steam, along with the idea that you had to hide the evil vapors of liquor on your breath. They came up with the idea of selling it in drinking establishments.''
After his Mint Products Company became a multimillion-dollar enterprise, Noble bought and developed a television network to break up a monopoly. His American Broadcasting Company continues to this day. Marnie Hanel
Brunch
Though the meal originated with Englishmen coming home from the morning hunt and wanting heavy food -- the first published reference to brunch appeared in a British magazine called Hunter's Weekly, in 1895 -- it didn't catch on in the United States until the 1920s, according to Farha Ternikar, a sociologist and author of the coming ''Brunch: A Global History.'' Through the '30s, celebrities and upper-class people hosted brunches in their homes. The Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York had a brunch menu in 1941. ''Breakfast parties'' and cookbooks with brunch recipes became popular in the '50s.
What Ternikar calls brunch's ''second heyday'' came in the '70s and '80s, when church attendance dropped and disposable income increased. The cheapness of eggs and brunch's residual social status made it an attractive alternative to going out for dinner. And even as the menu has changed -- we no longer yearn for fish dishes like shad roe or finnan haddie, which were common in the '40s and '50s -- the meal retained its unconventional air. ''It was built on this idea of having no real tradition,'' Ternikar says. ''If you want cupcakes and eggs, you can have cupcakes and eggs.'' Maya Lau

HEADLINE: Take the A Train to Little Guyana

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
On an old building at 12 St. Marks Place, hovering above the sushi counters and tattoo parlors, is an inscription chiseled in the stone facade: Deutsch-Amerikanische Schützen Gesellschaft. It marks the location of the German-American Shooting Society clubhouse, long defunct, and is a rare vestige of the German immigrant community that dominated the East Village and the Lower East Side for much of the 19th century.
Known as Kleindeutschland, or Little Germany, the community had German saloons and social clubs, German theaters and churches, German stores and workshops, and, of course, tens of thousands of German residents.
Little Germany is long gone -- the clubhouse now houses a Yoga to the People studio -- and other European enclaves that once defined immigrant life in New York City have also faded or disappeared altogether. 
But in their place, a welter of immigrant neighborhoods have formed, populated by newcomers from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America. This shift was triggered by the passage of immigration reform legislation in 1965, which opened the door to greater numbers of non-Europeans and changed the ethnic composition of the United States.
Since 1970, the number of foreign-born New Yorkers has more than doubled, to about three million, or 37 percent of the city's total population, according to the Census Bureau. About 32 percent of the city's immigrants today came from Latin America, 26 percent from Asia, 20 percent from non-Hispanic Caribbean nations, 17 percent from Europe and 4 percent from Africa.
As with earlier waves of immigrants, many of the newcomers fled economic hardship, armed conflict and other adversity, and have settled near their compatriots for convenience and mutual support, organically forming communities within the ethnic mosaic of the city.
Here are nine such newer enclaves -- the Kleindeutschlands of the 21st century -- in various states of evolution. Because the foods and goods of home are such a central part of these communities, we have included places to find typical fare in each neighborhood, as well as retail spots that cater to the immigrant population. Think of them as possible starting points for exploration.
Arab
Bay Ridge, Brooklyn
Friday Prayer at the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge is so popular that the mosque often fills to capacity and late-arriving worshipers have to find a free spot to pray on the sidewalk, which the staff covers with carpet.
It is an amazing sight, a manifestation of the emergence of a thriving pan-Arab enclave in northern Bay Ridge. The immigrants -- Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians, Egyptians, Yemenis, Moroccans and others -- have mostly settled in an area bounded by 65th and 77th Streets to the north and south, and Seventh Avenue and Colonial Road to the east and west.
Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian-American community activist who grew up in Sunset Park, the next neighborhood to the north, said Bay Ridge's population was the latest in a series of Arab enclaves that began with a settlement of mostly Syrians, Lebanese and Palestinians in Lower Manhattan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Under the pressure of development and gentrification, that enclave splintered and a new one took shape in Brooklyn on the western end of Atlantic Avenue. In recent years, the Arab population of Brooklyn has gradually migrated south to Bay Ridge.
The entrepreneurial zeal of the new arrivals is quickly transforming the face of the neighborhood, with restaurants like Yemen Café (7130 Fifth Avenue; 718-745-8000) and Tanoreen (7523 Third Avenue; 718-748-5600), and shops like Balady Halal Foods (7128 Fifth Avenue; 718-567-2252).
''Every time there is a closed store, an Arab will get up and open it,'' said Ms. Sarsour, executive director of the Bay Ridge-based Arab-American Association of New York, sounding both amused and celebratory. ''They'll just look around and see what's missing. They just open stuff!''
Getting there: Take the R train to the Bay Ridge Avenue or 77th Street stop.
Bangladeshi
Kensington, Brooklyn
When Ansar A. Lovlu immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh in 1995, he settled near the intersection of Church and McDonald Avenues, where a fledgling community of Bangladeshi immigrants had taken root.
At the time there were only a few Bangladeshi-owned businesses in the area. Now, there are more than 80, supporting what has become the city's most dynamic, and perhaps biggest, Bengali enclave.
''I feel like I'm living in my own country,'' said Mr. Lovlu, executive editor of Thikana, one of several Bengali newspapers published in the city. ''You don't have to learn English to live here. That's a great thing.''
More than 74,000 Bangladeshi immigrants live in New York City, according to the latest figures from the Census Bureau, a 20 percent increase since 2009, making them the 11th-largest foreign-born population in the city. In addition to the Kensington enclave, there are significant concentrations of Bangladeshis in Queens, as well as in the Bronx, in Parkchester.
On Church and McDonald Avenues, grocery stores like the Bangla Nagar Supermarket (87 Church Avenue; 718-633-0114) sell Bangladeshi staples like radhumi spice and atta flour, while places like Ghoroa Sweets & Restaurant (478 McDonald Avenue; 718-438-6002) and Sugandha Restaurant (483 McDonald Avenue; 718-438-8773) serve biryani and pulao. There are Bangladeshi law, accounting, medical and insurance offices; Bangladeshi tailors, travel agencies and architects; and four mosques within a few blocks.
Bangladeshi activists have for years tried, unsuccessfully, to attach a sobriquet to the area, from renaming a stretch of McDonald Avenue after Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the first president of Bangladesh, to anointing the intersection Bangla Town.
On a recent Sunday, thousands of Bangladeshis packed McDonald Avenue for a block party to celebrate the Bangladeshi New Year. A band played Bengali pop music, and merchants tended scores of food and clothing stalls.
Mr. Lovlu was there, too, taking photos of the event for his newspaper -- mostly shots of women in colorful saris and shalwar kameezes. ''People need to see in the newspaper beautiful women,'' he announced cheerfully.
Getting there: Take the F or G train to the Church Avenue stop.
Chinese
Homecrest/Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn
For generations, New York City knew one Chinatown and only one Chinatown: the world-famous neighborhood in Lower Manhattan. But today, if you ask an alert cabdriver to take you to Chinatown, he might respond, ''Which one?'' There are now more than 350,000 foreign-born Chinese spread across the five boroughs, coalescing into several Chinatowns and making them the city's largest immigrant population after Dominicans, according to the latest American Community Survey, a continuing study by the Census Bureau. In Brooklyn, the Chinese population has spread south from its stronghold in Sunset Park in a crescent covering parts of Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach and Gravesend. The tip of that crescent points to a neighborhood that straddles Homecrest and Sheepshead Bay.
At first glance, the area does not necessarily look like a classic Chinatown. On Avenue U, the neighborhood's main commercial corridor, the Chinese-owned businesses -- including grocery stores; restaurants like Golden ''Z'' Chinese Restaurant (1410 Avenue U; 718-382-4328), serving dishes like roasted duck and garlic shrimp; 99-cents stores; and beauty salons -- are interspersed among those owned by everyone else: Georgians, Vietnamese, Italians, Russians and Greeks.
Even several Chinese business owners and store employees questioned the notion that they were part of a new Chinatown. A cashier in a local store looked doubtful. ''I live in Sunset Park -- and that counts as another Chinatown,'' she said.
But she was working the register at a branch of New York Mart (2309 Avenue U; 718-891-8828), a thriving immigrant-owned chain of grocery stores in growing Chinese enclaves. And the latest statistics from the American Community Survey show that the area's population is increasingly Chinese: At least 40 percent of the residents in three nearby census tracts are of Chinese descent.
All of which suggests that if you want to see what a Chinatown looks like in its zygote phase, go there.
Getting There: Take the Q train to the Avenue U stop.
Ecuadorean
Corona, Queens
Assemblyman Francisco P. Moya, local boy made good, is piloting his sleek BMW through dense midday traffic on Roosevelt Avenue in Corona, one hand on the wheel, the other pointing out the indicators of his community's ascendance. There are now more than 137,000 Ecuadorean immigrants in the city, making them the sixth-largest immigrant population.
''The restaurant there,'' he said, gesturing toward a building on the south side of the street, under the elevated tracks of the 7 train. ''Ecuadorean.''
''Look,'' he continued, pointing to the other side of Roosevelt. ''Two restaurants and a grocery store. We have the whole mall here.''
He waved his hand to encompass the entire streetscape: ''All of this is Ecuadorean.''
Mr. Moya, 39, the son of Ecuadorean immigrants, was born and raised in the neighborhood and still lives there. He has seen the area change from a predominantly Dominican neighborhood to one with a mix of Latino immigrant populations to the home of the densest concentration of Ecuadoreans in the city. In several census tracts straddling Roosevelt Avenue in Corona, at least a quarter of the population is of Ecuadorean descent, according to Census Bureau statistics.
They eat at restaurants like Sabor Latino (95-35 40th Road; 718-457-3966) and Barzola (9212 37th Avenue; 718-205-6900), and they shop and conduct business at Ecuadorean-owned bodegas and bakeries, law and notary offices, money exchanges and travel agencies lining Roosevelt Avenue and its side streets.
The assemblyman, who was elected in 2010, turned south onto 104th Street. ''I live right up this block,'' he said, pointing down a side street, then drove slowly through the neighborhood.
When constituents have an issue and they want Mr. Moya's ear, they sometimes bypass his district office and call his parents. ''They'll say, 'I need to talk to your son. I need help,' '' he said. ''They come and knock on my door.'' Ecuadoreans from outside his district frequently seek his assistance; he has even received requests for help from Ecuadoreans living outside New York.
''They say, 'This is our guy.' ''
Getting there: Take the No. 7 train to the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue, Junction Boulevard or 103rd Street-Corona Plaza stop.
Ghanaian
Concourse Village, the Bronx
The primacy of fufu in the Ghanaian diet is evident in the stock at Anokyekrom African and Caribbean Market (1152 Sheridan Avenue; 718-618-0717) in the Concourse Village section of the Bronx. There, a dizzying array of fufu powder mixes, made by companies in the Bronx, Newark, California and Ghana, fill an entire set of shelves. Along with the fufu, which is made from starchy vegetables, the store feeds other Ghanaian hungers. There are foodstuffs like kenkey -- fermented cornmeal -- and Star beer to drink with it, as well as natural black soap and CDs of Ghanaian high life, hip life and gospel music. Leaflets covering a wall advertise nightclub events, concerts, jobs and funerals.
A television broadcast of a European soccer match and the accompanying whoops of several men were audible through a closed door in the back. The business card of the proprietor, Kwame Danso, reveals an even broader range of needs that can be satisfied: ''Phone cards, money transfer, fax, photocopy, travel tickets, etc. D.J. services available.''
The number of immigrants from Africa living in New York has soared over the past few decades. There are now more than 27,000 Ghanaians, the largest African immigrant group, in the city, with most spread across several Bronx neighborhoods, and in pockets in Queens and Brooklyn. Amid this sprawl, the cluster of Ghanaian businesses near the intersection of Sheridan Avenue and McClellan Street, including Anokyekrom, may be the most visible commercial manifestation of the Ghanaian population. It functions for some not simply as a place for commerce, but also as a place to share ideas, cut deals, swap gossip and hang out.
There's Papaye Restaurant (196 McClellan Street; 718-681-3240), which serves specialties like fermented corn balls in a fish stew and, of course, fufu in a peanut-flavored soup with goat; a second Ghanaian grocery store; a small CD shop; and two barber shops, one of which also advertises tax preparation services.
Getting there: Take the B or D train to the 167th Street stop.
Guyanese
Richmond Hill, Queens
On a Friday afternoon in early spring, his work done for the day, Kawal P. Totaram leaned back in his desk chair in his Richmond Hill law office on Liberty Avenue and dreamed of summer.
''You will be inundated by the different whiffs of curry and roti,'' he began. ''Your ears will be jarred by chutney music and Indian music. You'll see women wearing short skirts and saris, men without a shirt, people with their cups, vendors yelling, the guys cursing. You'll have the bars packed with young men drinking rum.'' He smiled. This, he said, was Guyanese Richmond Hill at its fullest.
There are about 140,000 Guyanese immigrants living in New York City, according to the latest American Community Survey figures, making them the fifth-largest foreign-born population in the city. While many Afro-Guyanese immigrants have settled among other Afro-Caribbean immigrants in places like Canarsie and Flatbush in Brooklyn, Guyanese of South Asian descent are concentrated in large numbers in Richmond Hill and neighboring Ozone Park.
The lively Liberty Avenue and its tributaries are lined with roti shops, restaurants and bakeries like Sybil's Bakery & Restaurant (132-17 Liberty Avenue; 718-835-9235), two branches of Little Guyana Bake Shop (116-04 Liberty Avenue, 718-843-6530, and 124-11 Liberty Avenue, 718-843-4200), and The Hibiscus Restaurant & Bar (124-18 101st Avenue; 718- 849-4225); shops selling all manner of goods, from spices to saris, like Dave West Indian Imports (98-07 97th Avenue; 718-323-1200); dancing schools and political clubs; ''rum shops''; and community associations. The neighborhood is peppered with mosques, temples and churches to accommodate the population's Hindus, Muslims and Christians.
Describing life in the diaspora, Mr. Totaram said, ''As I put it, you go to bed in America, you sleep in Guyana and you wake up back in America.'' Still, for Guyanese immigrants, Richmond Hill, when viewed from the right angle, can be a pretty good approximation of home.
Getting there: Take the A train to the Ozone Park-Lefferts Boulevard stop.
Korean
Murray Hill, Queens
Someone arriving for the first time at the Long Island Railroad station in Murray Hill could be forgiven for thinking he had somehow been magically transported to the outskirts of Seoul. The station is surrounded by Korean-owned businesses, their names rendered in Korean-language neon signage. The air is redolent with the smell of Korean barbecue. And the dominant language on the street is Korean.
The area immediately around the station is known in New York City's Korean diaspora as the new Meokjagolmok, or Restaurant Street, and features about two dozen restaurants, bars, cafes and a bakery, not to mention a couple of karaoke spots.
The area is a quieter, quasi-suburban counterpart to the hectic, noisy and better-known Koreatown of Manhattan, centered on 32nd Street between Broadway and Fifth Avenue.
Korean immigrants in the greater Flushing area first gained a foothold along Union Street. As their diaspora grew in numbers and wealth, the population spread east along the line of Northern Boulevard, the area's main commercial corridor, into Bayside, Little Neck and then into Nassau County. Korean restaurants, bars, karaoke clubs, supermarkets, salons, banks, malls, language and music schools, and businesses offering legal and other professional services line the boulevard.
Korean Restaurant Street around the railroad station is a distillation of those vast offerings, and the range of establishments offers a primer in Korean gastronomy: Each specializes in certain dishes or kinds of food, such as cold arrowroot noodles and pork belly barbecue at Han Joo Korean Restaurant (41-06 149th Place; 718-359-6888) and kalbi at Mapo BBQ (14924 41st Avenue; 718-886-8292).
Getting there: Take the No. 7 train to the Flushing-Main Street stop or the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington line to the Murray Hill station.
Mexican
Sunset Park, Brooklyn
Mexicans may be the most subtle immigrant group in New York City. For such a large population that has grown so fast -- there are now more than 186,000 Mexican immigrants in the city, making them the third-largest foreign-born population -- it has remained astonishingly low-profile, politically, economically and otherwise.
The reasons for this are complex and varied, but among them is the fact that Mexicans, geographically speaking, are remarkably dispersed. As a result, no neighborhood has been able to stake a claim to being the most Mexican. At some point, East Harlem acquired the moniker Little Mexico, though mostly among Manhattan-centric outsiders. And with the flight of Mexicans out of that neighborhood in recent years amid fast-rising rents, that name seems outdated at best.
Declaring any neighborhood as the definitive Little Mexico is a fool's errand: The general population is still unsettled and shifting, particularly amid the pressures of gentrification. That said, Sunset Park's Mexican community is relatively large and well-established, with a bustling commercial corridor along Fourth and Fifth Avenues.
''I think there are bigger roots here than in other communities,'' said Leticia Alanis, executive director of La Union, a longstanding social services group based in the neighborhood. ''People here are not, in the majority, newcomers. Most of the families I know have been here at least 10 years.'' The densest population of Mexicans is in an area bounded by Second and Fifth Avenues to the northwest and southeast, stretching from about 35th Street to about 63rd Street.
Along Fourth and Fifth Avenues, Mexican entrepreneurship lends a powerful flavor to the mix. Grocery stores like Guadalupita II (3901 Fifth Avenue; 718-438-1080) are stocked with goods imported from Mexico, and restaurants and bakeries abound, including Casa Vieja Restaurant (6007 Fifth Avenue; 718-439-3502), Taqueria El Maguey (3910 Fourth Avenue; 718-768-2846) and Las Conchitas Bakery (4811 Fifth Avenue; 718-437-5513). Mexico's flag is everywhere.
In the evenings and on weekends, Sunset Park proper teems with Mexican families. And Mexican Catholicism is on display at the neighborhood's main church, the soaring Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The parish was once almost entirely Irish-American. Nowadays, about two-thirds of the 3,000 or so parishioners who attend weekend services are Latino, the majority of them Mexican.
Getting there: Take the R train to the 45th Street, 53rd Street or 59th Street stop.
Sri Lankan
Tompkinsville, Staten Island
Food bloggers are among the city's most adventurous explorers, venturing to far-flung neighborhoods and filing dispatches that chart the evolution of cuisine on the city's fringes.
And so, while many New Yorkers may be surprised to hear that Staten Island has one of the highest concentrations of Sri Lankans outside Sri Lanka, connoisseurs of ethnic food began mapping that population, or at least its food, years ago. They wrote lyrically of the lampreys and string hopper kothus, the fried lentil cakes and pithus, and the godamba rotis and dhosas, as if sending reports from a distant land. Sri Lankans, many fleeing the civil war in their country, began settling in Staten Island several decades ago; by some estimates, more than 5,000 people of Sri Lankan descent live in the borough. They are scattered throughout the island, though the commercial focus of the population is a short stretch of Victory Boulevard where it intersects with Cebra Avenue.
There are three Sri Lankan restaurants at that intersection -- New Asha Sri Lankan Restaurant (322 Victory Boulevard; 718-420-0649), Dosa Garden (323 Victory Boulevard; 718-420-0919) and Lak Bojun (324 Victory Boulevard; 347-466-5338) -- alongside two grocery stores selling Sri Lankan staples and specialty products like dry fish and jaggery, lotus root and banana blossoms. A third grocery store is farther down Victory Boulevard, and two other restaurants are on Bay Street including San Rasa (226 Bay Street; 718-420-0027) and Lakruwana (668 Bay Street; 347- 857-6619), which was reviewed in The New York Times by the restaurant critic Pete Wells this year. On weekends, Sri Lankan men play cricket on the grounds of the South Beach Psychiatric Center and elsewhere.
On a recent Sunday, hundreds of Sri Lankans gathered at a campground in Staten Island for their New Year celebrations, which included a traditional oil-lighting ceremony, live baila music and competitive events, including coconut-scraping and bun-eating contests. The biggest-belly competition was canceled because of the lateness of the hour.
Getting there: Take the Staten Island Ferry to the St. George Ferry Terminal, and then the S46, S52, S61 or S66 bus to the intersection of Victory Boulevard and Cebra Avenue.

HEADLINE: The Little Land of Big Houses

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
When Kevin Liau gives directions to his house, an updated four-bedroom 1960 ranch at the northernmost end of Englewood Cliffs, he tells friends it is one of the smallest on his block. But Mr. Liau's house holds another distinction: it happens to be one of the older models around -- as residents of this affluent Bergen County community facing the Hudson seem to have a propensity for tearing down and rebuilding.
An 8,500-square-foot turreted mansion going up on the site of a 5,000-square-foot colonial that itself replaced a 3,000-square foot split-level is not an unusual phenomenon in this two-square-mile town of strictly single-family residences. As Mr. Liau put it: ''People are feeling better about the economy and they want to make improvements. It's just a natural progression.'' But as far as his house is concerned, Mr. Liau, who works in the investment office of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, says updating will require a lottery windfall. 
Frank Sorrentino, on the other hand, recalls having had no doubt that he would replace the 1960 ''sugar maple split'' he bought in 1987 when he and his wife and young son moved here from Cliffside Park. ''It was poorly built, termite-ridden,'' he said. ''It was no crying shame to demolish it.'' The Sorrentinos still live in the four-bedroom five-and-a-half-bath colonial that replaced the split-level in 1991.
Mr. Sorrentino, who worked as a building contractor in the '90s and early 2000s, replaced some 30 other homes in Englewood Cliffs, for ''younger people coming back with families to Englewood Cliffs for its spectacular location, but they wanted something more than a 3,000-square-foot home.'' Now, as the chief executive of ConnectOne Bank, a commercial lender in town, he counts many of the current crop of home builders as bank customers.
Some neighboring towns suffered a significant drop in home values during the economic downturn, but ''Englewood Cliffs has always been a good investment,'' said Terry Plawker, who has lived in this town of 5,280 residents for 45 years and has run a real estate business for more than 30. The first asset she and others mention is the low taxes, followed by the proximity to New York City. The town's tax status is due to the presence of several major corporate headquarters, while the ease of access to New York comes thanks to the George Washington Bridge just five minutes away.
Another attraction, according to Helena Lobo-Zagorski, is the relaxed zoning that allows for larger homes to be built on smaller properties. ''There's a fair amount of people who don't care about a large lawn and maintenance,'' said Ms. Lobo-Zagorski, a broker with Sotheby's Prominent Properties. ''They're O.K. with having a beautiful home with a little backyard.''
Both Mr. Liau and Mr. Sorrentino moved to Englewood Cliffs years ago with their parents, choosing it as the spot to raise their own families. In both cases, their parents still live in town and have helped out. Mr. Liau's parents take care of their 3-year-old grandson, Peter, each day while he and his wife, Jessica Park, an auditor for an investment bank, commute into the city. ''I guess you could say we see a lot of them,'' Mr. Liau said of his parents. ''We go to their house every night to pick our son up, and stay for dinner.''
What You'll Find
Some early 20th-century houses can be found at the southern end of town near Fort Lee, but the first significant wave of residential construction in Englewood Cliffs took place in the 1950s and '60s, after the Palisades Interstate Parkway was completed in 1957.
East Palisade Avenue divides the long, narrow town into North and South Cliffs. Properties in North Cliffs are larger but rarely have more than half an acre; most houses in South Cliffs have 0.25 acres or less. Teardowns for larger houses occur more often at the north end, though new houses can be found in South Cliffs, stretching almost to the property line.
Michele Kolsky-Assatly, a sales associate with Coldwell Banker, finds Englewood Cliffs distinctive among the towns that face Manhattan, describing it as ''the beginning of true suburbia, without the high-rises.'' There are no apartments or town houses, though there are usually a handful of houses available for rent, a popular option for corporate executives relocated here for a year or two, Ms. Kolsky-Assatly said. In the 2010 census, 38.5 percent of residents described themselves as Asian-American -- an increase of 9 percent since 2000 -- with more than half being of Korean descent.
There is no town center as such, but the commercial arteries of East Palisade Avenue and Route 9W, or Sylvan Avenue, have restaurants, office complexes, and the corporate headquarters of companies like Unilever, CNBC and the LG Corporation. The South Korean conglomerate LG has proposed a $300 million headquarters on a 27-acre plot it owns here, but a coalition of preservationists has sued Englewood Cliffs, arguing that at eight stories, at least part of the proposed structure would violate height restrictions.
What You'll Pay
There are 70 houses on the market, with a median asking price of $1.7 million. The median sale price in the first five months of 2013 was $937,000, versus $909,000 in all of 2012, Ms. Lobo-Zagorski said. The most expensive listing, at $3.85 million, is a 6,914-square-foot house built in 2003 on two acres. The most affordable, not including foreclosure properties of which there are currently four, is a 1,600-square foot 1960 split-level listed at $645,000.
Ms. Plawker described demand as strong, in particular at the thinly furnished lower end of the price range. Of houses ranging from $1.5 million to $3 million, there are 30, but in the $1 million range there are fewer than a dozen. Mr. Liau said this had also been true during his move from Manhattan in 2011, noting that with the first house he and his wife bid on, they lost out to a builder planning on tearing the house down, and that on the second they ran up against an all-cash bidder. The third time they offered the asking price of $1.36 million, securing their ranch, which has a new kitchen and an open floor plan.
Property taxes are among the lowest in North Jersey. For an eight-bedroom colonial on 0.33 acres listed at $2.99 million, taxes are $19,850 a year; in nearby Tenafly, taxes on a comparable house would be closer to $35,000.
As for rentals, a four-bedroom 1970 ranch was listed recently at $4,750 a month, an eight-bedroom 2000 house for $15,000.
What to Do
The cliffs of the Palisades Interstate Park drop dramatically toward the river, offering scenic lookout points, walking paths, bike trails, playgrounds and, at the river level, a boat basin. The 10-acre Allison Park, just south of the local campus of St. Peter's College, has picnic areas and great views of the George Washington Bridge. With no downtown of their own, residents can go west on Palisade Avenue into the bustling downtown in Englewood, or make the quick trip into New York City for shopping or entertainment.
The Schools
North Cliff School runs through Grade 2, Upper School through Grade 8. For high school, the town has an affiliation with the Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, though many families opt for private school, either in North Jersey or New York City. SAT averages at Dwight Morrow in 2011 were 477 in math, 460 in reading and 472 in writing, versus 517, 493 and 496 statewide. Dwight Morrow is also home to the Academies@Englewood, the state's largest interdistrict public school, which is by application only.
The Commute
Most commuters drive into New York via the George Washington Bridge, which crosses the Hudson from neighboring Fort Lee. New Jersey Transit's No. 156 bus serves Englewood Cliffs; the trip to Midtown takes just under one hour and costs $4.25 one way.
The History
The riverfront served in the early 19th century as a port through which New Jersey farmers shipped produce to the city. In the mid 1800s, rock-quarrying began to thrive, so much so that the cliffs were destined for obliteration until saved by the establishment of the Palisades Interstate Park.

HEADLINE: Chief Bill John Baker

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY. 
Kate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Chief Bill John Baker leads the Cherokee Nation, which has 300,000 members and business interests that range from aerospace to casinos. The local economic impact of the tribe, which is based in northeastern Oklahoma, is $1.5 billion annually. 
READING ''I Called Him Uncle Will,'' by Doris ''Coke'' Lane Meyer. She's Will Rogers's niece and one of the most revered women in the Cherokee Nation. I wouldn't be chief if it wasn't for her. She wrote this book about her remembrances when Will would come home from New York City and they would all set around their dining room table and of course he was such a fabulous individual that the kids just hung on every word.
And ''Bridges Out of Poverty.'' So many people go to school, they grow up and get married and they have no earthly idea how to pay the bills and how to prosper in life. The book is full of ideas of how to guide people to economic self-sufficiency by giving them the courage and belief that they are worthy.
I pick up ''How to Win Friends and Influence People'' quite a bit and thumb through it. I was fortunate as a young man to take Dale Carnegie's course and I would highly recommend it to anybody. You can get a whole lot more work done and more projects completed if people like you.
LISTENING I was just thinking last night how relaxing it was listening to the crickets. It pretty well soothes me to sleep. I live in a 100-year-old house that is on my old family farm in Tahlequah, Okla. The Cherokee Nation has a White House, if you will, but we only use it for entertaining and greeting guests. It's nothing like the real White House, but it is white. We actually call it the Brown House, but it's white. It's named for the first superintendent of the school that the tribe runs. He was Jack Brown.
WATCHING We own casinos, and I'll go to some of those performances and give gifts to the performers. Bill Cosby came in and we had a really good time. And Willie Nelson, we had a good visit with him and presented him with a blanket. Yeah, we hire them to come in, but Cherokee hospitality dictates that we treat them like family and honor them. I think most of them feel that and I don't think they get that everywhere they go.
EATING Until you've had hog meat cooked in a black pot, you've not eaten anything. We call it a hog fry. The loin is cut into squares and boiled in oil in one of the traditional old pots the government issued the Cherokees before the removal, to cook their food in. They use plenty of salt and pepper for seasoning and the really good hog meat is cooked in lard. In the same big black pot over a wood fire, they cook brown beans and it's usually served with fried bread like a sopaipilla and fried potatoes. Yeah, there's a lot of frying going on.

HEADLINE: Pitch, Putt and Poutine

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH. 
CHARLES McGRATH, a contributing writer for The Times, is editor of the ''Golf Stories'' anthology (Random House, 2011).

 BODY:
''Well, you can tell we're not in Myrtle Beach,'' said my brother Tom, peering into the darkness from the passenger seat of our rental car.
Rain was pelting down and we were trying to navigate the Cabot Trail, the scenic but occasionally harrowing two-lane road that encircles the northern tip of Cape Breton, the island at the northern tip of Nova Scotia. For more than an hour, we hadn't seen another car, let alone one conveying the basic unit of Myrtle Beach social life: four sunburned guys wearing Titleist caps.
A time zone to the east, we were on the same kind of mission that sends so many tourists to South Carolina. We were on our way to the little town of Ingonish, on the island's northeast corner, to play golf, of all things. (It wasn't part of the plan, but we also wound up eating a lot of poutine, a concoction of French fries, brown gravy and cheese curds that for some reason has become a signature dish in this part of the world.) 
Rugged and beautiful, this island has always attracted visitors, but it is hardly known as a golf haven, even though Ingonish is home to one of Canada's best courses, Highlands Links, built in 1939. Last summer, Cabot Links opened in the old coal-mining town of Inverness, in the southwest, and people are already calling it one of the better layouts not just in Canada, but in all of North America. A second 18-hole course is scheduled to open there in 2015.
The season is shorter than it is in Myrtle; the courses are farther apart; there is no night life; and some of the food makes you wonder about life expectancy in the Maritime Provinces.
On the other hand, there is no traffic to speak of (unless you find yourself backed up behind a tour bus on the Cabot Trail) and getting a tee time is no trouble at all. For the adventurous golfer, Cape Breton could become a prized destination.
Golf is hardly part of the island's heritage. Cape Breton was not settled by country-club types. The people who moved there were miners, loggers and fishermen, many of them exiles from Scotland, driven out by the Highland Clearances of the early 19th century. For generations they spoke Gaelic, a language still used on road signs.
Ingonish is a long way to go for golf, but if you add in Cabot Links, the trip is worth it. The place to stay is the Keltic Lodge, a big Tudor-style resort on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic that has been popular among well-to-do Canadians since the '40s. We didn't book in time, and wound up down the road at the Glenghorm Beach Resort, which felt like a time capsule from the '50s. The furniture was spartan and well dinged, the ceiling of our room was acoustic tile, and the air-conditioning, had we needed it, consisted of a plug-in electric fan.
A lot of Cape Breton is like this: a throwback to an earlier, hardier kind of tourism. In the little towns that dot the circumference of the island (the interior is virtually uninhabitable), there are no chain motels or chain restaurants. The main accommodation is the tourist cabin. Little clusters of them -- like the ones Lolita and Humbert Humbert stayed in -- are set back from the road as you come around a bend, some with hand-lettered signs out front, and the restaurants tend to be no-nonsense mom-and-pop places.
The restaurant at Glenghorm was closed when we got there, so we ate instead at the resort's Thirsty Hiker pub, where the menu, as my brother pointed out, was clearly not created by Alice Waters.
There were no vegetables to be had, as far as I could make out, but two of the featured dishes were deep-friend pepperoni and something called Mexican poutine, which proved to be regular poutine embellished with salsa and jalapeño peppers.
It's not an accident, I concluded, that in Canadian French the word poutine means ''mess,'' among other things, and though I had had poutine only once before, at a ski lodge in Quebec years ago, I decided now that when it comes to this particular dish, I am a classicist. If you ask me, French fries, gravy and cheese curds benefit from jalapeños about as much as foie gras would.
Nor is Mexican poutine a recipe for untroubled sleep. My digestive system was still smoldering when we headed next morning to Highlands Links, which, strictly speaking, is not a links at all. That is, it's not built on dunelike land bordering the sea. A couple of early holes overlook the Atlantic, but most of it goes up into the forested highlands, and its most distinguishing feature is drastic elevation changes.
Stanley Thompson, the designer, thought it should be called the Mountains and Ocean Course. The day Tom and I played, it began with rain and also included some sleet, a little snow and some snatches of sun, and ended with a rainbow. This was in mid-October (I forgot to mention that), which is perhaps not ideal for Canadian golf, but partly because the course was so much fun, we found the conditions exhilarating.
As a concession to the weather, we did take a cart, which proved to be wise. Some of the holes at Highlands are widely separated (it's about a third of a mile between the 12th green and the 13th tee, for example), and to walk the whole course is a trek of some eight miles, compared with four or five at a typical golf course.
The layout is also unusual in having five par 3s and two pairs of back-to-back par 5s. Mr. Thompson, the greatest Canadian golf architect of his era, believed in letting nature shape how a course was routed, and in the case of Highlands Links (a Depression-era make-work project intended to encourage tourism), he had little heavy equipment to help him. The course was mostly built by hand, and if there's a flaw, it's that it doesn't drain particularly well.
High-strung and temperamental, Mr. Thompson was known as the Toronto Terror, but he also had a whimsical side. Seen from an elevated tee, the bunker to the right of the fifth green looks like a storybook dragon waiting to gobble your ball. The bunkers behind the 10th resemble elongated donkey's ears.
But the greater charm of the course is the way it rolls and twists, affording beautiful views around every corner. On many of the holes, either the tee or the green is elevated, and a couple require blind shots, so that you feel as if you're playing in three dimensions, suspended in air. The course tests every shot you have and some you don't. Unaccountably, I have lost our scorecard. My brother claims he whupped me that day, but there is no proof of this.
To get to Inverness, we drove for three hours or so counterclockwise on the Cabot Trail, up and around the top of the island and back down the other side. (Squeamish drivers prefer to travel the other way, so that they're on the inside lane and not on the edge of the many cliffs and fjords.)
The town is where Alistair MacLeod, Nova Scotia's greatest writer, grew up, and from his spare, flinty short stories, you get a sense of how hardscrabble and demanding life there used to be. The main industry was the coal mines, and when the last of them shut, in the late '60s, the place went into a long decline. The advent of the golf course, which is actually built on a slag pile (though you would never know it), has rejuvenated the entire area.
One of the investors in Cabot Links is Mike Keiser, who engineered a similar economic transformation in Bandon, Ore., with Bandon Dunes, a five-course golf resort that is now one of the best in America. My brother and I have been there twice, and the last time he declared that golf there was ''the most fun I've ever had except in the dark.''
Part of the Bandon formula is a staff that is almost eerily friendly and helpful, and tasteful, functional architecture. Cabot repeats both, except that the lodge and clubhouse, designed by Susan Fitzgerald, a Halifax architect, are daringly untraditional. Long and narrow, they perch at the edge of the beach like an enormous glass-and-cedar shipping container.
My brother, an architect himself, pointed out things like the exposed aggregate concrete, whatever that is, on the walkways, and the high quality of the drywall detailing. ''This stuff is expensive,'' he said, ''and except for me, no one is ever going to notice.''
With gold velvet banquettes and orange-and-chrome chairs, the restaurant where we ate, the less fancy of Cabot's two, felt less like a golf club grill room than the cafeteria in some modern art museum. The menu did include poutine, in addition to more healthy offerings like salmon and poached lobster, and it came with Cheddar instead of the usual cheese curds -- an improvement on the traditional recipe, I'm tempted to say.
We drank beer, but had we wanted to, we could have sprung for a bottle of Montrachet (100 Canadian dollars) or even, for a mere 3,250 dollars, a 2008 Pétrus Pomerol Grand Vin. (Like Bandon Dunes, Cabot Links is reasonably priced for the most part -- a room starts at 165 dollars, depending on the season, and a round of golf for a guest starts at 75 dollars -- but it does cater a little to high rollers who fly in on their private planes.)
The name here is not misleading. Cabot Links, designed by the Canadian architect Rod Whitman, is a true links course. You can see the Gulf of St. Lawrence from every hole, and five of them (Nos. 12 to 16) play right along the beach. There is a double green just like those St. Andrews, and a green with a trough in the middle, a trademark of the American architect Charles Blair Macdonald, who used it at Yale and the St. Louis Country Club.
But Cabot reminds me a bit of Cruden Bay, in Scotland, or perhaps even more of Turnberry, the great links course on the Firth of Clyde, and in my opinion it belongs in the same rank, along with the Keiser courses in Oregon. The day Tom and I played, it blew about 20 miles an hour, a true links wind that was a factor on every hole, causing shots to bend like a parenthesis or else keeping them unnaturally aloft on an air cushion.
You don't need to hire a caddie at Cabot Links, but after traveling all that way, you'd be crazy not to, especially if you are lucky enough to be assigned Neil MacEachern and Bruce Kennedy. Neil, a retired phone company employee, and Bruce, who still takes care of buildings and grounds at the local community college, know every inch of the place, the bounce on every fairway, the break on every green, how much extra club to add for the wind, and they are local historians as well. They can tell you how much the former miners' cottages along the seventh fairway sell for now that they front a world-class golf course and not a slag pile, and they will tell you the story of how a working steam engine wound up behind a purple painted house near the 10th hole.
They will even enjoy, or pretend to, your particular brand of sibling rivalry. In the case of Tom and me, this involves a fair amount of trash talking. He is younger, bigger and stronger than I am, and in most respects the better golfer, but I can sometimes beat him by messing with his head. When we were younger, I sometimes reverted to more devious tactics, and once, for example, neglected to wait for him to get out of the way before striking a 3-wood in the direction of his left buttock.
At Cabot, there were no tears. We both played pretty well that day (Tom had a 39 on the back, when the wind was with us), and we wound up all-square, though neither of us made many putts. The greens at Cabot are slower than they look, and we kept leaving ourselves short. ''Not enough weight,'' Bruce said, using the curler's term for speed.
And with just two of us, and no one in front, we played briskly. The round, one of the half-dozen most enjoyable golfing days of my life, was finished in just a bit over three hours, far too quickly.
Almost all the holes there are memorable, except maybe the 18th, where the fairway runs so close to the clubhouse that I worried whether there might be a broken-window penalty. Among those that stick out in my mind are the second, a par 5, where the landing area is between two ravines and the green sits on top of what was once the mine head; the 11th, which winds around a little harbor; and the 16th; a 450-yard par 4 along the beach with a green protected by a gulch on the left and a cranberry bog in back.
I had a decent drive here but was still about 220 out and thinking of laying up when Bruce handed me my 4-wood and said, ''Trust me: just keep it to the right.'' I did as instructed, and after landing way short of the green, I thought, the ball just kept bounding along like a hare and wound up about eight feet from the hole. That's the magic of links golf, a game in which the ball's travels along the ground matter as much as its flight in the air.
Tom and I were so pumped up that we hopped into the car and drove to Antigonish, a university town on the mainland, where we squeezed in an extra nine holes (10, to be truthful) at Antigonish Golf and Country Club, a very pleasant layout designed by its own members in 1922 and then expanded in the '90s. We should have stopped at nine. The 10th is one of the most brutal par 5s I've ever played -- 506 yards uphill all the way to a green on a plateau.
Everyone had gone home by the time we made it back to the parking lot, then we drove what seemed like forever to Halifax. We stayed in a downtown hotel before heading out in the morning for a round at Glen Arbour, a newish course and site of the Canadian Women's Open in 2005.
But first, of course, we needed sustenance, and thinking I might never have it again -- might never again feel a cheese curd squeak against my palate, or know the particular mushiness imparted to French fries by a pool of gravy -- I ordered more poutine.

HEADLINE: Japan Is a Model, Not a Cautionary Tale

BYLINE: JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ


HIGHLIGHT: Along many dimensions &#8212; greater income equality, longer life expectancy, lower unemployment, and greater investments in children&#8217;s education and health &#8212; Japan has done better than the United States. 

 BODY:
IN the five years since the financial crisis crippled the American economy, a favorite warning of those who have urged forceful government action, myself included, has been that the United States risked entering a long period of "Japanese-style malaise." Japan's two decades of anemic growth, which followed a crash in 1989, have been the quintessential cautionary tale about how not to respond to a financial crisis.
Now, though, Japan is leading the way. The recently elected prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has embarked on a crash course of monetary easing, public works spending and promotion of entrepreneurship and foreign investment to reverse what he has called "a deep loss of confidence." The new policies look to be a major boon for Japan. And what happens in Japan, which is the world's third-largest economy and was once seen as America's fiercest economic rival, will have a big impact in the United States and around the world. 
Of course, not everyone is convinced: though Japan reported a robust 3.5 percent annualized growth rate for the first quarter of this year, the stock market has dipped from a five-year high amid doubts about whether "Abenomics" will go far enough. But we shouldn't read anything into short-term stock fluctuations. Abenomics is, without a doubt, a huge step in the right direction.

To really understand why things look good for Japan requires not only looking closely at Mr. Abe's platform, but also re-examining the popular narrative of Japanese stagnation. The last two decades are hardly a one-sided story of failure. On the surface, it does look like there's been sluggish growth. In the first decade of this century, Japan's economy grew at a measly average annual rate of 0.78 percent from 2000 to 2011, compared with 1.8 percent for the United States.
BUT Japan's slow growth does not look so bad under close examination. Any serious student of economic performance needs to look not at overall growth, but at growth related to the size of the working age population. Japan's working age population (ages 15 to 64) shrank 5.5 percent from 2001 to 2010, while the number of Americans of that age increased by 9.2 percent - so we should expect to see slower G.D.P. growth. But even before Abenomics, Japan's real economic output, per member of the labor force, grew at a faster rate over the first decade of the century than that of the United States, Germany, Britain or Australia.
Still, Japan's growth is far lower than it was before its crisis, in 1989. From our own recent experience in America, we know the devastating effects of even a short (albeit much deeper) recession: in America, we've had soaring inequality (with the top 1 percent securing all of the gains of the "recovery," and even more income), increased joblessness, and a middle that has been falling farther and farther behind. Japan's example shows that full recovery doesn't happen on its own. Luckily for Japan, its government took steps to ensure that the extremes in inequality that happened in the United States weren't manifest there, and now is finally being proactive about its growth.
And if we broaden the range of metrics we consider, we see that even after two decades of "malaise," Japan's performance is far superior to that of the United States.
Consider, for instance, the Gini coefficient, the standard measure of inequality. Zero represents perfect equality, and 1 stands for perfect inequality. While Japan's Gini coefficient stands today at around 0.33, the number for the United States is 0.38, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (Other data sources put the United States' level of inequality at even higher levels.) In the United States, the average income of the top 10 percent is 15.9 times that of the bottom 10 percent - compared with 10.7 times for Japan.
The reasons for these differences are political choices, not economic inevitability. Also according to the O.E.C.D., the Gini coefficient before taxes and transfer payments is about the same in the two countries: 0.499 for the United States, and 0.488 for Japan. But the United States does only a little to modulate its inequality, bringing it down to .38. Japan does much more, reducing the Gini coefficient to 0.33.
To be sure, Japan's situation is not perfect. The country needs to do better in caring for its "older old," those over 75. This cohort constitutes a growing share of the world's aging population. In 2008, the O.E.C.D. estimated that 25.4 percent of Japan's "older old" lived in relative poverty - that is, with incomes less than half the national median - a figure only marginally better than the United States' (27.4 percent), and far above the O.E.C.D. average of 16.1 percent. While neither we nor Japan may be as rich as we once thought we were, it is unconscionable that such a large fraction of our elderly should face such hardship.
But if Japan has a problem with poverty among the very aged, it does much better on another front, one that has important implications for any country's future: Some 14.9 percent of Japan's children are poor, compared to a disheartening 23.1 percent of American children.
Broader measures of performance are equally indicative. Life expectancy at birth (a good measure of the health of the economy) is a world-leading 83.6 years in Japan, versus 78.7 years for Americans. And even this data does not expose the full scope of inequality in life expectancies. It's been estimated that the longest-living 10th of Americans - who tend to be the wealthiest Americans - live almost as long as the average Japanese person. But our bottom 10th live about as long as the average person in Mexico or Argentina. The United Nations Development Program estimates that the effect of inequality on life expectancy in America is nearly twice as strong as it is in Japan.
Other measures also show Japan's strengths. It is second-highest in the world for attainment of university education, well ahead of the United States. And even in periods of slow growth, Japan has run its economy in a way that has kept a lid on the unemployment rate. During the global financial crisis, the rate peaked at 5.5 percent; in the two decades of its malaise, it never surpassed 5.8 percent. This low unemployment is one of the reasons Japan has fared so much better than the United States.
Those are numbers we now look on with envy. American unemployment, and an overall weak labor market, hurts those in the middle and bottom in four ways.
First, those who lose their jobs obviously suffer - and in America, especially so, because until Obamacare, they overwhelmingly depended on their employers for health insurance. The combination of the loss of a job and an illness sends many Americans to the brink of bankruptcy, or over it. Second, a weak labor market means that even those who have a job are likely to see their hours cut short. The official unemployment rate hides the huge numbers of Americans who have accepted part-time work, not because that's what they wanted, but because that's all there was. But even those who are supposed to be working full time see their incomes erode when their hours are cut back. Third, with so many seeking work and not getting it, employers are under no pressure to raise wages; wages do not even keep up with inflation. Real incomes decline - and that's what's been happening to most middle-class American families. Finally, public expenditures of all sorts - so important to those in the middle and bottom - are cut back.
WITH his three-pronged approach - structural, monetary and fiscal policies - Mr. Abe, who took office last December, has done what America should have done long ago. Though the structural policies have not been fully fleshed out, they are likely to include measures aimed at increasing labor-force participation, especially among women, and hopefully by facilitating employment for the large number of healthy elderly. Some have suggested encouraging immigration as well. These are areas in which the United States has done well in the past, and are crucial for Japan to address, for the sake of both growth and inequality.
Though Japan has long prioritized equal access to education for women - with a result that Japanese girls score higher in science than boys, and are not as far behind boys in math as American girls are - it still has a relatively low labor-force participation rate for women (49 percent, according to the World Bank, compared with 58 percent for the United States). And an astonishingly small portion of Japanese women - 7 percent, according to one estimate - occupy senior positions in management.
Achieving better labor participation by Japan's highly educated female population is of course as much a matter of social mores and customs as it is of government policy. And while governments can have only a limited role in changing social mores, they can tilt the playing field - making it easier for woman to participate actively in the labor market through pro-family policies (like pregnancy leaves and child-care facilities) and strongly enforced antidiscrimination laws. National statistics typically assess inequality among households or families - they don't get into what happens within the family. Yet inequalities within families can be marked, and differ markedly across countries.
Other likely reforms address the fact that Japan, like other advanced industrial countries, needs to go through some major structural transformations - moving from a manufacturing economy to a service-sector economy, and adapting to the dramatic changes in global comparative advantage, to the realities of climate change, and to the challenges of an aging population. While its powerful manufacturing sector has long showed good productivity growth, other sectors have lagged. Japan has the potential to extend its demonstrated innovativeness to the service sector.
With an aging population, increased efficiencies in the health care sector will be crucial; combining its manufacturing and technological prowess with new diagnostic devices is an example of an arena in which it can make global breakthroughs. Investments in research and higher education will help ensure that young Japanese have the skills and mind-set needed to succeed in globalization. Markets don't make these structural transformations easily on their own. And that's why government cutbacks in such situations are particularly foolish.
In fact, that is one reason the second pillar of Abenomics, its fiscal stimulus, is so important. Stimulus is needed, as we should have all learned, to increase aggregate demand. But it's also needed to complete the structural transformation. Investments in infrastructure, research and education promise high dividends. Yet just as deficit hawks blocked stronger action in the United States, critics claim that Japan, with a debt that is more than twice the size of its G.D.P., is not in a position to pursue this critical aspect of the new policies. They point to the fact that Japan's indebtedness coincides with its long period of low growth. But even here, the data tell a more nuanced story. It is not the debt that caused the slow growth, but the slow growth that caused the deficit. Growth would have been even slower had the government not stimulated the economy.
What's more, the foundation of austerity advocates' logic - that high levels of debt-spending always slow growth, anywhere in the world - has been debunked. Europe is providing ever more evidence that austerity breeds austerity, which brings on recession and depression.
The final facet of Abenomics is its monetary policy, which reinforces stimulus with monetary stimulus. We should have learned that monetary stimulus - even strong and unprecedented actions like quantitative easing - has, at most, limited effects. Attention is focused on reversing deflation, which I believe is mainly a concern because it is a symptom of underutilization. While weakening the yen's exchange rate will make Japanese goods more competitive and thus stimulate the economy's growth, this is the reality of the international interdependence of monetary policy. It is equally true that the Federal Reserve's policy of "quantitative easing" weakens the dollar. We can look forward to a day when global coordination improves in this area.
AS the pieces of evidence fall into place, the pressing issue turns out to be not whether Abenomics is a good plan, but how the United States could achieve a similarly integrated plan, and what the consequences would be if it fails. The obstacle is not economic science but, as usual, America's raging political battles. For example, despite austerity advocates' dubious intellectual foundation, we have allowed public expenditures to slip in all sorts of areas, including those necessary for ensuring a future of shared prosperity. As a result, even as some states' financial situations start to edge toward improvement, public employment is still some 500,000 lower than it was before the crisis; the decrease in jobs has occurred almost completely at the state and local level. To regain the pre-recession levels of employment and public services is a tremendous task, to say nothing of bringing them to where they would have been without a recession. (If the economy had been expanding normally, public employment would have increased significantly.) With inequality still high, the burdens are being felt, disproportionately, by our country's most vulnerable.
A major theme of my research has been that any country pays a high price for its inequality. Societies can have higher growth and more equality - the two are not mutually exclusive. Abenomics has already laid out some policies aimed to produce both. And one hopes that as further details are worked out, that there will be more policies that promote greater gender equality in the labor market will tap into one of that country's underutilized resources. It will enhance growth, efficiency, and equality. Mr. Abe's plan also reflects an understanding that monetary policy can only go so far. One needs to have coordinated monetary, fiscal and structural policies.
Those who see Japan's performance over the last decades as an unmitigated failure have too narrow a conception of economic success. Along many dimensions - greater income equality, longer life expectancy, lower unemployment, greater investments in children's education and health, and even greater productivity relative to the size of the labor force - Japan has done better than the United States. It may have quite a lot to teach us. If Abenomics is even half as successful as its advocates hope, it will have still more to teach us.

HEADLINE: The Big Shrug

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
I've been in this economics business for a while. In fact, I've been in it so long I still remember what people considered normal in those long-ago days before the financial crisis. Normal, back then, meant an economy adding a million or more jobs each year, enough to keep up with the growth in the working-age population. Normal meant an unemployment rate not much above 5 percent, except for brief recessions. And while there was always some unemployment, normal meant very few people out of work for extended periods.
So how, in those long-ago days, would we have reacted to Friday's news that the number of Americans with jobs is still down two million from six years ago, that 7.6 percent of the work force is unemployed (with many more underemployed or forced to take low-paying jobs), and that more than four million of the unemployed have been out of work for more than six months? Well, we know how most political insiders reacted: they called it a pretty good jobs report. In fact, some are even celebrating the report as ''proof'' that the budget sequester isn't doing any harm. 
In other words, our policy discourse is still a long way from where it ought to be.
For more than three years some of us have fought the policy elite's damaging obsession with budget deficits, an obsession that led governments to cut investment when they should have been raising it, to destroy jobs when job creation should have been their priority. That fight seems largely won -- in fact, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like the sudden intellectual collapse of austerity economics as a policy doctrine.
But while insiders no longer seem determined to worry about the wrong things, that's not enough; they also need to start worrying about the right things -- namely, the plight of the jobless and the immense continuing waste from a depressed economy. And that's not happening. Instead, policy makers both here and in Europe seem gripped by a combination of complacency and fatalism, a sense that nothing need be done and nothing can be done. Call it the big shrug.
Even the people I consider the good guys, policy makers who have in the past shown real concern over our economic weakness, aren't showing much sense of urgency these days. For example, last fall some of us were greatly encouraged by the Federal Reserve's announcement that it was instituting new measures to bolster the economy. Policy specifics aside, the Fed seemed to be signaling its willingness to do whatever it took to get unemployment down. Lately, however, what one mostly hears from the Fed is talk of ''tapering,'' of letting up on its efforts, even though inflation is below target, the employment situation is still terrible and the pace of improvement is glacial at best.
And Fed officials are, as I said, the good guys. Sometimes it seems as if nobody in Washington outside the Fed even considers high unemployment a problem.
Why isn't reducing unemployment a major policy priority? One answer may be that inertia is a powerful force, and it's hard to get policy changes absent the threat of disaster. As long as we're adding jobs, not losing them, and unemployment is basically stable or falling, not rising, policy makers don't feel any urgent need to act.
Another answer is that the unemployed don't have much of a political voice. Profits are sky-high, stocks are up, so things are O.K. for the people who matter, right?
A third answer is that while we aren't hearing so much these days from the self-styled deficit hawks, the monetary hawks -- economists, politicians and officials who keep warning that low interest rates will have dire consequences -- have, if anything, gotten even more vociferous. It doesn't seem to matter that the monetary hawks, like the fiscal hawks, have an impressive record of being wrong about everything (where's that runaway inflation they promised?). They just keep coming back; the arguments change (now they're warning about asset bubbles), but the policy demand -- tighter money and higher interest rates -- is always the same. And it's hard to escape the sense that the Fed is being intimidated into inaction.
The tragedy is that it's all unnecessary. Yes, you hear talk about a ''new normal'' of much higher unemployment, but all the reasons given for this alleged new normal, such as the supposed mismatch between workers' skills and the demands of the modern economy, fall apart when subjected to careful scrutiny. If Washington would reverse its destructive budget cuts, if the Fed would show the ''Rooseveltian resolve'' that Ben Bernanke demanded of Japanese officials back when he was an independent economist, we would quickly discover that there's nothing normal or necessary about mass long-term unemployment.
So here's my message to policy makers: Where we are is not O.K. Stop shrugging, and do your jobs.

HEADLINE: Xi and Obama See Pitfalls That Might Be Difficult to Avoid

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, emerged over the weekend in California from their first lengthy talks declaring their determination to keep disputes over cyberespionage and territorial claims in the Pacific from descending into a cold war mentality and to avoid the pitfalls of a rising power confronting an established one.
But officials on both sides described forces at work in Beijing and in Washington that risked pushing Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi into exactly the trap they warned against.
American intelligence officials have told Mr. Obama that the cyberattacks on American companies emanating from China, which have swept up billions of dollars' worth of intellectual property, are caused by the increasing desperation inside China to keep its economy growing at 7 or 8 percent a year. Chinese leaders consider that rate necessary to create enough jobs for the millions of young Chinese who flock to the coastal manufacturing centers each year. 
The territorial claims are an expression of China's sense that it is ready to seize its moment as a global power. American officials who attended the summit meeting at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif., say Mr. Xi gave no ground on those claims.
Mr. Obama's team was looking for indications of how the new Chinese president -- more confident and probably more powerful than his predecessor -- would balance his nation's short-term needs and its long-term interests.
''There was definitely an intent to send a signal to the bureaucracies on both sides that any kind of downward spiral into overt and sustained competition would not be in either side's interest,'' said one senior American official who participated in some of the meetings. But on the questions of cyberattacks and territorial claims, ''that is where you would see a flash of nationalism,'' the official said.
This meeting was not concerned with suppressing those flashes, but with managing them. ''This was the most important meeting between an American president and a Chinese leader in 40 years, since Nixon and Mao, '' said Joseph S. Nye Jr., a Harvard political scientist who once guided the preparation of National Intelligence Estimates, including some that tracked China's economic and military rise. He said Mr. Obama was right to work on first creating a relationship and a tone, and dealing with specific conflicts later.
That might be a lesson from Mr. Obama's dealings with the Chinese leadership during his first term. He began in 2009 by making it clear to Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi's predecessor, that the United States was not seeking to contain Chinese power; Mr. Obama said in a speech delivered on his first trip to China that the United States could not do so even if it tried. The speech was part of a careful effort to reassure the Chinese that the United States was willing to make room for a new superpower, as long as it played by international rules. For a while, there was talk of a ''G-2,'' an economic collaboration between the largest- and second-largest economies in the world.
That talk evaporated quickly. By 2010, China's military had made it clear that it viewed Mr. Obama's overture as an expression of American weakness. Beijing's confrontations in the South China Sea with Vietnam and the Philippines intensified; so did a dispute with Japan over a pile of rocks with virtually no economic value to either nation.
Mr. Obama angrily told aides that he needed ''leverage'' over the Chinese, according to several officials. And Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, asked the Australian prime minister over lunch, ''How do you deal toughly with your banker?'' according to a diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks.
Now, with Mr. Xi in charge in China, Mr. Obama sees a chance to restart the relationship. And there is reason to believe he can.
American and Chinese officials appear to finally be on the same page about how to contain a nuclear North Korea. During the talks at Sunnylands, according to two officials, the Chinese spoke in unusually specific terms about how they might use their leverage as the North's economic savior and energy provider to bring its young leader, Kim Jong-un, to heel. ''They made clear they would not be engaging with him directly until there is a change in action,'' one official said.
If Mr. Xi chooses to act on that commitment, it would be a major accomplishment for Mr. Obama. For the first time in the six decades since the Korean War ended, an American leader will have persuaded the Chinese that the threat posed by its ally's ambitions is greater than the risk of chaos if the North were to collapse. American officials say Mr. Xi appears to agree with Washington that if North Korea stays on its current path, South Korea and Japan will be tempted to develop their own nuclear arsenals and that more American forces will move into the Pacific.
But there has been no such agreement on cyberissues. Mr. Obama spent much of Saturday morning describing to Mr. Xi specific episodes involving Chinese theft of intellectual property -- an exercise intended to make clear how seriously the United States takes the issue. Computer attacks have never before been the subject of discussions between Chinese and American leaders.
''It is now really at the center of the relationship,'' Tom Donilon, Mr. Obama's departing national security adviser, told reporters after the meeting.
Still, he said, China's leadership has yet to acknowledge that sections of the Chinese government -- including People's Liberation Army Unit 63198, which has been linked to many of the attacks on American corporate and government sites -- are at all responsible for the wave of hacking. In the talks, Mr. Donilon said, Mr. Obama ''underscored that the United States did not have any doubt about what was going on here.''
So far, Mr. Obama's approach has been to try to get China to agree to what the president calls ''norms'' of behavior, akin to trade rules. But with Mr. Xi at his side, Mr. Obama observed that ''these are uncharted waters'' because ''you don't have the kinds of protocols that have governed military issues, for example, and arms issues, where nations have a lot of experience in trying to negotiate what's acceptable and what's not.''
Nor is there trust: the Chinese point out that the United States has used cyberattacks as an offensive weapon against Iran while the Pentagon warned in a recent report that China was pouring huge resources into a cyberarsenal of its own.
China's military sees American techonological power as one more form of pressure to be countered, just like the American naval presence in the Pacific. That is zero-sum cold war thinking -- but China and the United States are far more economically interdependent than the United States and the Soviet Union ever were.
That is no guarantee that the two leaders will work out what Mr. Xi calls a ''new type of great-power relationship.'' But each man clearly understands the damage that the other could do to his legacy, and each has a motive for reining in the forces that would argue for continued low-level confrontation.

HEADLINE: After Drought, Rains Plaguing Midwest Farms

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
NORBORNE, Mo. -- About this time last year, farmers were looking to the heavens, pleading for rain. Now, they are praying for the rain to stop.
One of the worst droughts in this nation's history, a dry spell that persisted through the early part of this year, has ended with torrential rains this spring that have overwhelmed vast stretches of the country, including much of the farm belt. One result has been flooded acres that have drowned corn and soybean plants, stunted their growth or prevented them from being planted at all.
With fields, dusty and dry one moment, muddy and saturated the next, farmers face a familiar fear -- that their crops will not make it.
''This is the worst spring I can remember in my 30 years farming,'' said Rob Korff, who plants 3,500 acres of corn and soybeans here in northwestern Missouri. ''Just continuous rain, not having an opportunity to plant. It can still be a decent crop, but as far as a good crop or a great crop, that's not going to happen.'' 
As farmers go through the ritual of examining every weather map and every tick on the futures boards, trying to divine if and how their pocketbooks can survive another curveball from nature, they are also keeping an eye on Washington, where Congress is still bickering over the farm bill. Farmers are hoping that lawmakers will maintain taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance and other support programs that will help them get through disasters like floods and drought.
Another year of mediocre crop yields could well trickle down to consumers, though agriculture experts insist that it is too early to rule out a robust harvest of corn and soybeans for this year.
''If there's a shortage of corn and soybeans, and feed costs are higher,'' said Bill Northey, the Iowa agriculture secretary, ''there's certainly a possibility that well down the road -- six months or a year after that harvest -- that you end up seeing higher meat prices than you would have if you'd had a full supply.''
Still, last year's poor production had only a minor effect on food prices, analysts say, and even with the early planting problems, they expect better yields this year.
Since the beginning of the year, parts of the Mississippi River basin, from eastern Minnesota down through Illinois and Missouri, have received up to three times their normal precipitation. Storm systems also brought flooding to parts of Montana and the Dakotas, and into Nebraska, Iowa and Oklahoma. Iowa, the nation's top corn producer, had a record 17.66 inches of precipitation this spring.
Just over 44 percent of the country remains in drought, down more than 9 percentage points from the beginning of March.
Ideally, farmers need the top two to four inches of soil to be dry when they are planting so that when they drive their tractors in the field they do not pack down the mud, which prevents the roots from getting oxygen. Oversaturated earth also means that pockets where oxygen can filter through to help the roots breathe will instead be filled with water. Ideally, the moisture should be in the soil directly below the seed.
With rain falling day after day, farmers have been hard pressed to find windows of time when they have dry topsoil to get into their fields to plant. The task has been made harder by lower temperatures and cloudy skies that prevent the land from drying even when it is not raining. Many farmers find themselves more than a month behind in their planting, and some have even given up on planting all their seeds. Late planting could stunt the growth of crops, decreasing production once harvest rolls around.
On May 12, 28 percent of the nation's corn crop had been planted, compared with 85 percent on the same day last year. As of the United States Department of Agriculture's latest report, released last week, 91 percent of corn had been planted by June 2, compared with 100 percent a year earlier.
This year, the Agriculture Department had estimated that 97.3 million acres of corn, the most since 1936, would be planted, and that a record 14.14 billion bushels would result from them.
Now, there is concern that ''not as much corn was planted as had been indicated,'' Joseph W. Glauber, the department's chief economist, wrote in an e-mail, and ''that yields will be adversely affected because plantings were less.''
Mr. Korff, 44, planted all his corn in the middle of May, about a month later than usual, and he has yet to plant any of his soybeans because there has not been a long enough break in the weather, he said. This area about an hour east of Kansas City has already gotten 23.6 inches of rain this year, four inches shy of the total for all of last year.
By this time, three weeks after planting, Mr. Korff said, his corn should be waist high. But instead, his crop looks like rows of small blades of grass, with the plants popping about only four inches out of the ground. The leaves are a pale yellow with brown lesions. Some patches of the field are bald, washed away by the rains. The earth is mucky and chocolate brown in some spots. A narrow stream of water slices through it.
''It doesn't have the appearance I like to see,'' Mr. Korff said.
But on an optimistic note, he said all it would take would be about a week of temperatures in the 80s or 90s and the corn could shoot up.
The rain has benefited some farm operations, however.
''This has been a great spring for cattlemen -- just absolutely perfect,'' said Kyle Kirby, who has a herd of 2,500 cattle in Liberal, Mo., which has had 29.13 inches of precipitation this year, about a foot more than in the same period last year.
The rain has replenished the pasture grass that cattle eat and has filled the ponds and streams where they drink. During last year's drought, pastures were a charred brown, and evaporated ponds became nothing more than divots of parched earth. The refreshed pastures will also mean an abundance of hay to feed cattle. Hay was in such short supply last year that prices skyrocketed. Mr. Kirby said he was paying as much as $250 for a ton of hay last year, about two and a half times the normal price.
Still, Mr. Kirby is tempering his excitement. This spring has taught him that the whim that brought moisture could just as cruelly take it back.
''It doesn't matter how wet it is today,'' he said. ''We're just two weeks away from a drought.''

HEADLINE: Supporting Oil and Gas, But Resisting Encroachment

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
GREELEY, Colo. -- This is a town running on oil. From dawn till dusk, trucks carrying men and machinery rumble away for the oil and gas fields. New steakhouses and wine bars have popped up downtown. Energy companies help sponsor rodeos, blues concerts and other events. Tax revenues are surging.
In the depths of the recession, a new wave of drilling took hold across farm fields and the high plains, helping to revive the city's straggling economy. Unemployment is still stuck at 7.5 percent, but is down from highs of more than 10 percent. And local officials estimate that one in nine jobs is somehow tied to the drilling boom. Homes are selling again, and hotels are nearly full. 
''We had better occupancy than Vail did during the ski season,'' said Greeley's mayor, Tom Norton.
But this spring, an energy company proposed sinking 16 wells next to a neighborhood of winding cul-de-sacs, pastel homes and the Family FunPlex recreation center. And in this energy-friendly town, an unlikely resistance was born.
''These wells are going to be here for a long time,'' said Wendy Highby, a librarian at the University of Northern Colorado who joined a group of residents to oppose the project. ''They're what we're leaving to our children.''
The wells in the Fox Run neighborhood on Greeley's western fringe would hardly be the first ones drilled here. Energy companies have drilled in northern Colorado for more than three decades, and Greeley is ringed by about 20,000 oil and gas wells.
About 425 wells are tucked within the city limits, along roadsides and near industrial parks and commercial strips, and that number is expected to grow to 1,600 in coming years. Empty lots near strip malls are scheduled for drilling, and a vacant patch of grass near graduate-student housing on the city's east side bears this sign: ''Future Drilling Site.''
As companies here and across the energy-rich West look for new places to drill, they are increasingly looking toward more densely populated areas, and bumping into environmentalists and homeowners. In a study last year, the environmental advocacy group Western Resource Advocates found that 32 schools in northern Colorado were within 1,000 feet of a well.
''These cities are the last open bastions where they can drill,'' said Mark Schreibman, who created a community group to oppose the drilling in Greeley. ''They're the only places left. Now they're finding themselves under siege.''
As wells have sprouted in cities across northern Colorado, some towns have pushed for bans on the drilling technique known as fracking, in which highly pressurized water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the ground to crack open rock formations and pull out the minerals. Last week, the liberal college town of Boulder passed a one-year ban on fracking.
Others have embraced the boom's royalty checks and tax payments, crediting drilling for the new grocery store in Platteville, the huge lunch crowds in Ault or the reopened Tumble Weed Café in Nunn.
Greeley and drilling have a complicated history. In the mid-1980s, the city banned drilling inside its borders, a move that was overturned by Colorado's highest court after a long and expensive legal battle with energy companies. Since then, the city has passed rules to manage drilling and has learned to coexist with the industry, and even embrace it.
Last year, Greeley collected $3.3 million from oil and gas operations, and it estimates that energy production will generate $429 million in tax revenue over the next 25 years. The University of Northern Colorado and school districts inside Greeley have leased out their drilling rights, and this spring huge ''thumper trucks'' rolled through the streets, sending seismic jolts deep into the ground to see where mineral deposits might lie.
This winter, when Colorado's oil and gas commission passed new rules requiring 500-foot setbacks between new wells and homes, Mayor Norton publicly opposed the changes. He argued that they would hurt development and city planning and would undermine local governments.
Last year, a drilling rig rose like a beanstalk about 1,000 feet from Mr. Norton's home. The nights were filled with clanking and thudding as trucks came and went and as workers bored into the ground and pumped fracking fluid into the well. It was not bliss, he said, but he and his neighbors got by.
''It's not that you want them there,'' he said, ''but you've got to put them someplace.''
Residents are fiercely divided on that point. At a packed meeting last month to discuss the drilling project in Fox Run, some spoke in favor of the economic benefits of oil and gas development. Dozens of others urged city officials to reject the proposal, saying the flurry of new wells would forever damage their city of parks and walking paths.
Logan Richardson, the vice president of the energy company Mineral Resources, promised to do everything possible to keep the noise down and mask the drilling near Fox Run. He said the company would build a fence and plant trees and was making extensive efforts to protect the environment around the well sites.
Despite strong public objection, city officials unanimously approved the new wells. And now, inside the house that she and her husband built six years ago, Karen Janata is bracing for what comes next. The couple moved to Greeley from Illinois to be close to their children and grandchildren, and loved their home's mountain views and sunny suburban charm. She wonders whether all that will survive after the drilling rigs arrive.
''I'm just devastated by this,'' Ms. Janata said. ''I would move out of Greeley tomorrow if I could.''

HEADLINE: Mott Green, a Free-Spirited Chocolatier, Dies at 47

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Mott Green, who emerged from a hermitlike existence in a bamboo hut in the jungle of Grenada to produce a coveted Caribbean delicacy -- rich, dark chocolate bars that he exported around the world with the help of sailboats, bicycles and solar-powered refrigeration -- died on June 1 in Grenada. He was 47.
He was electrocuted while working on solar-powered machinery for cooling chocolate during overseas transport, said his mother, Dr. Judith Friedman.
Mr. Green was born David Friedman, and grew up on Staten Island. He became Mott over the course of many years of visiting and eventually living in Grenada, where residents had a distinctive way of pronouncing his nickname, Moth. He later took Green as his surname to reflect his environmental interests. 
Mr. Green tended to flit about as a child, but with focus: he built go-karts using lawn mower engines; he ran the New York City Marathon when he was 16; he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania just months before graduation -- accepting a degree, he felt, would be capitulating to a corrupt social structure -- and he spent much of his 20s squatting with a community of anarchists in abandoned homes in west Philadelphia, where he ''rescued'' food that restaurants had planned to throw away and distributed it to homeless people.
He was eventually drawn permanently to Grenada. When Mr. Green was a boy, his father, Dr. Sandor Friedman, the director of medical services at Coney Island Hospital, taught there each winter, often bringing his family along.
Mr. Green founded the Grenada Chocolate Company in 1999. Its slogan was ''tree to bar,'' but that did not capture the breadth of the endeavor. Working with small cocoa farmers in Grenada and as many as 50 factory employees during peak operations, all of whom earned the same salary -- and probably more than he did -- Mr. Green dried cocoa beans in the sun; built, maintained and powered the machinery to make chocolate; packaged the finished product; and cobbled together an international network of distributors, including volunteer cargo cyclists in the Netherlands.
In 2011, the company received recognition from the State Department for its ''contribution to the sustainable growth of rural economies by establishing Grenadian products in international markets; pioneering agrotourism; outstanding environmental conservation efforts; and promotion of organic farming.''
In 2008, 2011 and 2013, the Academy of Chocolate in London awarded silver medals to Grenada's dark chocolate bars. A documentary film about the company, ''Nothing Like Chocolate,'' directed by Kum-Kum Bhavnani, was released last year and has been shown at film festivals.
Human rights advocates have long criticized the treatment of small cocoa farmers, and, particularly in Africa, the exploitation of child workers by buyers and exporters who sell cocoa to big chocolate companies. Despite international protections put in place in 2001, a 2009 survey by Tulane University found that nearly a fourth of all children ages 5 and 17 in cocoa-growing regions of Ivory Coast had worked on a cocoa farm in the previous year.
Mr. Green set out to address such issues by dealing directly with small growers and by keeping the processing and packaging of chocolate within Grenada. In the process, he appears to have created the only chocolate-making company in a cocoa-producing country.
''My progression,'' he told D magazine in Dallas for a 2012 blog post, ''was activist, love Grenada, love cocoa, love machines and tinkering, making chocolate, and doing it all without hurting the land.''
David Lawrence Friedman was born on April 15, 1966, in Washington. His family moved to Staten Island shortly before he turned 2.
He was the valedictorian of his class at Curtis High School. He was accepted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but chose Pennsylvania instead. He dropped out in the spring of 1988, his senior year.
''He was repulsed by the prison of privilege,'' Tim Dunn, a friend, said in an interview. ''He was looking for real life. And he found it.''
Mr. Green spent several years after college as a kind of master tinkerer, forager and activist among homeless anarchists in Philadelphia. He helped route electricity into abandoned houses for squatters, and he converted a Volkswagen bus to run on electricity. He helped develop a free lunch program that is still in place. He later moved to the East Village in Manhattan and made solar-powered hot-water showers for a group of squatters there.
By the mid-1990s he had moved to Grenada, where he initially lived in a remote hut he had built himself. It, too, relied on solar energy, in part to power Mr. Green's passion for music.
''You'd hear Ella Fitzgerald coming out of this bamboo house in the rain forest,'' his mother recalled.
Mr. Green developed a taste for cocoa tea, a local favorite, and that helped draw him out of the jungle and into the concerns of cocoa farmers and workers. Joining with a friend from Eugene, Ore., Doug Brown, he studied chocolate production in San Francisco. Working in Eugene, the men restored old machines from Europe and built new ones themselves. By the late '90s they had shipped everything to Grenada. Mr. Brown died of cancer several years ago.
The company struggled for many years even as it won recognition. Mr. Green lived at the factory the whole time, sleeping in a workroom.
It moved into profitability just a few months ago, thanks in part to its recent opening of a shop in Grenada that sells treats made from its chocolate. Grenada's chocolate bars are also sold online and at stores in various countries. In the United States, they are sold at Whole Foods stores in Manhattan and other retailers scattered across several states.
Last year the company delivered tens of thousands of chocolate bars to Europe on a sail-powered Dutch ship, the Brigantine Tres Hombres, operated by a company called Fairtransport. A team of volunteer cyclists in Amsterdam helped handle distribution on the ground.
Mr. Green called it ''the first carbon-neutral trans-Atlantic mass chocolate delivery.''
In addition to his mother, a clinical psychologist in New York, Mr. Green is survived by a brother, Peter. Sandor Friedman died in 2004.
Dr. Friedman said she and several other people involved with the company were meeting this month in Grenada to develop a plan for keeping it operating.
''A lot of people now talk about paying for the actual cost of food or fair food and stuff like that,'' said Alexis Buss, a friend from Mr. Green's days as a squatter. ''He wasn't doing it to be trendy. He's always been that way. He was just doing it because it made sense.''

HEADLINE: The Euro Zone's 2nd Chance to Clean Up Banks

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON | REUTERS

 BODY:
One reason the euro zone is in such a mess is that it has not had the courage to clean up its banks. The United States gave its lenders a proper scrubbing, followed by recapitalization, in 2009. By contrast, the euro zone engaged in a series of halfhearted stress tests that missed many of the biggest banking problems, like those in Cyprus, Ireland and Spain.
In recent years, Europe has started to address these problems on a piecemeal basis. But it is still haunted by zombie banks, which are not strong enough to support an economic recovery. 
The European Central Bank now has a golden opportunity to press the reset button in advance of taking on the job of banking supervisor in mid-2014. It must not flunk the cleanup.
Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, is alive to the opportunity and the threat. His fear is that, even if the supervisor does its job properly, there will not be a safety net for troubled banks that cannot recapitalize themselves. This is why he called on governments last week to make an explicit commitment to provide such a ''backstop.''
Mr. Draghi highlighted the contrast between the U.S. stress test, in which Washington committed to plug any balance sheet holes, and the last stress test conducted by the European Banking Authority in 2011, which lacked such a commitment by governments. The U.S. test started the American economy on the road to recovery; the European one set off a new phase in the crisis.
The moral is obvious: Without a safety net, shining a light on problems can provoke panic. The supervisor may as a result be tempted to continue sweeping problems under the carpet. The euro zone's recovery would then be further delayed, and the E.C.B.'s credibility destroyed.
So far, governments have not responded to Mr. Draghi's request for a backstop. In the meantime, the E.C.B. and the banking authority -- which are working on different aspects of the cleanup -- have many issues to clarify.
First, who exactly will review the banks' assets? The E.C.B. does not yet have the manpower to do it. So it has to rely on national supervisors. The snag is that these supervisors could have an incentive to hide problems in their banks, so the cost of bailing them out is borne by the euro zone as a whole.
Mr. Draghi's answer is to get supervisors to cross-check the balance sheets of banks in other countries -- and to reinforce the audit's independence by involving private-sector assessors. The latter suggestion originally provoked unhappiness in France. But at a recent dinner with central bank governors, Mr. Draghi pushed his solution through.
That still leaves the question of whether the E.C.B. can conduct a sufficiently in-depth review given that it wants to finish the whole process by next spring. It needs to figure out how likely loans are to turn sour and whether banks have taken adequate provisions against that possibility. About 140 of the euro zone's top banks will be reviewed.
The E.C.B. should also look into whether lenders have used appropriate ''risk weights'' for their assets. A risk weight determines the size of the capital buffer a bank is required to hold. There is a widespread suspicion that many lenders are using artificially low weights to give the misleading impression that they are well-capitalized.
After the E.C.B. completes its review, the banking authority will conduct a stress test to check whether banks can survive a shock. This raises many other questions, on matters including how big a shock it will test; how much capital banks will need to have in this stressed scenario; and how long they will get to restock their capital if they fail the test. If the banking authority is too soft, the test will be exposed to ridicule in financial markets.
Yet another issue is whether capital shortfalls will be expressed as an absolute number -- like &#x20ac;1 billion, or $1.3 billion -- or as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The last banking authority test plumped for the percentage method, with the disastrous consequence that many banks solved their capital problem by selling assets and stopping lending -- and thus further crushing the economy. Ewald Nowotny, an E.C.B. council member, suggested to Reuters last month that this error would not be repeated.
Once all this is dealt with, the question then becomes who will provide a backstop in the event that a bank has a capital shortfall that it cannot fill itself, and its government has too much debt to help out.
One option would be for the European Stability Mechanism, the zone's bailout fund, to inject capital directly into banks. But Germany seems to have rejected this.
The main alternative is that the stability mechanism should lend money to national governments, which could then inject it into their banks. That is what happened last year when Spain's lenders got into trouble.
The snag is that this would add to the government's deficit and debt. A partial workaround could be for the European Commission to ignore any capital injections when it determines whether governments are doing enough to cut their deficits. Without such forbearance, the countries could be forced into another round of growth-pummeling austerity measures.
With so many issues to resolve, there is a risk that Europe's megabank cleanup will either be another damp squib or even create more damage. Having wasted five years failing to address the problem properly, the euro zone must make sure this does not happen.

HEADLINE: Conflicting Signals for End of One-Way Policy Traffic

BYLINE: By ANDY BRUCE | REUTERS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Financial markets have become convinced in the past two weeks that two years of one-way policy traffic from the developed world's central banks is coming to an end.
The difficulty, on the evidence of the last few days, is the mass of conflicting signals on how shaky things still are, or how much better they will get -- and as a result, getting from here to actual changes in policy will probably take months.
Since the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis administered another jolt to the global economy three years ago, central bank decisions on more monetary easing have not so much been a question of if, but when. The same has largely gone for a fragile U.S. recovery. 
That is not the case in 2013, even if global growth looks likely to disappoint again this year.
Faced with fewer immediate threats but still under pressure to nurse the world economy back to more convincing health, central bankers have been grasping at a disparate and volatile set of economic indicators for a guide on policy.
''That's a fairly difficult challenge at the best of times, and we're hardly in the best of times,'' said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.
Data from the United States last week summed up the problem.
Depending on the indicator, there was a case for the Federal Reserve maintaining support for the economy by pressing on with its $85 billion-a-month bond purchase program for a long time, or scaling it back soon.
U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly fell to the lowest level in four years, economists said -- a sign that the Fed will refrain from winding down its program anytime soon.
On the other hand, the news Friday that U.S. employers had stepped up hiring was interpreted as a sign of economic resilience, suggesting that the Fed could begin to scale back its stimulus this year.
The Fed's officials are split, too, meaning it could be months until a consensus emerges. But most economists expect a scaling back of bond purchases by the end of the year, and a sizeable number expect reduced buying as early as September. Of course, central bankers have to take into account developments in economies other than their own, and the economic data from the rest of the world has been similarly volatile.
''The indicators are mixed across the globe, some countries look a little more convincing than others. I'd put the U.S. and Canada as looking like a recovery is taking hold,'' said Mr. Wright, contrasting that with a situation in Britain and the euro zone that ''is still hit and miss.''
While a fairly quiet week for economic data lies ahead, central bankers and top officials from the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Asian Development Bank are expected to give their views on the world economy Monday at the 2013 Conference of Montreal.
For Europe and Japan, the question is whether more still needs to be done.
Early doubts about the effectiveness of a growth strategy outlined by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, dubbed Abenomics, pushed Japanese stocks to two-month lows Friday after their worst week in two years.
This week will provide a better idea of whether that was a blip in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan's announcement of $1.4 trillion in monetary stimulus, or a sign that it might not be enough to right the Japanese economy.
''Recent weakness in the market represents a little bit of a disappointment for Abenomics,'' said Kenji Shiomura, an analyst at Daiwa Securities.
''But it would be too extreme to say that hopes for Abenomics have faded completely because the biggest impact Abenomics gave the market was monetary easing, and it is still continuing.''
Perhaps the biggest worry for Japanese officials is the yen's spike to its strongest in two months against the dollar. While the government showed little concern about the Friday surge, the calm response masks a lack of solid policy options should the yen strengthen further and stamp on the country's ability to export.
European policy makers, like their U.S. counterparts, have had a hodgepodge of numbers to deal with.
Economic confidence figures have surprised on the upside in the euro zone over the last month, but harder data like business surveys still point to a dearth of demand. And like the Fed, the lack of a clear guide for the economy means the European Central Bank is sitting on the fence when it comes to the question of stimulus.
''There was a common assessment that the changes that have taken place are not sufficiently one-directional as to grant action now,'' the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, said after leaving policy unchanged last Thursday.
Britain has been leading the way in Europe of late, according to the latest business surveys. But like the United States, there is little certainty about whether Britain will keep up the momentum.
''I think when you look at turning points in the cycle, which is hopefully where we are in Europe, you do get these mixed signals. And that's what we're seeing,'' said Mr. Wright.

HEADLINE: J.F.K.'s 'Strategy of Peace'

BYLINE: By JAMES GOLDGEIER

 BODY:
Our problems are man-made. Therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable -- and we believe they can do it again. ... In the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.
-- John F. Kennedy, June 10, 1963 
Fifty years ago, not long after the Cuban missile crisis brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war, President John F. Kennedy took the stage at American University's commencement and delivered one of the finest presidential speeches in the history of U.S. foreign policy.
The fundamental existential question of the time was whether the two superpowers would engulf the planet in an all-out nuclear war. In response, Kennedy articulated that day a ''strategy of peace,'' declaring: ''We have no more urgent task'' than the pursuit of peace.
In a series of events held this spring at American University to commemorate the anniversary of this remarkable address, prominent speakers highlighted many of the core themes of Kennedy's speech, including the need for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the importance of engaging adversaries.
Nonproliferation of nuclear weapons remains a central global challenge, and it is easy to draw lessons from Kennedy's remarks in reflecting upon relationships such as those between the United States and North Korea, Israel and Iran, and India and Pakistan.
At a deeper level, however, Kennedy's speech was about the nuclear threat, the pursuit of peace over war, and the U.S. relationship with the Soviet Union, because those were the existential predicaments of the second half of the 20th century.
While nonproliferation and nuclear arms reduction agendas remain central today, as we honor Kennedy's legacy 50 years later, our most critical undertaking as a nation will be to grapple seriously with the existential threat of our time: climate change.
Climate change goes well beyond the impact of rising sea levels on low-lying communities.
Scholars from numerous disciplines -- political science, geography, demography, sociology, anthropology, economics and the natural sciences -- are studying climate change's impact on future violence and conflict as dramatic shifts and unexpected variations in weather patterns affect food production, human migration and settlement, and the availability of fresh water. The U.S. Defense Department and defense ministries abroad have raised the alarm of the real threat of climate change-induced conflict.
As climate variation affects populations worldwide, our leaders acknowledge the need for action. Yet many observers contend that the politics around this issue make action impossible.
Moreover, while critics have set aside their unsubstantiated arguments that climate change is not man-made, they have taken up the new charge in recent years that the United States can ill afford to enact policies that might inhibit economic growth, or that sacrifices in the West will do little to offset the pollution levels of emerging economies.
Yet not to act condemns future generations to a life built around simply trying to survive the damage we created.
As Kennedy argued forcefully in his ''strategy of peace,'' the United States must lead here, as it did in pursuing negotiations with its supreme adversary five decades ago.
Kennedy's legacy should inspire today's leaders to pursue a strategy of peace to address this century's existential threat, which may lead to a far more unstable world order than that which we ever imagined during the Cold War.
In his address at American University, Kennedy called for ''not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.'' Fifty years later, to honor his legacy, we should call for not merely a habitable planet in our time, but a habitable planet for all time.

HEADLINE: Research Forgotten by Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Many Republicans, and Democrats, never thought the automatic across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration would take effect. After all, they might produce dangerous, if unintended, consequences like potentially bankrupting the U.S. health care system, along with millions of families.
Typical Washington hyperbole, right? It actually is happening under the automatic cuts, which kicked in three months ago, a product of the political dysfunction in the United States. 
Because the cuts only affect the margins of a wide array of defense and domestic discretionary programs, there mostly hasn't been an immediate pinch; the public backlash has been minimal. But the long-term consequences, in more than a few cases, are ominous.
There is no better case study than Alzheimer's disease. With the enforced cuts at the National Institutes of Health, research to find a cure or better treatment is slowing.
Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Five million Americans are afflicted by the disease. It costs about $200 billion a year, creating severe strain for public health care and many families. Then there is the emotional toll: The Alzheimer's Association estimates that caregivers had an extra $9 billion of health care costs last year.
''As the population lives longer, Alzheimer's is the defining disease of this generation,'' said Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who is trying to fight the budget cuts and sharply increase spending for research.
The latest annual report on health statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention underscores her point. There is a lot of progress, in large part because of earlier N.I.H. efforts: The number of deaths from strokes and heart disease is down more than 30 percent over the past decade, and cancer deaths have declined almost 15 percent. The reverse has occurred with Alzheimer's. Over a decade, deaths have risen sharply, up 38 percent for men and 41 percent for women.
It is expected to get worse. A report this spring by the nonpartisan RAND Corp. estimates that by 2040, the number of Americans afflicted will have doubled, as will the costs. Other experts say that, as grave as those projections are, they may be underestimated. The Alzheimer's Association says that under current trends the cost will exceed $1 trillion annually by 2050. That would either bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid, the insurance programs for the elderly and the poor, or force tax increases.
Much critical health research in the United States generally emanates from the N.I.H., which has compiled a record of success with most diseases that has been the envy of the world.
The supporters of the automatic cuts do not seem fazed. The N.I.H. funding is cut 5 percent, or $1.55 billion this year, across the board. That means 700 fewer research grants are approved and 750 fewer patients will be admitted to its clinical center. The longer the automatic cuts go on, the worse it will get; medical breakthroughs are rarely instant. They take years and build on previous studies and experiments.
Before the cuts went into effect, Alzheimer's research was slated for a healthy increase this year. By moving a few discretionary funds, the N.I.H. has avoided cutbacks.
Still, the funding falls significantly short of the promise.
''In recent years, there have been some extraordinary advances, from genetics to molecular biology, that have given us insights into Alzheimer's that we didn't have before,'' said Richard Hodes, a physician who heads the N.I.H.'s National Institute on Aging.
About five in six grant applications currently aren't funded; Dr. Hodes said money for some of those grants and increasing some of the clinical trials, also being cut by the automatic cuts, would capitalize on these advances.
Ms. Collins said that aside from the human dimension, this is a simple cost-benefit analysis.
''We spend only $500 million annually on Alzheimer's research, and it costs Medicare and Medicaid $142 billion,'' she said. ''It's going to bankrupt our health care system and we're spending only a pittance on prevention.''
She wants to double the Alzheimer's research budget immediately and then double it again -- to $2 billion annually -- within five years. For most U.S. programs, huge increases in spending would cause reckless waste and inefficiency. N.I.H. is an exception. Fifteen years ago, its budget doubled in five years and the results were better than ever.
For N.I.H., there are other critical advances -- in areas like Parkinson's, diabetes and forms of cancer -- that are slowed by the budget cuts. And the automatic cuts, which do not touch entitlement spending or the tax benefits enjoyed by the wealthy, forces reductions in programs like Head Start for low-income kids, the nutritional program for women, infants and children or the meals on wheels initiatives for lower-income senior citizens.
Congress did act once to reverse the damage wrought by the automatic cuts: It undid some cuts affecting aviation.
There was an emergency; members could not be inconvenienced by flight delays or cancellations when getting back to their districts. They do not seem as motivated to help prevent or slow the spread of a wrenching affliction that costs a fortune.

HEADLINE: In Iran Race, All 8 Candidates Toe Hard Line on Nuclear Might

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- A group of chador-wearing female supporters of Iran's nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, cheered wildly when he entered a packed conference hall during a campaign stop at Tehran University last week.
''No compromise, no submission, only Jalili!'' they shouted, while waving a handwritten placard with the text: ''Negotiating with Satan is against the Koran.''
They are among many who support Mr. Jalili, who is the presidential candidate favored by Iran's hard-liners in Friday's presidential election.
He has built his campaign around implacable ''100 percent'' opposition to compromise with the West over the country's nuclear program. And while he and the seven other carefully vetted candidates might disagree on issues like women's rights and economic troubles, when it comes to Iran's nuclear program they are all saying the same thing: there will be no backing down, no bargaining away the nation's perceived right to enrich uranium for power generation. 
Even his opponent on the far side of Iran's narrow political spectrum, the cleric Hassan Rowhani -- the closest any of the candidates comes to the reformist camp -- avoids any mention of the word ''compromise'' when discussing the nuclear program. He spends much of his time fending off attacks from political opponents who accuse him of having already sold out the country's rights when he was the nuclear negotiator by temporarily suspending uranium enrichment while under heavy international pressure in 2004.
Hoping to force Iran to stop enriching uranium and begin negotiating in earnest, the Obama administration has imposed tough economic sanctions that appear to be wreaking havoc on Iran's economy. But if the presidential campaign is any indication, rather than forcing a capitulation, the sanctions seem only to have stiffened Iran's will to resist.
''Year after year, America has imposed harsher sanctions on us,'' said Nader Karimi Joni, an Iranian journalist who is critical of certain state polices. ''Now, with these candidates, we see the consequences: the sanctions hurt, but they have made our leaders much more determined.''
The stances of Mr. Jalili, the current nuclear negotiator, and Mr. Rowhani, the former negotiator, illustrate how much Iran's position has hardened after a decade of escalating sanctions and increasing international isolation.
Mr. Jalili, in particular, has turned the election into a referendum on the country's nuclear stance, banking on the support of Iran's governing establishment, a mix of conservative clerics and Islamic Revolutionary Guards commanders for whom anti-Western sentiment is a staple.
Mr. Rowhani, who has been attracting support from some of the veterans of the now silenced green movement, led the first rounds of negotiations with Western countries, after the 2002 disclosure of Iran's secret nuclear program.
Under his watch, two years later, Iran temporarily suspended enrichment of uranium as a confidence-building measure, but the Western powers stood by their demand that the entire program be terminated, accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons.
Mr. Rowhani now finds himself mocked by the Jalili camp, which cites those negotiations as an example of ignorance and weakness.
''We disarmed ourselves'' by suspending enrichment, an official of Mr. Jalili's campaign said in a film shown on state television last week.
''They assumed we would suspend, shut down and destroy our nuclear facilities,'' Mr. Jalili himself says in the film, quoting Joschka Fischer, who was then Germany's foreign minister. ''Resistance is the solution to our problems,'' he says over and over again.
As talks waxed and waned, Iran's nuclear program ballooned. Following the end of suspension in 2005, Iran went from having two dozen test centrifuges to having nearly 17,000, according to the May 2013 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The current sanctions against Iran have slashed the value of its currency, aggravated its already high inflation rate and cut many of its financial ties to the rest of the world. Iran is increasingly resorting to barter trade with remaining oil buyers India and China as financial transactions have become nearly impossible.
But there are few if any signs of the sanctions' effects on Iran's streets. Gas stations have plenty of fuel, supermarket shelves are still filled and in recent months the currency, which lost half of its value over the past year, has been stable.
To give in to the pressure would hurt Iran's negotiation position, all the candidates agree. ''Only on the day that the Americans lose hope in all sorts of plots, military war and economic war, will we be able to hold talks based on logic,'' another candidate, Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, said on state television.
''Logic'' is a code word, analysts say, which translates as accepting the Iranian position that it has a ''right'' to enrichment without restrictions.
Mr. Rowhani, a close ally of the pragmatic Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was barred from the race by the conservative Guardian Council, is one of just a few prominent politicians proposing better relations with the outside world.
And he offered a pointed reminder in a televised debate by presidential candidates on Friday, noting that the suspension of enrichment in 2004 happened ''under the leader's guidance,'' meaning that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had signed off on it.
There are other politicians who have questioned the government's recent negotiating stance, if not the commitment to nuclear development.
During the debate, one presidential candidate, Ali Akbar Velayati, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Khamenei, argued that Mr. Jalili, with all his talk of never compromising, had in essence made no progress, either.
''You want to take 3 steps, and you expect the other side to take 100 steps. This means you don't want to make progress,'' Mr. Velayati said. ''We can't expect everything and give nothing.''
Many analysts, however, note that two major factors run against any softening: widespread public support for nuclear power and, even more important, the will of Ayatollah Khamenei.
''It is our people who do not allow the candidates to talk of compromise,'' said Hamid Reza Taraghi, an analyst with viewpoints close to that of Iran's governing establishment of conservative clerics and military commanders. ''And our supreme leader also says there is no room for a nuclear compromise.''
In an address on Tuesday, Ayatollah Khamenei acknowledged that Iran was suffering from economic problems and inflation, but he stressed that anybody thinking that appeasing Western countries was the key to a solution was mistaken.
''Some have this wrong analysis that we should make concessions to the enemy in order to lighten the anger they have against us,'' Mr. Khamenei told an audience at the annual commemoration of the death of the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Khomeini. ''In fact, they prefer the enemy's interests to the interests of the nation. This is wrong.''

HEADLINE: Affirmative Reaction

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
In the coming days the Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case that could further restrict the use of race as a factor in college admissions. A white student denied a place at the University of Texas at Austin claims that although Texas uses race sparingly in its college admissions, the state is still cheating white students and violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The betting among court watchers is that the verdict will be another setback for racial affirmative action. As a supporter of diversity, I wonder: could that be a blessing in disguise?
I am not a disinterested bystander on the subject. As an editor, I have long believed that hiring and promoting talented minorities was not just a moral obligation but a professional imperative: to comprehend a disparate world and present it to a disparate audience, it helps to have a reporting and editing staff with a diversity of experience and perspective. As a trustee of a liberal arts college, I've supported admission of black and Latino students not just as a remedy for historic injustice but because something fundamental is missing from a campus where everybody is pretty much alike. Diversity tends to make institutions more creative, more adaptable, more productive. 
But over the years, following the work of scholars like Richard Kahlenberg at the Century Foundation, Anthony Carnevale of Georgetown and Marta Tienda of Princeton, I've come to think there may be a better way to accomplish diversity: namely, by shifting attention from race to class. The idea is controversial, the execution is complicated and it doesn't come cheap, but it promises a richer kind of variety -- and it is less likely to run afoul of the Supreme Court.
We already have a growing body of experience in several states where race-based affirmative action has been curtailed by courts or ballot initiatives. Universities in those states have tried creative ways to achieve diversity by weighing economic factors. Some have expanded their outreach and financial aid to low-income or working-class students of all races, or to children of single parents, or to students from families where no one has gone to college. Some have partnered with disadvantaged high schools. Texas replaced most racial preferences with a rule that any student in the top 10 percent of his or her high school graduating class is assured admission to a state college, thus greatly increasing college access for poor kids. (Most University of Texas admissions come from this pool. The rest are chosen using a menu of factors, including race, which is what the Supreme Court case is about.) California, where Proposition 209 banned all racial preferences in 1996, employs a similar system, taking the top 9 percent.
I hope the Supreme Court will allow universities to continue using race as one factor in admissions, at least for a time. There is no question that it is a relatively efficient way to make higher education less monochromatic. But sooner or later, racial preferences, which were originally designed to be temporary, will end. Whatever the court decides in the pending case, it is time for college administrators to shift their attention decisively away from racial preferences to an affirmative action based on class. Here's why:
1. Racial preferences are highly unpopular. They contribute to the kind of resentments politicians on the right pander to in code, from Ronald Reagan's ''welfare queens'' to Mitt Romney's ''47 percent.'' On the other hand, polls show that most Americans are willing to give a leg up to students who have grown up in poverty. Of course, the popular thing is not always the right thing, but Americans are more likely to support the taxes to pay for high-quality education if they think the system is fair.
2. Economic inequality is increasingly recognized as an even greater menace to our national well-being than racial discrimination. Huge and growing disparities of wealth contribute to a shift of political power from the many to the privileged few, retard economic growth and productivity, and undermine the values we profess. So affirmative action that puts poor and working-class students on the on-ramp to success is good for our economy, legitimizing for our democracy and consistent with our values. Racism is still a toxic reality in our country. But the gulf between the wealthy and the poor is wider and even more socially corrosive than the gap between black and white. And basing college admissions on economic status does not mean giving up on racial diversity, because...
3. As it happens, a well-designed program of socioeconomic preference also increases minority enrollment. Racial preferences don't help all that much in promoting class diversity, because selective colleges heavily favor minorities from middle-class and affluent families; but class-based preferences favor minorities, because blacks and Hispanics are more heavily represented among the poor. It is true that affirmative action based on economic disadvantage has not proved to be quite as effective as explicit racial preferences at bolstering minority enrollment -- ''Nothing is as good a proxy for race as race itself,'' says Sean Reardon of Stanford, who favors using both class and race. But a class-based system can come close. At the University of California's Irvine campus, which introduced class-based admissions after Proposition 209, the number of students who are the first in their families to attend college has risen dramatically, and black and Hispanic enrollment has roughly doubled. There are many other examples in a 2012 Century Foundation study. As Kahlenberg and Carnavale have pointed out, minorities would benefit even more from class-based admissions if the formula took into account one indicator that is generally not counted: a family's net worth. Because wealth is accumulated over generations, it captures the legacy of slavery and segregation much better than income.
4. The impact of affirmative action for the poor seems to trickle down. Thurston Domina, an assistant professor of education at Irvine, studied the disadvantaged high schools that now feed into the Texas 10 percent program. He found that the lure of assured admission and a few college scholarships significantly raised the aspirations and performance of students in those poor schools. Attendance was up, college applications were up, test scores were up, enrollment in advanced courses was up. There is anecdotal evidence that the same thing is happening under California's program. This is particularly exciting given that the most urgent need for raising educational standards occurs long before kids graduate from high school.
5. One argument that doesn't get much attention is that enrolling students from poor and working-class backgrounds is likely to increase ideological diversity. Conservatives may exaggerate the extent to which universities are bastions of left-leaning godlessness, but it is fair to say that on most campuses social conservatives, the deeply religious and the children of military families are scarcely heard. As a result, the political discourse can be glib, predictable and impoverished. Class-based diversity would oblige students of different beliefs to test and sharpen their convictions.
The biggest obstacle to class-based affirmative action, as Richard Perez-Pena pointed out in The Times the other day, is the obvious one: cost. Poor and working-class students are by definition in need of more financial aid. That is why universities have shown little interest in switching. It's cheaper to bring in students of color from middle-class or affluent families. (It also brings in kids with higher SAT test scores, which count so heavily in the obsessively watched college rankings.) Cost is the reason that even many proponents of class-based affirmative action favor what Tienda calls ''a holistic approach'' -- class and race both.
''I'm sympathetic to that,'' counters Kahlenberg, ''but I think that in the real world universities will never get around to addressing class as long as they have race as one of their instruments.''
If he's wrong about that, it's up to the universities to prove it.

HEADLINE: 2 Koreas Agree to Discuss Restoring Economic and Other Ties as Strains Ease

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North and South Korea agreed Monday to hold high-level government talks later this week to discuss reversing not only the recent suspension of their joint operation of an industrial complex in a Northern border town, but also other economic and humanitarian projects that faltered years ago amid tensions built by North Korean nuclear tests, international sanctions and threats of war.
The agreement was struck between delegates from the two Koreas after 17 hours of negotiations at the ''truce village'' of Panmunjom straddling the inter-Korean border, where the 1953 armistice ending the three-year Korean War was signed. The high-level dialogue, which the two sides agreed to hold in Seoul on Wednesday and Thursday, will be the first senior government talks on the divided Korean Peninsula in six years. 
The agreement was a clear sign that North and South Korea were easing tensions and moving toward a thaw after years of recriminations that hit a peak earlier this year, after the North's third nuclear test prompted broad international sanctions. The North responded with a frenzy of threats against the South and its ally, the United States.
Last week, North Korea made a surprise overture proposing government-to-government dialogue with the South. South Korea quickly accepted, offering to hold cabinet minister-level talks in Seoul on Wednesday. Their delegates met at Panmunjom on Sunday in a meeting that stretched into early Monday as they haggled over the agenda.
They eventually agreed that the talks should include the possibility of reopening the industrial park at Kaesong, and restarting cross-border tours and Red Cross programs that arrange reunions of families separated by the Korean War. All three projects, introduced during a period of inter-Korean rapprochement between 1998 and 2008, were suspended as relations deteriorated in the past few years.
Cross-border tours were canceled in 2008 after North Korean soldiers shot and killed a South Korean tourist and the North then rejected South Korean demands for a joint investigation and measures to prevent similar episodes. The two Koreas held their last reunion of separated families in 2010.
The joint industrial zone in Kaesong, a North Korean border town, had been the last symbol of cooperation until the North suddenly pulled out its 53,000 workers, blaming military tensions, and left South Korean factory owners at a loss to meet orders.
In the coming high-level talks, the most contentious question will be the conditions imposed on any of the suspended projects before they can be reopened. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea has repeatedly said her government is determined to end a ''vicious cycle'' in which the South appeases the North after its provocations. And her aides have said that the South would not revive the projects ''as if nothing had happened'' and that the North must take steps to ensure that it would not sacrifice economic projects for political ends.
They have also said that South Korean efforts to engage the North would be limited until the stalemate is broken over North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Before starting the talks on Sunday, Chun Hae-sung, the chief South Korean delegate, reiterated that the North and South could move toward greater economic cooperation and political reconciliation when they ''start building trust on small things first.''
But during the border talks, North Korea called for more expansive exchanges with the South, causing a prolonged haggling over the agenda of the talks in Seoul.
In the end, they agreed not to nail down the agenda. The South announced that the Seoul meeting would discuss only the reopening of the three economic and humanitarian projects. But in its own announcement, North Korea said that the agenda would also include discussions on increasing civilian exchanges and other cooperative projects between the two Koreas. It also wanted to discuss a possible joint celebration of the anniversary of the 2000 inter-Korean summit meeting agreement that called for large South Korean investments in the North.
That deal has been suspended since 2008, when conservatives came to power in Seoul and insisted that North Korea give up its nuclear weapons first if it wanted South Korean largess to continue.

HEADLINE: What's Next for Social Security?

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The trustees of Social Security recently reported that the retirement system can pay full benefits until 2035, when it will be able to pay about three-fourths of promised benefits. That is not a crisis. It is a manageable problem.
The system needs to be restored to long-term health, but policy makers must realize that broad-based benefit cuts are not really a viable option. For most people, the ability to finance a secure retirement has been ruined by stagnating wages, repeated stock market busts, diminished home equity and weakened or nonexistent pensions. Social Security, whose average monthly retirement benefit is $1,268, is pretty much all that is left. Most people age 65 and older get two-thirds to all of their income from Social Security. 
And yet, in the deficit-obsessed, anti-tax world of Washington, closing the shortfall in Social Security has come to mean broadly cutting benefits. That would be a mistake. Targeted cuts -- like lower payouts for upper-income recipients who live longer and draw larger benefits -- could improve the system's finances and fairness.
But those who promote across-the-board cuts are not interested in strengthening the system. They want to reduce the budget deficit. And even though Social Security is not a cause of today's deficits, they would rather cut benefits than improve the system's finances by imposing tax increases on higher-income taxpayers or phasing in a modest payroll tax increase over decades.
The focus on benefit cuts also conveniently ignores the fact that benefits are already shrinking. Under current law, benefits are being reduced by the higher retirement age, which has been gradually rising from 65 to 67 for those born in 1960 or later. That translates into lower monthly benefits for those who retire at 65 or fewer years of benefits for those who work until 67. For example, a worker entitled to a $1,000 monthly benefit upon retirement at age 67 will get only $867 if he or she retires at 65.
Benefit checks are also being reduced by higher Medicare Part B premiums, which are deducted from Social Security benefits. The premiums are set to rise from 5 percent of benefits, on average, for those retiring in 2002 to 9.5 percent for those retiring in 2030. And if you factor in rising co-payments on health care services, most retirees already face living on less.
Taxes further erode benefit payments because the levels at which benefits become taxable -- generally, $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for couples -- have never been adjusted for wage growth or inflation. By 2030, more than half of recipients will owe tax on a portion of their benefits, compared with 10 percent when the taxes were first imposed, in 1984.
The upshot is that under current law, Social Security benefits will replace 31 percent of the typical retiree's preretirement earnings in 2030, compared with 42 percent as recently as 2004, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. And that includes only the big reductions. Benefits are also smaller because of changes instituted in 1983 that permanently delayed all retirees' first cost-of-living adjustment for six months. A misguided plan by the Obama administration to cut the COLA as part of a deficit reduction package would add to that cutback.
Social Security benefit cuts are already well under way, and they cannot go much further. Reform should balance cuts with tax increases, including raising the level of wages subject to payroll tax. It should also include a plan to create good jobs and foster immigration, bolstering the income and number of workers paying into the system. There are sensible ways to fix Social Security without undermining it as a support against hardship in old age.

HEADLINE: A V.I.P. Ticket to Ride

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Theme parks have traditionally been the ultimate melting pots. Tourists, retirees, rowdy teenagers, families and fathers who would rather be golfing are all thrown together in an egalitarian experience in which the line for one is the line for all, and cotton candy is the food of the masses.
Not anymore.
As stratification becomes more pronounced in all corners of America, from air travel to Broadway shows to health care, theme parks in recent years have been adopting a similarly tiered model, with special access and perks for those willing to pay. 
Now Universal Studios Hollywood has pushed the practice to a new level.
It has introduced a $299 V.I.P. ticket, just in time for the summer high season, that comes with valet parking, breakfast in a luxury lounge, special access to Universal's back lot, unlimited line-skipping and a fancy lunch.
V.I.P. visitors also receive ''amenity kits,'' which include mints, a poncho to wear on the ''Jurassic Park'' water ride and bottles of hand sanitizer.
Disney still serves up its roller coasters the old-fashioned way -- one rank for everyone, white collar next to blue -- but Universal says it had experienced rising demand for special access and price distinctions.
''Consumers want what they want,'' said Xiomara Wiley, senior vice president for marketing and sales at Universal Studios Hollywood, which charges $80 for a no-frills ticket and $149 for one that allows for limited line-skipping.
But others see it differently. While there is no ''Occupy Universal'' movement blossoming, some customers contend that the park has created a conspicuous class system that threatens to overshadow the fun.
''It creates haves and have-nots, which is disturbing,'' said Robin McQuay, a teacher and fervent fan of theme parks. ''There's this feeling of, 'Aren't you a loser because you can't afford to be a line-skipping V.I.P.?' ''
She added, ''Oh, sure, by all means zip to the front of the line with that grin while the rest of us sweat it out next to the screaming baby.''
On a recent Friday at Universal, a breeze rustled the palm trees as several hundred people waited in the snaking queue for a tram tour of the park's back lot. It was the quintessential theme park scene: tourists chattering noisily, a chubby man digging through his fanny pack, boys using the railings as a swing set.
''How much longer?'' one whined to his mother.
People who recoil at crowds but enjoy theme parks used to come in the off season. But relentless advertising, new attractions and an improving economy now keep attendance high year-round. Universal's three theme parks in the United States attracted roughly 20 million people last year, a 19 percent increase from 2010, analysts estimate. The Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World recently recorded the busiest day in its 41-year history.
''If Universal didn't offer a V.I.P. option, I wouldn't go,'' said Mark Lieber, chief executive of Rethink Entertainment and Media. ''I just don't have the time to wait in a line, and I want a certain level of service.'' (He did feel a twinge of guilt, however: ''They should give deserving students access to the V.I.P. tours once a week. That way it's not just for the privileged.'')
The amusement park industry urgently wants to expand profits without introducing costly new rides every summer. NBCUniversal, which recorded $953 million in profit from its parks in 2012, has no major new attractions planned for Universal Studios Hollywood until next year; the V.I.P. Experience, in the meantime, is a relatively low-cost way to generate revenue and send a message of bigger and better into the marketplace.
Universal upgraded its V.I.P. Experience -- and raised the price by 50 percent -- after realizing that the old one, which did not include lunch, the lounge or other perks, ''was selling out more and more frequently,'' Ms. Wiley said.
How is the new offering going over? She declined to disclose sales data, but said that ''we're seeing double-digit percent increases in terms of volume.''
As for worries about creating a sense of class warfare, Ms. Wiley said Universal had none. ''We don't find any of our existing guests giving us that feedback,'' she said. ''People who come on a regular Joe ticket give us really good ratings.''
Fearful of puncturing its utopian image, Disney has stuck to a single class of ticket. V.I.P. tour guides are available, but Disney charges an exorbitant price -- up to $380 an hour, with a minimum of six hours -- to limit demand. (Some critics say such pricing restricts guides to the truly rich.)
There is clearly strong demand at Disney for a special-access offering to be more broadly available. Last month, The New York Post reported that a few wealthy Manhattan parents had paid a disabled stranger more than $1,000 a day to pose as a family member, allowing the whole group to skip Disney World's often exhausting lines. (''We are thoroughly reviewing the situation and will take appropriate steps to deter this type of activity,'' Disney said in a statement.)
Will Disney join Universal in charging for special access and enhanced experiences, perhaps using its new MyMagicPlus park navigation system? A spokeswoman for the company said it had no such plans. But analysts are watching closely. ''Parks are trying to maximize their revenue in a marketplace that's becoming more and more economically stratified anyway,'' said Robert Niles, editor of ThemeParkInsider.com.
Alan Plotkin, for one, was thrilled that special access was available at Universal Studios Hollywood.
''It was expensive, but we saw much more than other people, and the guides really treated us royally,'' he said. With DVD extras, people know a lot about how movies are made now. ''But this took it to another level,'' he said. He particularly enjoyed poking through Universal's prop and costume shops.
Mr. Plotkin, chief of a health care organization in Pennsylvania, and his wife, Merle, were part of a nine-person tour that recently set out from that luxury lounge, hand sanitizer at the ready. ''There go the V.I.P. people -- wave goodbye, you may never see them again,'' an announcer boomed into a microphone.
The group was subjected to minimal mingling with the masses. The Plotkins were even able to eat lunch in a private, quiet dining room, sampling items like sake-poached shrimp, New Zealand mussels and New York sirloin from a lavish buffet. (Outside, no-frills ticketholders stood in line for hamburgers at the Flintstones Bar-B-Q pit.)
The V.I.P. day started on new 20-person trolleys equipped with iPhone chargers and bottles of water packed in ice. One of the first stops was Courthouse Square, where movies like ''Back to the Future'' were filmed.
As the Plotkins and other high-end ticket holders peeked inside the set, one of the park's 175-person trams, carrying ordinary customers, slowed to a stop. Riders started taking pictures, but they were unable to step off -- the tram stopped for only about 30 seconds -- and some were still snapping photos as it drove away.
The V.I.P.'s lingered. ''Take your pictures at your leisure,'' a guide told them.

HEADLINE: Infectious Diseases

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Pressure Grows to Create Drugs for 'Superbugs' '' (front page, June 3): 
The time for talk has passed. We are on a fast track backward to a pre-antibiotic era when infectious diseases were the leading cause of death. If you think this is hype, just ask any infectious diseases specialist at a major medical center who struggles to treat multidrug-resistant Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, E. coli, MRSA and Enterococci. Many forms of these organisms can only be treated with a single drug class, if at all.
These common infections threaten our ability to implement advanced medical procedures and can also arise from injuries outside the hospital. American military combatants wounded in the Middle East encounter this problem all too often.
A novel funding mechanism or incentive program that spurs responsible antibiotic development after a generation of indifference should be embraced openly. Engaging the academic community and pharmaceutical industry in a development partnership may be the best way to jump-start the process. Finding excuses not to act will certainly compromise the advances of modern medicine and our overall health security.

HEADLINE: Nestlé Adds Premium Brand in Still Water Arena

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
DRINKING tap water is essentially free, but even during the economic downturn, consumers have sprung for bottled water, with sales in the United States increasing 6.7 percent in 2012, to $11.8 billion, according to the International Bottled Water Association. Americans on average drank 30.8 gallons of bottled water, 5.3 percent more than in 2011.
Now Nestlé Waters North America, the top producer with about a third of the domestic bottled water market, hopes to make a splash with a new brand it is introducing nationally, Resource. 
Larry Cooper, group marketing manager for Resource, said the brand, which was introduced in Whole Foods in 2009, then Southern California in 2012 before its national rollout early this month, is intended for the most discriminating water drinker.
''We look at bottled water as being at a more value, mainstream or premium level,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''And we have incredibly good coverage in those first two tiers, but we haven't in all these years had a premium entry to compete with the Smartwater, Fijis and Evians of the world,'' he continued, referring to the Glacéau, Fiji Water Company and Danone Waters of North America brands.
While Nestlé owns premium sparkling water brands like San Pellegrino and Perrier, Resource is what it calls its first domestically sourced premium brand of still water, meaning noncarbonated and noneffervescent.
Nestlé Pure Life has a narrow lead in the bottled still water category, with a 10 percent share, followed by Dasani, a Coca-Cola brand, with a 9.7 percent share, and Aquafina, a PepsiCo brand, with a 9.4 share, according to data for the 52 weeks ending May 19 from SymphonyIRI Group, a market data company. Other Nestlé brands include Poland Spring, with a 6.3 share, Deer Park, with a 4.4 share, and Ozarka, with a 3.4 share.
Resource is being aimed primarily at ''a woman who is a little more on the trendy side and higher-income side, and the bull's-eye is 35 years old,'' Mr. Cooper said.
New print ads show the bottle in lush woodland settings, and highlight ''100 percent naturally occurring electrolytes -- for taste, never added'' and that the bottle has 50 percent recycled plastic content.
''It's more than hydration, it's total electrolytenment,'' says the headline in the ads, which will be introduced on Monday in publications including People, Vanity Fair, In Style and Fitness. The campaign, which includes online advertising, is by McCann, New York, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Public relations efforts for the campaign are by Cone Communications in Boston.
Nestlé, which declined to reveal expenditures for the new campaign, spent $51.5 million in 2012 on domestic advertising for its bottled water brands, according to Kantar Media, part of WPP.
Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council generally discourage drinking bottled water because of resources required to source, bottle and ship the water, not to mention the impact on the waste stream. But Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, commended Resource for using bottles that contain 50 percent recycled plastic.
''The fact that they are using recycled content in their bottles is something that all beverage companies should emulate,'' Mr. Hershkowitz said.
In the United States, Coca-Cola brands use an average of about 5 percent recycled content in plastic bottles and PepsiCo soft drink brands average about 10 percent, the companies said.
As for promoting electrolytes, David G. Schardt, a senior nutritionist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, noted that Resource stopped short of explicitly claiming they benefit health.
''They're trying to stay away from F.D.A. interference but it also allows them to leave it up to the consumer to imagine the benefits that might come from electrolytes,'' Mr. Schardt said.
With the exception of distilled water, all water contains some naturally occurring electrolytes like sodium and potassium, he said, adding that the added electrolytes in sports drinks are necessary only for extreme exertion.
''Replacing your electrolytes is only an issue for endurance athletes sweating for hours, not a jogger going out for a half-hour,'' Mr. Schardt said.
Electrolytes and recycled content aside, Mr. Cooper said the real goal for Resource is to transcend mere beverage status.
''We want to raise it to the level of a lifestyle brand,'' he said, ''where she's proud to carry around Resource as her bottled water accessory, so to speak.''
In a deal with ''Project Runway,'' the reality show on Lifetime, Resource will be featured throughout the 12th season, which will begin on July 18. In one episode the water will be integral to the theme of a design challenge, when fashion designers will be taken to a pastoral setting and challenged with reflecting elements of the natural environment in their designs.
Resource also has signed endorsement deals with Bobbie Thomas, the style editor on the ''Today'' show on NBC, Aida Mollenkamp, the host of ''FoodCrafters'' on the Cooking Channel, and Brett Hoebel, a fitness trainer who starred on ''The Biggest Loser'' on NBC.
It also will participate in fund-raising events for Dress for Success, the organization that provides professional clothing and confidence training to woman struggling to join the work force.
''As we're trying to reach this new target, the brand is saying we've got to come at what their interests are and support their endeavors and causes,'' said Leslie Sims, an executive creative director at McCann. ''You have to be more interesting than just touting product benefits.''

HEADLINE: The Once (but No Longer) Golden Age of Human Capital

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Higher education advocates should face up to the possibility that global markets will drive down the dollar value of a college degree, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
Only slightly more than half of college presidents (54 percent) believe that a bachelor's degree is worth more or a lot more than five years ago, according to a recent survey conducted by the Chronicle of Higher Education.
A majority of Americans (57 percent) say the higher education system in the United States fails to provide students with good value for the money they and their families spend, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. 
It seems that the golden age of human capital is losing its shine.
That shine came not just from a high rate of return (both individual and social) on a college degree, but also from a beautiful, if partial, alignment between ideals of human development and the needs of employers.
It was a happy alignment, not just for college professors and their students, but for the soul of capitalism itself. Academic striving would be rewarded. Merit would prevail. Students willing and able to invest in their own abilities had a good shot at permanent prosperity.
Not anymore. Problems are particularly conspicuous on the supply side: declining state support, higher tuition and fees, increased inequality of access and the growing burden of debt. The investment costs more than it once did and remains beyond the reach of those who need it most.

Problems are also increasingly apparent on the demand side: high unemployment and underemployment rates among college graduates.
Historical data suggest that investing in college still offers significant economic benefits to those who actually complete their degree requirements and find employment (especially if they enjoy parental support or generous financial aid).
But private rates of return have begun to decline. Uncertainty about future benefits lowers the expected dollar value of a degree. Rates of return differ widely by personal characteristics, the institutions students attend and the majors they choose.
In their highly respected economic history, "The Race Between Education and Technology," Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz contend that the demand for college-educated workers began to outstrip the supply in the United States about 1980. Since then, the college premium, or difference in lifetime earnings between those with degrees and without, has increased.
But in the 1990s the global supply of college-educated workers burgeoned and large American corporations improved their ability to use skilled labor in other countries. As the economist Richard Freeman points out, developing countries have invested heavily - and successfully - in their higher education systems. In 2005 Chinese universities awarded five times as many bachelor's degrees as they did in 1999.
This global expansion of the educated labor force is likely to put downward pressure on the college premium in the United States.
Another possibility is that the demand for highly educated workers has changed shape in recent years. With vast improvements in information technology, employers may now seek a small number of specialized, technically trained experts rather than a large number of versatile, diversified liberal arts graduates.
Certainly students are now encouraged to think more strategically about their majors and to specialize in more technical fields. This is good financial advice, but it won't guarantee success. Unlike financial capital, which can be easily moved from one investment to another, investment in human capital represents a sunk cost.
If more and more students pile into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the wage premiums for those majors could decline. With a high rate of technical change and continued globalization of labor markets, some students could also find their specialization obsolete. Someday soon there will probably be an app for writing apps.
The evolution of the global human capital market has momentous political implications. Like many Democrats, President Obama is bullish on human capital. He favors increased public investment in education, ranging from early childhood to post-secondary programs. The assertion that such spending will generate a high individual and social rate of return is based on the optimistic expectation that demand for better-educated workers will remain strong.
On the other hand, many critics of public-education subsidies are bearish on human capital. The economist Richard Vedder, for instance, warns against both private and public overinvestment in education, pointing to the growing tendency for college graduates to land in jobs that don't actually require the credential they hold.
If the bears are right, we may be moving toward a stage of capitalism less dependent on a growing supply of home-grown human capital. In that case, many of those bullish on higher education investments in the United States could end up as red meat.
Those who believe, as I do, that education has intrinsic value both to individuals and to society as a whole should reconsider their habit of relying on market-based private rate-of-return rhetoric.
Rather than bowing to market forces, an intelligent, well-educated citizenry would bend those forces toward better ends, including the best possible development of human capabilities.

HEADLINE: Are Students Who Go Far Away to College More Likely to Study Abroad?

BYLINE: MICHAEL A. WILNER


HIGHLIGHT: The correlation between going far away for college and studying abroad in more challenging countries has not been studied closely, experts say, but more general indications of comfort level often prove determinative. 

 BODY:
Katie Anne Scott was the only one of her friends to leave California for college. None of them understood her desire to leave, with so many terrific options for college in her home state. And yet to Ms. Scott, from San Diego, that was just the point. Staying in California meant she would not experience anything new.
After enrolling at Emory University in Atlanta and accommodating to the South, where the car culture and the demographics were radically different, Ms. Scott found herself applying similar logic to her options for study abroad. 
"I might not have gone to Ghana if Emory hadn't geared me for it," Ms. Scott said during a Skype interview earlier this year from her adopted African home. "I just have one suitcase here, and that's fine. But most of my friends here don't have that experience, so it's definitely been easier for me. Ultimately, it's still just a plane ride."
Ms. Scott is just the type of student of interest among advisers for studying abroad who are trying to figure out why sophomores and juniors choose to study where they do. While these advisers need to know how best to organize their annual budgets and which programs to finance or cut, many colleges are also busy strategizing how to effectively motivate students not just to go abroad, but also to choose developing countries - with emerging markets and less familiar cultures - as their destinations.
The correlation between going far from home for college and studying abroad in more challenging countries has not been studied closely, experts acknowledge, but more general indications of comfort level often prove determinative.

A 2009 study by the National Association for College Admission Counseling indicates that the education level, income and travel experience of parents are the easiest ways to determine how far away a student is willing to go for college. Seventy-two percent of Americans go to college in their home state; only 16 percent end up enrolling in a school that is neither in their home state nor in a bordering state.
New research indicates that those same factors drive decisions to study abroad.
"It's the conceivability factor: what seems conceivable for students," said Nick Gozik, the director of the office of international programs at Boston College. "What does your family say? Here, there are socioeconomic differences. For students who come from less privileged backgrounds, getting to university is already a hurdle. Getting abroad feels like extra."
Mr. Gozik began studying these trends at Duke University; he has since coordinated an assessment working group between Boston College and Duke to continue his research. Duke cites a host of variables that make it difficult to measure the importance of a student's distance from home, ranging from household income to where in the world one's college friends have chosen to congregate that particular semester.
"In national statistics as well as statistics here at Duke, students have chosen, on the whole, not to go to more challenging places," said Margaret Riley, the director of the global education office for undergraduates at Duke, where just under half of all students study abroad. The top home state of Duke students is California.
The same ease of mobility that first allowed students to enroll in colleges throughout the country has also made studying abroad increasingly feasible: the decline in airfare costs since airline deregulation in the 1970s, growing college endowments that now extend financial aid to studying abroad, and the Internet, which allows students to keep in touch with their families and discover schools and programs far and wide.
"There's a requirement that these students are going to have to be more independent," said Bruce Poch, a former dean of admissions of Pomona College who is now a college counselor at the Chadwick School in California. "And there's still an adventuresomeness to students who choose that path. There are just a lot of kids who don't want to go to school with the same people they went to high school with, and they do that against a lot of pressure."
At Grinnell College, where 65 percent of juniors chose to study abroad last year, the majority of students come from outside of Iowa. Grinnell's study abroad office sees a willingness from those students to travel to more challenging places more consistently than is the national norm.
"What makes a student choose a safe location, versus one that's more challenging, is an important question," said Richard Bright, the director of off-campus study at Grinnell. "But we do know that most of our students are taking a flight here. So plenty of students are coming from distant parts of the country, and then they really go all over the world."
Among the 1 percent of students enrolled at American colleges and universities who study abroad each year, three-quarters are Caucasian and two-thirds are female. 
"I'm not sure who has the greater challenge: the student who has not been out of the four counties around their college who goes to Europe for the summer, or the student who comes to university from 2,000 miles away and then goes to Thailand," said Joseph Brockington, the director for the center for international programs at Kalamazoo College. "But we know from research in the education abroad area that if Mom and Dad can't imagine themselves in the location, they're unlikely to let their kids go."
"It's not about whether they'll have toilets that flush," Mr. Brockington added. "It's about whether their kids will be taken care of. So we try hard to dispel the rumors, but if Mom's against it, it's not going to happen."
Grace Hancock of Atlanta, in a switch of sorts with Ms. Scott, is now a freshman at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Her thinking was similar to Ms. Scott's on both her college choice and her options for studying abroad.
"The places I've been thinking about are definitely more exotic, because I want something further away that's new and different," Ms. Hancock said. She is considering New Zealand or Tanzania, where she plans to continue her studies in environmental science. "I'm already so far away, I think I can handle it just fine. It's not as scary to go a bit farther."

 The Week's Best Quotes: 
 André Mouton warns that the first quarter was business as usual for cloud companies - and that's a bad thing : "Cloud companies are growing, and they're losing money. If that's all you know about them, it's enough. Those two facts define the industry more than any hyperbole coming out of Silicon Valley. Much as their predecessors did 15 years ago, today's tech companies are selling an exciting new technology; and like the dot-coms, they've embraced a business model that will self-destruct at the first sign of trouble."
 Derek Thompson explains why work-life balance is so bad: "Although the workweek has fallen, the changing composition of families has put tremendous time stresses on more mothers. Over all, research shows that lower-income men have never had more downtime, while working single mothers have never been more common. The first part is a problem. The second is a crisis."

HEADLINE: Energy Agency Makes Case for Climate-Wise Energy Steps

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: An international energy agency charts steps countries can take now that cut greenhouse emissions with other benefits. 

 BODY:
The International Energy Agency today released a helpful report that charts four climate-wise (if fairly familiar) actions countries can pursue to make a difference in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020. There's a low bar to entry, the agency noted, saying these steps "can deliver significant emissions reductions by 2020, rely only on existing technologies and have already been adopted successfully in several countries." Here are the four core points, followed by a slide show and related links: 
- Targeted energy efficiency measures in buildings, industry and transport account for nearly half the emissions reduction in 2020, with the additional investment required being more than offset by reduced spending on fuel bills. [Here's more on the efficiency opportunities in the United States and a reality check on what's possible .]
- Limiting the construction and use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants delivers more than 20% of the emissions reduction and helps curb local air pollution. The share of power generation from renewables increases (from around 20% today to 27% in 2020), as does that from natural gas. [Background from The Times here and World Bank here .]
- Actions to halve expected methane (a potent greenhouse gas) releases into the atmosphere from the upstream oil and gas industry in 2020 provide 18% of the savings. [ One success story described on Dot Earth in 2009.]
- Implementing a partial phase-out of fossil fuel consumption subsidies accounts for 12% of the reduction in emissions and supports efficiency efforts. [Some helpful context from various vantage points is here, here and here.]
The agency chose these actions because it said they all meet these criteria: They can result in significant near-term emissions reductions, do not curb economic growth, rely only on existing technologies and proven policies and produce significant benefits beyond climate change mitigation.
Here's an informative slide presentation:

HEADLINE: What They Said: Indian Rupee Hits Record Low

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI BAGRI


HIGHLIGHT: The Indian rupee was trading at almost 58 against the U.S. dollar on Monday. 

 BODY:
The rupee fell to a new low against the dollar on Monday, hitting 58 rupees per dollar at one point. The previous low was recorded in June 2012 at 57.33 rupees for a dollar.
While the sharp fall in the rupee was caused mainly by the strength in the United States currency, experts say that India was particularly affected because of its widening current account deficit, brought about by huge imports of crude oil and gold over the past year. 
 Reena Rohit, chief manager for non-agriculture commodities and currencies at Angel Commodities Broking: Monday's opening in the domestic markets has triggered a sense of fear as the rupee plunged to a new all-time low of 57.767, depreciating over 1.2 percent within hours of opening. Extreme weakness in the rupee yet again highlights the microeconomic as well as macroeconomic concerns. 
While microeconomic concerns are bending towards the current account deficit, gold imports and a general slow economic scenario, the macroeconomic factors that are affecting the rupee is the strength in the dollar index, which is being backed by expectations that the Federal Reserve would withdraw its bond-buying program, thereby creating a favorable condition for the dollar index. This in turn would lead to weakness in the rupee. Also, U.S. Treasury yields would look more attractive, and that too could see a pullback in investor flows in the nation. High capital inflows support appreciation in the rupee and vice versa.
Given the current complex macroeconomic happenings, one could take a view on the rupee with a depreciation bias. Although it has already weakened considerably, there are expectations of a further weakening trend, and a stronger dollar index would cause majority of the weakness.
 Sajjid Z. Chinoy, economist at JP Morgan: This is not of India's making over the last four, five days. Every emerging market has blared over the last week, but it is the emerging market current account deficit countries that have suffered the most. So India is right in the middle of the pack. South Africa has been the worst sufferer. If you look at Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, this is just a global phenomenon.
Ironically, just three weeks ago before this move started, there was for the first time a semblance of macroeconomic stability in India. Wholesale price index numbers were at a three-year low, consumer price index inflation was coming off and we found out that the fiscal consolidation last year was very impressive. All of that suggested more monetary easing.
However, given the bleeding in the rupee, the R.B.I. [Reserve Bank of India] will very much stay on hold. A June rate cut is very much off the table, and if things don't stabilize, so will a July rate cut. The reasons for the rupee depreciation may not be very India-specific, but the consequences will be India-specific. This kind of move is bound to be inflationary. It is going to push up subsidies on the budget; it will affect corporate balance sheets.
 Taimur Baig, chief economist for India, Indonesia and Singapore, global markets research, Deutsche Bank: We see the fundamentals for the rupee improving substantially in the second half of the year. The move today doesn't change that outlook. The economy's outlook is weak, and the currency will remain vulnerable to periodic policy setback and global factors. But the major sources of drag to the currency in recent years - high inflation and high current account deficit - are dissipating rapidly, and will help support the currency, in our view.
 Samir Arora, fund manager at Helios Capital in Singapore: If we have the prospect of lower inflation and gold imports come off, then that's good news for the rupee. We're foreign investors in Indian markets so we watch the rupee very carefully, but we don't think the fall in the rupee has crossed investors' pain threshold yet.
 Adarsh Sinha, head of Asia-Pacific G-10 currency research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch: The problem for the rupee is that India is one of the few countries in Asia with a current account deficit, so when you see capital outflows, the rupee and Indonesian rupiah tend to be vulnerable. In an environment where markets are worried about an end to Q.E. [quantitative easing] and a rise in global bond yields, unfortunately the rupee will be vulnerable.
 Raghuram Rajan, chief economic adviser to the Indian government: India has a large current account deficit, and currencies of emerging markets with large current account deficits have depreciated more. This could be temporary phenomenon. But again let me reiterate: the government is not supportive of the weakening of the rupee, and we would like more stability.
 Arvind Mayaram, economic affairs secretary: If you see weakening of all currencies vis-à-vis dollar, the rupee is also not unaffected in that sense. But I think this panic in the market is unwarranted. I think this will settle down in a while. We should not worry, but we are watching the situation closely.
 Dipen Shah, head of private client group research at Kotak Securities: Markets were volatile today but ended the day in the negative, dragged down by concerns on the rupee. The European markets opened lower before recovering. The rupee made new lifetime lows in the morning and traded near the 58/USD levels on continuing concerns about the current account deficit and reversal in foreign institutional investor (FII) flows.
FII's have turned net sellers in equities over the past few sessions. In the last few days, the debt market has also seen outflows from FII's, which further pressurizes the rupee. The rupee movement will be the focus area in the near term at least. The government has taken steps to reduce gold imports, and after a spike in May, gold import volumes may come down, providing some support to the rupee.

HEADLINE: The $1 Million Nest Egg

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: Addressing some questions readers raised about the magic of $1 million as a retirement savings goal &#8212; an asset level out of reach for most Americans. 

 BODY:
My Strategies column on Sunday, "For Retirees, a Million-Dollar Illusion," was intended to be provocative. It evidently succeeded. 
Hundreds of people responded to the column in writing, raising far more questions than I can address individually.
I plan to answer some of the major ones in my column this coming weekend - and to cover others in the weeks ahead, along with my colleagues. For now, here are some quick thoughts on a central question, and then an answer to a specific one. 
Several people asked why the column focused on a $1 million nest egg. Why go there if most people don't have $1 million? And if $1 million retirees might exhaust their money before they die, what hope is there for everyone else?
One million dollars has symbolic power. That's why it was the column's central metaphor. It wasn't chosen to represent the savings of a typical American family. 
In fact, $1 million in financial assets is more money than 9 out of 10 American families have - and it's vastly more than the typical family possesses. That's especially true when you exclude the value of a home, which accounts for a high proportion of the wealth of people in most income brackets. 
As Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, said in the column, $10,890 is the median financial net worth of American households of all ages today, including the value of their stocks, bonds, 401(k)'s and other investments. To be absolutely clear, that figure excludes the value of a home. (With home equity included, the median net worth of an American family in 2013 is $60,678, he calculates. That estimate is based on 2010 Federal Reserve data, updated according to changes in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Case-Shiller housing index.)
Yet thanks to inflation, $1 million is no longer a great fortune. It's not the vast sum it was when John Jacob Astor was popularly described as America's first millionaire, nor does it come near the riches it represented a generation ago, when Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable portrayed women seeking rich husbands in "How to Marry a Millionaire." 
Today, there are almost 10 million millionaire households in the United States (excluding the value of a home), according to Professor Wolff's calculations. In short, $1 million is a great deal of money, yet it is not so absurdly large a sum as to be beyond the comprehension - and, perhaps, the aspirations - of many people. 
That may be why the calculations for the $1 million portfolio were so startling. 
They started with a 65-year-old couple, retiring this year and using the 4 percent withdrawal rate that is a commonly used rule-of-thumb draw-down. The calculations provided by Bernstein Global Wealth Management showed that at a 4 percent withdrawal rate, adjusted for inflation, if they had invested the $1 million entirely in municipal bonds, there is a 72 percent probability that they will exhaust all of that money before they die. 
One important factor for this disturbing outcome is the highly unusual state of the markets more than five years after the onset of a global financial crisis. Bond yields remain very low, and central bank intervention in the economy remains very high. This won't persist forever, but it has caused many investors to rethink the rules of investing and retirement.
As the column suggests, this situation underlines the important role that Social Security plays for people at nearly all levels in the national income distribution. If Social Security is important for millionaires, it is far more crucial for nearly everybody else. 
And the column notes that people at nearly all income levels are not saving enough to maintain their current living standards in retirement. Paring back spending would help in many cases, as would delaying retirement, for those able to do so. That's true for many people with big nest eggs, and it's true for many without them. 
As many readers pointed out, payouts from solidly funded, traditional pension funds make retirement much easier. One implication, not drawn specifically in the column, is that old-fashioned pension funds may have enormous value - in some cases, providing more monthly income than a $1 million portfolio. 
The column briefly discussed measures that can be taken to recalibrate portfolios, mainly adding stocks to the mix. Over the long run, stocks have added to annual portfolio returns - at the cost of higher volatility, and possible losses of capital, which may be unpalatable to many retirees. That raises some difficult choices.
Several people asked specifically about one of those choices - including dividend-paying stocks in a portfolio intended to produce steady income. I didn't discuss dividend-paying stocks at all in the column, but that was only because of space limitations. 
Dividend-paying stocks in the current environment do make sense for many investors. Why? The current dividend yield for the S.&P. 500 is 2.07 percent, according to Bloomberg. That's almost as much as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. And the advantage of holding dividend-payers is much the same as for other stocks - if history holds for the future, they may well increase in value at a faster rate than Treasuries. Furthermore, at the moment, the consensus in the bond market is that Treasuries are vulnerable to losses if the economy improves and the Federal Reserve tapers its bond-buying.
There are dangers, however, that investors, and particularly retirees, need to evaluate carefully: Dividends aren't as steady as bond yields, and the value of a stock is likely to fluctuate much more severely than that of a high-quality bond. That risk-reward trade-off can be tricky; bonds and dividend-paying stocks aren't entirely equivalent. The general rule that diversification is safer is very important here.
I'll end by noting that many people have asked for specific advice. For concrete guidance about your own finances, you'll need to talk to an adviser. I'll provide more analysis of these broad issues, however. And I do appreciate those comments and questions!

HEADLINE: Peer-to-Peer Car Sharing at the Airport

BYLINE: TAMARA WARREN


HIGHLIGHT: Car sharing, like house sharing, shows much promise. But it&#8217;s also a regulatory wild card. 

 BODY:
Most Internet sources that dedicate content to such things agree that Hertz opened its first airport car rental center at Chicago's Midway International Airport in 1932. Hertz says it was the first of its kind anywhere. But regardless of who started it, airport car rentals changed the way people traveled.
More than 80 years later, a new peer-to-peer car sharing company is trying to change the airport commute at two airports in the United States, introducing a departure from the way airport car rental has usually been done. FlightCar wants travelers to rent out their personal vehicles to vacationers, wooing the cars' owners with free airport parking while they're away and attracting renters with lower prices.
FlightCar is a sort of agent for car sharing. Unlike traditional rental companies, there is no fleet to maintain. Users who rent out their vehicles receive compensation, free parking and a free car wash. If the car is not rented, the parking is still free, and so is the car wash. According to FlightCar's Wes site, long-term parking at San Francisco's airport can be as much as $18 a day. Car owners who participate in the program get free parking, plus $10 for each day the car is rented. 
FlightCar is the latest company to tackle car sharing in a growing marketplace that includes RelayRides, Getaround, Lyft and Sidecar. It first offered service at San Francisco International Airport in February, then expanded to Boston Logan International Airport in May. FlightCar has plans to open at Los Angeles International Airport this summer.
"We are now seeing greater diversification in the shared-use mobility arena; FlightCar is part of this expansion," said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, in an e-mail. "Traditionally, car sharing had been a round-trip shared-use model supplied by a third-party operator. Recently, we have seen more peer-to-peer shared use mobility models. These services are facilitated by a third party, which helps to manage and facilitate between individuals sharing privately owned vehicles."
The company was founded by Kevin Petrovic, who lives in San Francisco, and Rujul Zaparde and Shri Ganeshram who are based in Boston. They said Airbnb was their inspiration.
Mr. Zaparde and Mr. Ganesham are both 18 years old and Mr. Petrovic is 19. They said they received $5.5 million in financing from investors, including the founders of Airbnb and Reddit, Ryan Seacrest and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
"It just makes more sense; it's more green, and the way the trends are going we believe this is the future," said Mr. Zaparde. "We give you free parking guaranteed. We're closer to the airport than long-term parking in San Francisco. You pull in and have someone assisting you. We take photos of the car in front of you."
The company by the end of May had conducted over 1,000 rentals and had 750 cars listed in the San Francisco market, said Mr. Zaparde. The top three rentals in San Francisco were the Toyota Prius, the BMW 3 Series and the Honda Civic.
On the site, a 2006 Honda Accord is listed for $31 per day. A recent search found a black 1999 AM General Hummer in June in San Francisco. A 2010 Kia Forte was listed for $21 per day in Boston by an owner identified as Sara.
Vehicles must be 1999 or newer models to be eligible for rental. A rate of 35 cents per mile is charged after running over the 90-mile daily limit, which the owner receives. There is a $1,000 fine for smoking in the vehicle.
The company, however, has already been sued by the city of San Francisco over the curbside drop-off that FlightCar provides for car owners through a third-party limousine service. In the complaint filed last week, the city argues that FlightCar has broken rules that require rental car companies to use the AirTrain to transport passengers to the terminal and the company dodged airport fees charged to rental car agencies for doing business at the airport.
FlightCar is also being criticized by the insurance industry because of the potential for personal liability cases. Ms. Shaheen said that the policy FlightCar offers was similar to the one offered by RelayRides, which includes a $1 million liability insurance policy for owners and a $300,000 policy for renters.
"The problem remains that once the car is used as a business it's not considered a typical auto policy; it's now considered to be a commercial policy," said Loretta Worters, vice president of the Insurance Information Institute. "Part of the reason is that premiums are based on information from the original policy. Who is going to be at fault? Who has the culpability if there's a dispute about when the accident occurred? It opens car owners up to a lot of problems. People need to really speak to their insurance agents to understand the scope of their coverage."
According to an academic paper Ms. Shaheen co-authored, three states - California, Oregon and Washington - have voted on legislation to prohibit insurance companies from making changes to consumer's policies because of car sharing. Rachael Risinger, a State Farm spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that car sharing does not affect rates or impact customers' ability to qualify for a State Farm insurance policy, but, on the other hand, the company will also not cover damage incurred during a car sharing rental.
"Rates are impacted by claims experience, car sharing or not," Ms. Risinger wrote. "While the car sharing laws may vary from state to state, our coverage remains the same. There is no coverage for an insured for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a vehicle while it is rented to or leased to others by an insured. There is no coverage for an insured for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a vehicle while it is being used to carry persons for a charge. This exclusion does not apply to the use of a private passenger car on a share-the-expense basis."
Mr. Zaparde said he did not foresee liability issues causing problems for the company and its consumers. FlightCar screens renters to make sure. According to FlightCar's Web site, "For all renters and additional drivers, we do a driving history check that shows us any past driving citations and moving violations. We also verify renter's identities and may also do a criminal background check." Flight car requires drivers to be at least 18 years old - 25 or older if they're renting a car worth more than $40,000 - and they can't have any major violations, drug and alcohol-related charges or numerous accidents on their records.
"That's something we'd handle case by case. Most of the time $1 million is pretty sufficient," Mr. Zaparde said, referring to liability coverage. "We know there are going to be regulatory issues because it's a new industry, and the government has to figure out new ways to regulate it."
Some industry experts see the insurance limits as sufficient. Guy Fraker has worked in the insurance industry and served as an adviser to car sharing companies, including RelayRides, regarding risk mitigation. His company, Get2Kno, focuses on transparency in peer-to-peer companies.
"I don't get too worried about the limits, because that's a risk we take every single day when we get in the car, and every time we get in a taxi or a limo," said Mr. Fraker. "I don't know a car share company out there, including FlightCar, whose membership requirements wouldn't hold up to any of the top five insurance companies."
As the sharing industry continues to spread, the complexity of the business models remains to be defined in the automotive market. FlightCar estimates it will take 12 years for the company to become profitable.
"There are 1.2 cars for every person in America," said Mr. Zaparde. "What FlightCar is doing is a halfway step to going fully into peer-to-peer sharing. Hopefully down the road they'll be more to sharing of other objects. It opens the door to the sharing economy."

HEADLINE: Booz Allen Reaps Big Benefits From U.S.

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Booz Allen Hamilton, the government contractor whose employee acknowledged leaking national security documents, is in a way illustrative of Washington&#8217;s economic boom in recent years. 

 BODY:
Lining the roadways out to Dulles Airport in Virginia, filling the many boxy office buildings near the Pentagon, and adding to the sprawl heading north from the city far into the Maryland suburbs are countless private companies reliant on taxpayer-financed government contracts that have helped transform Washington into one of the richest areas in the country.
But few are as successful as Booz Allen Hamilton, the government contractor whose employee, Edward J. Snowden, has acknowledged leaking national security documents revealing details of the government's extensive surveillance programs. 
Businesses in Washington, Virginia and Maryland have become increasingly dependent on government money over the years, and as of 2011 federal spending accounted for 39 percent of the region's economic output, according to a report from Stephen S. Fuller, the director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. The biggest beneficiaries include the armies of contract workers for the government's sprawling national security empire.
Of the 10 biggest local employers in the region (besides the federal government) last year, four were major military, aerospace and cybersecurity contractors (the Science Applications International Corporation, Northrop Grumman, Booz Allen and Lockheed Martin), according to an annual list compiled by The Washington Post. 
Others in the top 10, like the University of Maryland at College Park, receive taxpayer money for a variety of federal projects, and even those that do not are still benefiting from the increasing spending power of local residents employed through government money. The same goes for the smaller employers, like restaurants, gyms, shops, and dry cleaners that serve the growing professional-class work force in the area.
The contractors also tend to earn much more than their public payroll counterparts, which helps drive up local household incomes. Today, of the 50 most populous metropolitan areas in the country, the Washington area has one of the highest concentrations of high-income households. The Washington area also dominates the list of counties with the highest median household incomes.
National security contractors are not the only local residents getting rich as a result of government policy: in recent years, the stimulus package and other new laws and regulations (like the Affordable Care Act) and proposed laws (like tax reform) have sustained and improved the careers of lobbyists, lawyers and consultants.
Government-related money is one reason the Washington economy was relatively insulated from the recession and its difficult aftermath. In both 2011 and 2012, in a ranking of the top 50 metropolitan areas, residents of the Washington area expressed the most confidence in the American economy, according to Gallup.
That optimism probably reflects these residents' own job situations. The unemployment rate in the Washington metro area encompassing Northern Virginia and parts of Maryland and West Virginia was just 5 percent in April (not seasonally adjusted), the most recent month for which data are available. Even at its recent business cycle peak, in early 2010, it was just 7 percent. By comparison, the country's jobless rate peaked at a seasonally adjusted rate of 10 percent, and is now 7.6 percent.
Of course, there is concern that the metropolitan area's glory days are over, as Congress cut $85 billion from military and domestic programs on March 1 for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The Center for Regional Analysis estimates that the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland will collectively lose 330,819 jobs as a result of the so-called sequestration, accounting for about 21 percent of total job cuts nationwide.
Booz Allen - which earned $1.3 billion, or 23 percent of its total revenue, in the last fiscal year from intelligence work - might be particularly worried about the federal spigot's being tightened after this new security breach. Not surprisingly, Booz Allen's stock price fell 2.56 percent on Monday.
In its recent annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in May, the company said that the main risks to its business include changes to "U.S. government spending and mission priorities" (like the sequester) and "mishandling or the perception of mishandling of sensitive information, such as our failure to maintain the confidentiality of the existence of our business relationships with certain of our clients or a failure to maintain adequate protection against security breaches," which "could harm our relationship with U.S. government agencies."
The company also said that it had already reduced the number of its employees in the previous fiscal year by about 500 people, bringing the total head count to 24,455 people, "due to modestly lower demand in an uncertain federal budget environment."

HEADLINE: Kennedy's Finest Moment

BYLINE: By PENIEL E. JOSEPH. 
Peniel E. Joseph, the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy and a professor of history at Tufts University, is the author, most recently, of ''Dark Days, Bright Nights: From Black Power to Barack Obama.''

 BODY:
MEDFORD, Mass. -- JUNE 11, 1963, may not be a widely recognized date these days, but it might have been the single most important day in civil rights history.
That morning, Gov. George Wallace, in an effort to block the integration of the University of Alabama, made his futile ''stand at the schoolhouse door.'' That evening, Boston N.A.A.C.P. leaders engaged in their first public confrontation with Louise Day Hicks, the chairwoman of the Boston School Committee, over de facto public school segregation, beginning a decade-long struggle that would boil over into spectacular violence during the early 1970s. And just after midnight in Jackson, Miss., a white segregationist murdered the civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
But the most important event was one that almost didn't happen: a hastily arranged speech that evening by President John F. Kennedy. 
Kennedy had dabbled with the idea of going on TV should the Alabama crisis drag out, so when it ended, his staff assumed the plan was off. But that afternoon he surprised them by calling the three networks and personally requesting airtime at 8 p.m. He told his speechwriter Theodore Sorensen to start drafting the text, but shortly before he went on air the president was still editing it.
The president had been routinely criticized by black leaders for being timid on civil rights, and no one knew just what to expect when the cameras started filming.
Kennedy began slowly and in a matter-of-fact manner, with an announcement that the National Guard had peacefully enrolled two black students at the University of Alabama over Wallace's vociferously racist objections.
But he quickly spun that news into a plea for national unity behind what he, for the first time, called a ''moral issue.'' It seems obvious today that civil rights should be spoken of in universal terms, but at the time many white Americans still saw it as a regional, largely political question. And yet here was the leader of the country, asking ''every American, regardless of where he lives,'' to ''stop and examine his conscience.''
Then he went further. Speaking during the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation -- an anniversary he had assiduously avoided commemorating, earlier that year -- Kennedy eloquently linked the fate of African-American citizenship to the larger question of national identity and freedom. America, ''for all its hopes and all its boasts,'' observed Kennedy, ''will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.''
Perhaps the most significant part of the speech came near the end, when Kennedy, borrowing directly from the movement's rhetoric, recognized the civil rights struggle as part of a political and cultural revolution sweeping the land -- again, an obvious point to anyone on the other side of the 1960s, but not to a white population still living in the stifling bliss of the Eisenhower era.
Kennedy not only reported the revolution, but invited Americans of all backgrounds to engage in the kind of civic activism that reflects the tough work of democracy. ''A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all.''
Nor was this just stirring rhetoric: Kennedy's announcement that he would introduce comprehensive civil rights legislation and spur school desegregation beyond its frustratingly glacial pace gave teeth to his historic address.
Kennedy's speech was almost immediately overshadowed by Evers's murder. Two months later the March on Washington would further render it a forgotten artifact of the civil rights movement's heroic period.
Still, the speech had real consequences. A little over a week later, Kennedy followed through on his promise to submit strong civil rights legislation to Congress, which he pushed aggressively until his assassination in November 1963.
Kennedy's death made him a martyr for many causes, and in a cruel twist, it provided a huge boost to the civil rights bill, which his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, signed on July 2, 1964. But without the moral forcefulness of the June 11 speech, the bill might never have gone anywhere.
The speech also set the tone for how presidents should address civil rights. No longer could they dance around the issue, qualifying it as a strictly regional or legal or economic issue (though many would later try to do so). The power of the White House, and of the federal government, was on the side of the struggle.
And it continues to resonate today. Barack Obama's March 2008 ''race speech,'' delivered amid the Jeremiah Wright controversy, has been rightfully applauded for its nuanced depiction of contemporary American race relations. And yet it must be read within the context of Kennedy's address: both reflected and defined the tenor of race relations at a moment of great tension and change.
Kennedy's words anticipated some of the key themes found in King's soaring March on Washington address two months later. And that shared moral force, that commonality of thinking between the two speeches, is the most important reason to remember the president's address, 50 years ago today: it reminds us of a forgotten moment of the civil rights era, when presidential leadership and grass-roots activism worked in creative tension to turn the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal.

HEADLINE: Libya Doesn't Need More Militias

BYLINE: By FREDERIC WEHREY. 
Frederic Wehrey, a former United States military attaché in Libya, is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

 BODY:
TWO years after the Libyan revolution, the police and army remain weak and hollow. Neglected by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in favor of more loyal units commanded by his sons, they are ill-equipped, understaffed, bloated at the senior ranks and tainted by their association with the old regime. Into their place have stepped the country's 300 revolutionary militias -- the groups that fought in the 2011 revolution that overthrew Colonel Qaddafi or arose in its aftermath.
On Saturday, throngs of protesters in Benghazi stormed the headquarters of a government-sponsored militia, Libya Shield, whose members opened fire, killing at least 27 people. Weary of Libya Shield's overbearing presence, the crowds had demanded that the regular army and police take its place. It was a disheartening reminder of the Faustian bargain that Libya's anemic and fractured government has made with the militias. 
Libya Shield is part of a constellation of Islamist-oriented militias that arose in Benghazi during the revolution. Some of these armed groups have fallen under the authority of the government while others, like Ansar al-Sharia, have not. (These groups decry the term ''militia,'' given its connotation of illegitimacy and lawlessness).
Bereft of the means to project authority and provide security, Libya's transitional government tried to co-opt the militias in late 2011 and bring them under the control of the Army chief of staff and the Interior Ministry. And so Libya Shield and the Supreme Security Committees were born.
Across the country the Committees and Libya Shield have played the roles of de facto police department and army: they arrest drug traffickers, patrol the western and southern borders, and try to quell tribal fighting in the country's provinces. Increasingly though, they have become a law unto themselves, pursuing agendas that are regional, tribal, Islamist and sometimes criminal.
When I met last month in Benghazi with one Libya Shield commander, Wissam bin Hamid, he evinced a quiet contempt for the central government and the regular army as Qaddafi-era holdouts. An Islamist engineering graduate and war hero in his mid-30s, he surrounds himself with a coterie of wiry militiamen.
Despite his subordination to the chief of staff, Mr. Bin Hamid was clearly reluctant to surrender his newfound autonomy. He criticized recent efforts by the Libyan special forces to move in on his turf. And last month, militias allied with Mr. Bin Hamid besieged the parliament and a number of ministries demanding the passage of a law that would bar Qaddafi-era officials from further government service. Next, they demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.
Now the increasingly isolated Mr. Zeidan has approached the United States about training a general-purpose military force, consisting entirely of fresh ''nonmilitia'' recruits. On the surface, the proposal is attractive -- beef up a ''real'' army to confront extremists and persuade the militias to disarm and integrate. But it is highly risky and could throw the country deeper into strife.
First, it is unclear if parliament and other parts of the Libyan government back the plan. Moreover, without sufficient oversight, the new force could become another militia among militias, a palace guard for an already-despised politician who will become increasingly loathed, especially by Islamists, for his visible association with America.
Building such a force from scratch takes time. Colonel Qaddafi's systematic neglect of the army left a military devoid of qualified and trained lieutenants and captains, who form the backbone of any fighting force. Creating a reliable national army would take at least six or seven years. And if it runs into trouble with battle-hardened militias -- which is likely -- will America be obliged to assist?
Most crucially, the plan fails to address the roots of the crisis: uneven provincial development, unemployment, a lack of transparency in the government, and tensions between Libyan elites who accommodated the Qaddafi regime and those who were persecuted by it. These are problems that cannot be confronted head-on with another armed force.
What is needed instead is a new social contract that reconciles Libya's factions and produces a government with real legitimacy. Last year's parliamentary elections were an important first step on that journey. A plan under consideration by parliament to integrate the militias into a national guard-type force, until the regular army is bolstered, is also wise. Although not without flaws, this idea offers the best hope for coaxing the militias back under the umbrella of the state.
Libya would then need a constitution that clarifies lines of command for the military and decentralizes power to municipal governments. For many militias, especially Islamist ones in Benghazi, the constitution is a prerequisite for any disarmament and integration.
Following the United States model, militia leaders told me last month that Libyan army officers should pledge to defend the constitution, not the head of state. That is a noble goal. Rushing to create a new Praetorian Guard with unclear lines of authority and minimal popular support is not the answer.

 BODY:
BIG DATAA Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think
By Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and Kenneth Cukier242 pages. Eamon Dolan/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $27.
Google does it. Amazon does it. Walmart does it. And, as news reports last week made clear, the United States government does it.
Does what? Uses ''big data'' analysis of the swelling flood of data that is being generated and stored about virtually every aspect of our lives to identify patterns of behavior and make correlations and predictive assessments.
Amazon uses customer data to give us recommendations based on our previous purchases. Google uses our search data and other information it collects to sell ads and to fuel a host of other services and products. 
The National Security Agency, a news article in The Guardian revealed last week, is collecting the phone records of millions of American customers of Verizon -- ''indiscriminately and in bulk'' and ''regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing'' -- under a secret court order. Under another surveillance program called Prism, The Guardian and The Washington Post reported, the agency has been collecting data from e-mails, audio and video chats, photos, documents and logins, from leading Internet companies like Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Apple, to track foreign targets.
Why spread such a huge net in search of a handful of terrorist suspects? Why vacuum up data so indiscriminately? ''If you're looking for a needle in the haystack, you need a haystack,'' Jeremy Bash, chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and defense secretary, said on Friday.
In ''Big Data,'' their illuminating and very timely book, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, a professor of Internet governance and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute at Oxford University, and Kenneth Cukier, the data editor for The Economist, argue that the nature of surveillance has changed.
''In the spirit of Google or Facebook,'' they write, ''the new thinking is that people are the sum of their social relationships, online interactions and connections with content. In order to fully investigate an individual, analysts need to look at the widest possible penumbra of data that surrounds the person -- not just whom they know, but whom those people know too, and so on.''
Mr. Cukier and Mr. Mayer-Schönberger argue that big data analytics are revolutionizing the way we see and process the world -- they even compare its consequences to those of the Gutenberg printing press. And in this volume they give readers a fascinating -- and sometimes alarming -- survey of big data's growing effect on just about everything: business, government, science and medicine, privacy and even on the way we think. Notions of causality, they say, will increasingly give way to correlation as we try to make sense of patterns.
Data is growing incredibly fast -- by one account, it is more than doubling every two years -- and the authors of this book argue that as storage costs plummet and algorithms improve, data-crunching techniques, once available only to spy agencies, research labs and gigantic companies, are becoming increasingly democratized.
Big data has given birth to an array of new companies and has helped existing companies boost customer service and find new synergies. Before a hurricane, Walmart learned, sales of Pop-Tarts increased, along with sales of flashlights, and so stores began stocking boxes of Pop-Tarts next to the hurricane supplies ''to make life easier for customers'' while boosting sales. UPS, the authors report, has fitted its trucks with sensors and GPS so that it can monitor employees, optimize route itineraries and know when to perform preventive vehicle maintenance.
Baseball teams like Billy Beane's Oakland A's (immortalized in Michael Lewis's best-seller ''Moneyball'') have embraced new number-crunching approaches to scouting players with remarkable success. The 2012 Obama campaign used sophisticated data analysis to build a formidable political machine for identifying supporters and getting out the vote. And New York City has used data analytics to find new efficiencies in everything from disaster response, to identifying stores selling bootleg cigarettes, to steering overburdened housing inspectors directly to buildings most in need of their attention. In the years to come, Mr. Mayer-Schönberger and Mr. Cukier contend, big data will increasingly become ''part of the solution to pressing global problems like addressing climate change, eradicating disease and fostering good governance and economic development.''
There is, of course, a dark side to big data, and the authors provide an astute analysis of the dangers they foresee. Privacy has become much more difficult to protect, especially with old strategies -- ''individual notice and consent, opting out and anonymization'' -- losing effectiveness or becoming completely beside the point.
''The ability to capture personal data is often built deep into the tools we use every day, from Web sites to smartphone apps,'' the authors write. And given the myriad ways data can be reused, repurposed and sold to other companies, it's often impossible for users to give informed consent to ''innovative secondary uses'' that haven't even been imagined when the data was first collected.
The second danger Mr. Cukier and Mr. Mayer-Schönberger worry about sounds like a scenario from the sci-fi movie ''Minority Report,'' in which predictions seem so accurate that people can be arrested for crimes before they are committed. In the real near future, the authors suggest, big data analysis (instead of the clairvoyant Pre-Cogs in that movie) may bring about a situation ''in which judgments of culpability are based on individualized predictions of future behavior.''
Already, insurance companies and parole boards use predictive analytics to help tabulate risk, and a growing number of places in the United States, the authors of ''Big Data'' say, employ ''predictive policing,'' crunching data ''to select what streets, groups and individuals to subject to extra scrutiny, simply because an algorithm pointed to them as more likely to commit crime.''
Last week an NBC report noted that in so-called signature drone strikes ''the C.I.A. doesn't necessarily know who it is killing'': in signature strikes ''intelligence officers and drone operators kill suspects based on their patterns of behavior -- but without positive identification.''
One problem with relying on predictions based on probabilities of behavior, Mr. Mayer-Schönberger and Mr. Cukier argue, is that it can negate ''the very idea of the presumption of innocence.''
''If we hold people responsible for predicted future acts, ones they may never commit,'' they write, ''we also deny that humans have a capacity for moral choice.''
At the same time, they observe, big data exacerbates ''a very old problem: relying on the numbers when they are far more fallible than we think.'' They point to escalation of the Vietnam War under Robert S. McNamara (who served as secretary of defense to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson) as a case study in ''data analysis gone awry'': a fierce advocate of statistical analysis, McNamara relied on metrics like the body count to measure the progress of the war, even though it became clear that Vietnam was more a war of wills than of territory or numbers.
More recent failures of data analysis include the Wall Street crash of 2008, which was accelerated by hugely complicated trading schemes based upon mathematical algorithms. In his best-selling 2012 book, ''The Signal and the Noise,'' the statistician Nate Silver, who writes the FiveThirtyEight blog for The New York Times, pointed to failures in areas like earthquake science, finance and biomedical research, arguing that ''prediction in the era of Big Data'' has not been ''going very well'' (despite his own successful forecasts in the fields of politics and baseball).
Also, as the computer scientist and musician Jaron Lanier points out in his brilliant new book, ''Who Owns the Future?,'' there is a huge difference between ''scientific big data, like data about galaxy formation, weather or flu outbreaks,'' which with lots of hard work can be gathered and mined, and ''big data about people,'' which, like all things human, remains protean, contradictory and often unreliable.
To their credit, Mr. Cukier and Mr. Mayer-Schönberger recognize the limitations of numbers. Though their book leaves the reader with a keen appreciation of the tools that big data can provide in helping us ''quantify and understand the world,'' it also warns us about falling prey to the ''dictatorship of data.''
''We must guard against overreliance on data,'' they write, ''rather than repeat the error of Icarus, who adored his technical power of flight but used it improperly and tumbled into the sea.''

HEADLINE: Booz Allen Reaps Big Benefits From U.S.

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Lining the roadways out to Dulles Airport in Virginia, filling the many boxy office buildings near the Pentagon, and adding to the sprawl heading north from the city far into the Maryland suburbs are countless private companies reliant on taxpayer-financed government contracts that have helped transform Washington into one of the richest areas in the country.
But few are as successful as Booz Allen Hamilton, the government contractor whose employee, Edward J. Snowden, has acknowledged leaking national security documents revealing details of the government's extensive surveillance programs. 
Businesses in Washington, Virginia and Maryland have become increasingly dependent on government money over the years, and as of 2011 federal spending accounted for 39 percent of the region's economic output, according to a report from Stephen S. Fuller, the director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. The biggest beneficiaries include the armies of contract workers for the government's sprawling national security empire.
Of the 10 biggest local employers in the region (besides the federal government) last year, four were major military, aerospace and cybersecurity contractors (the Science Applications International Corporation, Northrop Grumman, Booz Allen and Lockheed Martin), according to an annual list compiled by The Washington Post.
Others in the top 10, like the University of Maryland at College Park, receive taxpayer money for a variety of federal projects, and even those that do not are still benefiting from the increasing spending power of local residents employed through government money. The same goes for the smaller employers, like restaurants, gyms, shops, and dry cleaners that serve the growing professional-class work force in the area.
The contractors also tend to earn much more than their public payroll counterparts, which helps drive up local household incomes. Today, of the 50 most populous metropolitan areas in the country, the Washington area has one of the highest concentrations of high-income households. The Washington area also dominates the list of counties with the highest median household incomes.
National security contractors are not the only local residents getting rich as a result of government policy: in recent years, the stimulus package and other new laws and regulations (like the Affordable Care Act) and proposed laws (like tax reform) have sustained and improved the careers of lobbyists, lawyers and consultants.
Government-related money is one reason the Washington economy was relatively insulated from the recession and its difficult aftermath. In both 2011 and 2012, in a ranking of the top 50 metropolitan areas, residents of the Washington area expressed the most confidence in the American economy, according to Gallup.
That optimism probably reflects these residents' own job situations. The unemployment rate in the Washington metro area encompassing Northern Virginia and parts of Maryland and West Virginia was just 5 percent in April (not seasonally adjusted), the most recent month for which data are available. Even at its recent business cycle peak, in early 2010, it was just 7 percent. By comparison, the country's jobless rate peaked at a seasonally adjusted rate of 10 percent, and is now 7.6 percent.
Of course, there is concern that the metropolitan area's glory days are over, as Congress cut $85 billion from military and domestic programs on March 1 for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The Center for Regional Analysis estimates that the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland will collectively lose 330,819 jobs as a result of the so-called sequestration, accounting for about 21 percent of total job cuts nationwide.
Booz Allen -- which earned $1.3 billion, or 23 percent of its total revenue, in the last fiscal year from intelligence work -- might be particularly worried about the federal spigot's being tightened after this new security breach. Not surprisingly, Booz Allen's stock price fell 2.56 percent on Monday.
In its recent annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in May, the company said that the main risks to its business include changes to ''U.S. government spending and mission priorities'' (like the sequester) and ''mishandling or the perception of mishandling of sensitive information, such as our failure to maintain the confidentiality of the existence of our business relationships with certain of our clients or a failure to maintain adequate protection against security breaches,'' which ''could harm our relationship with U.S. government agencies.''
The company also said that it had already reduced the number of its employees in the previous fiscal year by about 500 people, bringing the total head count to 24,455 people, ''due to modestly lower demand in an uncertain federal budget environment.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Standard & Poor's Raises Its Outlook on U.S. Credit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's ratings services upgraded its outlook for long-term debt of the United States on Monday, citing the government's strengthened finances, the recovering national economy and some easing of Washington's political gridlock. 
The credit ratings service changed its outlook to stable from negative, which means it is less likely to downgrade United States debt in the near future.
S.& P. also reaffirmed the government's AA+ long-term and A-1+ short-term unsolicited sovereign credit ratings. The long-term rating remains a notch below the ratings agency's top grade.
The agency had downgraded the government's long-term credit rating in 2011 after a standoff in Congress over raising America's borrowing limit.
Stan Collender, a budget expert with the consulting firm Qorvis Communications, played down the significance of S.& P.'s move, noting that its downgrade two years ago had no lasting effect on interest rates in the United States, the stock market or the value of the dollar. Long-term interest rates remain historically low -- evidence that global investors remain confident in the government's creditworthiness.
The agency said its decision to increase its outlook for reflected ''the strengths of the U.S. economy,'' including the Federal Reserve's willingness to support growth by keeping short-term rates near zero and buying bonds to keep long-term borrowing rates down.
After criticizing Washington politicians in 2011 for failing to reach a compromise to cut the federal deficit, the agency noted on Monday that Congress had agreed to raise some taxes this year, notably by restoring the full Social Security tax that most workers pay. The payroll tax had been cut two percentage points during the worst of the financial downturn.
Those tax changes, along with automatic spending cuts that kicked in March 1 and higher payments to the federal Treasury from the mortgage guarantors Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, have reduced the government's budget deficit. The deficit is the gap between the revenue the government collects and the money it spends on everything from Medicare to the military.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that the deficit, which topped $1 trillion in each of the last four years, would drop this year to about $642 billion.
The ratings agency said it expected Congress to increase the debt limit around the time the current fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Raising the debt limit would let the government continue to borrow to pay its bills.

HEADLINE: Obama Names Longtime Aide as His Chief Economic Adviser

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Council of Economic Advisers will have a prominent voice in White House discussions after President Obama named his longtime adviser Jason Furman as chairman of the panel on Monday. 
Mr. Furman, 42, who had a large role in developing the government's response to the economic crisis, ''is one of the most brilliant economic minds of his generation,'' Mr. Obama said in making the nomination official before an audience of friends and family members at the White House. The president urged the Senate to quickly confirm Mr. Furman, who has won respect from both parties despite the divisiveness of the fiscal fights of recent years.
During Mr. Obama's presidency, Mr. Furman has moved up at the White House National Economic Council, becoming principal deputy to the director, Gene B. Sperling. The departure of the current chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Alan B. Krueger, who decided to return to Princeton, created an opening for Mr. Furman, who has been long considered a candidate for a higher post.
The three-member council provides research and advice to the White House on economic policy, but some leaders of the council have been more influential and more prominent than others over the years. Mr. Obama's first leader of the council, Christina D. Romer, was a central player during the recession. Mr. Krueger has been a frequent presence in the West Wing, given his expertise in labor markets at a time of high unemployment.
Officials say that Mr. Furman, having had more personal engagement with Mr. Obama than other advisers, is expected to maintain closer ties to the president than some of his predecessors did. Mr. Furman was the economic policy director in Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign.
Mr. Furman has three degrees from Harvard, including a doctorate in economics, and a master's degree from the London School of Economics. He has ties to two council chairmen in earlier administrations. N. Gregory Mankiw, who worked for President George W. Bush, advised Mr. Furman on his doctoral thesis. Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman under President Bill Clinton, hired Mr. Furman as an aide. Mr. Furman also served on the National Economic Council in the Clinton administration.
''There's no one I'd rather turn to for straightforward, unvarnished advice that helps me to do my job,'' Mr. Obama said, citing Mr. Furman's advice to him on tax cuts for middle-income families and small businesses' hiring. ''He understands all sides of an argument.''
While Mr. Furman is widely seen as a left-of-center economist, at times he has disappointed liberals with his pragmatic support for compromises that can pass Congress. On Monday, groups across the political spectrum expressed support.

HEADLINE: Delivering Water From Disaster

BYLINE: By CHARLES J. VOROSMARTY and CLAUDIA PAHL-WOSTL

 BODY:
If one incident best highlights the perilous state of the world's fresh waters, it's the ''pig spill'' in China last March. After the slaughter and illegal dumping of a diseased herd, the authorities in Shanghai went fishing for 16,000 bloated carcasses in the Huangpu River, which flows through the city. Hardly the thing you wish to hear about if you use the Huangpu for drinking water.
On the other side of the world, Greg Lyons tends a stretch of the Merrimack River in Massachusetts as a citizen volunteer. One by one, Lyons collects some of the 8 million plastic treatment disks released by a wastewater plant that malfunctioned in March 2011. The disks, two-inch wafers caked with sewage, today serve as a reminder of how massive public waterworks designed to protect the environment can sometimes go haywire. Lyons's catch by October 2011: 16,000 disks. The situation would have shocked 19th-century Transcendentalists who used the Merrimack to inspire a modern philosophy of humans in kinship with nature. 
And then there is the Ganges, arguably the most polluted large river in the world. Each year it carries 16,000 tons of ash from cremated bodies along with a cocktail of sewage and toxic chemicals produced by a dense population and rapidly developing economy. This is no way to treat the goddess Ganga.
A panorama of our conflicted relationship with water is unfolding not only with the sensational fishing expedition for pigs or sewage disks, but with the countless decades of neglect and millions of misguided decisions we make daily regarding this essential resource. This was a chief finding of 350 water experts who recently issued the Bonn Declaration on Global Water Security.
And yet waterborne threats remain under the radar. Exposure to unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation results in 3.4 million deaths, mostly poor children, each year from diarrhea, yet this fact never makes the news. Threats also are rising in rich countries like Australia. In January, after drenching rains, residents of Brisbane were asked to restrict water use after the city's drinking water dwindled to just a six-hour supply. This occurred after the city's main treatment plant became clogged with sediment washing down from poorly managed land upstream. Across the United States, despite advanced pollution controls, more than 200 million people live within 10 miles of degraded fresh water. Europe is a global hotspot of aquatic biodiversity loss.
It is ironic that many of today's water problems arise from the very solutions we administer. Proliferation of costly, so-called hard-path engineering, like centralized sewers and large dams, provide undeniable benefits, such as improved hygiene and stable water supply. But they also degrade waters with pollution, obliterate natural flow cycles and block the migration routes of fish and other aquatic life. By throwing concrete, pipes, pumps and chemicals at our water problems, to the tune of a half trillion dollars a year worldwide, we've hung a huge technological curtain between the clean water flowing through our faucets and the background array of problems in our rivers, lakes and groundwater. It is no surprise that the public is largely unaware of this or its growing costs.
And virtually unknown to most is the collateral damage to freshwater biodiversity arising from mismanaged watersheds and waterways. Despite overuse and contamination, freshwater ecosystems host a trove of diverse life, almost 10 percent of all known species and one-third of all vertebrates. The 20,000 aquatic species now extinct or imperiled are sending us an important message about our stewardship of fresh water.
Although water has figured prominently in the U.N. development agenda for decades, the world is at a critical juncture as the Rio+20 Sustainable Development Goals take shape over the coming 12 months. In the wings looms a hastily designed and politically motivated post-2015 development agenda. The developing world argues for autonomy in pursuing whatever water-related goals it deems necessary for growth, with a more or less singular focus on the basics of clean drinking water and sanitation. In contrast, the developed world argues for all nations to adopt a broader perspective emphasizing environmental protection, yet is retreating from financial support for the poor to help realize this outcome.
These two perspectives can be reconciled. While it is imperative that we meet the water and sanitation needs of all people, it would be wildly counterproductive if success were achieved at the expense of nature. In a financially strapped world, it is hard to imagine how preservation and sensible use of the rivers, lakes and wetlands would not be a valued component of any long-term development plan. And with the specter of climate change, the very water systems we today abuse, if better managed, could climate-proof society, for example by employing wetlands as natural shock absorbers against floods.
The price tag and environmental damage of poor stewardship and hard-path water management strategies mean that we need to design solutions that deliver basic water services while preserving freshwater ecosystems for future generations.
We are not against sensible deployment of water engineering. But by exporting to poor countries identical versions of the developed world's model for water management, we risk locking the development agenda into a vicious cycle of capital-hungry and energy-intensive solutions, resource degradation and overuse, and an expanding reliance on costly remediation. We advocate instead a do-no-harm strategy in lieu of emergency care and endless rehabilitation of damaged water systems.
If we fail, we will still have development -- but not the sustainable kind.

HEADLINE: E.U. Refuses to Cooperate on Security

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Next week, President Barack Obama will make his first official call on Chancellor Angela Merkel since 2009. During those four years, Mr. Obama has had to grapple with an economic downturn, the Arab Spring and winding down U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.
And, of course, the euro zone crisis. It has been a source of disagreement between the White House and Berlin. Ms. Merkel's critics in the United States believe her policy of insisting on austerity measures has jeopardized growth. No doubt all of these issues will be discussed when both leaders meet on June 18 and 19. 
But if there is one topic that top U.S. officials have shied away from asking European leaders, it is how Washington's pivot toward Asia will affect the Union's security and defense policy. As leader of Europe's biggest and most successful economy, Ms. Merkel has remained silent on the issue.
The reason is that Germany and most other E.U. countries still do not think and act strategically when it comes to strengthening Europe's foreign and security policy. And if they cannot even do that, how can they react to Washington's changing strategic priorities?
''Apart from a very few countries, such as France and Britain, the Europeans have been very complacent about strategic affairs,'' said Rem Korteweg, defense expert at the Center for European Reform, a research organization in London. ''It's as if the world outside does not affect them.''
This is confirmed by a new study from the European Council on Foreign Relations that analyzed the national security strategies of the 27 member states. Olivier de France, one of the authors, said the strategies showed that there was no common purpose or common strategic culture that could give Europe's foreign, security and defense policy substance. ''There is no shared ambition about Europe as a global player or about the allocation of defense resources,'' Mr. de France said.
Many of the national strategies reveal parochial attitudes toward security. This is despite the fact that Europe's southern neighborhood has fundamentally changed since the Arab Spring, China is a major economic power, and the United States believes it's time Europe took responsibility for its own security.
But why is it that 20 years after the European Union first established the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the member states still think almost exclusively in national terms?
Some experts say that governments are loath to cede more sovereignty to Brussels. Yet all the E.U. governments signed up to the 2009 Lisbon Treaty precisely to give Europe a stronger, coherent and more effective voice.
Heiko Biehl, one of the editors of a new book, ''Strategic Cultures in Europe,'' argues that the differing historical and national experiences of the member states have prevented any welding of a common strategic culture for Europe.
Consider the national strategies of the Baltic states, France and Germany. The Baltic countries are focused on NATO as their crucial security guarantor because of their deep distrust of Russia. France's recent white paper on defense grapples with the big strategic issues of the Middle East and elsewhere because of its perspective as a former colonial power and its status as a nuclear power. Germany's perspective focuses on the importance of multilateralism for dealing with new threats but lacks ideas for European defense. Perhaps it's because Germany has since 1945 depended on the United States for its security and for setting the security agenda.
But analysts wonder how much longer Germany can use the past as an excuse not to commit itself to a strong European defense and security policy. ''The dependence on the U.S. was a virtue and vice,'' Dr. Korteweg said. ''Now Europe is struggling with this as Washington shifts its strategic attention elsewhere.''
If the Europeans were serious about responding to the changes taking place in its neighborhoods and in the United States, then national governments would at least agree to write a new security strategy.
The first one was 10 years ago. Yet Catherine M. Ashton, Europe's foreign policy chief, opposes writing a new one, fearing huge disagreements. London and Berlin are hostile to the idea, too. Britain would have to discuss its role in Europe, and Germany would have to deal with Europe's relations with Russia.
These attitudes bode ill for next December's E.U. summit meeting on defense, the first one in eight years. ''The expectations are already being lowered,'' Mr. de France said.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Obama's visit to Berlin can change that.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Stimulus Gets Its Second Wind

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Investors raced back into the Japanese stock market Monday after upbeat data helped dispel some recent doubts cast on the government's aggressive pro-growth policies.
The Nikkei 225 stock index jumped 636.67 points, or 4.9 percent, to 13,514.20, the biggest single-day gain in point terms in almost five years. The broader Topix index rose 55.02 points, or 5.2 percent, to 1,111.97.
Earlier, the government's revision of gross domestic product data showed Japan's economy expanded at a rate of 1.0 percent between January and March, above a preliminary estimate of 0.9 percent, after estimates for corporate capital spending and stronger household spending were raised. That new clip came to 4.1 percent in annualized terms, up from 3.5 percent. 
Bank lending, which had stubbornly refused to grow despite years of easy money amid companies' weariness over growth prospects, rose a robust 1.8 percent in May from the same month last year. That uptick came as a victory for the Bank of Japan, which has embarked on a bold program to pump the economy with cheap money to get businesses to borrow and invest.
Data released Monday also showed Japan's current account surplus doubled in April to ¥750 billion, or nearly $7.6 billion, far above market forecasts of slightly above ¥300 billion, as a weakened yen pushed up returns on overseas investments. Last year, Japan's current-account surplus shrunk to record levels as a strong yen hurt exporters, and an energy shortfall led to a jump in the costs of importing fuel. But a welcome drop in the yen -- another consequence of the central bank's loose monetary policies -- has eased some of the pressure on the balance of trade.
The fresh data came as relief for investors who had become increasingly jittery over Japan's recovery amid signs of an economic slowdown in China, a major trading partner, and speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve might soon start to scale back its stimulus. Mediocre U.S. jobs numbers released Friday, however, appeared to have eased concerns of a major rollback by the Fed.
The latest numbers also provided encouragement for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his push to reinvigorate Japan's deflationary economy. The so-called Abenomics initially garnered a euphoric reception by the stock market, and shares surged by 80 percent. But a sudden end to the market rally put the spotlight on skeptics who questioned Mr. Abe's growth plans and voiced concerns over harmful side effects.
An additional economic growth plan described by Mr. Abe last week underwhelmed many investors and economists who had hoped for a stronger commitment for structural reforms -- for example, to overhaul a rigid, two-tier labor market. Meanwhile, the yen crept higher from its recent declines against the dollar, crossing over the psychologically important level of ¥100 to the dollar last week for the first time since early May.
Foremost in investors' minds has been the specter of too fast a rise in long-term interest rates, which could pressure government finances by increasing the costs of servicing Japan's sky-high public debt. Yields on benchmark 10-year government bonds, however, have stabilized following a jump in early May, helping to alleviate those concerns. The Bank of Japan could announce steps to lessen volatility in bond markets at the end of a two-day policy meeting that ends Tuesday. Economists, meanwhile, point out that a rise is inevitable as inflation takes hold in Japan.
Now, as investors take more measured stock of opportunities and risks in Japan, its stock market is likely to see a more tempered rise, said Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. After the rally Monday, the Nikkei is still down 15 percent from a peak in mid-May, but up 30 percent since the start of the year.
''Growth from here is likely to be a lot less rapid -- almost certainly a good thing for the longevity of the bull run,'' Mr. Smith said in a note to clients.

HEADLINE: Economic Optimism Leaves Markets Unimpressed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's ratings agency posted improved expectations on Monday regarding the United States economy, but investors just yawned.
Stocks started higher at the opening of trading, shortly after the agency raised its outlook for the United States government's debt rating and credited ''the strengths of the economy.'' But the gains proved both modest and fickle, and the market spent most of the day flitting between small gains and losses.
At day's end, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.& P. 500-stock index were lower, but just barely. The Nasdaq composite was slightly higher. It was a marked change from Friday, when the Dow jumped 207 points after a jobs report that investors viewed as positive. 
Notable movers included Booz Allen Hamilton, the military contractor, which slid after an employee said he had leaked information about secret government surveillance programs. Its shares dropped 46 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $17.54.
Facebook rose after analysts at the brokerage Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy from hold, saying the company was one of the most compelling investments in the Internet sector. The stock rose $1.04, or 4.5 percent, to $24.33.
B&G Foods, whose brands include Cream of Wheat and Mrs. Dash, climbed after announcing it would buy Robert's American Gourmet Food, whose brands include Pirate's Booty and Smart Puffs. B&G Foods rose $1.99, or 6.8 percent, to $31.17.
The S.& P. statement harked back to August 2011, when the agency slashed its rating of the government's debt because Congress was in a heated battle over whether to raise government spending limits. The downgrade sent the stock market into a tailspin. The Dow plunged 634 points, or more than 5 percent, on the first trading day after the downgrade. The market had triple-digit swings throughout that fall.
While Monday's shift by the ratings agency failed to restore the government's top-shelf credit rating, it did suggest that S.& P. was unlikely to cut the rating again in the near future.
The reaction from investors was a far cry from two summers ago. Some doubted S.& P.'s assessment that the economy was improving, and said the Fed was only artificially propping it up.
Ed Butowsky, managing partner of Chapwood Investments in Addison, Tex., said that the unemployment rate was still too high, economic growth too weak and the government's budget deficit too heavy for the economy to be considered healthy.
''It defies economic logic as to why the S.& P. did this,'' Mr. Butowsky said.
Others agreed with the S.& P. assessment, but said it was old news. Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds in New York, said he thought the economy was strong enough to drive sustainable earnings growth, but not so strong that the Fed might pull the plug on its stimulus measures -- a sentiment that seemed to drive Friday's rally. Still, he said he thought investors should not draw too many conclusions from a single S.& P. report. ''On the question of what's moving the U.S. stock market,'' Mr. Webman said, ''the answer is, 'not much.' ''
The 10-year Treasury note dropped 9/32 to 95 29/32, and the yield edged up to 2.21 percent from 2.18 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Guardian Makes Waves, and Is Ready For More

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY and NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
When Janine Gibson, the editor in chief of The Guardian's Web site in the United States, realized that one of her columnists had a scoop about secret National Security Agency surveillance -- potentially one of the biggest leaks in American intelligence history -- she presented it to The Guardian's top editor in London with classic British understatement.
''I've got a little story to chat to you about,'' she told the editor, Alan Rusbridger. 
Last week's revelations about the extent of N.S.A. surveillance both in the United States and abroad is a major coup for the British news organization, which established a beachhead here less than two years ago. Mr. Rusbridger, who flew to New York from London last Wednesday in anticipation of the scoop, credits the story to the fact that The Guardian continues to invest in journalism when many news organization have cut back.
''We're internationally engaged,'' Mr. Rusbridger said Monday as he sat with Ms. Gibson in The Guardian's conference room in Manhattan after a nonstop weekend. Outside the conference room, television screens featured reports from a range of networks, all focused on The Guardian's story.
The scoop may also owe a partial debt to The Guardian's longstanding liberal and anti-establishment approach to journalism. The newspaper has in recent years aggressively covered, among other stories, the News Corporation hacking scandal, the accusations of sexual abuse against the BBC personality Jimmy Savile, and the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables.
In 2012, the paper hired Glenn Greenwald, a high-profile writer, activist and lawyer who Ms. Gibson said ''embodies something that is really quite Guardian.'' Mr. Greenwald has been a longtime critic the Patriot Act and other national security steps that the government has taken since 9/11.
For the N.S.A. story, the paper allowed him to cross over to the news pages and to cooperate with a source who leaked the N.S.A. documents. Mr. Greenwald said that his source, who on Sunday identified himself as Edward J. Snowden, ''knew the views that I had'' and ''knew that in order for someone to do this story the way it had to be done'' he had to be ''in an adversarial posture vis-à-vis the U.S. government.''
Barton Gellman, an investigative reporter who had a long career at The Washington Post, said Mr. Snowden also discussed the documents with him. But he balked when Mr. Gellman and The Post would not agree to Mr. Snowden's timetable for releasing the documents or his request that the paper print all the slides in a PowerPoint presentation about Prism, the government's extensive online surveillance system.
Laura Poitras, a documentary filmmaker who shared a byline with Mr. Greenwald in The Guardian and Mr. Gellman in The Post in the coverage of the N.S.A. leaks, said in an interview with Salon that Mr. Snowden ''had a suspicion of mainstream media.''
David Corn, the Washington bureau chief at Mother Jones magazine -- who is probably best known for releasing the Mitt Romney ''47 percent'' video -- said that leakers once sought out established news organizations like television networks and national newspapers but that ''that oligopoly no longer exists.''
''If the leak is big enough, it doesn't matter what platform you choose,'' he said. ''If it has merit and wow factor, you will get your story out.''
The N.S.A. story also came with benefits: The Guardian Web site recorded its highest day of traffic on Monday, a spokeswoman said.
The Guardian's parent, Guardian Media Group, loses money, according to its most recent financial statements. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the paper's circulation in Britain is less than half what it was a decade ago -- 192,376 compared with 396,508. While Mr. Rusbridger said he expected the company's financial situation to improve, The Guardian is exploring new ways to make money, including inviting loyal readers to help financially.
''We are deeply interested in monetizing them,'' Mr. Rusbridger said. Many have offered financial support, especially after the Snowden scoop.
Charlie Beckett, director of Polis, a media research group affiliated with the London School of Economics, said plans for growth internationally could help offset losses back home.
''The Guardian is desperately trying to become globally recognized. They do it because they care,'' Mr. Beckett said. ''But it's also part of their global business strategy.''
The company has 57 employees in the United States in New York, Washington and Chicago. Its editors do not deny that their journalism walks much closer to the line of advocacy than most American newspapers. Mr. Beckett described The Guardian as serving a role in Britain similar to the one that MSNBC does in the United States.
''Because of the BBC and public service broadcasting, we always have a huge volume of objective and balanced journalism. The newspaper press have always had a tradition of being partisan from the beginning of the 20th century,'' Mr. Beckett said.
Ms. Gibson said part of The Guardian's approach to journalism came from its limited resources. Because it cannot afford to hire beat reporters to cover all topics, its reporters must be driven to write about their passions, like phone hacking or national security, she said.
''They're not really going to pursue it unless they really, really care about it,'' Ms. Gibson said.
Ms. Gibson described the growth of the Web site in the United States as steady and that it would integrate all types of experts into its coverage who it may reach through blogs, commenters and types of social media.
Mr. Rusbridger said, ''You are just giving a better account of the world.''

HEADLINE: Re-election Challenge Could Complicate McConnell's Balancing Act

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In any season, Washington bristles with barriers to accomplishment: permanent partisan warfare, vast ideological differences, a system built for stalemate.
But the political realities of a party leader facing a fight for re-election, as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will in 2014, can complicate matters further.
Mr. McConnell, the minority leader, said in an interview that he would continue to advance bipartisan deals that make sense, like the 2011 debt limit agreement and the 2012 compromise on deficit reduction, and oppose those that do not.
''I intend to do my job in the same way I've done it since I've been Republican leader,'' said Mr. McConnell, 71, who rose to that post in 2007 and is seeking his sixth term in the Senate. 
Others in Washington are not so sure, fearing that the strain of a re-election fight and a potential conservative primary challenge could close the narrow opening for legislative achievement in this Congress.
''It makes it a little harder,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. Not only could Mr. McConnell get pushed to the right if a challenger emerged during primary season, but he also faces a grueling fund-raising gantlet to collect the $20 million or more his campaign is seeking to protect him.
Managing the roles of candidate and party leader ''requires an inordinate amount of time, effort and concentration,'' said former Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota. ''It's very challenging to deal with.''
Too challenging, as it turned out, for Mr. Daschle, who in 2004 became the first Senate party leader in a half-century to lose a re-election bid. In an era of extreme partisanship in Washington and dismal regard for Congress everywhere else, the extra burden of home-state peril has become an expectation ever since.
In early 2010, anticipation of Senator Harry Reid's defeat in Nevada grew so great that attention shifted to intraparty jockeying over who would follow him as the head of Senate Democrats. Good fortune helped save him in November after Republicans nominated Sharron Angle, a favorite of the Tea Party movement in Nevada, whom Democrats successfully portrayed as an extremist.
These days, Mr. Reid's Republican counterpart faces gossip from colleagues and ominous headlines in the news media. ''Poll: McConnell Popularity Sagging,'' read one in Politico this spring.
''Party leaders for about 50 years had pretty much a free ride,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''Now, there's a new paradigm.''
He has responded by instructing aides to assemble, as he put it, ''the best U.S. Senate campaign in the history of the country.''
After the Tea Party candidate Rand Paul bowled over his establishment choice for the other Senate seat in Kentucky in 2010, Mr. McConnell hired Mr. Paul's campaign manager to run his re-election bid. On a surreptitiously taped campaign audio recording this year, he brandished a feisty ''Whac-a-Mole'' stance toward potential opponents like the actress Ashley Judd.
Still lacking a strong opponent in either party, Mr. McConnell has targeted President Obama -- a promising tactic in one of the states where the Democratic incumbent drew less than 40 percent of the vote last year. A recent campaign video portrayed misconduct by the Internal Revenue Service as evidence that Mr. Obama has returned Richard Nixon-style lawlessness to the White House.
Mr. McConnell's personal battle matters beyond Kentucky if it alters the national agenda. Mr. Reid's race three years ago appeared not to.
Mr. Reid had no alternative, as Democratic leader, but to aggressively promote the agenda of a new Democratic president, who had also carried Nevada. He helped push through the economic stimulus, the health care law and the overhaul of Wall Street regulation. On revamping the immigration system, a critical concern for Nevada's swelling Hispanic constituency, Mr. Reid sometimes carried the banner more aggressively than Mr. Obama himself.
That issue is not nearly so popular in Kentucky, with its tiny Hispanic population. The fact that bipartisan legislation has moved toward a Senate floor debate this week is one sign that Mr. McConnell will not block action to guard his right flank.
A potential breakthrough on long-term deficit reduction poses a tougher test. In return for curbs on Medicare and Social Security, Mr. Obama and Democrats have insisted on additional tax increases.
Tea Party Republicans have unequivocally opposed the increases.
''There won't be a deal, in large part because he's worried about himself,'' said J. B. Poersch, a veteran strategist for Senate Democrats. ''The politics will demand that he be an obstructionist.''
That did not keep Mr. McConnell from reaching an agreement on Dec. 31 with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on higher tax rates for individuals earning more than $400,000 and families earning more than $450,000 -- thresholds that, an aide noted, affect fewer than 5,400 Kentucky tax filers. Even as he blisters Mr. Obama, Mr. McConnell boasts of having negotiated every major bipartisan deal of the president's tenure.
''I don't think McConnell in his heart of hearts wants to be a partisan warrior all the time,'' said Al Cross, a veteran Kentucky political reporter who directs the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky.
Mr. Alexander, who is up for re-election in Tennessee, agrees.
As a conservative facing re-election in one of the nation's reddest states, Mr. McConnell might well oppose any compromise including tax hikes and cuts to so-called entitlement programs.
Mr. Alexander, who dined with Mr. Obama and has talked with Democratic colleagues about a budget deal this spring, said that as a party leader with a keen tactical sense, Mr. McConnell knew that ''the right time'' for a politically sensitive budget compromise was when Republicans and Democrats shared power and could ''spread the pain around.''
''I don't think he'd try to stop a deal from happening,'' Mr. Alexander said, ''even though he may not be able to vote for it.''
Mr. McConnell does not rule out the passage of a deal he would personally oppose, calling the need to rein in entitlements ''the transcendent issue of our time.''
''I wouldn't want to pass up a single opportunity for the president to do the right thing for the country,'' he said. ''Divided government is probably the only time you can do this.''
''I don't intend to support any deal that includes new revenues,'' he said. But ''I don't know that I have the ability to block things.''

HEADLINE: Take A Number

BYLINE: By ANDREW GELMAN. 
ANDREW GELMAN, PROFESSOR OF STATISTICS, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

 BODY:
1.8: it's the ratio of average personal income in the richest state to that in the poorest state in 2012.
The number may not be all that surprising, nor are the rankings of the states: Connecticut is richest, with an income of $59,000 per capita, followed by Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York; Mississippi is poorest, at $33,000. What is striking is a much older number: 5.1, the ratio in 1930. 
This means that the disparity between the richest and poorest states has shrunk by almost two-thirds in 80 years. And actually, it happened much faster than that, thanks to an array of powerful social and economic trends.
Government spending in the Great Depression and World War II hastened the transfer of income from North to South. Growing prosperity, migration and mobility had the same effect. By 1976 the ratio of average income in richest and poorest states had declined to 1.7 (excluding the anomaly of Alaska, with its huge resources and tiny population in its early years of statehood), and it has held fairly steady since then.
Though the disparity has shrunk sharply, the rankings of rich and poor states have changed little. In 1929 the richest state was New York, at $16,000 per capita (in 2013 dollars), followed by Delaware and Connecticut. In last place was South Carolina, at $4,000, and Mississippi was next to last.
Yet while income inequality among states has been falling, the pattern among individuals and families tells a different story. The economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez report that in 1930, the top 1 percent of Americans received 17 percent of the nation's total income. Their share declined steadily until 1975 -- to a mere 8 percent. But since then the number has been creeping back up, and it now stands again at 17 percent.

HEADLINE: Fresh Start for a Critical Relationship

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
There was never any guarantee that President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China would end their informal talks over the weekend with a deeper and more productive relationship. On too many issues, their national interests diverge. Even so, their meeting seems to have laid a reasonable basis for cooperation and for managing the inevitable competition between rising and established powers. 
There were two concrete results, including an agreement to discuss ways to curb the emission of hydrofluorocarbons, known as HFCs, an important step in addressing global warming. Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the current generation of HFCs -- the heat-trapping chemicals that are used in air-conditioning and refrigeration -- replaced older refrigerants that were depleting the ozone. But while they succeeded in preserving the ozone, they turned out to be powerful greenhouses gases that are accelerating climate change and now themselves must be replaced.
Previously, China objected to tackling the HFCs, which it produces in large quantities. Now, Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama said they would work within the protocol on a global phasedown that could significantly reduce the gases by 2050. This would eliminate a powerful greenhouse gas, and it might also provide momentum toward a broader global agreement aimed at the reduction of other greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.
The two sides also made important progress on North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong-un, in recent months has raised regional tensions with belligerent rhetoric and nuclear and missile tests. Under pressure from China, its chief ally, North Korea agreed to hold high-level talks with South Korea later this week, the first in six years.
But that's unlikely to produce results unless Mr. Xi keeps the pressure on the North and shows sustained interest in curbing its nuclear program.
There was no sign that any headway was made on the issue that Washington considers most pressing: cyberattacks by hackers linked to the Chinese military and the stealing of American military and economic secrets. While unfortunate, that's not a surprise since American officials predicted that it would take time to lay out their evidence and convince the Chinese government that such activities could seriously threaten relations between the United States and China. They will have another chance to engage on the subject when they convene a senior-level strategic dialogue next month.
Nor was there any apparent progress on finding ways to ease China's increasingly assertive territorial claims in the South China and East China Seas, which are stirring dangerous tensions with Japan and South Korea. On human rights, the signals were disquieting. While the Chinese government granted passports to relatives of Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer who sought asylum in the United States last year, a Chinese court on Sunday sentenced a brother-in-law of Liu Xiaobo, the persecuted Nobel Peace Prize winner, to 11 years in prison on trumped-up charges of fraud.
But the presidential summit meeting was more about each leader getting a feel for the other and figuring out how they could work constructively with each other. On that, they seemed to make some headway. If they can resist political forces that are stoking distrust between the two countries and maintain a dialogue, maybe they can achieve the ''new model'' of relations they pledged to build. That would be a significant move for both nations.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
1 P.M. (Sundance) L'AMOUR FOU (2011) The French couturier Yves Saint Laurent, below, may have been surrounded by intense beauty, both in the atelier and at home, yet he was said to be joyful only twice a year: on the days a new collection was shown, usually to boisterous acclaim. But within 24 hours, the euphoria had evaporated. Pierre Bergé narrates this documentary about Saint Laurent, his partner in business and in life for a half-century until the designer's death in 2008. The ''crazy love'' of the title refers not so much to their relationship but to Saint Laurent's obsessions with objects, from the artworks -- including Picassos, Matisses, Braques and a treasured Brancusi that were sold at a 2009 Christie's auction -- to the perfect houses, which he collected passionately. (All of the rooms in one were named after characters from Proust.) 
''Much of this stately, rather detached biography,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times of this documentary from Pierre Thoretton, ''is pornography for the eye (not the body).'' Of Saint Laurent's depression, he added, ''To realize that you may have the world while still feeling as if you have nothing is to experience a closer encounter with the void than most of us are likely to have.''
NOON (Fox Business) FBN REPORTS LIVE FROM THE NCTA Liz Claman reports on the latest news, technology and network developments from the National Cable and Telecommunications Association's annual conference in Washington. Her guests include Michael Powell, the organization's president and chief executive, as well as other chief executives, including Philippe Dauman of Viacom; Tom Rogers of TiVo; David Zaslav of Discovery Communications; and Matthew Blank of Showtime Networks.
8 P.M. (CUNY) SURVIVING THE RECESSION Residents of Manhattan and the Bronx tell how their lives and habits have changed since the recession set in. Edward Nell, an economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, offers insight. In ''City Talk,'' at 8:30, members of the Edward I. Koch Saturday Luncheon Club reminisce about the former mayor, who died on Feb. 1. Sam Roberts of The Times moderates.
8 P.M. (Cinemax) THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL (2012) Seven financially distressed British retirees (Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith) are lured by invitation to ''outsource'' themselves for a stay at what is billed as a luxurious retreat ''for the elderly and beautiful'' in Jaipur, India, in this film directed by John Madden. But upon arrival, they discover that the place is far from what was advertised by their host (Dev Patel), a wildly disorganized but enthusiastic young man who neglected to mention the lack of working telephones and doors on the rooms. ''This leisurely paced two-hour movie is a reasonably tasty banquet for the same Anglophiles who embrace 'Downton Abbey,' '' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. ''Although it's not as tidy or comfy as that self-congratulating fantasy of British noblesse oblige or as elevated as the Merchant-Ivory films set in India, it'll do nicely.'' He added, ''Besides its sterling cast, its ace in the hole is its pungent depiction of Jaipur's teeming streets, which give an otherwise well-mannered movie a blinding splash of color.''
9 P.M. (ABC Family) TWISTED In this new mystery series, Danny Desai (Avan Jogia, below), a charismatic 16-year-old with a troubled past, returns to his home after spending five years in juvenile detention for killing his aunt. Branded an outcast, he tries to reconnect with his best friends from childhood, Jo (Maddie Hasson) and Lacey (Kylie Bunbury), who rarely speak to each other these days, and ease tensions with his socialite mother, Karen (Denise Richards), who fell from grace after Danny's imprisonment and the mysterious disappearance of his father. But no one can get Danny to divulge the motive behind his crime. Then a student is found dead, and Danny becomes the prime suspect. The Season 4 premiere of ''Pretty Little Liars'' leads in at 8.
10 P.M. (TLC) MY TEEN IS PREGNANT AND SO AM I Four mothers are expecting at the same time as their teenage daughters.
10 P.M. (13) SYRIA BEHIND THE LINES In this ''Frontline'' repeat Olly Lambert ventures into the Orontes River Valley in the Syrian countryside, where the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad has caused friends and neighbors of different faiths who had lived together peacefully for generations to take up arms against one another. Above, a scene from the program.
11 P.M. (HGTV) RENOVATE TO RENT This new series follows Drew Levin, a real estate agent, and Danny Perkins, a contractor, as they refurbish foreclosed dwellings and rent them. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Women's Colleges and Economic Diversity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Colleges Show Uneven Effort to Enroll Poor'' (front page, May 31) doesn't mention a sector of higher education that has a proud story to tell about educational access. 
Women's colleges like Smith succeed at enrolling an economically diverse student body to a greater extent than many of their peers. At Smith, 25 percent of students come from families eligible for federal Pell grants.
Smith and other women's colleges excel in recruiting and retaining an economically diverse student body, motivating a significant proportion of those students to pursue study in critical fields like science and engineering, and preparing them for advanced and professional study.
Thomas Jefferson said the goal of American education is to nurture the ''natural aristocracy of talent and virtue.'' Smith and its peers embody this ideal.

HEADLINE: Water Levels Fall In Great Lakes, Taking a Toll On Shipping

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Aboard the Dorothy Ann, in Lake Erie near Fairport Harbor, Ohio -- As Capt. Jeremy R. Mock steered this 711-foot combination of tug and barge toward a harbor berth, a screen of red numbers indicated the decreasing depth of water under the vessel: 6 feet, 3.6 feet, 2 feet.
Suddenly the numbers gave way to a line of red dashes: -- -- -- -- .
It was a signal that there was not enough water to measure. 
Drought and other factors have created historically low water marks for the Great Lakes, putting the $34 billion Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway shipping industry in peril, a situation that could send ominous ripples throughout the economy.
Water levels in the Great Lakes have been below their long-term averages during the past 14 years, and this winter the water in Lakes Michigan and Huron, the hardest-hit lakes, dropped to record lows, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. Keith Kompoltowicz, the chief of watershed hydrology with the corps's Detroit district, said that in January ''the monthly mean was the lowest ever recorded, going back to 1918.''
While spring rains have helped so far this year, levels in all five Great Lakes are still low by historical standards, so getting through the shallow points in harbors and channels is a tense affair.
The combination of low water and infrequent dredging is annoying to recreational boaters, but the biggest impact is economic: shippers, carriers and the industries that rely on the bulk materials like limestone, iron ore, coal and salt are hugely dependent on lake travel.
Lakers can move products at prices that beat rail or road by as much as $20 per ton of cargo, using much less fuel. Given those advantages and an improving economy, about 30 ships are being built this year to run cargo on the Great Lakes, according to Craig H. Middlebrook, the deputy administrator of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.
But for now, low water is ''hammering our industry,'' said Glen G. Nekvasil, the vice president of the Lake Carriers' Association, a trade group. To cope, shipowners have had to lighten the loads on their boats, making hauling less efficient and profitable.
''When the water level drops as it has, we're ripping tons out of the boat,'' said Mark Barker, the president of the Interlake Steamship Company, which owns the Dorothy Ann.
In the Dorothy Ann pilothouse, 70 feet above the water, the sudden appearance of dashes on the screen was a moment of tight shoulders and held breath. The boat had already been lightened by dropping off thousands of tons of cargo earlier in its journey to float at this depth, and the boat glided the last few hundred feet over the soft bottom.
A large laker, 1,000 feet long, will lose 250 to 270 tons for every inch the water level drops, Mr. Nekvasil said. That can add up to 324,000 tons a season per boat, he said.
The impact does not stop with shippers. ''The aggregate impact over time will be to raise the cost of commodities, which in turn will raise the price of manufacturing goods, which in turn raises the price to the consumer,'' said Richard D. Stewart, the director of the Transportation and Logistics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Superior.
The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that inadequate harbor maintenance increased the cost of traded products by $7 billion in 2010 and that this cost would increase to $14 billion by 2040 if the work was not stepped up.
The most recent causes of low water were the mild winters in 2011 and 2012, which left too little snow to feed the lakes, traditionally ''the largest source of water to the Great Lakes,'' Mr. Kompoltowicz of the corps said. Last spring, the water level rose just 4 inches instead of the usual 12 in Michigan and Huron, he said, and that was followed by an unusually dry summer and above-average evaporation in the fall -- 12 inches more than average. The water level currently stands at 577.20 feet, 22 inches below the long-term average.
A measure of the drop in water levels can also be attributed to the engineering that makes Great Lakes shipping possible. The 1962 dredging of the St. Clair River may have lowered the water in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan by five inches, said John Nevin, a spokesman for the International Joint Commission, founded by the United States and Canada nearly 100 years ago to study issues pertaining to boundary waters.
Other dredging projects may have emptied 16 inches in all from the lakes, Mr. Nevin said. Ways to slow water flowing down the St. Clair, including water gates or turbines that could generate power, have been discussed for years, but any changes would have to be weighed against factors like environmental impact on aquatic life.
Anything that puts more water in Lake Michigan could, in the long run, affect lower-lying areas, he said. ''You don't want to do something that would, ultimately, flood Chicago in 50 or 100 years,'' Mr. Nevin said. Climate change is expected to reduce water levels still further in the long run.
The owners of the big lake boats like the Dorothy Ann and its barge, the Pathfinder, contend that the federal government has fallen down on the job of dredging these harbors, which could help compensate for the low water. ''If we had the dredging, we wouldn't have the dashes,'' said Mr. Barker, president of the Interlake Steamship Company.
He said the Great Lakes ports could be properly dredged for $200 million. ''Pretty much all we're asking for is the cost of a highway interchange,'' he said.
The federal government has a trust fund for harbor dredging, based on taxes on cargo. The fund is supposed to receive $1.8 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, but the Army Corps of Engineers requested to spend only $850 million of the fund, a situation that led Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, to hold up a piece of paper that read ''I.O.U. $6.95 Billion,'' the surplus in the fund since it was established in 1986, in a hearing with Jo-Ellen Darcy, the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. The Water Resources Development Act, which was drafted to address many of these issues, has passed the Senate and is under consideration in the House.
Don T. Riley, a former official with the Army Corps of Engineers who works with a Washington lobbying and consulting firm, Dawson & Associates, acknowledged that the extra money could seem absurd. ''You've got this major surplus -- that just sounds so dumb not to spend at least what you take in because that's what you're paying for,'' he said. But the corps spends only what Congress appropriates, he said, and tapping the fund is not necessarily easy: even if money has been collected, ordering it to be spent increases the appropriation for the corps, and that can be politically troublesome in times of budget cutting.
The ability of humans to fix the situation is limited, said Mr. Nevin of the International Joint Commission. ''We can't make it rain.''

HEADLINE: 'Financialization' as a Cause of Economic Malaise

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Washington seems not to have awakened to the problems caused by the growing share of the United States economy captured by the financial services sector, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Economists are still searching for answers to the slow growth of the United States economy. Some are now focusing on the issue of "financialization," the growth of the financial sector as a share of gross domestic product. Financialization is also an important factor in the growth of income inequality, which is also a culprit in slow growth. Recent research is improving our knowledge of financialization, which has yet to get the attention of policy makers. 
According to a new article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives by the Harvard Business School professors Robin Greenwood and David Scharfstein, financial services rose as a share of G.D.P. to 8.3 percent in 2006 from 2.8 percent in 1950 and 4.9 percent in 1980. The following table is taken from their article.
They cite research by Thomas Philippon of New York University and Ariell Reshef of the University of Virginia that compensation in the financial services industry was comparable to that in other industries until 1980. But since then, it has increased sharply and those working in financial services now make 70 percent more on average.
While all economists agree that the financial sector contributes significantly to economic growth, some now question whether that is still the case. According to Stephen G. Cecchetti and Enisse Kharroubi of the Bank for International Settlements, the impact of finance on economic growth is very positive in the early stages of development. But beyond a certain point it becomes negative, because the financial sector competes with other sectors for scarce resources.
Ozgur Orhangazi of Roosevelt University has found that investment in the real sector of the economy falls when financialization rises. Moreover, rising fees paid by nonfinancial corporations to financial markets have reduced internal funds available for investment, shortened their planning horizon and increased uncertainty.
Adair Turner, formerly Britain's top financial regulator, has said, "There is no clear evidence that the growth in the scale and complexity of the financial system in the rich developed world over the last 20 to 30 years has driven increased growth or stability."
He suggests, rather, that the financial sector's gains have been more in the form of economic rents - basically something for nothing - than the return to greater economic value.
Another way that the financial sector leeches growth from other sectors is by attracting a rising share of the nation's "best and brightest" workers, depriving other sectors like manufacturing of their skills.
The rising share of income going to financial assets also contributes to labor's falling share. As illustrated in the following chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, that share has fallen 12 percentage points since its recent peak in early 2001 and even more from its historical level from the 1950s through the 1970s.
 Labor Share of Nonfarm Business Sector
The falling labor share results from various factors, including globalization, technology and institutional factors like declining unionization. But according to a new report from the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, financialization is by far the largest contributor in developed economies (see Page 52).
The report estimates that 46 percent of labor's falling share resulted from financialization, 19 percent from globalization, 10 percent from technological change and 25 percent from institutional factors.
This phenomenon is a major cause of rising income inequality, which itself is an important reason for inadequate growth. As the entrepreneur Nick Hanauer pointed out at a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on June 6, the income of the middle class is critical to economic growth because of its buying power. Mr. Hanauer believes consumption is really what drives growth; business people like him invest and create jobs to take advantage of middle-class demands for goods and services, which must be supported by good-paying jobs and rising incomes.
According to research by the economists Jon Bakija, Adam Cole and Bradley T. Heim, financialization is a principal driver of the rising share of income going to the ultrawealthy - the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution.
Research by the University of Michigan sociologist Greta R. Krippner supports this position. She notes that financialization exacerbates the well-known problem of corporate ownership and control: while corporate assets are owned by shareholders, they are controlled by managers who often extract an excessive share of corporate profits for themselves.
One main source of income for financial executives is fees paid to financial asset managers, according to the Princeton economist Burton G. Malkiel. Among the best compensated of these are hedge-fund operators, who typically receive 2 percent of the assets under their control plus 20 percent of any increase, annually. (Additionally, they reap special tax benefits that are widely viewed as unjustified.)
Professor Malkiel has long been a fierce critic of actively managed funds, which seldom deliver better returns than an investor could get by simply buying low-cost index funds. Over the decade ending in 2011, index funds easily outperformed actively managed funds, in part because of the low fees on the former and high fees on the latter.
Among those pointing their fingers at financialization is David Stockman, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, who followed his government service with a long career in finance at Salomon Brothers and elsewhere. Writing in The New York Times, he recently said financialization was "corrosive" and had turned the economy into "a giant casino" where banks skim an oversize share of profits.
It's not yet clear what public policies are appropriate to deal with the phenomenon of financialization. The important thing at this point is to be aware of it, which does not yet appear to be the case in Washington.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara

BYLINE: SHIVANI VORA


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Bharara on his profession, personal life and Indian roots. 

 BODY:
 As the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara has prosecuted high-profile political corruption and terrorism cases. But he's best known for going after some of the world's biggest hedge funds in his pursuit of corporate criminals.

 Among those Mr. Bharara, 44, has prosecuted are two prominent South Asians: Raj Rajaratnam, head of the Galleon Group, who is serving a 11-year sentence for receiving insider information from Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, who received a two-year sentence. (Mr. Gupta has appealed for a new trial.) 
 Much of Mr. Bharara's work has been covered extensively by the media, but less attention has been paid to his personal life. For starters, even though Mr. Bharara is referred to as Preet, his full name is Preetinder. He was born in Punjab to a Sikh father and Hindu mother, and his family immigrated to the United States when he was 2. He lives with his wife, who has a Muslim father and Jewish mother, and three children in a New York City suburb. 
 In a recent interview with India Ink at his office in Manhattan, he spoke about what motivates him, his connection to his Indian roots and how he wants to be remembered after he leaves the job. 
 Q. 
You've had an exceptionally high success rate in prolific prosecutions, and any such success requires a passion and a drive. What is it that drives you?
 A. 
I eat a lot of spinach [laughs]. That's actually not true. I'm not at all good at eating my vegetables. What drives me is the mission of doing what this office has been about from the time it was founded back in 1789, which is that we are making the country a little bit better and a little bit safer.
It's an exciting thing to come to work here every day, and the nature of the work itself is what drives me. I want to serve and help people. Just because I feel tired at 6 p.m. doesn't mean that a case is going away.
 Q. 
What's a typical workweek like for you?
 A. 
This is the kind of job that doesn't lend itself to any schedule. I'm up early and e-mailing people and also doing it late at night. I don't sleep that much and am working on weekends too. I don't think I've gotten eight hours of sleep in a very long time.
There are times when you think it's going to be quiet, and then a lead will come in that there is someone out there attempting to do some harm to the city. It may end up being baseless, but every single threat that comes in is investigated seriously, and you may think you had a free evening but end up working for the next 36 hours. That happens on a regular basis because that's the nature of the beast in this job.
 Q. 
Of all the cases you've worked on, is there one that is most memorable?
 A. 
All of the cases are incredibly important, but some do stand out more than others. One that will stay with me in a more dramatic way is the case against Faisal Shahzad. He decided on a Saturday evening in 2010 that he wanted to blow up as many people as possible in Times Square. We stayed up for the next 53 hours until he was in custody, and there was a lot of anxiety about that because he was on the loose.
We learned afterwards that his plan was to keep blowing up people and kill as many Americans as he possibly could. That's something I remember not only in the time that it was going on but now as well. If he hadn't been caught when he was, who knows what kind of damage he would have done.
 Q. 
Countering terrorism is a top priority for your office, but your work on Wall Street has gotten all the attention. Is this because your work on the terrorism front hasn't been covered as much or is it because you feel the corruption on Wall Street is more prevalent today than the threat of terrorism?
 A. 
I don't care that much how the press treats the cases, except that I think it's unfortunate that certain cases don't get the attention they deserve. I can't explain how the press operates, and they're not going to take any advice from me, but it happens to be the case that antiterrorism is the most important priority of the office because the most significant harm can come from terrorism. This city is a target and will always be a target and has been a target in the past, and there is no higher priority than countering the devastation that can be caused by terrorists.
 Q. 
So the press just gloms on to your cases against hedge funds?
 A. 
Well, yes. There are three networks out there devoted 24/7 to financial news, and there are lots of reporters out there who cover only finance so those are the stories they focus on. Our office has done significant work in other areas such as with gangs, but there aren't many journalists who cover just gangs or any networks covering only gangs.
 Q. 
Fame has been the side effect of your job. You've been on magazine covers, you were the Time magazine Person of the Year last year, and Bruce Springsteen even gave you a shout-out at his concert last year. What is it like being famous?
 A. 
I don't think I'm famous at all. I'm not recognized or anything when I walk down the street. If I were, my kids would think I'm really cool, but that's far from the case. In fact, when I call other offices around the country, I often have to spell out my name, and people have no idea who I am.
 Q. 
What do you want your footprint to be after you leave office?
 A. 
I would not like people to think of a particular case in association with me long after I leave. What I hope is that I leave the same legacy of the office that was left to me, which is a place where the best attorneys in the country come to make people's lives better and safer and bring justice in way that works to the highest level of integrity that you can possibly imagine.
 Q. 
How has the South Asian community reacted to you, given that a number of your high-profile prosecutions have been against South Asians?
 A. 
Well, I still get invited to their parties [laughs]. Seriously though, people are usually polite to my face, but of course people are not happy with some of the ways we prosecute cases. But I feel that's true in every community. If everyone was happy with everything we did, then we probably wouldn't be doing our job properly.
 Q. 
Do you ever visit India?
 A. 
I unfortunately haven't been back in 13 years. I would really like to go back sometime, but it's difficult to find the time.
 Q. 
You're a first-generation immigrant, but your three kids were born in the United States. Is it a priority for you that they know their Indian roots?
 A. 
I think that it's important for every family that their children have an appreciation for their roots, whether the roots are in Italy, India, China or wherever. People who don't appreciate where they are from are not being full Americans, in a way.
In our family, our kids spend time with their grandparents and appreciate certain cultural aspects like the music and food. My family is very diverse and from different backgrounds, and it's important they appreciate all those backgrounds.
 Q. 
Can you talk a bit about your personal life? What do you do to unwind? What are your hobbies?
 A. 
I don't get to unwind very much. I work a lot and have a lot of obligations. When I have a little bit of time, I like to be with my family. We go out to eat as much as we can. And if we go away, we like to take the kids to places where they can learn something like Boston or Philadelphia which have so much history.
I do work out on the weekends mostly but not as much as I should, just like everything else.
 Q. 
What's on your nightstand right now?
 A. 
An iPad and a reading lamp, plus stacks of newspapers I need to catch up on reading.
 Q. 
Besides newspapers, what else do you like to read?
 A. 
I try to read widely and in areas where this office has to focus on, like terrorism and financial news. Beyond that, I read a lot of nonfiction. Most recently, I am reading a great book called "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which is about behavioral psychology. It fascinates me how people think about problems, risk and fear.
 Q. 
Where do you go for your Indian food fix in New York City?
 A. 
My favorite Indian restaurant is Tamarind. We are loyal followers. When I lived in the city, I used to order from Baluchi's, especially their $12.95 special.

HEADLINE: Becoming 'Asia Literate': Learn Chinese, but Don't Stop There

BYLINE: SUE-LIN WONG


HIGHLIGHT: As initiatives are under way around the world for non-Chinese to learn the language, some say there&#8217;s more to Asia than China; and more to becoming &#8220;China Literate&#8221; than learning the language. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - While studying abroad at Peking University in Beijing, Andrew Stead didn't expect to find a job at Burton, one of the top snow boarding brands in the world.
"In my spare time on exchange, I would go skateboarding around Beijing with friends, including one who worked at Burton. A few months later, I was offered a job at their Beijing office because of my interest in snowboarding and China," said Mr. Stead, 23, who is majoring in engineering and finance and speaks solid Chinese. He plans to return to Beijing after he graduates soon from an Australian university.
Governments are increasingly recognizing the opportunities that exist for people like Mr. Stead who are able to marry technical skills or hobbies with "Asian literacy." Also called "global competence," it represents an understanding of other cultures and languages; but China isn't the only nation in Asia and people should also be looking more broadly, to Japan, India and Indonesia, to name just three other places, according to some experts. 
In 2009, President Barack Obama announced the "100,000 Strong" initiative to encourage 100,000 students to study abroad in China over four years.
In 2012, the Australian government released a white paper titled "Australia in the Asian Century," described as "a roadmap showing how Australia can be a winner in the Asian century."
Outside of government, there has been a burgeoning of other initiatives: language teaching conferences, Facebook groups to connect parents interested in the idea of "Asia literate," even native Chinese speaking nannies who can command decent salaries.
Yet Asia is a very diverse continent. From the 1970s to the 1990s, "Asian literacy" was mostly about Japan. From the 1990s onwards, the focus shifted to China, as its economy expanded fast.
"Unfortunately, less attention is being paid to many other Asian countries including Japan, India, Pakistan and Indonesia, which are increasingly going to play important roles in the world," Christopher M. Livaccari, the director of education and Chinese language initiatives at the Asia Society in New York, said.
"Global competence is not about speaking Chinese. I worry the United States is putting a tremendous amount of resources into Chinese," he said. "Thirty years ago we saw this with Japanese. Now, many people who spent all this time learning Japanese are saying, 'Why did I do this? Japan is not as central to the world or my life as it was once perceived to be.'"
And, what does it even mean to be "China literate?" Is it about rattling off fluent Mandarin? Or can it be less than that - a basic understanding of Chinese culture and customs, or cuisine? Is it exclusively for a privileged few who can afford the experience of studying abroad? Or can everyone have an opportunity to be "China literate"?
"Asia literacy may just be about encouraging young people to think about Asia as an option for their future, for travel, for a gap year, for a career," said Angela Merriam, a senior policy analyst at China Policy in Beijing.
For those who do take the leap and learn Chinese, there are both linguistic and cultural barriers. Westerners, accustomed to liberal teaching methods, may complain that Chinese teachers' style is too rigid.
"Many U.S. school administrators share that there is some level of frustration with Chinese teachers approaching instruction as if they were teaching a group of Chinese children, as opposed to a group of American children," Mr. Livaccari said.
For teachers who do adapt to American schools and classrooms, it is sometimes a struggle to excite students about China because it lacks the contemporary cultural appeal of Japan and Korea.
Foreigners studying Chinese may find Chinese popular culture difficult to connect to, and while Chinese studying abroad may enjoy watching television (also to improve their language skills), Chinese television offers foreigners a diet heavy in bloody, anti-Japanese war dramas and entertainment styles that may be difficult to understand. But the strength of the Chinese economy and pressure from parents and school districts for schools to offer Chinese language classes trumps China's lack of soft power.
What about foreigners who live in China and learn to speak the language well? Quite a few say that there's nothing as annoying as the question, "But how many real Chinese friends do you have?"
"Even though you speak Chinese well, it's sometimes hard to develop close relationships," Mr. Livaccari said. "It's about language, but it's about so much more than language."
For Mr. Stead, it all started by accident; growing up in Australia, the two Malaysian children at his school were the closest he ever got to Asia. A few years later on a flight home, he noticed the person next to him on the airplane struggling to fill out an immigration card.
"We started chatting," Mr. Stead said. "He was coming from Yunnan in China to study in Perth and was going to live a few streets away from me. Now he's one of my best friends. Around that time, I had some elective classes at university so I decided to take the most different class I could think of - Chinese."
 What does being "Asia literate" mean to you? How can there be a shift away from focusing on "China literacy" to "Asia literacy" more broadly? How important is it to learn another language to be "Asia literate"? 
The name of the person who studied Chinese in Beijing is Mr. Andrew Stead, not Mr. Andrew Mead, and he studied at Peking University, not Tsinghua University.

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Back in British Hands Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: The Briton who purchased the British sports car maker TVR has promised to bring the marque back to its automotive senses, and Jeep announces pricing for the all-new Cherokee. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 The British sports car maker TVR appears to have been resurrected, according to a report from BBC's "Top Gear." Les Edgar, the English entrepreneur who bought the marque from its previous Russian owner, promised that TVR - which had come close to lending its name to wind turbines after not producing new cars - will remain a car company. Mr. Edgar didn't say when the company would begin producing cars, but a slogan on the company's Web site is suggestive: Roaring Back. (Top Gear)
 Chrysler announced Monday that the starting price for the all-new Jeep Cherokee will be $23,990 - $300 less than that of the 2012 Jeep Liberty. The top-of-the-line Cherokee, the Limited 4×4, will start at $30,990, which, like the price of its lesser sibling, includes shipping. The original Cherokee, which sold in the United States from its 1984 introduction until Chrysler pulled the plug in 2001, is entirely different from the new model. The 2014 Cherokee features a bold new look and is a first-ever collaboration between Jeep and its Italian parent company, Fiat. (Automotive News)

 There's nothing quite like horror movie shock to get one's attention, or so goes the reasoning behind a new anti-drunken driving public service announcement in Britain. As of Monday evening, the YouTube version of England's Department for Transport-sponsored ad, called #PublicLooShocker, had garnered more than 4.2 million views. Its message is simple: drinking and driving can kill people. The point is driven home by pub patrons being scared half to death in a bathroom when a bloody face smashes through the mirror, much as one would through a windshield in a severe collision. The video was filmed with actors, but the effect is chilling. (Huffington Post)
 According to a report from The Los Angeles Times, tire rental is a burgeoning business that has many motorists paying a lot more for tires than they would by buying rubber up front. For some, the bite of the recession still stings, leading them to make hard choices. With average annual incomes down and the price of tires up, some families say they have no choice but to rent tires to keep vehicles they use to get to work on the road. The problem is, reports The Times, that renting tires as opposed to buying them can make their cost double or even triple. But with many consumers unable to qualify for traditional lines of credit, the rent-to-own industry is on the rise. (Jalopnik)

 Mercedes-Benz has challenged the Nürburgring Nordschleife lap time of the Audi R8 e-tron with its all-electric Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Coupé Electric Drive. Completing the loop in 7:56.234, Mercedes has taken away Audi's production E.V. record, and, as far as electric cars go, is second only to the Radical-based Toyota Motorsport EV P002, which is not a production car. Mercedes's electric supercar will be available to very wealthy customers - Autoblog says it costs more than $550,000 - this summer. (Autoblog)

HEADLINE: SoftBank Raises Bid for Sprint

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: SoftBank raises its takeover bid for Sprint Nextel to $21.6 billion. | The big tech companies walk a tightrope in their responses to the revelations about government surveillance. | Brokers are making efforts to remove negative information from their records. | Bank governance has become a critical issue in Greece. 

 BODY:
SoftBank of Japan has raised its takeover bid for Sprint Nextel to $21.6 billion, seeking to block a rival bid from Dish Network, Michael J. de la Merced reports in DealBook. Under the revised terms, SoftBank is shifting about $1.5 billion originally intended for Sprint itself to the company's shareholders; investors can now sell shares at $7.65 each, an increase of nearly 5 percent from the original offer. The revised offer is valued at about $7.48 a share, up nearly 19 percent from the earlier bid, Mr. de la Merced reports. SoftBank would own about 78 percent of Sprint if the deal is approved.
Sprint said it had ended sale talks with Dish, which in April had offered $25.5 billion, or about $7 a share, for all of Sprint. Dish has failed to put forward an acceptable formal bid, Sprint said in a statement. "The new proposal by SoftBank, cobbled together largely over the weekend, is aimed at preserving SoftBank's biggest gamble: buying control of Sprint to challenge the existing titans of the American cellphone market, AT&T and Verizon Wireless," Mr. de la Merced writes. 
The new offer, which has been approved by a special committee of Sprint's board, may sway some skeptical investors. Paulson & Company, the hedge fund that is Sprint's second-largest shareholder, said it would support the new offer. Still, the revised offer would saddle Sprint with more debt, Peter Thal Larsen of Reuters Breakingviews writes. "That matters to the dynamics of the auction. SoftBank has made lower leverage one of the main virtues of its bid."
TREADING LIGHTLY IN STATEMENTS ON U.S. SPYING | After revelations that the National Security Agency is engaged in a surveillance program of Internet users through a system called Prism, the biggest technology companies have responded by denying involvement in the spying apparatus. "Of course, the news - as well as the responses - raises doubts about who is telling the truth and about how extensive the spying program really may be," Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. "But perhaps just as important, the episode also raises questions about how publicly traded companies with hundreds of millions of consumers - companies that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission - can, and should, react to news when pressed about involvement in confidential government programs."
"Senior executives I spoke with at many of the technology companies cited in the Prism documents said they routinely provided the government with requested data, in some cases months' worth of e-mail traffic for a certain address," Mr. Sorkin writes. "So while the nation's biggest technology companies may not be a part of systematic large-scale spying program, it is clear that they are legally required to play a significant role in funneling data to the government. That leaves them on a tightrope balancing what they can say to their customers and investors while complying with their obligations to keep the government's secrets."
WHEN BROKERS REQUEST A CLEAN SLATE | As investors increasingly rely on BrokerCheck, the online database of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to vet financial professionals, brokers and executives "are pursuing every means possible to remove negative information from their records," Susan Antilla reports in DealBook.
If an investor, for example, "checked the securities industry's official regulatory database of complaints against brokers for the name of Michele Kief, a Wells Fargo broker in Naples, Fla., it would reveal nine client disputes - enough red flags to give a customer pause. But on May 24, a panel of arbitrators for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority granted a request to polish Ms. Kief's record a bit."
ON THE AGENDA | The Morgan Stanley Financials Conference gets going at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. The N.F.I.B. small business optimism index for May is out at 7:30 a.m. Data on wholesale inventories in April is out at 10 a.m. Michael B. Mukasey, a former United States attorney general who is now a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, is on Bloomberg TV at 10:10 a.m. Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, is on CNBC at 1:20 p.m.
GREEK BANKER REACHES THE TOP | As Europe prepares to close the books on a cash injection of about 50 billion euros into the four largest banks in Greece, bank governance has become a critical issue, Landon Thomas Jr. writes in The New York Times. "Still, Greece's overseers from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund may well find that even with increased oversight, changing the freewheeling business culture that long defined the Greek financial system will be easier said than done." The rapid - and, some say, problematic - rise of one banker, Michalis G. Sallas, the chairman of Piraeus Bank, exemplifies that culture.

HEADLINE: Domestic Surveillance Could Create a Divide in the 2016 Primaries

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Attitudes toward the security state could split the establishment from outsiders within each party &#8212; possibly creating a wedge issue in both party primaries in 2016. 

 BODY:
A poll released on Monday by the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post found a partisan shift in the way Americans view the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance programs. In the survey, slightly more Democrats than Republicans said they found it acceptable for the N.S.A. to track Americans' phone records and e-mails if the goal is to prevent terrorism. By comparison, when Pew Research asked a similar question in 2006, Republicans were about twice as likely as Democrats to support the N.S.A.'s activities.
The poll is a reminder that many Americans do not hold especially firm views on some issues and instead may adapt them depending on which party controls the executive branch. When it comes to domestic surveillance, a considerable number of Democrats seem willing to support actions under President Obama that they deemed unacceptable under George W. Bush, while some Republicans have shifted in the opposite direction. 
What may be just as significant is the way in which attitudes toward the security state could split voters and elected officials within each party - possibly creating a wedge issue in both party primaries in 2016. Politicians who are normally associated with being on the far left and the far right may find common cause with grass-roots voters in their objection to domestic surveillance programs, fighting against a party establishment that is inclined to support them.
Take, for example, the House's vote in May 2011 to extend certain provisions of the Patriot Act - including the so-called library records provision that the government has used to defend the legality of sweeping searches of telephone and e-mail records. The bill passed with 250 yes votes in the House against 153 no votes, receiving more of its support from Republicans. (In the Senate, the bill passed, 72-23, winning majority support from both parties.) However, the House vote was not well described by a traditional left-right political spectrum.
In the chart below, I've sorted the 403 members of the House who voted on the bill from left to right in order of their overall degree of liberalism or conservatism, as determined by the statistical system DW-Nominate. Members of the House who voted for the bill are represented with a yellow stripe in the chart, while those who voted against it are represented in black.
The no votes are concentrated at the two ends of the spectrum. The 49 most liberal members of the House (all Democrats) who voted on the bill each voted against it. But so did 14 of the 21 Republicans deemed to be the most conservative by DW-Nominate.
By contrast, 46 of the 50 most moderate Republicans voted for the Patriot Act extension, as did 38 of the 50 most moderate Democrats.
Perhaps, you might object, a one-dimensional spectrum doesn't do a very good job of capturing all the nuances of what it means to be liberal or conservative in America today. In considering the surveillance state, for example, Republicans must weigh their traditional support for aggressive antiterrorism policies against their distrust of government, while Democrats must weigh their trust of Mr. Obama, who so far has been unapologetic for the N.S.A.'s actions, against their concern about civil liberties violations.
Or more broadly, what about libertarians who take conservative views on economic policy but liberal views on social policy - or conservative Democrats who support the welfare state but not policies like gay marriage? Where are they represented on the spectrum?
I am sympathetic toward these objections as a theoretical matter. Without making this too much of an editorial comment, I find the platforms of both parties to be lacking in philosophical cohesion - why, for example, should views on abortion have much to do with preferences on tax policy?
But when it comes to American political parties and their representatives in Congress, partisanship tends to dominate all other considerations. National Journal has a different system for ranking members of Congress from liberal to conservative. It is somewhat less statistically rigorous than DW-Nominate's system, but it does have the advantage of breaking votes down into three categories: those on economic, social and foreign policy.
The correlations between the three policy areas are very high (specifically, they are about 0.9, where 1 would represent a perfect correlation). Members of Congress who take conservative views on economic policy tend almost always to take conservative views on social policy and foreign policy as well, while members who are liberal on one set of issues tend to cast liberal votes on almost all other issues.
This does leave the question of how liberal and conservative policy stances are defined. (Support for gun rights, for example, is generally seen as socially conservative rather than socially liberal, even though socially liberal stances are often thought of as promoting the rights of individuals against communities or governments.) Nevertheless, for members of Congress today, a vote on any one issue is highly predictable based upon his votes on other issues. There are extremely few mavericks in Congress who vote on each issue on an independent and nonpartisan basis.
DW-Nominate uses a different method to classify Congressional votes. Instead of assigning a subjective definition to each vote as liberal or conservative, it instead uses an automated process called optimal classification. The goal of this process is essentially to explain the highest number of Congressional votes based on a one-dimensional scale, regardless of the content of the legislation that comprises it. Whichever votes are not well explained by this first dimension are then explained by additional dimensions.
The process is more intuitive than it might sound. For example, during the 1960s, Congressional votes on civil rights policy toward African-Americans were not very strongly correlated with votes on other types of political issues. (For instance, Southern Democrats were often staunchly opposed to civil rights for blacks while casting very liberal votes on the welfare state.) Thus, you needed at least two dimensions to describe Congressional voting patterns in a reasonably comprehensive way.
In recent years, however, this has been much less of a problem: the one-dimensional spectrum explains about 95 percent of Congressional voting, and votes on economic, social and foreign policy are highly correlated. But a few votes still fall outside of the spectrum - the 2011 vote on the Patriot Act among them.
If the second dimension no longer represents a distinction between economic and social policy, then what does it reflect? The authors of DW-Nominate are interpreting it to measure a distinction between what they call "establishment" members of Congress and "outsiders." Here at FiveThirtyEight, I have sometimes used the same labels when describing the ideological space occupied by different candidates during the presidential primaries. Some candidates, like Mitt Romney, run as insider or establishment politicians, offering some iteration of what they say are tried-and-true solutions, while others run as insurgents or outsiders, submitting a more profound critique of politics as usual and claiming they will topple an unacceptable status quo.
In general, those politicians who rate as insurgents or outsiders are on the wings of the liberal-conservative scale. The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street and Ron Paul movements probably all fit into the outsider or insurgent category, for example, even though they inhabit vastly different spaces on the traditional left-right political spectrum.
Conversely, moderates in both parties tend to score as establishment politicians. There aren't very many "radical centrist" members of Congress who offer a pronounced critique of the status quo while also coming down somewhere in the middle on most policy issues.
In the case of the Patriot Act vote, the establishment-outsider axis makes nearly as much difference as the liberal-conservative or Democratic-Republican scales. Among the so-called establishment members of the House who voted on the bill, 78 percent voted to extend the Patriot Act, while only 41 percent of the so-called outsiders did, according to DW-Nominate's classifications.
You can find similar patterns in certain votes on policy toward the financial sector - for example, during the various bailout votes that were cast toward the end of 2008. More recently, votes on the federal debt ceiling have taken on some of the same contours.
What is the link between the financial votes and those on the surveillance state? In both cases, members of Congress were asked to trust the assertions of elites that significant harms would result if the bills were not enacted: terrorist acts in the event that the Patriot Act was not extended, or financial calamity in the event that the bailout was not passed or the debt ceiling was not raised.
As a matter of practice (but not necessarily theory), convincing someone that a future crisis must be averted requires a higher level of persuasion than making the case for a policy that is claimed to ameliorate some extant problem. Members of Congress who are members of their party establishments might be more inclined to trust testimony from financial or national security elites, and therefore might have been easier to pitch on these bills.
We should be careful about extrapolating the voting behavior of Congress to policy views among the general public. But as I have suggested, the establishment-outsider divide can loom large in presidential primaries. Particularly within the Republican Party, rank-and-file voters have increasingly lukewarm views of the party leadership. But Democrats will also face a primary after Mr. Obama's tenure in office. Highly liberal, activist voters who might ordinarily be inclined to critique the status quo could face some awkward questions given that the status quo has featured a Democratic president.
Debates on domestic surveillance could serve as proxy battles for these intraparty factions. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, perhaps along with other Republican candidates, could use his opposition to surveillance programs to help consolidate the support of libertarian and Tea Party voters, at the risk of alienating national security conservatives. Democratic candidates who criticize the Patriot Act or the N.S.A.'s actions will be finding fault with policies that Mr. Obama has defended - and Mr. Obama will very likely remain quite popular among Democrats three years from now.
Precisely because public opinion on domestic surveillance policy is malleable (as evidenced by the Pew survey), it may come to take on symbolic power. How inclined will Democrats be to support policies that they might otherwise oppose because Mr. Obama pledges that the N.S.A. is using the information it collects appropriately? How much are Republicans willing to believe national security officials appointed by Mr. Obama - defending policies that were often first enacted under Mr. Bush?
How does someone in either party weigh the desire to prevent terrorist attacks against the image of a bureaucrat snooping through his in-box?
The phrase "trust in government" is often invoked in a political context, but its meaning is usually metaphorical, referring to how much a voter might prefer public-sector decisions to those that might be left to the private sector or to individuals. Here, it means something rather more literal: do you trust officials within the government to carry out their national security mission without abusing their powers? Do you trust them when they say that the trade-off between security and liberty is worthwhile - especially when many of the threats they claim to be preventing are based on classified information that you aren't privy to?
In some ways, it may prove invigorating to have a political debate that does not break down all that neatly into the usual partisan camps. And because they create as many fractures across the parties as between them, the recent N.S.A. disclosures might not have all that much effect, for instance, on Mr. Obama's approval ratings or the Congressional elections next year.
But there's the possibility that surveillance policy could become a major issue in the 2016 primaries, as elites in each party defend themselves against rank-and-file voters who are critical of their judgment.

HEADLINE: What You Don't Know About Your Portfolio May Help You

BYLINE: CARL RICHARDS


HIGHLIGHT: Carl Richards discusses the benefits of ignoring the daily moves of the stock market. 

 BODY:
 Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at The BAM Alliance. His book, "The Behavior Gap," was published this year. His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog. 
Back in 2008, a friend of mine left for a two-week trek in Nepal. While he was gone, the entire financial world exploded. 
Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. A.I.G. received an $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve to avoid bankruptcy.
But here's the interesting part: he didn't know anything happened because he didn't have any connection to the outside world. Although recently retired from the investment industry, my friend would have been glued to his computer. But he had no idea what was going on.
Think about that for a minute. I remember those days. I remember waiting up to see how markets opened in Japan. I remember being so worried that I didn't sleep for days. And I remember another friend who called me from a cruise ship to ask if things were O.K. He said that many other passengers got off at the first port and flew home to deal with what was happening in the market.
My friend in Nepal missed it all, and it didn't make one bit of difference. He was actually better off. All my worrying didn't change one thing.
In fact, my friend said that when he got back and eventually heard the news, something became crystal clear. He knew exactly what was going to happen for the rest of his life: the markets were either going to move up and then down, and then up and down again - and then he would die. Or, they would go down and up and down and up - and then he would die.
In either scenario, he was still dead. And no amount of obsessing over the stock market would change that.
This idea of being unconnected for a few weeks reminded me of Warren Buffett's statement: "Benign neglect, bordering on sloth, remains the hallmark of our investment process."
But it's still so hard to ignore the market because we're so connected. We seem to be obsessed with economic news. I'm not sure when exactly it happened, but sometime in the 1990s investing became America's favorite spectator sport. I knew there was a problem while sitting in my dentist's office and seeing CNBC on the TV in the lobby. It's only become more difficult to avoid, now that everyone has a smartphone.
But knowing doesn't help. And much of the time, it actually hurts. Aside from the tendency to trade too much when we're following every market move, there's also the issue of our happiness. It doesn't feel good when our investments go down, even if it's just for one day.
We have an aversion to loss. In other words, you're likely to feel the pain of loss far more acutely than the joy of an investment gain. We feel twice as bad losing money as we do making money. And yet, knowing this, we continue to do things that will cause us pain.
Since many of us use the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index as a proxy for the market, let's take a look at the period from 1950 to 2012 to see how often we're likely to feel positive, based on how often we check our investments:

        
If you checked daily, it would be positive 52.8 percent of the time.
        
If you checked monthly, it would be positive 63.1 percent of the time.
        
If you checked quarterly, it would be positive 68.7 percent of the time.
        
If you checked annually, it would be positive 77.8 percent of the time.
So here's the thing to ask yourself. Other than upsetting yourself half of the time, what good is it doing you to look anyway? Maybe we should all invest as if we're going on a 12-month trek in Nepal!
So along with your do-nothing streak, let's see how long you can go without looking at your investments (assuming you're in a low-cost, diversified portfolio, of course). I think you'll discover that it makes you happier, keeps you from doing something stupid and helps you become a more successful investor.

HEADLINE: French Foodies Fight Boil-in-a-Bag Trend

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: To the alarm of France&#8217;s gastronomes, a growing number of restaurants now offer pre-prepared meals. Now some want to change the law to limit the word &#8220;restaurant&#8221; to those that serve the real thing. 

 BODY:
LONDON - In a fight back against a rising tide of boil-in-a-bag meals and other gastronomic horrors, France is to consider a law change that would limit use of the word "restaurant" to establishments that use proper ingredients prepared on the premises.
In a proposal being formally presented on Tuesday, the National Assembly is being asked to consider a measure that would bar about a third of the country's outlets from calling themselves restaurants, according to estimates from a restaurant trade union that is backing the ban. 
Some of France's top chefs say the list of offenders is much higher, claiming preprepared "industrial cooking" is the norm in three out of four of the country's 150,000 restaurants.
The brouhaha comes less than three years after Unesco, the international cultural agency, added French cuisine to its "world intangible heritage" list. 
But it also follows the European horsemeat scandal, which tarnished France's foodie image because some of the tainted meat may actually have ended up on French restaurant tables.
In a proposed amendment to an upcoming consumer protection law, Pascale Got, a legislator of the governing Socialist Party, says restaurants worth the name would have to guarantee their meals were made from raw materials cooked on the spot.
Menus would have to inform diners whether what was on their plate was freshly made or was a reheated industrial dish.
The measure appears to have a cross-party support. A similar amendment was put forward by Daniel Fasquelle and 30 of his parliamentary colleagues from the opposition U.M.P.
Didier Chenet, head of the Synhorcat restaurant and hotel union, which supports the amendment, said a survey showed a change in the law could encourage two-thirds of establishments to abandon industrial food and go back to real cooking.
He said the word "restaurant" had been abused in France. "In the United States, a grill is called a grill," he told France's Lyon Capitals. "There's nothing wrong with a grill but it's not the same thing as a restaurant."
Mr. Chenet's union believes the law change could create as many as 27,000 jobs in the industry.
Others are not so sure. Six organizations from the restaurant, hotel, cafe and fast-food trades, say the name restriction could lead to a loss of jobs and would be confusing to the public, particularly foreign tourists. 
They favor the creation of an "artisan-restaurateur" designation that would have the same effect of specifying establishments where traditionally prepared food was on offer.
Some of France's leading chefs have decided to take their own action against a boil-in-the-bag food culture and not wait for a change in the law.
Michelin-starred chefs, who include Alain Ducasse, Joël Robuchon and Anne-Sophie Pic, have begun an initiative to save France's food image by creating a Restaurant de Qualité label for restaurants and bistros that prepare fresh food in their own kitchens and give diners a proper welcome.
According to Mr. Ducasse, "The average person has no idea what they are in for when they open the door to a restaurant."
 Do we really know what we're eating when we sit down to a restaurant meal? Are French foodies right to defend traditional cuisine from a fast food takeover? Or is it all a storm in a sauce boat? Let us know your thoughts.

HEADLINE: In Illinois, Daley Exploring a Run for Governor

BYLINE: STEVEN YACCINO


HIGHLIGHT: William M. Daley, a former chief of staff to President Obama, announced that he was exploring a bid for governor, setting up a possible fight with Gov. Pat Quinn for the Democratic nomination next year. 

 BODY:
CHICAGO - William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff to President Obama, announced on Tuesday that he was exploring a bid for governor of Illinois, setting up a possible fight with Gov. Patrick J. Quinn for the Democratic nomination next year. 
In a video on his Web site, Mr. Daley criticized Mr. Quinn, who has said he will seek re-election in 2014, and other Illinois lawmakers for not using a legislative session that ended last month to address major issues, including a pension crisis that has crippled the state's bond ratings. 
"Our state needed a productive legislative session, but what happened?" Mr. Daley asked. "Pension reform failed again, marriage equality died at the last minute, protecting our kids from illegal guns - another joke." 
Emphasizing Illinois's financial troubles, he later added, "We can no longer stand idly by while our pension debt bankrupts our schools and robs our children of a better future."
Mr. Daley, a former banker and a commerce secretary in the Clinton administration - and the son and brother of longtime Chicago mayors - also spoke about his 2011 tenure in Washington, where he said gridlock in Congress led Mr. Obama to take matters into his own hands, with executive actions, on stalled issues. 
"We need that same urgency in Illinois," Mr. Daley said. "We can't wait for the legislature to get well on its own. We need a governor who takes the field, takes command and gets things done."
A run by Mr. Daley has been a subject of speculation here for some time, as Republican candidates have started lining up to challenge Mr. Quinn, who is considered to be vulnerable. 
Another Democrat, Lisa Madigan, the state attorney general and daughter of the powerful Illinois House speaker, Michael J. Madigan, is also thinking about jumping into the race. It is unclear when she might make that decision. 
Candidates have until Dec. 2 to file for the March 2014 primary election.

HEADLINE: But for the Grace of Social Security

BYLINE: TERESA TRITCH


HIGHLIGHT: The reality of dismally low savings has turned conventional retirement advice on its head &#8211; and, in the process, highlighted the vital importance of Social Security. 

 BODY:
Back in the 1980s and 1990s, when it was still possible to believe that steady investments in 401(k) plans would lead to a comfortable retirement, the notion took hold that the best way to pay for old age was to leave your tax-deferred plan untouched for as long as possible, allowing it to grow into a formidable nest egg. 
It still makes sense to save as much as you can during your work life. But the idea that you should hold off breaking into your account even after you're retired no longer makes sense for most people, if it ever did. 401(k)s have largely failed to generate sums anywhere near sufficient for secure retirements. Long stretches of wage stagnation, high unemployment and widespread underemployment have made it impossible for many people to save for tomorrow while surviving today, and serial stock market busts, repeated financial crises, high fees and prolonged low interest rates have devastated what savings many people had.
Today, less than half of households aged 55 to 64 have retirement savings, and of them, half have less than $120,000.

The reality of dismally low savings has turned conventional retirement advice on its head - and, in the process, highlighted the vital importance of Social Security.
A recent research paper from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College shows that, today, the best deal for many people with modest 401(k)s is to live off those low balances in the early years of retirement and to delay claiming Social Security. That's because monthly Social Security benefits are higher the later benefits are claimed.
You get bigger benefits at your full retirement age - 66 for people born from 1943 to 1954, rising to 67 for people born in 1960 or later - than you do if you claim them early.
In addition, for each year you delay taking benefits beyond your full retirement age, up to age 70, you earn a bonus.
Monthly benefits are 8 percent higher if claimed at age 67, rather than age 66, and 32 percent higher if claimed at 70. For example, if your monthly benefit would be $2,000 a month if claimed at 66, it would be $2,160 at 67 and $2,640 at 70.
That's an attractive return in any case, and especially now, when interest rates are at rock bottom.
What is truly stunning, however, is that retirement experts are saying that the best use of modest retirement sums is to spend them in the near term, in effect buying time for one's Social Security benefit to grow.
There is a larger lesson in that: If Social Security is strategically important for those with 401(k)s, it is obviously indispensable for the majority who have little or no retirement savings. Benefits need to be preserved and enhanced, not cut.

HEADLINE: Thrilling New Chance to Get Queasy Is Planned for Coney Island

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A replacement for the Thunderbolt roller coaster will carry riders up to 65 miles an hour in various directions and open next year, the city announced. 

 BODY:
It won't exactly be THE Thunderbolt, but it will definitely be the Thunderbolt: The city announced on Tuesday that a new roller coaster would open on Coney Island next year on the site of the old Thunderbolt, the roller coaster that once rivaled the Cyclone and makes a famous appearance in "Annie Hall." 
The new Thunderbolt, to be built and operated by the owner of (the new) Luna Park at Coney Island near West 16th Street, will be faster, taller and longer than the Cyclone, if less lovably rickety.
The whole ride will be 125 feet tall and more than a third of a mile long, and riders will be pulled up 110 feet and dropped down into a series of "elements and inversions" at speeds up to 65 miles an hour, according to the city's Economic Development Corporation.
"The ride will then make its return through a series of 'bunny hills' that will give riders a floating sensation until the train returns," the city said in a news release. More renderings can be seen here. 
The original Thunderbolt operated on the site from 1925 until 1982 and was torn down by the Giuliani administration - illegally, a federal jury found - in 2000.
The house below the Thunderbolt, the fictional childhood home of Alvy Singer in "Annie Hall," burned down in 1991. There are no plans to rebuild it.

HEADLINE: Insurers Inflating Books, New York Regulator Says

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: New York regulators say life insurers are putting policyholders at risk and could cause another taxpayer bailout. 

 BODY:
New York State regulators are calling for a nationwide moratorium on transactions that life insurers are using to alter their books by billions of dollars, saying that the deals put policyholders at risk and could lead to another taxpayer bailout.
Insurers' use of the secretive transactions has become widespread, nearly doubling over the last five years. The deals now affect life insurance policies worth trillions of dollars, according to an analysis done for The New York Times by SNL Financial, a research and data firm.
 These complex private deals allow the companies to describe themselves as richer and stronger than they otherwise could in their communications with regulators, stockholders, the ratings agencies and customers, who often rely on ratings to buy insurance.
Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's superintendent of financial services, said that life insurers based in New York had alone burnished their books by $48 billion, using what he called "shadow insurance," according to an investigation conducted by his department. He issued a report about the investigation late Tuesday. 
The transactions are so opaque that Mr. Lawsky said it took his team of investigators nearly a year to follow the paper trail, even though they had the power to subpoena documents.
Insurance is regulated by the states, and Mr. Lawsky said his investigators found that life insurers in New York were seeking out states with looser regulations and setting up shell companies there for the deals. They then used those states' tight secrecy laws to avoid scrutiny by the New York State regulators.
Insurance regulation is based squarely on the concept of solvency - the idea that future claims can be predicted fairly accurately and that each insurer should track them and keep enough reserves on hand to pay all of them. The states have detailed rules for what types of assets reserves can be invested in. Companies are also expected to keep a little more than they really expect to need - called their surplus - as a buffer against unexpected events. State regulators monitor the reserves and surpluses of companies and make sure none fall short.
Mr. Lawsky said that because the transactions made companies look richer than they otherwise would, some were diverting reserves to other uses, like executive compensation or stockholder dividends.
The most frequent use, he said, was to artificially increase companies' risk-based capital ratios, an important measurement of solvency that was instituted after a series of life-insurance failures and near misses in the 1980s.
Mr. Lawsky said he was struck by similarities between what the life insurers were doing now and the issuing of structured mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008.
"Those practices were used to water down capital buffers, as well as temporarily boost quarterly profits and stock prices," Mr. Lawsky said. "And ultimately, those practices left those very same companies on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars in losses from risks hidden in the shadows, and led to a multitrillion-dollar taxpayer bailout."
The transactions at issue are modeled after reinsurance, a business in which an insurance company pays another company, a reinsurer, to take over some of its obligations to pay claims. Reinsurance is widely used and is considered beneficial because it allows insurers to spread their risks and remain stable as they grow. Conventional reinsurance deals are negotiated at arm's length by independent companies; both sides understand the risk and can agree on a fair price for covering it. The obligations drop off the original insurer's books because the reinsurer has picked them up.
Mr. Lawsky's investigators found, though, that life insurance groups, including some of the best known, were creating their own shell companies in other states or countries - outside the regulators' view - and saying that these so-called captives were selling them reinsurance. The value of policies reinsured through all affiliates, including captives, rose to $5.46 trillion in 2012, from $2.82 trillion in 2007.
The chief problem with captive reinsurance, Mr. Lawsky said, is that the risk is not being transferred to an independent reinsurer. Also, the deal is not at arm's length. And confidentiality rules make it difficult to see what secures the obligations.
The New York State investigators subpoenaed this information and discovered that some states were approving deals backed by assets that would not be allowed in New York; Mr. Lawsky referred to "hollow assets," "naked parental guarantees" and "conditional letters of credit."
"Weaker collateral requirements mean the policyholders are at greater risk," he said.
Insurers, unlike banks, have no prepaid fund like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to make customers whole in the event of a collapse. That's why Mr. Lawsky said he feared that taxpayers might have to be called to the rescue again.
Because New York has standing to investigate only life insurers based in the state, the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is calling for other states, or the federal government, to "conduct similar investigations, to document a more complete picture of the full extent of shadow insurance written nationwide."
Until then, Mr. Lawsky said, the deals should not be permitted. New York State has already stopped approving them, but other states have not.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has been examining the same type of transactions, but its members are sharply divided about their potential risk and what, if anything, to do about it. The group's proposals must be adopted by 42 state legislatures to become effective. That seems unlikely; many states have recently passed laws allowing the formation of captives. Gov. Rick Perry made Texas the latest contender for the business when he signed such a law this month.
A new federal entity created under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Federal Insurance Office, has also been monitoring the trend and is scheduled to discuss possible federal responses at an advisory committee meeting on Wednesday. Any federal action would be fought hard by the states, which have regulated insurance for more than 150 years.
New York's investigators could not disclose which companies are the biggest users of reinsurance through captives because of the secrecy laws of other states. Their report did describe some of the transactions in detail, but with the names of the companies removed.
The separate analysis by SNL Financial, by contrast, was based on public regulatory filings. It did identify the life insurance companies that are the biggest users of the transactions, both in and out of New York. They include Transamerica, MetLife, Prudential, Hartford, Genworth, John Hancock, ReliaStar and Lincoln National, among others. Another insurer, Allstate, turned up in the sample even though its primary business is property and casualty, because it owns some life insurers.
The big users generally appear to be publicly traded companies, which have to meet Wall Street's expectations for earnings growth and returns on capital. Life insurers that are owned by their policyholders, called mutual companies, do not have that pressure, and some, like State Farm, Guardian and New York Life, appear not to be reinsuring through captives at all.
MetLife said in a statement Tuesday that it "holds more than sufficient reserves to pay claims on its policies" and added that it used reinsurance subsidiaries "as a cost-effective way of addressing overly conservative reserving requirements" for certain insurance products. If it had to set aside that level of reserves more conventionally, it said, it would either have to borrow - putting its credit rating at risk - or raise the money by selling stock, dragging its returns below the level its stockholders require.
"Access to reinsurance subsidiaries significantly reduces costs to policyholders and in some cases is necessary to enable insurers to continue to offer certain coverage," MetLife said.
Prudential said in a statement, "Our captives are capitalized to a level consistent with 'AA' financial strength rating targets of our issuing insurance entities." It said that many of its captive reinsurance transactions were done in Prudential's own home state, New Jersey, so the same regulators could see both ends of the deals.
In other cases, Prudential said it reinsured obligations through a captive entity in Arizona, Pruco Re, whose reserves were "subject to asset adequacy testing by our actuaries." The company said these practices were disclosed to investors.
Other companies using this type of reinsurance said their transactions had been reviewed and approved by regulators, and helped them use capital efficiently. They also said the practice allowed them to charge lower prices, and in some cases made it possible to keep selling types of insurance that would otherwise have been discontinued. They also said it was appropriate to support their captives with contingent letters of credit in cases where the likelihood of big payouts was remote.
The Hartford said that it had sold its life insurance business to Prudential, and was no longer in the business of writing new life policies and reinsuring them.
Allstate said that captives and special-purpose vehicles were "a minor part of Allstate's reinsurance business."
SNL Financial's data also made it possible to see which states are courting the transactions most eagerly - Vermont, South Carolina, Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa and Missouri.
"If we let our guard down and ignore this regulatory race to the bottom, taxpayers and insurance policyholders are the ones who could get left holding the bag," Mr. Lawsky said in his report.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, Interest Rates Are Rising

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The interest rate charged by lenders has been going down for most of the time since the early 1980s, but there are signs that will not last. 

 BODY:
It has been a reliable fact of life for investors, corporations and ordinary borrowers: interest rates, for the most part, keep heading lower.
But all of that may be about to change. For prospective homeowners, the cost of mortgages has been going up in recent weeks. Governments are also facing the prospect of higher borrowing costs down the road, and they are projecting increases to their debt burdens. Savers with money in bank accounts, on the other hand, have the prospect of finally earning more than a pittance on their deposits.
 The interest rate charged by lenders, often cited as the single most important factor behind economic decisions, has been steadily going down for most of the time since the early 1980s, and has fallen to historical lows since the financial crisis. Over the last few months, though, investors and banks have been demanding higher payments for their loans, pushing up interest rates and bond yields.
The first tremors have been felt most sharply on investment products that were reliant on low rates, like bonds issued by American companies. But the movement is quickly spreading out into the real economy. 
"I think you all should be ready, because rates are going to go up," Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told a financial industry conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday.
As investors brace themselves for a new era of higher interest rates, global markets in bonds, currencies and stocks have experienced spasms of turmoil. On Tuesday, the catalyst for the market's volatility was disappointment over the Bank of Japan's decision not to take new steps to address rising bond yields. That heightened worries that other central banks - the Federal Reserve in particular - will soon pull back on pumping money into the financial system.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed has taken unprecedented steps to reduce rates, in an effort to stimulate borrowing and economic growth and bring down the unemployment rate. Recently, though, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, signaled that the central bank could scale back its efforts in coming months if the economy improved. But there is much debate on Wall Street over what Mr. Bernanke is planning and when it might take shape.
Several prominent money managers say they believe that the economic recovery is weakening, which will make it impossible for Mr. Bernanke to pare the central bank's intervention and could lead to falling rates again. Interest rates have experienced temporary spikes a number of times in recent decades before heading back down.
But recent economic reports, including last Friday's job report, suggest that the economy is slowly recovering.
In anticipation of what the Fed may do, many on Wall Street have been preparing their portfolios for a future in which interest rates do not remain at the low levels of the last few years. In a survey of 500 large investors, 43 percent said they were planning to cut back on their exposure to bonds this year, while only 16 percent are planning to increase it, according to the asset manager Natixis.
The recent efforts to adjust to higher bond yields have already been messy. Investors have been piling out of supposedly safe bond funds that have been a source of reliable returns in recent years, creating unexpected volatility in the markets.
Big American asset managers who borrowed money to buy foreign stocks and bonds have recently been selling those holdings, hurting markets around the world. That has been worsened by data suggesting that economic growth may be slowing outside the United States.
The realignment in the markets was evident on Tuesday as Asian and European stock markets fell. In the United States, stocks swung widely, with the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closing down 1.02 percent. Treasury prices fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note as high as 2.29 percent - its highest level since April 2012 - before settling at 2.19 percent. The Japanese yen strengthened 2.8 percent against the dollar.
Many market specialists say they think that a transition could go more smoothly in the long run if interest rates continue to rise as the United States economy grows. Still, even in that optimistic situation, a wide array of market participants will have to shift their operating procedures and assumptions from a world where declining interest rates were a given.
"When past performance has been so consistent, the risk that investors underestimate the risk, I think has consistently been an issue," said Richard Ketchum, the president of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees brokers.
The recent market volatility highlights the connection between Wall Street investors and consumers. Banks set mortgage rates in line with the yields on mortgage-backed bonds, for example. So as a sell-off has hit the market for such bonds, causing their yields to rise, ordinary borrowers end up paying more.
The rising cost of a new mortgage has already pushed down the number of people refinancing old mortgages, putting a crimp on a recent source of extra income for many households.
The looming question now is whether higher mortgage rates could stall the rally in home prices that has been taking place across the country.
Many real estate analysts say that homes are so affordable that even a considerable rise in interest rates would not do much to undermine the housing recovery, especially if the economy is growing at a healthy rate.
"There's no strong correlation between interest rates and home prices," said Douglas Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae.
But Joshua Rosner, a managing director at the research company Graham Fisher & Company, said many Americans were still so heavily indebted that even a small rise in mortgage rates would hit the housing market. "Affordability is already a problem, and rising rates won't help that," he said.
For governments around the world, a rise in rates will eventually push up their borrowing costs at a time when they may still be grappling with fiscal deficits. Some countries will probably be able to take a steady increase in their stride. But a jarring wave of selling has recently hit certain bond markets in Latin America and Europe, pushing up borrowing costs for governments there.
Recent market moves have also been an unpleasant jolt for ordinary savers who have come to view bonds as a stable anchor for any retirement account. The Vanguard total bond market mutual fund fell 2.7 percent last month after returning a steady 5.4 percent a year since 2008. Funds holding junk bonds, which were one of the hottest investments in recent years, have suffered even more.
Some managers argue that the important thing is to shift between different types of bonds, de-emphasizing longer-term, government-issued bonds. But whatever the mix, it is likely that bonds will present a risk to investors that they have not in recent history.
"There's no doubt we're living through the end of a generational bull market in bonds," said Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong, a Strange Place to Seek Freedom

BYLINE: By LAW YUK-kai. 
Law Yuk-kai is the director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, an advocacy group.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Edward J. Snowden, the 29-year-old government contractor who blew the whistle on the American government's vast data-collection efforts, was last seen checking out of a boutique hotel here on Monday. The previous day, he released a video defending his decision to leak sensitive secrets and explaining that he'd sought refuge in Hong Kong because it ''has a strong tradition of free speech'' and ''a long tradition of protesting in the streets.''
This news stunned many local residents, especially those of us who advocate for human rights. Since 1997, when the British government returned Hong Kong to China after getting assurances that this former colony's traditions of rule of law and individual freedom would be respected, the political, legal and human rights landscape here has become ever less conducive to the protection of civil liberties. Mr. Snowden -- if he is still in town -- has stepped into an unknown future in which the concept of ''one nation, two systems,'' promised us by Beijing, has become a fading memory. 
Whether it was youthful naïveté or just ignorance, Mr. Snowden's positive view of Hong Kong no longer matches the reality. Shortly before his arrival, the international organization Freedom House ranked Hong Kong 71st in the world in protection of political rights and civil liberties. Reporters Without Borders has dropped Hong Kong on its ranking of press freedom to No. 58, from No. 18 in 2002.
Mr. Snowden's initial choice of Hong Kong as a place of refuge may not have been entirely illogical. Here, he met with two journalists from The Guardian and a documentary filmmaker. Hong Kong remains a hub of the global media, not least because of its proximity to the economic boom in southern China and the ease of access to many other Asian cities. The publicity could complicate efforts by the United States to charge Mr. Snowden and have him deported.
But the local coverage of Mr. Snowden's case, which has largely ranged from bemused to unsympathetic, helps underscore the erosion of press freedom since 1997. A poll conducted last month by the Public Opinion Program of the University of Hong Kong found that nearly half (48 percent) of respondents believed that the local news media practiced self-censorship. These readers are on to something. More than one-third (36 percent) of media employees responding to a survey by the Hong Kong Journalists Association in April and May 2012 said that they or their supervisors had practiced self-censorship in the past 12 months.
This should be no surprise, since many local media owners have business interests in mainland China that they need to protect. Many of them have even accepted various honorary political titles in the People's Republic of China, even though doing so poses an obvious conflict of interest, in perception if not reality.
If Mr. Snowden is still here, he needs to know that he is now on a special piece of ''autonomous'' Chinese soil -- a legal limbo where police officers had not long ago restrained and detained a journalist who posed questions to visiting Chinese leaders related to the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989, effectively blocking him from covering his story. The government has denied journalists access to important events and increased the flow of state-sanctioned news reports to media entities staffed by ''official reporters.''
In 1984, when Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping negotiated the gradual, peaceful transfer of Hong Kong from Britain to China, the Beijing government promised a high degree of political autonomy and maintenance of the rule of law -- one of the best legacies of 155 years of colonial rule. The gradual erosion of that legacy, and the uphill battle that civil liberties advocates have had to fight each year, has been one of the most dispiriting developments since the transfer and means that Mr. Snowden's position, if he is still here, is tenuous.
Hong Kong has autonomy in its immigration policy, but foreign affairs and national defense are the responsibilities of the central government in Beijing.
Although China is a party to the Refugee Convention of 1951, its protections were never extended to Hong Kong, and so there is no legal right, per se, for foreign nationals seeking asylum here. The United States and Hong Kong have a bilateral extradition treaty, and American federal prosecutors are reported to be preparing charges against Mr. Snowden.
However, foreigners may still approach the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here and seek asylum and resettlement elsewhere. (Mr. Snowden mentioned Iceland as one possible destination.) Mr. Snowden, if he faced imminent arrest, could also apply to the Hong Kong government against any orders to remove him to a place where he might face cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. (Given the treatment of Pfc. Bradley Manning, the WikiLeaks whistle-blower, Mr. Snowden would have at least a plausible case.)
Contrary to media reports, these protections offer a possibility, however slender, that the local judiciary -- whose members were largely trained under the British system and have shown admirable independence -- might protect him. It's not clear if any crimes Mr. Snowden might have committed would have been crimes under Hong Kong law -- a prerequisite for extradition. The United States might also have to promise not to impose capital punishment on Mr. Snowden -- which could be a major sticking point. Finally, our judges would have to make sure that any removal proceedings would be consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which our judges (unlike their American counterparts) take seriously.
All that said, Beijing holds the cards. In 2004, a Libyan dissident, Sami al-Saadi, and his family were reportedly detained by the Hong Kong authorities and forced back to Libya, without due process of law. Mr. Saadi complained that American and British intelligence officers took part in his forcible repatriation. He was subsequently subjected to torture and inhumane treatment. He has sued both the British and Hong Kong governments.
Our judiciary, however vital, has its limits. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal is our highest court. But if a court case is understood to involve the Basic Law -- the quasi-constitution of Hong Kong -- the court can request from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, a political organ in Beijing, a reinterpretation of the Basic Law. China may also initiate its own request for interpretation -- bypassing the judiciary entirely, though such pre-emptive action, in this case, could be bad for Beijing's image, as it could be seen as caving in to American demands, especially so soon after last week's summit meeting between President Obama and China's president, Xi Jinping.
These legal distinctions may seem confusing -- and they confuse even Hong Kongers. They also explain why the United Nations Human Rights Committee has expressed concerns that such a ''mechanism of binding constitutional interpretation by a nonjudicial body may weaken and undermine the rule of law and the independence of judiciary'' in Hong Kong.
Mr. Snowden may have left Hong Kong, or be on his way out. Nevertheless, because he has shared, even briefly, in the legal uncertainties Hong Kongers have experienced since 1997, his case might at least draw greater international attention to the precarious state of individual freedoms here.

HEADLINE: 2 Weeks In, Bike-Share Program Is Hitting Snags

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER; Randy Leonard contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Judged by the numbers, New York City's fledgling bike-share program might be viewed as a rousing success.
After two weeks, more than 170,000 trips have been taken. Annual memberships have exceeded 36,000. No serious injuries have been reported.
But the Bloomberg administration has refused to quantify, or even elaborate on, the rash of problems plaguing its system, which has had technical errors of a magnitude never experienced by bike-share programs in other major American cities.
Many docking stations have proved temperamental, refusing to accept bikes or process credit card information. Others have at times shut down altogether. On some occasions, passers-by have been able to pull a bike from a station without paying, probably because the last user was unable to lock it back in place. Some riders have grown weary of testing individual bike docks in search of one that works, pedaling off to another station before the system eventually allowed them to end their trip.
And when these riders have called to complain, they have been put on hold for 45 minutes or more. 
In a city where first impressions can quickly harden into lasting judgments, the setbacks threaten to sully what has been billed as a legacy-making transportation policy of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- leaving even the scheme's most vocal proponents alarmed by how the program's software seems ill prepared to handle public demand.
''I think it's the best thing that's happened to the city in a long time,'' said Abe Stanway, 23, a data engineer from Fort Greene, Brooklyn. ''But it hasn't proven itself to be reliable if I really need to be on time.''
After his latest problem with faulty docks in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn on Monday, Mr. Stanway said he decided to commute by private bike again for the foreseeable future.
The city's Transportation Department has sought to minimize these issues, referring to them as inevitable kinks. Compared with the number of trips taken each day, the city said that incidents were infrequent and appeared to be diminishing, though officials would not provide a more detailed estimate of breakdowns in the system. Seth Solomonow, a spokesman for the department, suggested last week that riders' own inexperience with the system was contributing to their troubles.
But a survey of programs in other cities makes clear that New York's problems lie with its system, not its users. Officials in Washington and Boston said that even in their programs' infancies, they never had station failures like New York's or widespread difficulties with docking.
Those cities also use New York's chosen operator, Alta Bicycle Share, based in Oregon, but have software from a company called 8D Technologies. Alta's partner based in Montreal, Public Bike System Company, has since severed ties with 8D, and chose to develop its own software before the introduction of the New York system.
New York's program was expected to begin last summer, but faced delays because, as Mayor Bloomberg put it last August, ''the software doesn't work.'' (Flooding from Hurricane Sandy postponed the program further, amid damage to equipment stored at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during the storm.)
In January, records show, Alta filed a lawsuit in an Oregon circuit court against Public Bike System Company, saying it delivered ''nonconforming goods and faulty goods'' to New York's bike-share program. Alta said this week that the suit was never served and that the groups remained partners.
The other city using the new software is Chattanooga, Tenn., where a bike program began last summer. Philip Pugliese, the bicycle coordinator there, said in an interview that the city had experienced a spate of docking problems. But with only 300 bikes and about 30 stations, Mr. Pugliese said, ''we could manage any customer service issues at the local level.''
In New York, with 6,000 bikes at more than 300 stations, gaps in the system have proved more difficult to patch. Stations are both solar- and battery-powered, with the strength of their charges dependent on factors like weather and use rates for bikes, as well as the adjoining touch-screen device. Accordingly, a beautiful day is both a blessing and a curse: The sun can help sustain a station, but ideal riding conditions beget heavy use, which can drain batteries.
As riders have sought to report problems since the opening, a customer service phone line has repeatedly failed. Station information provided by an app has often been unreliable, riders said, and many annual subscribers have still not received their membership keys.
Mr. Solomonow said the program had been rescinding overage charges when riders were unable to dock a bike, though it was not clear how the system could distinguish between riders who struggled to return bikes and those who simply rode for too long.
Officials also said this week that the customer service center's capacity had been doubled, but even this bit of progress was met with some skepticism.
''Focus more on fixing your software and equipment malfunctions,'' one man wrote on the Citi Bike Facebook page on Monday, ''and then you will have far fewer calls and e-mails to customer service.''
Since the program began, on Memorial Day, the Facebook page has been host to several squabbles, dividing program loyalists preaching patience from others whose displeasure with the problems has already reached a boiling point.
''To all who are kvetching about the kvetching: Citi Bike was clearly unprepared, and it's taken them way too long to acknowledge it,'' one man wrote on the system's Facebook page. ''I am proud to be an early adopter/beta tester,'' another said. ''Hiccup city.''
Janette Sadik-Khan, the city's transportation commissioner, said that ''every new bike-share system has had an adjustment period,'' adding that the scale of New York's program ''is like nowhere else.''
Yet for a program built on the notion of self-reliant travel and predictable commute times, the daily uncertainty of the docking system has undercut part of cycling's very appeal.
''We feel in control,'' Charles Komanoff, a transportation economist and longtime cycling advocate, said of bike commuting. ''If you don't have that with bike share, then it's never going to fulfill its true potential.''
And yet, amid the chorus of complaints about station locations and reckless cycling habits, the city is teeming with those who hope the program does.
On Sunday, Erin Stabile, 23, walked more than a mile from the Upper East Side to a rack near 58th Street and Second Avenue, disinclined to spend any part of a picturesque day inside a darkened subway tunnel.
When she arrived, she said, the station was out of service. She walked west to another hub, where she was able to check out a bike, and rode to a station near the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, which would not allow her to return it. She found a working station a few blocks away, at Ashland Place and Hanson Place, and later rode back from there to the station at East 58th Street, which again refused to cooperate. ''I'm an idiot,'' Ms. Stabile said, walking toward a working kiosk on Third Avenue.
Though it would have been nice if the station were fixed, she explained, she should have known better.

HEADLINE: Using Humor to Get a Little Respect for Faster Play

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
ARDMORE, Pa. -- For years, golf has struggled with its image as a fuddy-duddy sport for the elite that is, above all things, very, very slow.
But now, the United States Golf Association, the most serious-minded group in an often humorless golf community, has decided to embrace the game's most comic and caustic critic, the very one whose satire helped create the stereotypes that once made the golf establishment bristle.
In an attempt to shake golf out of its slow-playing doldrums, those who help run golf will unveil a new campaign Wednesday celebrating ''Caddyshack,'' the raucous 1980 movie headlined by the working-class comedian Rodney Dangerfield that lampooned golf's stuffy country club reputation.
More than four million golfers have given up golf in recent years, and the primary culprit, researchers say, is the tedious pace of play. Desperate for a solution, golf's leaders, on the eve of this week's national championship, have turned to ''Caddyshack,'' resurrecting one of Dangerfield's zingers in the film and making it the linchpin for a campaign aimed at rescuing the game. 
The centerpiece of the videos and the faster-play movement is the line Dangerfield's movie character shouts as he watches his antagonist, Judge Smails, fidget, twitch and delay as he prepares to hit a tee shot.
''Let's go,'' Dangerfield says. ''While we're young.''
The U.S.G.A. initiative includes five comedic 30-second videos starring Tiger Woods, Clint Eastwood, Arnold Palmer and the L.P.G.A. champions Annika Sorenstam and Paula Creamer. Woods is seen painstakingly pausing over a putt as he might at this week's United States Open. A wider camera angle reveals he is instead at a miniature golf course where children waiting behind him yell: ''Hey, while we're young.''
Palmer says the same thing as Eastwood overthinks a shot standing along the ocean, drawing one of Eastwood's best Dirty Harry-like stares. Sorenstam and Creamer are seen laboring over how to best deliver Dangerfield's renowned line, an impersonation that includes tugging on an imaginary tie, Dangerfield style.
''People start playing golf because they think it will be fun,'' said Rand Jerris, a U.S.G.A. managing director who has been leading the organization's pace-of-play strategy. ''It's discouraging if people are leaving because it isn't. So we have to intentionally restore an element of fun.''
But the long-term consequences for the golf industry are serious. According to polling done by the National Golf Foundation, more than 70 percent of golfers believe pace of play has worsened lately and half have admitted to walking off the course in frustration during a marathon round.
The U.S.G.A. is not alone in its attempts to get people to move along more quickly. A nonprofit group called the Three/45 Golf Association -- so named for how long a swift round should take (as opposed to the five hours it can now take) -- has gathered golf course owners, golf architects, manufacturers and golfers to develop a pace-of-play manifesto. Last month, Golf Digest magazine joined with the P.G.A. of America and the U.S.G.A. for its ''Time for Nine'' campaign, which encourages golfers to consider playing only nine holes because it might be more suited to modern, overcrowded schedules.
Lucius Riccio, a Columbia University business and engineering professor who also teaches a class in sports analytics, founded the Three/45 Association and has used scientific methods to analyze the causes of slow play.
''It's a very complex issue -- more involved than people think -- but it's got to be solved at the grass roots,'' said Riccio, who conceded that he had recently walked off a course when he grew tired of waiting.
The U.S.G.A. videos, which are more like public service announcements, come less a month after the organization took a widely debated stand against the use of anchored putting strokes. Both moves appear to be part of a strategic transformation for the U.S.G.A., a 118-year-old organization that has been criticized in the past for its distant, or arbitrary, governance. Composing comic videos aimed at tackling an industry problem, and doing it with the help of some of the game's biggest names is a bold step.
''If being innovative in a fun way is different than the U.S.G.A. of the past, then so be it,'' said Glen D. Nager, the organization's president. ''We have to get people's attention to mobilize. We're not using our bully pulpit to lecture but to engage them and ask them to join us.''
The videos are meant to be the jumping off point in a ''While We're Young'' campaign, as each skit directs people to a newly created Web site that asks golfers and golf facility managers to sign a pledge to improve pace of play. Completing that step leads to a pace of play education program and a resource center on best practices for golf courses to address hole length and routing, green speeds and the height of rough -- all pivotal factors influencing the pace of play.
As much as the videos released Wednesday focus on the role of the player in the slow play issue, the U.S.G.A.'s research has revealed that other parts of the golf experience outside the players' control contribute greatly.
Most significant might be the intervals that golf course managers send groups off the first tee. Hoping to maximize revenue, it is not unusual for courses to cram the course with golfers, sending them off every eight minutes. But as Jerris pointed out, the initial par 3 on a course is the usual telltale bottleneck spot, bringing everyone to a temporary halt as groups take on average 12 to 13 minutes to play the hole.
Research has shown that if golf courses sent golfers off the first tee at an interval equal to how long it takes to play the first par-3 hole, then flow around the golf course would be more smooth. That might keep more golfers happily coming back to the course, which would have long-term economic benefit.
But can golf's leaders sell that concept to the public? Perhaps with the help of Dangerfield, who died in 2004, but whose ''Caddyshack'' lines live on.
''We needed a rallying cry,'' Nager said. ''We wanted to give people something to say. Like, 'Let's go, while we're young. While we're still here.' ''

HEADLINE: Business Picked Up in April For Wholesalers, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American wholesalers increased their stockpiles in April, and their sales rebounded from a big decline in March, positive signs for economic growth.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that stockpiles at the wholesale level rose 0.2 percent in April. That followed a 0.3 percent gain in March. 
Sales in April increased 0.5 percent, the best showing since February. In March, sales plunged 1.4 percent.
The April increase left stockpiles at the wholesale level at $504.8 billion, up 4.1 percent from a year ago and 31.2 percent above the recession low.
An increase in restocking can drive more economic growth because it indicates companies are ordering more goods from American factories.
The April gain was led by a 1.9 percent increase in restocking of autos and auto parts. Stockpiles of furniture, lumber and computer equipment also posted solid gains.
Inventories of machinery, farm products and chemicals were down in April.
The economy grew at a 2.4 percent rate annual from January through March, up from a 0.4 percent rate in the previous quarter.
Growth accelerated in the first quarter largely because consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in more than two years. That also provided more incentive for businesses to restock shelves after many cut back on inventory-building at the end of last year.
Many economists suspect that growth has slowed in the current April-June quarter, to an annual rate of 2 percent or less. Economists say part of that reflects a slowdown in production at American factories, stemming from weakness overseas that has dampened demand for exports. Some economists also say businesses could be worried about the impact of federal spending cuts.
A stronger job market has helped offset some of the weakness from the spending cuts and higher payroll taxes.

HEADLINE: Whoa, the Apocalypse. We're Still Buds, Right?

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''This Is the End'' -- in more ways than one. The premise of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's new movie -- a foul-mouthed, good-natured ''Funny or Die'' sketch stretched to feature length and garnished with special effects -- is that the apocalypse is here. As a bunch of funny guys gather at a party in Los Angeles, events foretold in the Book of Revelation come to pass. The righteous are raptured up to heaven, while the rest (or at least most of the famous people in Hollywood) are swallowed up in fiery pits that open up in the ground, or pursued by scaly, oily, horned demons with enormous genitals. 
The end of the world is a hot topic at the movies these days, and there is no shortage of commentary linking this trend to anxiety about global warming, economic crisis, overconsumption and other scary real-life phenomena. But the allegorical significance of ''This Is the End'' may lie closer to home, in the creative exhaustion of its makers and the popular, profitable strain of humor they represent. The film, at its phoned-in worst and also at its riotous best, has a terminal feeling. It suggests that a comic subgenre based on the immaturity, sexual panic and self-mocking tendencies of men who should be old enough to know better has reached its expiration date.
This is not to say that there will be no more movies in which a bunch of dudes smoke weed, crack wise and give voice to their blatant terror of women and their covert homoerotic longings. As long as those things keep happening in the world, they will find expression in movies and on television. But maybe with diminishing insight and increasing cynicism. ''The Hangover Part III,'' which recently wrapped up the least self-aware, most lucrative cycle of contemporary man-child comedies, is already a zombie, a brain-dead thing kept in frenzied motion by autonomic reflexes and instinctive appetites, mostly for your money.
''This Is the End'' is quite a bit better than ''The Hangover Part III,'' and in places it is genuinely, even sublimely hilarious. Why shouldn't it be? It assembles a talented, quick-tongued bunch of performers and happily dispenses with the pretense that they are playing anything other than themselves. The fake-doc aesthetic that rules so much television these days is used to witty effect as we are invited to hang out with Mr. Rogen, James Franco and some other famous pals, whose lives turn out to be exactly what we might have expected, based on some of their earlier movies.
Seth -- I'll dispense with honorifics when referring to the characters; we're all buds around here -- is insecure and eager to please. James is a little on the pretentious side, which kind of bothers Jay (Baruchel), who has come to California to visit Seth. Their friendship stretches back to younger days in Canada, and Jay doesn't really get along with the Hollywood crowd Seth has been running with since his career took flight under the wing of Judd Apatow. Nonetheless, after a blissful, bro-y day spent getting high and playing video games, Seth drags Jay to a party at James's house, which serves as a Brueghel-esque tableau of modern celebrity. There's Rihanna! And Paul Rudd! Jason Segel! Michael Cera!
Also Jonah (Hill) and Craig (Robinson), who, along with Jay, Seth and James, make up a hardy band of survivors when the divine wrath really hits the fan. They are joined eventually by Danny (McBride) and Emma (Watson), who is around long enough to make you realize that the Harry Potter movies were basically a British version of ''Freaks and Geeks'' and to raise a question that has been burning up the Internet for years: can rape jokes ever be funny?
''This Is the End'' suggests that they can at least sometimes be harmless, and as crude as the movie's humor often is, its spirit is sweet, sensitive and innocuous. In their script for ''Superbad,'' Mr. Rogen and Mr. Goldberg zeroed in on the tenderness and vulnerability that lie at the heart of male friendship, and here they go even further, using the prospect of global annihilation as an occasion for some touchy-feely relationship workshopping.
The engine driving the plot -- apart from the biblical apocalypse, which is as literal a deus ex machina as you could wish for -- is Jay's jealousy. He resents Seth's new friends, and perhaps also his greater success. Once the two of them are locked in James's gaudy, modernist Hollywood mansion, this issue continues to simmer, and is intensified by the personality quirks of the other survivors. Craig's moodiness, Jonah's passive-aggressive tendencies, James's arrogance and Danny's jovial lack of consideration cause friction that is, notwithstanding the fireballs and murderous demons, quite realistic. So, in a way, are the squabbles that ensue, including an angry debate between James and Danny on the ethics of ejaculating on someone else's stuff.
That conversation -- which made me laugh louder than just about anything since the naked wrestling match in ''Borat'' -- may be a metaphor for the rivalry and intimacy that bond youngish, Y-chromosome-endowed actors and comedians these days. But a deeper and more troubling metaphor may be the house itself, which represents the limitations of an insular, exclusive and increasingly self-cannibalizing comic imagination. The problem is not that Seth and Jay and the rest are still rolling joints and trying out naughty material on one another in the comfort of their ever-larger and plusher homes. The problem is that they seem to be motivated, more and more, by professional duty and brand awareness. Solipsism has turned into shtick, and their childish interest in themselves betrays a confining lack of curiosity about anything else.
I think they know it's time to move on, and ''This Is the End'' is both a protest against, and an acknowledgment of, this reality. Mr. Rogen and Mr. Goldberg -- and their on-screen co-conspirators and alter egos -- would rather blow up the whole world than grapple with the existence of women, children, death, politics, responsibility, homosexuality and other fertile subjects for laughter. But I'm confident that eventually they will deal with all of it. They're good boys, much as they like to pretend otherwise.
''This Is the End'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Drug and penis humor.
This Is the End

HEADLINE: New Plans for Casinos in the Catskills

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Casino fever has hit the Catskills, again.
The Mashantucket Pequot Indians, who own the Foxwoods casino resort, announced an agreement Tuesday with a New York City landowner and developer to build a $500 million casino-resort on 500 wooded acres in Liberty.
Nineteen miles to the east, in Ellenville, the owners of the long-dormant Nevele Hotel also want to build a $450 million casino-resort, with a golf course, water park and new hotel. And Empire Resorts, which owns a slot machine parlor and horse track in Monticello, wants to move them to the site of another old borscht belt hotel, the Concord, where it would also build a casino-resort. 
All three plans would need a change in the State Constitution to allow casino gambling, which is now limited to Indian land.
Promoters have been pushing since the 1970s for the establishment of casinos as a way to revive the Catskills' resort economy. But the latest round of interest is prompted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's effort to legalize full-scale casino gambling in the state.
The response to the latest frenzy of proposals, however, has been wary, even in the Catskills, where there is political support for casinos and the jobs and revenue they might bring. Residents, though, have become increasingly skeptical about whether the gambling projects will progress any further than those that failed to materialize before.
''Business is excited, but the average Joe could give two damns,'' said Tony Cellini, a casino supporter and the longtime town supervisor of Thompson, where the Concord was. ''The people up here are sick and tired about having that golden carrot dangled in front of them.''
The plan by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, calls for up to seven casino-resorts. He wants to start with three casinos upstate, including one in the Catskills region, to lift the overall weak economy. He would not permit casinos downstate for five years. The plan would not allow any in New York City, the most sought-after location of gambling companies.
Last year, the Legislature approved a constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling. To become law, the amendment must pass the Legislature again this month and a referendum in the November election. Passage is by no means assured, as legislators debate the details, including locations and tax rates.
The state now has five Indian casinos, and electronic slot machine parlors at nine racetracks.
On Tuesday, the New York Gaming Association, which represents the slot parlors, said that it opposed the governor's casino plan, saying it would put the parlors out of business and generate far less money for education. The slot parlors, which pay a tax rate of over 60 percent of net slot revenues, generate nearly $1 billion a year for education. Mr. Cuomo has proposed a 25 percent tax rate on full-scale casinos.
State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican who represents the Catskills, is advocating for more than one casino in the area.
''I'm focused on the Catskills; that's where we get the best return for taxpayers and create the most jobs,'' Mr. Bonacic said.
In the early 2000s, there were proposals for Indian casinos in the Catskills. Developers bought stretches of land all over Sullivan County. But ultimately little happened. Proponents now say they are closer than ever to building at least one casino in the Catskills. The Mashantucket Pequots also say the Catskills are ideal.
''We think it's a great location for not only gaming activity, but for a full-scale destination resort, which is what we'd be looking to do,'' said Scott Butera, chief executive of Foxwoods Resort Casino.
With revenue down at Foxwoods, in Ledyard, Conn., and more competition on the way in Massachusetts, the Mashantucket Pequots decided to open a new location to increase earnings.
Their proposed casino would go on land owned by the Muss real estate family of New York City, which gained control of the property in the late 1980s.
But developers are also angling for a casino resort at the Nevele. And Empire Resorts recently obtained local approvals to develop a resort and slot parlor on the Concord site. Empire Resorts must build a new racetrack to retain rights for the slots.
Even if casino gambling fails to gain approval, Empire Resorts says it will build the project.

HEADLINE: Hirst Counts the Dots, or at Least the Paintings

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Damien Hirst's spot paintings -- some with dots about the size of pinholes, others 60 inches across -- have long been celebrated, and disdained, for a certain anonymous, machinelike industrial uniformity.
But since his first spot paintings appeared, in the mid-1980s, something of a mystery has grown: just how many are there?
Mr. Hirst has said he painted the first few dozen. The others he left mainly to a coterie of assistants, who, it seemed, could make them ad infinitum.
For buyers, dealers and auction houses, the prospect of an unlimited supply was a complication. A flooded market might affect the paintings' future value -- not a small worry when they can cost as much as $3.4 million. 
''Even art market professionals like myself don't know the exact count,'' said Koji Inoue, a Christie's specialist who is in charge of its evening sales.
Now Mr. Hirst's London company Science Ltd. will finally provide a definitive number.
This fall his publisher, Other Criteria, will release a book, a catalogue raisonné, that will show that there are exactly 1,365 spot paintings.
''All paintings are in the book,'' Jude Tyrrell, an official at Science Ltd., said in an e-mail.
For Mr. Hirst, the inventory is but another example of how, as an artist and businessman, he has often sailed against the winds. At a time when experts increasingly fear putting out catalogs and authenticating art, lest they be sued by owners whose works don't make the grade and are left out, Mr. Hirst, 48, is creating a book that could define what is -- and what is not -- an authentic Hirst spot painting.
The catalog, beyond providing scholarly luster, could well boost prices for the paintings, which in the past 18 months have sold for $53,000 to $1.7 million, by reassuring buyers who suspected there were many more in the series. In April The Art Newspaper reported that the catalog would include around 1,400 spot paintings. It could also dismay any forgers who think the spot works are particularly conducive to fakery. (In March a man was indicted in New York after being accused of trying to sell five fake Hirsts, including three fake spot limited-edition prints. He has pleaded not guilty.)
But a catalog could draw new attention to questions like whether those made by his assistants are of equal value. And while such a catalog is usually a sign that an artist or scholars are drawing a final line under a specific body of work, the spot paintings are still being made, said James Kelly, the director of Science Ltd. ''Damien is working on some spot paintings with very small spots, including a painting with one million spots, which will take a number of years to complete,'' he said in an e-mail.
Mr. Kelly added that Mr. Hirst would eventually follow this catalog with a complete catalogue raisonné for his entire body of work. Mr. Hirst did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
For many experts, this catalog -- along with a flurry of activity last year that included a commission for the London Olympics, a retrospective at Tate Modern in London and exhibitions of more than 300 spot paintings at 11 galleries in 8 cities -- seems like an effort to turn around a career that rose to dizzying heights until 2008, when prices, and the artist's reputation, took something of a plunge.
''He needs to regain the trust of the marketplace,'' said Jeff B. Rabin, a co-founder of Artvest Partners, an art investment advisory firm. ''It seems the catalog is one measure he could perhaps take to start to rectify some of the ill feeling out in the marketplace.''
Mr. Hirst has often been a polarizing figure in the art world. As part of a 1990s wave of young British artists, known as the Y.B.A.'s, he produced work -- from a dead shark swimming in formaldehyde to a platinum human skull paved with 8,601 diamonds -- that often provoked outrage as well as mystified shrugs.
Brought to prominence by the British advertising executive and art collector Charles Saatchi, with whom his relations, by many accounts, later grew strained, Mr. Hirst became as famous for his self-promoting style as for his work. He flouted art world custom in 2008 when he bypassed dealers and staged an auction of 223 pieces of his own work at Sotheby's in London that September. The auction, which took place even as financial markets were crumbling, was wildly successful and helped make him one of the richest artists in the world, with a fortune said to be more than $300 million.
But Mr. Hirst, like many artists, has been hurt by the financial crisis and recession. Prices of his works at auction are down by about 60 percent since their extraordinary peak in 2007, according to Artnet, the art market information company. And the lingering effect of his blow-out 2008 auction, experts say, is that Mr. Hirst's prices have been slower to bounce back than those of other artists.
The spot paintings -- especially early ones -- have tended to retain their value better than his other works, but for an artist whose ideas are often regarded as sly comments on the link between money and art, it may be disappointing that last year the value of all Hirsts sold at auction barely reached $26.5 million. In 2008 the figure was 10 times that amount, according to Artnet, showing perhaps that owners are reluctant to bring his work to market and take a loss.
As if to underline that all may not be not well in his commercial relationships, he broke with the super-dealer Larry Gagosian in January.
Science Ltd. said the catalog had been scheduled for last year, with the global exhibition, but took longer than expected. Mr. Hirst's company would not comment on whether it is concerned about possible objections from owners of works that might be omitted from the list, which is being put together in conjunction with the Gagosian galleries and White Cube, Mr. Hirst's London gallery. As it stands, all collectors who own what they believe are Hirsts can submit them to be authenticated by the Hirst authentication committee.
''Science Ltd., Damien's company, have a very comprehensive database of all his works, and if they were prior to our record keeping, we drew upon the extensive records for earlier spots, from White Cube gallery,'' Ms. Tyrrell said. She said only 14 paintings would be included without images.
The practice of authenticating art has become fraught, encouraging continual second-guessing, though the risk for Mr. Hirst is greatly diminished by the fact that the book is being produced while he is alive, experts said. Greater trust is put on the artist's own opinion about what is genuine.
An expert considering a spot painting's authenticity will look at a number of things. Is it featured in an earlier, credible publication? Are there documents of provenance, like gallery labels? Does it bear a Hirst signature or stamp, or carry, as some works do, a unique identification number from Science Ltd.?
The very concept of inventorying the ''genuine'' spot paintings rings silly to some critics who have long complained about the mass-produced nature of Mr. Hirst's work.
''No one was clear how many spot paintings there were -- and Hirst himself didn't know,'' Julian Spalding, an author and a former director of museums in Britain and a outspoken critic of Mr. Hirst's work, said in an e-mail. ''But then why should he? They were made purely to an unbelievably simplistic and boring formula by his assistants.''
But Oliver Barker, Sotheby's senior international contemporary-art specialist, who was the principal auctioneer for Mr. Hirst's 2008 single-artist sale, said such critics are missing the point. The paintings, he said, are not about mass production, or volume, or about the kind of limits implied by giving them a fixed count.
''He has made no secret,'' Mr. Barker said, ''of the fact that the spot paintings were an infinite series.''
For many collectors too, the number is beside the point.
Andrew Cogan, chief executive of the Knoll furniture company, owns a thin, horizontal pastel-colored spot painting about six feet long he bought around 2000.
The painting, he said, is in home in New York and reminds him of the dot candy on paper sheets he used to enjoy as a child.
''I don't get tired of looking at it,'' he said, adding, ''I assumed there were literally thousands of them.''

HEADLINE: Fair Opens in Time of Turbulence for Dealers

BYLINE: By NICOLAI HARTVIG

 BODY:
When Art Basel, the grandfather of art fairs, opens in Switzerland on Thursday, the world's most powerful dealers will share the event with midsize galleries and a crop of emerging hopefuls. But regardless of size, many of the more than 300 galleries at Basel will have felt the pressures of an art world in transition.
Art fairs are crucial for many galleries around the world, and can represent a large portion of their annual sales. Last year, the Pace Gallery sold the Gerhard Richter painting ''A.B. Courbet'' at Art Basel for more than $20 million. But doing double duty in gallery spaces and fairs can also be stressful and costly. At 669 Swiss francs per square meter, or $65 per square foot, an entry-level booth at Art Basel costs $42,900, with at least the same amount necessary for travel, shipping of art works, insurance and other expenses. With galleries needing to attend several fairs each year, this may be within easy reach for top dealers, but much less so for smaller ones. 
In a market report for the European Fine Art Fair this year in Maastricht, the Netherlands, the economist Clare McAndrew found that dealers generating sales of more than &#x20ac;10 million, or $13 million, in 2012 saw an average 55 percent increase in revenue. Midsize dealers, with sales of &#x20ac;500,000 to &#x20ac;10 million, experienced a decline of 1 percent to 2 percent. The smallest dealers suffered the most, with a 17 percent year-on-year drop in revenue for those with sales of less than &#x20ac;500,000. Dr. McAndrew suggested that the top 5 percent of dealers could now account for more than half the market's overall value.
The world's leading galleries, in many ways the backbone of fairs like Art Basel, are seeking to connect with wealthy new collectors in novel ways and hoping to offer more international exposure to high-demand artists. Larry Gagosian, for instance, plans to open his 13th gallery in 2014, a third space in London that adds to a brand extending across seven countries.
Last October, Pace opened its London flagship directly north of the Royal Academy of Arts, adding to its five New York sites, including one on East 57th Street in Manhattan, and a Beijing gallery. David Zwirner and Michael Werner have also expanded to London.
The French dealer Emmanuel Perrotin is opening a New York location on three floors in September, to complement two neighboring spaces in Paris and one in Hong Kong. ''There's certainly power and ambition, which you cannot deny, even if it seems pretentious,'' he said. ''But we are driven above all by a fear of losing artists if we don't develop at their rhythm.''
White Cube, which has its headquarters in London, opened a branch in Hong Kong in March 2012, followed by a space in São Paulo in December. ''If you want to work with good artists, you have to find ways to expand their reputation and bring them to new audiences,'' said Tim Marlow, White Cube's director of exhibitions. ''We're not chasing a market. If we were, we'd just do art fairs.''
Through such efforts, White Cube welcomed 130,000 visitors last year to its space in Bermondsey, London, where it also hosts screenings and talks. The gallery's teams in Hong Kong and Brazil, meanwhile, have been focusing on introducing British and international artists there, while also getting artists from those regions to London.
Mr. Perrotin will get French artists to New York, among them the painter Pierre Soulages. Pace, meanwhile, shows mainly Chinese artists at its Beijing space, leaving it and the London gallery to chaperone their own local talent, ''with Pace principle, and obviously Pace capital,'' said Marc Glimcher, president of the Pace Gallery, which will be at Art Basel this year.
''We're doing this because we want to,'' he said. ''It's not going to make everybody rich and it's probably going to be a little harder than to stick to 57th Street and just have Calder and Rothko shows.''
Hauser & Wirth's latest projects are perhaps the most ambitious of all. After settling in January in the former Roxy discotheque and roller rink in New York -- its second location in that city, adding to a presence in London and Zurich -- it plans to open a vast arts center in a former farm complex in Somerset, England, in 2014 and a museum-like space in Los Angeles, in partnership with the curator Paul Schimmel, in 2015.
With the gap between the top and the middle widening, such commitment is risky. ''It's an extremely complicated trade and you can very fast become a slave to your gallery,'' Mr. Perrotin said.
In March, Jérôme and Emmanuelle de Noirmont closed the gallery they had managed for 20 years on Avenue Matignon in Paris. ''It was a difficult decision and a moment of sadness,'' Mr. de Noirmont said. ''We don't reject the gallery system, we just weren't prepared to do it.''
The case of the Jérôme de Noirmont gallery is atypical but revealing. Amid murmurs that the economic crisis was hurting midmarket galleries -- an instance of art imitating life, with talk of the 1 percent and a dying middle class -- the gallery was doing well, usually finding collectors for two-thirds of the works in each of its exhibitions and selling out the gallery's swan-song presentation of paintings by the Iranian-born artist Marjane Satrapi. ''We could have stayed like this for another 10 or 15 years,'' Mr. de Noirmont said, ''but ours was an entrepreneurial problem.''
The ambitious couple had considered expanding the business and opening another gallery space. Expansion would have required adding new artists to the roster and about 30 additional employees to manage the enlarged operation. For this ''ultimate stage,'' as he called it, Mr. de Noirmont said he was deterred by what he termed a stunting economic climate in France. Rather than stagnate, the couple chose to change direction.
Today, Mr. de Noirmont is helping his artists find other representation, and investigating options for future projects. He recently organized a sale of works by artists including Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein at Sotheby's in Paris, to help save and restore Keith Haring's towering fresco at the Necker Children's Hospital. ''We're turning the page, but not closing the book,'' he said.
For some art dealers, having a physical gallery has simply felt counterproductive. Earlier this year, Jonas Zakaitis and Aurime Aleksandraviciute closed Tulips & Roses in Brussels. ''The commercial aspect had started to become a burden. It was just not our framework,'' Mr. Zakaitis said. The two commissioned for the Lithuanian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale and are devoting time to educational programs and an independent magazine in Vilnius.
In New York, meanwhile, Nicole Klagsbrun is closing her gallery after 30 years and plans stand-alone exhibitions in the United States and Europe, citing the pressure of a frenetic show schedule and the need to participate in ever more art fairs. ''I came into it at a stage when it was about the art, the artists,'' she said. ''Now it's really more about the machine that needs to be fed constantly.''
Worried critics and dealers are looking for new ways to keep the world's smaller galleries competitive despite the squeeze. To prevent gallery behemoths from enticing successful artists away from smaller colleagues, the Belgian collector Alain Servais has proposed a system inspired by the way FIFA, the governing body of soccer, regulates the trade of players, with clubs paying compensation and transfer fees. Others have suggested that galleries should not attend fairs in their own cities, or that there could be a tiered pricing system for sales in galleries or fairs.
Artists themselves could play a crucial role. When the New York artist Julie Mehretu was looking for representation, the largest galleries came calling. ''Everybody wanted to take on Julie Mehretu; we all went to her studio,'' said Mr. Glimcher of Pace. ''She's a bona fide, couple-of-artists-in-a-generation-type genius. We all listed the things that we could do for her. Then she looked around and she looked at Marian Goodman, who can barely fit her paintings into her 57th Street space.''
Ms. Mehretu is now represented by Ms. Goodman, a prestigious dealer with galleries in Paris and New York who has intentionally avoided the race for an expanded global presence.
''I asked her how difficult it had been to decide,'' Mr. Glimcher said, ''and she said, 'Frankly, it was a really easy decision.'''
''For such an incredibly authentic person, without a complex for power, fame or money, there was something unattractive about all these big galleries,'' Mr. Glimcher said. ''The benefit of 20 small galleries that have stayed authentic is death by a thousand cuts to the big megagalleries. Unless, of course, you're a megagallery that keeps spinning off your expansions and having them be independent.''
Ms. Mehretu also shows with White Cube and the smaller and edgy Carlier Gebauer gallery in Berlin, an example of how some prominent artists are unafraid to straddle. But to disrupt the market-driven model would require something more, Mr. Glimcher suggested. ''Probably all of us, generations of experience, will need to be gone,'' he said. ''The people who grow up in this less interesting time will have a better chance. I've already got my 3-year-old working on it.''

HEADLINE: E.U. Official Pushes U.S. to Explain Its Surveillance

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Amid a growing outcry over American snooping on foreigners that threatens to cloud European-U.S. trade talks and President Barack Obama's visit to Berlin, the European Union's top justice official has demanded in unusually sharp terms that the United States reveal what its intelligence is doing with personal information of Europeans gathered under the Prism surveillance program revealed last week.
Viviane Reding, the Union's combative commissioner of justice, told Attorney General Eric Holder in a letter sent on Monday evening that individual citizens of European countries had the right to know whether their personal information had been part of intelligence gathering ''on a large scale.''
In the letter, seen Tuesday by the International Herald Tribune, she also asked what avenues were available to Europeans to find out whether they had been spied on, and whether they would be treated similarly to U.S. citizens in such cases. 
''Given the gravity of the situation and the serious concerns expressed in public opinion on this side of the Atlantic, you will understand that I will expect swift and concrete answers,'' Mrs. Reding wrote.
Speaking for a continent where snooping carries ghastly echoes of fascist or communist regimes, Mrs. Reding challenged Mr. Holder to answer a list of detailed questions by Friday, when they are expected to speak face-to-face in Dublin at a ministerial meeting scheduled before the Prism spy operation came to light.
In Berlin, where Mr. Obama will speak next week before the Brandenburg Gate, privacy is a highly sensitive political issue and the Prism revelations have stirred a furor.
''You can be sure that this will be one of the things the chancellor addresses when President Obama is in Germany,'' said Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Angela Merkel, who grew up in the former Communist East.
Germany's interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said his ministry wants to establish whether any Germans' right to privacy had been infringed and is preparing a ''catalog of questions'' for its American counterparts.
The justice minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, in a guest editorial for the Web site Spiegel Online, called the revelations about the U.S. surveillance ''deeply disconcerting'' and possibly ''dangerous.''
''In a democratic constitutional state, security is not an end in itself, but serves to secure freedom,'' Ms. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger wrote.
Mrs. Reding -- who has irked U.S. authorities in the past by threatening companies like Google for overstepping E.U. privacy standards -- suggested Mr. Holder's responses could shape the outcome of important trans-Atlantic initiatives like trade talks.
Europe has been a frequent critic of the United States in recent years for jeopardizing individual liberties by filtering vast volumes of information on European bank transfers and in airline passenger records to fight terror plots.
Mrs. Reding's letter is another sign that the growth of government surveillance that began under the Bush administration after Sept. 11, 2001, and has expanded under the Obama administration, continues to touch raw nerves far beyond the United States.
Under the Prism program, the United States is said to have collected Internet data on foreigners abroad from companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and Skype.
The revelations have prompted members of the European Parliament, a directly elected body of representatives from across the Union that meets in Brussels and Strasbourg, to demand that data protection be included in upcoming U.S.-European talks on a long sought trade pact.
Any ''trade pact will have to fully ensure the highest standards of data privacy for all citizens,'' and an ongoing reform of Europe's data protection law ''must guarantee these standards for E.U. citizens when using U.S.-based Internet companies,'' Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian member of the parliament who is president of the Socialists & Democrats group, said in a statement on Tuesday.
''It is no good the E.U. having strict regulation on data protection if those standards are not guaranteed when using U.S.-based Internet companies,'' he said.
Talks on a trade deal were endorsed by Mr. Obama in February and involve efforts to drop trade barriers between the E.U. and the United States and to synchronize regulations.
The talks are expected to be conducted by Mrs. Reding's colleague, Karel De Gucht, the E.U. trade commissioner -- but the Parliament would have a final say over any such deal under its right, in force since 2009, to veto treaties with third countries.
In the strongest demonstration against U.S. policy, the Parliament in 2010 blocked an agreement allowing U.S. authorities access to European banking data from a cooperative responsible for routing trillions of dollars daily among banks, brokerage houses, stock exchanges and other institutions.
The cooperative, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is based near Brussels. It provided the U.S. authorities with personal data after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
The Parliament eventually gave its approval to a revised agreement in July 2010. But some lawmakers have threatened to renew demands to scrap that agreement, and others, with the United States.
In a thinly veiled warning to Mr. Holder about the trade pact, Ms. Reding said relations between the United States and Europe could be undermined by concerns about privacy, which many in Europe regard as an inviolable right.
In her letter, Mrs. Reding said she ''is accountable before the European Parliament, which is likely to assess the overall trans-Atlantic relationship also in the light of your responses.''
In nine detailed questions, Ms. Reding asked Mr. Holder how much data-sifting the United States is conducting, whether those activities target individuals, and whether the surveillance involves issues beyond national security.
Mrs. Reding also pushed Mr. Holder to tell her ''what avenues'' are available to citizens of countries in the European Union to obtain information about whether their personal information has been examined under the Prism program and other programs, and whether Europeans have similar access to that information as Americans.
E.U. officials said Tuesday that the outcry over Prism will reinforce anxiety about how personal data is used.
On Tuesday, the president of Italy's privacy authority, Antonello Soro, warned against the growing pressure from police and national authorities all over the world to obtain citizens' private information. ''The generalized and indiscriminate surveillance of citizens, reasonably also European citizens, beyond any criminal evidence, through data coming from phone calls or from the Web, is a very, very serious thing'' he wrote to the Italian Parliament.
For Mrs. Reding, the chance to push back against Washington is a welcome opportunity.
Two years ago, she was forced to soften her initial proposals for data privacy rules in order to accommodate U.S. intelligence gathering. That followed intense pressure on the European Commission, the E.U.'s governing body, from the Obama administration.
Under Mrs. Reding's original proposal, companies in Europe that store or process personal data would need authorization from a ''supervisory authority'' before they could transfer personal information outside the Union at the request of a foreign government or court.
That article is no longer in the latest draft of Europe's data privacy laws but, even before the furor erupted over Prism, some members of the European Parliament were asking for similar safeguards to be reintroduced.
Chris Cottrell contributed reporting from Berlin and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.

HEADLINE: Insurers Inflating Books, New York Regulator Says

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
New York State regulators are calling for a nationwide moratorium on transactions that life insurers are using to alter their books by billions of dollars, saying that the deals put policyholders at risk and could lead to another taxpayer bailout.
Insurers' use of the secretive transactions has become widespread, nearly doubling over the last five years. The deals now affect life insurance policies worth trillions of dollars, according to an analysis done for The New York Times by SNL Financial, a research and data firm.
These complex private deals allow the companies to describe themselves as richer and stronger than they otherwise could in their communications with regulators, stockholders, the ratings agencies and customers, who often rely on ratings to buy insurance.
Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's superintendent of financial services, said that life insurers based in New York had alone burnished their books by $48 billion, using what he called ''shadow insurance,'' according to an investigation conducted by his department. He issued a report about the investigation late Tuesday. 
The transactions are so opaque that Mr. Lawsky said it took his team of investigators nearly a year to follow the paper trail, even though they had the power to subpoena documents.
Insurance is regulated by the states, and Mr. Lawsky said his investigators found that life insurers in New York were seeking out states with looser regulations and setting up shell companies there for the deals. They then used those states' tight secrecy laws to avoid scrutiny by the New York State regulators.
Insurance regulation is based squarely on the concept of solvency -- the idea that future claims can be predicted fairly accurately and that each insurer should track them and keep enough reserves on hand to pay all of them. The states have detailed rules for what types of assets reserves can be invested in. Companies are also expected to keep a little more than they really expect to need -- called their surplus -- as a buffer against unexpected events. State regulators monitor the reserves and surpluses of companies and make sure none fall short.
Mr. Lawsky said that because the transactions made companies look richer than they otherwise would, some were diverting reserves to other uses, like executive compensation or stockholder dividends.
The most frequent use, he said, was to artificially increase companies' risk-based capital ratios, an important measurement of solvency that was instituted after a series of life-insurance failures and near misses in the 1980s.
Mr. Lawsky said he was struck by similarities between what the life insurers were doing now and the issuing of structured mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008.
''Those practices were used to water down capital buffers, as well as temporarily boost quarterly profits and stock prices,'' Mr. Lawsky said. ''And ultimately, those practices left those very same companies on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars in losses from risks hidden in the shadows, and led to a multitrillion-dollar taxpayer bailout.''
The transactions at issue are modeled after reinsurance, a business in which an insurance company pays another company, a reinsurer, to take over some of its obligations to pay claims. Reinsurance is widely used and is considered beneficial because it allows insurers to spread their risks and remain stable as they grow. Conventional reinsurance deals are negotiated at arm's length by independent companies; both sides understand the risk and can agree on a fair price for covering it. The obligations drop off the original insurer's books because the reinsurer has picked them up.
Mr. Lawsky's investigators found, though, that life insurance groups, including some of the best known, were creating their own shell companies in other states or countries -- outside the regulators' view -- and saying that these so-called captives were selling them reinsurance. The value of policies reinsured through all affiliates, including captives, rose to $5.46 trillion in 2012, from $2.82 trillion in 2007.
The chief problem with captive reinsurance, Mr. Lawsky said, is that the risk is not being transferred to an independent reinsurer. Also, the deal is not at arm's length. And confidentiality rules make it difficult to see what secures the obligations.
The New York State investigators subpoenaed this information and discovered that some states were approving deals backed by assets that would not be allowed in New York; Mr. Lawsky referred to ''hollow assets,'' ''naked parental guarantees'' and ''conditional letters of credit.''
''Weaker collateral requirements mean the policyholders are at greater risk,'' he said.
Insurers, unlike banks, have no prepaid fund like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to make customers whole in the event of a collapse. That's why Mr. Lawsky said he feared that taxpayers might have to be called to the rescue again.
Because New York has standing to investigate only life insurers based in the state, the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is calling for other states, or the federal government, to ''conduct similar investigations, to document a more complete picture of the full extent of shadow insurance written nationwide.''
Until then, Mr. Lawsky said, the deals should not be permitted. New York State has already stopped approving them, but other states have not.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has been examining the same type of transactions, but its members are sharply divided about their potential risk and what, if anything, to do about it. The group's proposals must be adopted by 42 state legislatures to become effective. That seems unlikely; many states have recently passed laws allowing the formation of captives. Gov. Rick Perry made Texas the latest contender for the business when he signed such a law this month.
A new federal entity created under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Federal Insurance Office, has also been monitoring the trend and is scheduled to discuss possible federal responses at an advisory committee meeting on Wednesday. Any federal action would be fought hard by the states, which have regulated insurance for more than 150 years.
New York's investigators could not disclose which companies are the biggest users of reinsurance through captives because of the secrecy laws of other states. Their report did describe some of the transactions in detail, but with the names of the companies removed.
The separate analysis by SNL Financial, by contrast, was based on public regulatory filings. It did identify the life insurance companies that are the biggest users of the transactions, both in and out of New York. They include Transamerica, MetLife, Prudential, Hartford, Genworth, John Hancock, ReliaStar and Lincoln National, among others. Another insurer, Allstate, turned up in the sample even though its primary business is property and casualty, because it owns some life insurers.
The big users generally appear to be publicly traded companies, which have to meet Wall Street's expectations for earnings growth and returns on capital. Life insurers that are owned by their policyholders, called mutual companies, do not have that pressure, and some, like State Farm, Guardian and New York Life, appear not to be reinsuring through captives at all.
MetLife said in a statement Tuesday that it ''holds more than sufficient reserves to pay claims on its policies'' and added that it used reinsurance subsidiaries ''as a cost-effective way of addressing overly conservative reserving requirements'' for certain insurance products. If it had to set aside that level of reserves more conventionally, it said, it would either have to borrow -- putting its credit rating at risk -- or raise the money by selling stock, dragging its returns below the level its stockholders require.
''Access to reinsurance subsidiaries significantly reduces costs to policyholders and in some cases is necessary to enable insurers to continue to offer certain coverage,'' MetLife said.
Prudential said in a statement, ''Our captives are capitalized to a level consistent with 'AA' financial strength rating targets of our issuing insurance entities.'' It said that many of its captive reinsurance transactions were done in Prudential's own home state, New Jersey, so the same regulators could see both ends of the deals.
In other cases, Prudential said it reinsured obligations through a captive entity in Arizona, Pruco Re, whose reserves were ''subject to asset adequacy testing by our actuaries.'' The company said these practices were disclosed to investors.
Other companies using this type of reinsurance said their transactions had been reviewed and approved by regulators, and helped them use capital efficiently. They also said the practice allowed them to charge lower prices, and in some cases made it possible to keep selling types of insurance that would otherwise have been discontinued. They also said it was appropriate to support their captives with contingent letters of credit in cases where the likelihood of big payouts was remote.
The Hartford said that it had sold its life insurance business to Prudential, and was no longer in the business of writing new life policies and reinsuring them.
Allstate said that captives and special-purpose vehicles were ''a minor part of Allstate's reinsurance business.''
SNL Financial's data also made it possible to see which states are courting the transactions most eagerly -- Vermont, South Carolina, Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa and Missouri.
''If we let our guard down and ignore this regulatory race to the bottom, taxpayers and insurance policyholders are the ones who could get left holding the bag,'' Mr. Lawsky said in his report.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ends Lower on Central Bank Fears

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks slumped on Tuesday after the Bank of Japan declined to take additional stimulus measures, a move that increased investors' worries about the eventual decline in central bank support that has bolstered an equities rally.
At the end of Wall Street trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1 percent in afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite was 1 percent lower.
The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady at the end of its two-day meeting, holding off on taking fresh steps to calm bond market volatility. Unhappy traders sent the Nikkei down 1.5 percent. 
The lack of additional action rattled investors, underscoring worries about what would happen when the stimulus programs eventually go away. At the same time, nervousness remains over when the Federal Reserve may slow its measures, which have been a significant driver of this year's stock market rally.
''This market has been fed by extremely supportive government policies around the world,'' said Richard Meckler, president of the investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City. ''You're getting to that period where investors have to recognize that these policies are beginning to wrap up.''
In Europe, the broad FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of top shares, which has shed 5 percent in the previous 12 trading sessions, ended Tuesday's session 1.2 percent lower.
But United States Treasury prices turned higher on Tuesday, as the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, erasing a modest loss, was up 6/32 to yield 2.19 percent. The 30-year Treasury extended a gain to 24/32, allowing its yield to ease to 3.33 percent.
Shares of Lululemon Athletica slumped more than 17 percent after the company's chief executive said she would step down.
SoftBank said it would raise its offer for Sprint Nextel to $21.6 billion from $20.1 billion. Sprint was up 2.4 percent.
The S.&P. 500 is up more than 15 percent since the start of the year, but markets have been bumpier since comments from the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, last month sparked uncertainty over the central bank's timeline for slowing its $85 billion a month bond purchase program.
While the Bank of Japan left the door open to taking fresh steps to calm markets if borrowing costs spiked again, it did not appear to assuage investors. ''The B.O.J. took some big steps and had some big changes but now that they've done that, the market is looking for even more,'' Mr. Meckler said.
Seasonality was also playing a part in Tuesday's weakness as equities tend to have less direction in the summer months, he said.
Shares in the Dole Food Company rose 22 percent after Dole received an unsolicited buyout offer from its chief executive.
The Catamaran Corporation climbed 11 percent after it signed a 10-year agreement with the Cigna Corporation.
Boeing raised its 20-year forecast for demand, saying airlines will need 35,280 new airplanes worth $4.8 trillion as the world's fleet doubles. Boeing shares fell 0.5 percent.
The yen extended its rally after the Bank of Japan's lack of action, and the dollar traded as low as 95.68 yen for a 3 percent loss on the day.
The euro briefly traded above $1.33, but gains were pared headed into Europe's stock market close, with the euro last trading at $1.3274, up 0.1 percent on the day.
In the debt market, investors pulled out of the riskiest assets, sending Greek 10-year bond yields up 75 basis points, to 10.22 percent. Portuguese equivalent bonds rose 34 basis points, to 6.59 percent.
The Greek government has failed to find buyers for its state-owned natural gas company, threatening the privatization goal set under the country's bailout.

HEADLINE: $20 Billion Plan To Shore Up City As Climate Shifts

BYLINE: By KIA GREGORY and MARC SANTORA; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined a far-reaching plan on Tuesday to protect New York City from the threat of rising sea levels and powerful storm surges by building an extensive network of flood walls, levees and bulkheads along its 520 miles of coast.
The mayor said the plan would initially cost about $20 billion, and eventually far more. The city would spend the money on fortifying infrastructure like the power grid, renovating buildings to withstand hurricanes and defending the shore, according to a 438-page report on the proposals.
The proposals, in all, would change the look and fabric of the city, though not until well after the mayor leaves office at the end of the year.
Still, he emphasized that Hurricane Sandy was such a devastating event that the city had to move immediately. 
''This plan is incredibly ambitious -- and much of the work will extend far beyond the next 203 days -- but we refused to pass the responsibility for creating a plan onto the next administration,'' he said in a speech at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. ''This is urgent work, and it must begin now.''
The report details 250 recommendations, including the installation of flood walls and other measures to protect some of the areas that were hit worst by the hurricane in October.
The plan covers so many parts of the city and proposes such an array of projects that the cost could change -- and given the history of such large projects, it is likely to grow substantially.
Not included in the estimate are some of the more ambitious projects envisioned in the report that require further study, like the construction of a so-called Seaport City, just south of the Brooklyn Bridge in Manhattan, modeled after Battery Park City, which would protect Lower Manhattan but cost billions more.
The administration said that roughly half of the currently estimated $20 billion cost over the next decade would come from federal and city money that has already been allocated. An additional $5 billion would be covered by aid that Congress has already approved. Most of that money was allotted, through a variety of programs, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, according to the report.
The city would have to raise an additional $5 billion.
Mr. Bloomberg said that the price tag was high, but that the cost of not taking action would be higher. Hurricane Sandy caused $19 billion in damage and loss of economic activity for the city, he said, and if a similar storm were to strike three decades from now, the cost could be $90 billion.
''This is a defining challenge of our future,'' he said.
Mr. Bloomberg delivered the recommendations in an elaborate presentation, including a documentary-style video and a glossy report, that underscored how he is making climate change a signature issue toward the end of his tenure. In recent months, he has sought to contrast his activist stance on climate change with what he has said is the unwillingness of Washington to tackle these issues.
He chose to speak not at City Hall, but at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which was damaged by four and a half feet of floodwater during the hurricane.
Mr. Bloomberg's speech came a day after his aides released information on what they predicted would be the effect of climate change on the city.
Officials estimated that more than 800,000 city residents would live in the 100-year flood plain by the 2050s -- more than double the 398,000 currently at risk, based on new maps released by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The number of days with temperatures above 90 degrees is expected to jump sharply.
Environmental and business groups largely praised Mr. Bloomberg's initiative, though some experts questioned whether the city needed to consider evacuating some areas.
''I think that the mayor's plan is great,'' said Robert S. Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. ''I really appreciate the fact that he acknowledges the problem and understands climate change and the fact that we need to prepare for it. But everyone needs to understand that you can't guarantee protection for infrastructure that is in vulnerable locations, no matter how much money you throw at the problem.''
In the first phase of building defenses, the report released on Tuesday calls for erecting barriers at Hunts Point in the Bronx to protect the food distribution center, on the East Harlem waterfront along Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, on the East Side where several of the city's hospitals are, on the Lower East Side, in Chinatown, in the financial district and in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
On Staten Island, the plan calls for a system of permanent levees.
Along some parts of the coast, stone or concrete bulkheads would be installed, while in other places, dune systems would be built.
The city's power infrastructure also should be better protected, the report said. Currently, 53 percent of power plants are in threatened neighborhoods. By the 2050s, according to the report, 97 percent will be.
Much of the worst damage during Hurricane Sandy occurred in buildings erected before 1961, according to the report. The plan calls for $1.2 billion to be made available to property owners for renovations, like raising critical equipment, upgrading foundations and reinforcing exterior walls.
The plan calls for the city's hospitals to protect electrical equipment, emergency power systems and water pumps better by 2030.
Even before the hurricane, the mayor had commissioned a panel to study the changing climate, rising oceans and more powerful storms, and to propose plans to address the risks.
The panel is part of the city's broader, so-called sustainability campaign, known as PlaNYC. Much of what is called for in that plan is meant to have an impact over the course of many years. For instance, one of its key goals is to reduce carbon emissions 30 percent by 2030. The city is halfway there, with emissions cut 16 percent, city officials said.
After Tropical Storm Irene forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents along the city's coast in 2011, there were renewed questions about whether long-term goals were enough or whether more urgent action was needed -- especially as more people were settling along the city's shoreline.
During the Bloomberg administration, much of the waterfront has been revitalized, with the city spending hundreds of millions of dollars to improve parks, build esplanades and create the infrastructure necessary for residential development.
Developers have rushed to put up expensive rental and condominium towers from Battery Park City to Long Island City, transforming warehouse and wharf districts.
But as the administration's own waterfront plan, Vision 2020, warned in 2011, the development came with risks.
By 2050, sea levels could be 12 to 29 inches higher, according to the plan. By 2080, they could be about 55 inches higher. Those estimates have been revised upward recently.
While the city was spared a direct hit by Tropical Storm Irene, experts knew how close the storm had come to doing terrible damage. If the storm surge been 12 inches higher, city subways and thousands of homes would have been flooded.
One year later, Hurricane Sandy fulfilled even the most dire predictions.
''No matter how far we've come,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on Tuesday, ''we face real, immediate threats.''

HEADLINE: In North Carolina, Weekly Protests Challenge Conservative Shift in State Politics

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
RALEIGH, N.C. -- By now, the sixth week that the police and protesters have faced off in a series of political rallies called Moral Mondays, everyone knew what to do.
The singing stopped. Hands went behind backs. While hundreds of people watched from the rotunda that separates the House from the Senate chambers here, officers slipped plastic cuffs onto Duke University professors, ministers, teachers and union members, who were charged with trespassing and other charges. Even a Charlotte newspaper reporter was arrested as he took notes.
At the end, 89 people went to jail. They were out by morning. 
Week by week, Monday by Monday, since April 29, a growing coalition assembled by the N.A.A.C.P. has challenged the newly conservative Republican leadership in North Carolina, raising its voice against the loss of the state's centrist leadership and what they see as diminished recognition of the poor and minorities.
''These folks have lost their constitutional minds and their moral minds,'' said the Rev. William J. Barber II, the president of the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. and the force behind the protests. ''We can no longer allow the ultraconservatives to have the moral megaphone.''
N.A.A.C.P. leaders and an increasing number of labor, immigration and civil rights groups are bent on turning the protests in North Carolina into a national movement to stop a hard swing right that they say has sprung from the election of President Obama and the rise of Tea Party-style politics.
''If you are going to change the nation, you have to change the South,'' Mr. Barber said. ''And if you are going to change the South, you have to focus on these legislatures.''
As the protests have grown, so has the list of causes. At the center is a package of changes to voting rules and a tax reform plan working its way through the legislature that would reduce individual and corporate income taxes and expand the sales tax.
Protesters have also rallied against the expansion of school vouchers, cuts to unemployment benefits, the repeal of the Racial Justice Act, efforts to allow hydraulic fracturing and the state's refusal to expand Medicaid benefits as part of President Obama's health care plan.
But the protests are quickly turning into a platform for all kinds of causes. A woman holding a sign that read ''Just Say No to GMOs'' -- genetically modified organisms -- wandered through the crowd on Monday.
Many at the rallies are individuals who work with the poor.
Sylvia Ray, 72, works for a small social services agency in Fayetteville that helps people find jobs. A $50,000 program for displaced homemakers was recently cut.
''That's just one small example of what's happening everywhere,'' she said. ''This state is hurting the people who are struggling for every penny.''
Other states in the South have been advancing equally conservative social and fiscal agendas, but in North Carolina, long considered one of the least conservative Southern states, the shift right has seemed sudden, stark and well-executed.
''I want the American people to watch the conservative playbook unfold in North Carolina,'' Representative G. K. Butterfield, a Democrat in Congress who represents one of the poorest districts in the country, said Monday to the crowd. ''It's meanspirited, and it's wrong.''
The powerful Republican revolution in North Carolina began in earnest in 2010, when for the first time in more than 100 years Republicans took control of both the House and the Senate. Helped by a round of redistricting, the Republicans increased their majority in 2012 and put Pat McCrory, the former mayor of Charlotte, in the governor's office.
He began an agenda aimed at reducing spending and stimulating business that has been well received by many in the state.
Whether the protests are having much effect on the governor and legislators is difficult to discern. At first, they ignored Moral Mondays. But as the arrest totals crept over 300 and crowds topped a thousand, politicians began to respond.
Some pulled no punches. Thom Goolsby, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, renamed the protests ''Moron Mondays'' in an opinion column and called the protesters ''mostly white, angry, aged former hippies.''
Governor McCrory, who declined a request for an interview, told reporters last week that outsiders were stirring things up and that he would not meet with Moral Monday leaders. He called for an end to what he said were illegal assemblies.
Thom Tillis, the speaker of the House and a board member of the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization that proposes legislation based on limited government and individual liberty, was more measured.
Mr. Tillis, who is running for the United States Senate, suggested both sides find a way to talk.
''There are so many positive things we can do if we can lower the volume and sit down and talk and show some mutual respect,'' he said.
But the protesters are realists.
''We don't think this is going to change the legislature's mind right now, but it highlights what's at stake in the next election,'' said Jedediah Purdy, 38, a law professor at Duke who was arrested Monday evening.
He said the battle mirrored the issues that divided the country in the 2012 presidential election. ''The states are the new front line in politics,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Atomic Power's Green Light or Red Flag

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WAYNESBORO, Ga. -- The two nuclear reactors rising out of the red Georgia clay here, twin behemoths of concrete and steel, make up one of the largest construction projects in the United States and represent a giant bet that their cost -- in the range of $14 billion -- will be cheaper than alternatives like natural gas.
But something else is at stake with the reactors called Vogtle 3 and 4: the future of the American nuclear industry itself.
The Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear power plant near Augusta is using a new plant design, a new construction method and a new system of nuclear regulation for what the industry says is a faster, better and cheaper system that will lead the way for a new generation of reactors. 
Until recently, a new reactor construction project had not been started in the United States for 30 years, and now Vogtle and a similar project in South Carolina, V.C. Summer 2 and 3, are supposed to provide the answer to nuclear power's great questions: What does a new reactor cost? With the price of natural gas near historical lows, can it even be worthwhile?
As the current generation of reactors moves toward retirement, the two projects may be the industry's last best hope.
''Everybody's watching the construction of that plant,'' said Barry Moline, executive director of the Florida Municipal Electric Association, speaking of Vogtle. Several association members are considering investing in a nearly identical plant proposed by Florida Power and Light in Miami. Mr. Moline said of Vogtle's builders, led by Georgia Power, ''If they can do it, that will be the model.''
And if they can't, it could be years before anybody thinks of trying again. The new designs are supposed to be a tenth as likely to have an accident and to be easier to operate, but if they cannot be built roughly on time and on budget, then nuclear power will have trouble in the era of plentiful natural gas and emerging technologies like wind.
Nuclear power could become a bypassed technology -- like moon landings, Polaroid photos and cassette tapes.
Executives at Southern Company, Georgia Power's corporate parent, say they are eager for the challenge. ''It takes leadership to do something like this,'' said Joseph A. Miller, known as Buzz, Southern's vice president for nuclear development.
Southern, one of the biggest utilities in the United States, raced to grab incentives offered by Congress to restart the nuclear construction business and to try out a licensing system devised by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to avoid a repeat of the experience of the 1970s and '80s.
In those decades parts of plants were built, ripped out and rebuilt because of design and regulatory problems, leading to ruinous costs. Examples sit across the muddy construction site: Vogtle 1 and 2, which opened in 1987 and 1989, cost $8.87 billion. When they were proposed in 1971 the estimated cost was $660 million.
For Vogtle 3 and 4, the company submitted a license application with a design described as nearly complete and received an operating license when construction had barely started, contingent on building exactly what it said it would.
The older plants, in contrast, were built by welders and pipe fitters and electricians who were working from incomplete plans that were conflicting, vague or inadequate to meet regulatory standards.
In a second innovation, Southern chose a system in which large sections of the plant would be prefabricated in multiton sections, shipped to the site and welded together into gigantic modules, then loaded into place by the world's largest crane.
But with construction now roughly one-third complete, it is clear that much is not going as planned, and that the schedule -- which is closely linked to cost because of growing interest expense on the incomplete asset -- has slipped by at least 14 months and possibly more.
Still, all is not lost. Some of the changes since the company committed to the project seven years ago have helped it along; interest rates are at historical lows and the price for labor and materials has been held down by recession.
But the company that was supposed to be making prefabricated parts like clockwork, from a factory in Lake Charles, La., was shipping them with some parts missing or without required paperwork. Southern built a cavernous ''module assembly building,'' 120 feet high and 300 feet long, where the parts were supposed to be welded together, largely by robots, into segments weighing thousands of tons. But shipments stopped last August and are still arriving too slowly.
The builders ''kind of stumbled,'' said William Jacobs, a longtime nuclear engineer hired by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor construction. Mr. Jacobs said it remained to be seen whether modular construction would actually save time.
In the assembly building one recent afternoon, Anna McLendon, a supplier compliance engineer at Southern, stood in her fluorescent yellow safety vest with her iPad and four pens and observed the operations.
''It's amazingly exciting,'' said Ms. McLendon, who recently returned from Lake Charles, where Southern is trying to help straighten out its supplier.
Ms. McLendon studied mechanical engineering and nuclear engineering at Georgia Tech but like most of the workers here, she has never seen a nuclear plant being built. She was an infant when Vogtle 2 was finished.
The modules are just one problem. In the six-foot-thick basement of the plant, contractors painstakingly wove 1,200 tons of steel reinforcing bar together but connected the bars differently from the way the design specified. In the 1980s it would have made no difference, but today it requires a license amendment -- a delay of seven and a half months.
Mr. Jacobs, the construction monitor, said delays could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost.
According to some staff members of the Public Service Commission, if there is no future tax on carbon dioxide emissions (which would raise the cost of alternatives) and if the price of natural gas stays low, the benefits of building the plant are razor-thin and could be eliminated by further delays and cost increases.
Others are more dire. Mark Cooper, an economic analyst affiliated with the Vermont Law School Institute for Energy and the Environment, predicted in a study in March that over their lifetimes, Vogtle 3 and 4 would cost $10 billion more than the alternatives. The reason that utilities choose nuclear plants, he argued, is that they can collect profits on their investments. In Georgia they can do so even before the plant is finished.
Local support is strong, however, in a county previously dominated by farming cotton, peanuts, soy and corn. Roads are now dotted with signs offering housing to construction workers.
Near the main entrance, Greg Hawkins opened Greg's Convenience in 1984, to sell bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches to the workers who built Vogtle 1 and 2. When plans for units 3 and 4 were announced, his son Shane tore the place down and built a bigger store opening at 4 a.m. daily. Shane Hawkins has since branched out into real estate, offering parking spots for the RVs that some workers live in behind his shop.
For the duration of construction, business is great. ''There are so many people here, you could sell an Eskimo a refrigerator,'' said the elder Mr. Hawkins. And while Unit 3 is now scheduled to be finished in 2017, he thinks it will be longer. ''They're going to get some more behind,'' he said. ''It's in the nature of things this big.''

HEADLINE: Health Care's Overlooked Cost Factor

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
When the Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Corporation merged its two hospitals with the neighboring Highland Park Hospital just north of Chicago 13 years ago, the deal was presented as an opportunity to increase efficiency and improve the quality of patient care.
But when the Federal Trade Commission finally decided to look at the deal, it encountered an entirely different objective: to gain market power.
Mark Neaman, Evanston's chief executive, had told his board that the deal would ''increase our leverage, limited as it might be,'' the investigation found, and ''help our negotiating posture'' with managed care organizations.
The commission caught Ronald Spaeth, the Highland Park C.E.O., talking about the corporation's three hospitals and explaining how ''it would be real tough for any of the Fortune 40 companies in this area whose C.E.O.'s either use this place or that place to walk from Evanston, Highland Park, Glenbrook and 1,700 of their doctors." 
It was a great deal for the hospitals. The fees they charged to insurers soared. One insurer, UniCare, said it had to accept a jump of 7 to 30 percent for its health maintenance organizations and 80 percent for its preferred provider organizations.
Aetna said it swallowed price increases of 45 to 47 percent over a three-year period. ''There probably would have been a walkaway point with the two independently,'' testified Robert Mendonsa, an Aetna general manager for sales and network contracting. ''But with the two together, that was a different conversation.''
And who was left holding the bag? Not the shareholders of UniCare or Aetna. It was the people who bought their policies, who either paid higher premiums directly or whose wages grew more slowly to compensate for the rising cost of their company health plans.
The commission's unusual investigation of the aftermath of the Evanston-Highland Park deal produced its first successful antitrust case against a hospital merger since 1990, after a string of defeats in court. Highland Park and Evanston were forced to negotiate separately with insurers, rather than as a bundle. Collusion was forbidden.
What was learned from the investigation is more relevant than ever today. It should draw policy makers' attention to an elephant in the room that appears to have been overlooked in the debate over how to rein in the galloping cost of health care: a lack of competition in what is now America's biggest business -- accounting for almost 18 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
Our anguished search for ways to slow runaway health spending has so far mostly focused on how to eliminate waste: Might the fee-for-service system used by health care providers across the nation provide perverse incentives for doctors and hospitals to prescribe costly yet pointless treatments? Are doctors prescribing every possible test to insulate themselves from any conceivable lawsuit?
The Obama administration is betting heavily on waste control to address the problem. It has offered incentives for accountable care organizations, which get a bundled payment to keep a patient in good health rather than charge for individual procedures. It has financed research into comparative effectiveness -- hoping to steer patients to the best therapies.
What is missing from the stampede of policy innovation is something to tackle one of the best-known causes of high costs in the book: excessive market concentration.
Two decades ago, there were on average about four rival hospital systems of roughly equal size in each metropolitan area, according to research by Martin S. Gaynor of Carnegie Mellon University and Robert J. Town of the University of Pennsylvania. By 2006, the number of competitors was down to three.
The share of metropolitan areas with highly concentrated hospital markets, by the standards of antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, rose to 77 percent from 63 percent over the period.
And consolidation is continuing. Professor Gaynor counts more than 1,000 hospital system mergers since the mid-1990s, often involving dozens of hospitals. In 2002 doctors owned about three in four physician practices. By 2008 more than half were owned by hospitals.
If there is one thing that economists know, it is that market concentration drives prices up -- and quality and innovation down.
Research by Leemore S. Dafny of Northwestern University, for instance, found that hospitals raise prices by about 40 percent after the merger of nearby rivals.
Other studies have found that hospital mergers increase the number of uninsured in the vicinity. Still others even suggest that market concentration may hurt the quality of care.
Indeed, for all the emphasis on curbing waste, recent evidence suggests that health care costs are not being driven by intensive use of high-tech procedures as much as by rising prices for even the most humdrum treatments, which are today among the most expensive in the world.
''The primary drivers of health care costs are prices,'' said Professor Dafny, who was appointed last year to the newly created post of deputy director for health care and antitrust at the F.T.C. ''Utilization growth is slowing.''
The rate of increase in health care spending has slowed. Since 2009 health care spending has been growing less than 4 percent per year, the slowest rate in more than half a century, according to number crunchers from the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But it is still outpacing inflation by a significant margin, despite a sharp slowdown in the use of medical services.
And according to the Health Care Cost Institute, an academic institute started two years ago, the rising health care spending of Americans under 65 in the last two years has been driven entirely by rising prices; not by more use. The unit price of inpatient care jumped 5.9 percent last year, while the price for outpatient services increased 9.6 percent.
Between 2009 and 2011 the fee for an outpatient visit to the emergency room rose 17 percent. The price of a routine office visit to a primary care doctor rose 8 percent. The price of radiology services rose 12 percent.
Some parts of the government are worried about competition. Since the Evanston case, the Federal Trade Commission has won about half a dozen cases against hospital mergers.
Corporate America could help more. Large companies, like Wal-Mart Stores, Lowe's and PepsiCo, have cut deals with hospitals like the Mayo Clinic or the Cleveland Clinic to provide specialized care, including cardiac care or spinal surgery, for all their workers across the nation. This will allow them to get around the market power of local hospitals. Others could follow their example.
The Affordable Care Act could help reduce prices too. Forced to compete on price, plans in the new health insurance exchanges will pressure medical providers to limit costs, much as H.M.O.'s did briefly in the 1990s. The ''Cadillac tax'' on high-end health plans will also encourage some companies to drop high-priced policies.
But some provisions of the health care overhaul are potentially troubling. Professor Gaynor, for instance, worries that accountable care organizations may prove anticompetitive. Merger activity has jumped in anticipation of the law's coming fully into effect.
''Hospitals want to maintain their revenue streams and enhance their bargaining leverage,'' said Professor Gaynor. ''This is a way to do so.''
To ''bend the curve'' of health care costs downward, their leverage must stop growing.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, Interest Rates Are Rising

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
It has been a reliable fact of life for investors, corporations and ordinary borrowers: interest rates, for the most part, keep heading lower.
But all of that may be about to change. For prospective homeowners, the cost of mortgages has been going up in recent weeks. Governments are also facing the prospect of higher borrowing costs down the road, and they are projecting increases to their debt burdens. Savers with money in bank accounts, on the other hand, have the prospect of finally earning more than a pittance on their deposits.
The interest rate charged by lenders, often cited as the single most important factor behind economic decisions, has been steadily going down for most of the time since the early 1980s, and has fallen to historical lows since the financial crisis. Over the last few months, though, investors and banks have been demanding higher payments for their loans, pushing up interest rates and bond yields.
The first tremors have been felt most sharply on investment products that were reliant on low rates, like bonds issued by American companies. But the movement is quickly spreading out into the real economy. 
''I think you all should be ready, because rates are going to go up,'' Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told a financial industry conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday.
As investors brace themselves for a new era of higher interest rates, global markets in bonds, currencies and stocks have experienced spasms of turmoil. On Tuesday, the catalyst for the market's volatility was disappointment over the Bank of Japan's decision not to take new steps to address rising bond yields. That heightened worries that other central banks -- the Federal Reserve in particular -- will soon pull back on pumping money into the financial system.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed has taken unprecedented steps to reduce rates, in an effort to stimulate borrowing and economic growth and bring down the unemployment rate. Recently, though, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, signaled that the central bank could scale back its efforts in coming months if the economy improved. But there is much debate on Wall Street over what Mr. Bernanke is planning and when it might take shape.
Several prominent money managers say they believe that the economic recovery is weakening, which will make it impossible for Mr. Bernanke to pare the central bank's intervention and could lead to falling rates again. Interest rates have experienced temporary spikes a number of times in recent decades before heading back down.
But recent economic reports, including last Friday's job report, suggest that the economy is slowly recovering.
In anticipation of what the Fed may do, many on Wall Street have been preparing their portfolios for a future in which interest rates do not remain at the low levels of the last few years. In a survey of 500 large investors, 43 percent said they were planning to cut back on their exposure to bonds this year, while only 16 percent are planning to increase it, according to the asset manager Natixis.
The recent efforts to adjust to higher bond yields have already been messy. Investors have been piling out of supposedly safe bond funds that have been a source of reliable returns in recent years, creating unexpected volatility in the markets.
Big American asset managers who borrowed money to buy foreign stocks and bonds have recently been selling those holdings, hurting markets around the world. That has been worsened by data suggesting that economic growth may be slowing outside the United States.
The realignment in the markets was evident on Tuesday as Asian and European stock markets fell. In the United States, stocks swung widely, with the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closing down 1.02 percent. Treasury prices fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note as high as 2.29 percent -- its highest level since April 2012 -- before settling at 2.19 percent. The Japanese yen strengthened 2.8 percent against the dollar.
Many market specialists say they think that a transition could go more smoothly in the long run if interest rates continue to rise as the United States economy grows. Still, even in that optimistic situation, a wide array of market participants will have to shift their operating procedures and assumptions from a world where declining interest rates were a given.
''When past performance has been so consistent, the risk that investors underestimate the risk, I think has consistently been an issue,'' said Richard Ketchum, the president of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees brokers.
The recent market volatility highlights the connection between Wall Street investors and consumers. Banks set mortgage rates in line with the yields on mortgage-backed bonds, for example. So as a sell-off has hit the market for such bonds, causing their yields to rise, ordinary borrowers end up paying more.
The rising cost of a new mortgage has already pushed down the number of people refinancing old mortgages, putting a crimp on a recent source of extra income for many households.
The looming question now is whether higher mortgage rates could stall the rally in home prices that has been taking place across the country.
Many real estate analysts say that homes are so affordable that even a considerable rise in interest rates would not do much to undermine the housing recovery, especially if the economy is growing at a healthy rate.
''There's no strong correlation between interest rates and home prices,'' said Douglas Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae.
But Joshua Rosner, a managing director at the research company Graham Fisher & Company, said many Americans were still so heavily indebted that even a small rise in mortgage rates would hit the housing market. ''Affordability is already a problem, and rising rates won't help that,'' he said.
For governments around the world, a rise in rates will eventually push up their borrowing costs at a time when they may still be grappling with fiscal deficits. Some countries will probably be able to take a steady increase in their stride. But a jarring wave of selling has recently hit certain bond markets in Latin America and Europe, pushing up borrowing costs for governments there.
Recent market moves have also been an unpleasant jolt for ordinary savers who have come to view bonds as a stable anchor for any retirement account. The Vanguard total bond market mutual fund fell 2.7 percent last month after returning a steady 5.4 percent a year since 2008. Funds holding junk bonds, which were one of the hottest investments in recent years, have suffered even more.
Some managers argue that the important thing is to shift between different types of bonds, de-emphasizing longer-term, government-issued bonds. But whatever the mix, it is likely that bonds will present a risk to investors that they have not in recent history.
''There's no doubt we're living through the end of a generational bull market in bonds,'' said Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Dialogue With the South Collapses

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Just days after North and South Korea agreed to hold their first high-level government meeting in six years, the plans appear to have collapsed over a disagreement about whether the intended delegations were of similar rank.
South Korea said that the talks, scheduled to start on Wednesday, were canceled but that it was still open to dialogue with the North. 
The agreement to meet had been seen as a clear sign that the two Koreas were moving toward a thaw after years of recriminations. The tensions reached a peak this year when the North's third nuclear test prompted broad international sanctions and the North responded with threats that it could launch nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States.
But right up until the eve of the talks, North and South Korea were arguing over who should be their chief delegates to the meeting.
South Korea proposed sending its unification minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, as the top delegate and asked North Korea to send Kim Yang-gon, a Workers Party secretary in charge of relations with the South, as Mr. Ryoo's counterpart. But the North balked, insisting that Mr. Kim was above a minister's level -- an assertion the South did not accept.
North Korea eventually appointed a party official lower in rank than Mr. Kim as its chief delegate, but the South said it would then send a lower-level official than Mr. Ryoo.
North Korea then accused the South of a ''grave provocation'' and told the South that it would not send a delegation to Seoul, said Kim Hyung-suk, a South Korean government spokesman.
''We consider the North Korean decision very regrettable,'' Mr. Kim said. The North had not yet responded as of early Wednesday morning.
It has always been difficult to determine which officials are equivalent in authority in the very different political systems of the two Koreas. But the inability to resolve the dispute reflected a deeper standoff, analysts said.
The mutual mistrust between the two governments has deepened in recent years, as North Korea conducted nuclear tests and provoked South Korea militarily; the South then pulled back from its ''sunshine policy'' of working to engage the North. Consecutive conservative governments in Seoul complained that years of ample aid and investment had not persuaded Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arms program.
''The collapse of the government talks shows how rigid the South and North Korean authorities have become,'' said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.
The government of President Park Geun-hye of South Korea has repeatedly vowed to break the ''vicious cycle'' of the North's provocations -- in which it has been rewarded with gestures of appeasement, including aid, by its adversaries. Such a firm stance has proved popular in South Korea, with Ms. Park's approach being cited as one of her biggest strengths in public surveys. But critics this week expressed fear that by allowing the talks to collapse over what they view as a point of pride, Ms. Park was wasting an opportunity to ease tensions.
''If the South Korean government is really willing to resolve the standing issues with North Korea through dialogue, it could have shown some flexibility,'' Mr. Cheong said.
The North proposed the talks shortly after its benefactors in China prodded its leader, Kim Jong-un, to take steps to diminish tensions on the peninsula. The North has also been suffering economically under intensified sanctions leveled because of its nuclear program, and its leaders might have hoped that re-engagement with the South would lead to renewed investment.
The Koreas were to discuss reversing the recent suspension of their joint operation of an industrial complex, and revising other economic and humanitarian projects that faltered a few years ago amid tensions over North Korean nuclear tests, international sanctions and threats of war.
The industrial park at Kaesong, a North Korean border town, was shuttered in April when North Korea pulled out all of its 53,000 workers and accused the United States and South Korea of raising military tensions. The factory park had been the last and best-known symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement efforts from 1998 to 2008.
Representatives of the two countries met on the border on Sunday to sort out the details of this week's talks, but they left the dispute over the chief delegates unresolved.

HEADLINE: Japan's Central Bank Holds Steady on a Policy of Monetary Stimulus

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan held its policy steady on Tuesday, brushing off recent market volatility and standing by an ambitious target to stoke 2 percent inflation in two years, despite skepticism from within its own ranks over how quickly it can lift Japan's economy out of its long deflationary slump.
Stock market reaction was swift and negative. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 stock index fell almost 200 points, or 1.5 percent, marking another day of turbulent trade. European stocks picked up the pace, with the Euro Stoxx 50 down 2.1 percent in afternoon trading. Wall Street stock indexes opened with a loss of about 1 percent. 
David Hussey, head of European equities at Manulife Asset Management in London, said the equities drop was the result of concern about the potential end of economic stimulus in general.
''People are worried that the Fed would taper off quantitative easing,'' Mr. Hussey said about the United States Federal Reserve board. ''It could go wrong if they do it too early, but I think at some point that stimulus will have to come off as the economy is starting its healing process. and that ought to be a good thing.''
In a unanimous vote at the end of a two-day policy meeting, the Bank of Japan's board decided to stay pat on a policy to grow its base money, or the cash and deposits the bank holds, by between 60 trillion yen and 70 trillion yen a year ($600 billion to $700 billion a year), which in turn increases the funds that flow through the Japanese economy and encourages companies to borrow and invest.
The bank also raised its assessment of the Japanese economy, saying Japan's economy was ''picking up,'' a slight improvement over its appraisal last month that the economy was ''starting to pick up.'' The brighter outlook came after revised government data showed Japan's economy grew at a rate of 1.0 percent between January and March, faster than a preliminary estimate of 0.9 percent, due to stronger corporate capital and household spending
''Japan's economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path'' thanks to resilient domestic demand and the effects of its aggressive monetary easing program, the bank said in a statement.
Since April, the Bank of Japan has embarked on monetary stimulus of an unprecedented scale in a bid to jolt the Japanese economy out of 15 years of deflation, part of a wider economic growth push introduced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Under Haruhiko Kuroda, its new governor, the central bank pledged to double Japan's money supply in two years through aggressive purchases of government bonds and other assets. It also committed to a target to hit 2 percent inflation over the next two years, a goal that some economists say is overly ambitious in a country that has seen prices fall for 15 years.
In a sign of faltering confidence, one board member, Takahide Kiuchi, proposed replacing that two-year target with a less ambitious commitment to achieving 2 percent inflation ''in the medium to long term.'' That proposal was voted down by the other eight members on the bank's policy board, according to the bank's statement.
''It's true that the road to 2 percent will be long,'' Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference following the decision. To get there, he said, other facets of Prime Minister Abe's economic growth program needed to kick in, bringing about a rebound in jobs, wages and demand. ''Once the entire economy enters a positive cycle, we will see prices stabilize at 2 percent,'' he said, adding that for now, the bank's policy push was ''on track.''
The central bank also held off from introducing measures to keep down Japan's long-term interest rates, a move expected by some economists ahead of the meeting.
Yields on benchmark 10-year government bonds spiked in late May as prices of those bonds slumped, causing investor jitters over Japan's ability to keep funding, and servicing, its colossal public debt. Those fears helped end a spectacular rally in the Japanese stock market this year and brought several weeks of volatile trading.
One measure floated by economists that might calm investor nerves had been to extend a low-interest loan program that would make it easier for financial institutions to buy government bonds even if interest rates started rising. But that runs counter to the bank's goal of shifting corporate investment out of low-interest bonds to higher-yielding equities and borrowing.
Mr. Kuroda said that the board had discussed such measures, but ultimately decided fresh steps were unnecessary for the time being. He has said that the recent rise in long-term interest rates is a healthy reflection of inflation expectations, and does not pose an immediate threat to the Japanese economy.
He stressed that the bank has had a measure of success in reducing volatility in bond markets by conducting its bond purchases more frequently, in smaller amounts. He said that the bank would sustain those efforts, and would watch financial markets closely.
''We continue to be wary of movements in long-term interest rates, especially undesirable spikes in volatility, and will keep up efforts to reduce that volatility,'' he said. ''But the economy is on a solid path to recovery, and I expect financial markets to soon reflect that, and regain composure.''

HEADLINE: Raising the Cigarette Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gail Collins writes (column, June 6) that President Obama's plan to strengthen early childhood learning with a tobacco tax increase needs a ''groundswell'' of public demand. I agree: all Americans should urge their members of Congress to pass this. 
In addition to helping expand preschool, a higher tobacco tax would significantly reduce smoking, especially among children. Even tobacco companies admit this in their internal documents.
The Congressional Budget Office and other respected economic institutions agree that tobacco tax increases both raise revenue and cut tobacco consumption. The proposed 94-cent cigarette tax per pack would prevent more than a million children from smoking, saving hundreds of thousands of lives.
The Federal Trade Commission just reported that the tobacco industry increased marketing spending significantly in 2011. The industry is ramping up marketing to children, mainly with price-discounting schemes. Congress should counterstrike by raising the price of tobacco products aimed at children.

HEADLINE: Will Common Core Improve Schools?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a recovering high school math teacher who left the profession to pursue a career in finance, I was dismayed by ''Who's Minding the Schools?,'' by Andrew Hacker and Claudia Dreifus (Sunday Review, June 9).
The Common Core curriculum aims to replace outdated teaching methods with an approach emphasizing analytical and critical thinking skills. The authors focused almost exclusively on the ''tougher standards, and eventually higher standardized test scores.'' What about the substance of the Common Core curriculum? 
Last year I took a workshop on the new high school curriculum. I was amazed at the relevance of the material and the pedagogical approach. Students will be directed to work on problems in teams, sometimes with incomplete information, so they need to work creatively and collaboratively. They need to be able to explain how they got their answers. It felt more like my work in the private sector and less like the traditional classroom.
I think that we all agree -- the old approach was not working.
CECELIA BEIRNE New York, June 10, 2013
To the Editor:
The Common Core State Standards will undoubtedly be revised over time and through experience, but they do provide a basis for conversation about teaching and learning.
The sticking point rests not with the standards, but with the ways in which we attempt to measure student learning through a combination of multiple-choice test items and short essays.
Learning is a very complex human enterprise. It is a building up of a depth and breadth of knowledge and skills over time through a process that includes trial and error, interpretation and analysis, ''aha'' moments of discovery, and applying what we have learned to different situations.
Standardized tests are flawed because they decontextualize learning and attempt to break it up into tiny measurable segments. With learning, the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts that we do measure.
HOWARD MILLER Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., June 9, 2013
The writer is chairman of the department of secondary education at Mercy College School of Education.
To the Editor:
Isn't arguing about the Common Core State Standards rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic? Until we address the increase in childhood poverty and the rising disparity in incomes, as well as the disparity in funding across states, we will not truly address the way we as a society fail our children.
JERRY WEBSTER Henderson, Nev., June 9, 2013
The writer is a special education teacher and writes about special education for About.com.
To the Editor:
Given the Common Core's focus on testing in English and math, to the detriment of social studies, schools around the nation are significantly reducing the time and resources invested in the teaching of American history, government and economics.
In a nation of immigrants, it is the shared understanding of our history, as well as our political and economic principles, that makes us Americans. A Common Core that weakens that understanding of what America is, and what it means to be an American, will only make us have less in common.
RICH WOHL Morristown, N.J., June 10, 2013
To the Editor:
''Who's Minding the Schools?'' quoted from a Common Core English Language Arts test given to New York State eighth-grade students. The test challenged the students to draw a conclusion from the following text:
''Local pride in the preservation of cultural things that belong to the old days should be stimulated wherever possible, particularly in the minority groups. Remember that the Anglo-Saxon music that we are inclined to think of as the only 'American' kind is a relatively recent importation on this continent, exactly as the Hungarian, Finnish, and Armenian folk musics are.''
The correct answer is F, for the test's own failing grade. What does it say about an English Language Arts test partly written in prose so clumsy that one hopes it will never be imitated by students taking the exam?

HEADLINE: Business Picked Up in April For Wholesalers, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American wholesalers increased their stockpiles in April, and their sales rebounded from a big decline in March, positive signs for economic growth.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that stockpiles at the wholesale level rose 0.2 percent in April. That followed a 0.3 percent gain in March. 
Sales in April increased 0.5 percent, the best showing since February. In March, sales plunged 1.4 percent.
The April increase left stockpiles at the wholesale level at $504.8 billion, up 4.1 percent from a year ago and 31.2 percent above the recession low.
An increase in restocking can drive more economic growth because it indicates companies are ordering more goods from American factories.
The April gain was led by a 1.9 percent increase in restocking of autos and auto parts. Stockpiles of furniture, lumber and computer equipment also posted solid gains.
Inventories of machinery, farm products and chemicals were down in April.
The economy grew at a 2.4 percent rate annual from January through March, up from a 0.4 percent rate in the previous quarter.
Growth accelerated in the first quarter largely because consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in more than two years. That also provided more incentive for businesses to restock shelves after many cut back on inventory-building at the end of last year.
Many economists suspect that growth has slowed in the current April-June quarter, to an annual rate of 2 percent or less. Economists say part of that reflects a slowdown in production at American factories, stemming from weakness overseas that has dampened demand for exports. Some economists also say businesses could be worried about the impact of federal spending cuts.
A stronger job market has helped offset some of the weakness from the spending cuts and higher payroll taxes.

HEADLINE: China Is Fertile Ground For Crop of Luxury Hotels

BYLINE: By MIKE IVES

 BODY:
LIJIANG, China -- Tourists from China's crowded coasts have long considered this city of 1.2 million in the Himalayan foothills to be a scenic getaway.
Its hotel choices are still predominantly low- and mid-range properties, but a few of the world's top luxury hotel brands are putting the final touches on properties here in hopes of attracting the country's growing ranks of extremely wealthy travelers.
As economic growth has slowed in Europe and the United States, Asian locations now dominate lists of the current and projected hot spots for luxury hotel and resort growth. And Asia-based planners from leading luxury hotel groups say China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, is the top regional priority.
''There are several hot spots there because China is so massive,'' said David Spooner, vice president of sales and marketing at Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts, which opened Lijiang's first international-standard luxury property in 2006. And, he added, the country's luxury sector is flourishing because ''a growing market of Chinese travelers is much more sophisticated.'' 
In April, 253 of the 458 branded luxury hotel projects under construction or in the final planning stages were in the Asia-Pacific region, according to STR Global, a hotel research company.
And of all such Asia-Pacific projects -- branded and independent, and across all economic categories -- 58 percent were in China, the company said.
China will not be the only driver of Asia's future luxury hotel growth. Top-end hotel brands say they are expanding in India's cities and southwestern region, and that there is considerable buzz about Sri Lanka and Myanmar, countries where, until recently, unrest and political issues had limited visits by international travelers.
''Myanmar, at least medium to long term, has the potential to be a top tourism destination that could rival Thailand,'' said Michel Van der Hoeven, senior vice president of projects and development at Anantara Hotels, Resorts & Spas, a luxury hotel group based in Bangkok with properties in Asia and the Middle East. ''It has amazing culture, it has natural beauty, it has heritage -- what's lacking there is good-quality properties.''
The country has just two luxury hotels, both in Yangon: The Governor's Residence, an Orient-Express property, and The Strand, which is operated by Myanmar Hotels International, a joint venture of the government's Tourism Ministry and Strand Hotels International.
But there are several high-end resorts in the central city of Bagan that could potentially qualify as luxury properties, said Jonas Ogren, Asia director at STR Global. And industry experts say the country's undeveloped islands offer immense potential, although construction is likely to be several years away at best.
They also say destinations in Bhutan and Laos are beginning to attract interest among luxury hotel groups, as are Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and undeveloped islands in Indonesia and the Philippines.
But the industry's primary focus is on China.
''China is obviously a key market for us,'' said Chris Hart, president of Asia-Pacific hotel operations at Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. ''I think eventually we will have as many hotels in China as we do in the United States.''
The group, which manages 31 U.S. properties, now has five in mainland China, with a sixth to open this year in Shenzhen and another under construction in Tianjin, a city of 10 million southeast of Beijing.
Mr. Hart said the company, which is based in Canada, was expanding across China partly to expose its citizens to the brand and encourage them to stay in other Four Seasons properties.
The number of annual overseas trips by Chinese travelers has risen to 83 million last year from 10 million in 2000, according to the U.N. World Tourism Organization. And their 2012 spending on international tourism -- $102 billion -- helped China overtake Germany to become the world's largest source of tourism spending.
''We want to be their first choice when they go on vacation, whether to the Maldives or to Paris or New York,'' Mr. Hart said.
While Beijing and Shanghai already have well-developed luxury hotel markets, they still can accommodate more growth -- especially boutique properties with 80 to 150 rooms, said Damien Little, Asia director at Horwath HTL, an international hotel and tourism consulting firm.
Mr. Little said there are already luxury hotels in the coastal cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou, destinations that appeal to tourists with a picturesque lake and traditional gardens, respectively.
And some luxury brands -- including Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton and Kempinski -- are operating in Sanya, a tropical resort destination on Hainan Island in the South China Sea that has been developing for more than 20 years.
But when it comes to luxury and mid-range hotels, ''much of China's development has been urban-related, and Sanya's really the only significant leisure-slash-resort destination that's developed to any great scale in the last decade,'' Mr. Little said.
The lure of China's wealth now has major luxury brands wading into second-tier cities that are not typically regarded as tourist magnets. Ritz-Carlton, for example, is planning to open hotels soon in Tianjin as well as Chengdu, a city of 14 million in the southwestern province of Sichuan. And Fairmont and Kempinski will soon be established in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi, a northern province known for its coal mines.
Andrew Hirst, Asia operations manager at Mandarin Oriental, said luxury hotels in China's second-tier cities are beginning to cater to leisure travelers as well as those on business trips. As the economy grows, people are ''getting wealthy and wanting to enjoy the better things in life,'' he said.
And China's scenic areas and hot springs are said to be promising destinations for luxury brands. Mr. Little of Horwath HTL said the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan were the primary hot spots in that emerging market.
In Yunnan, Banyan Tree operates two resorts and is planning to open two more next year. Aman and St. Regis say they plan to open their first Lijiang locations in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Anantara opened in southern Yunnan in February.
When Banyan Tree Lijiang opened in 2006, about 80 percent to 90 percent of its guests were international tourists, but since 2008 more than 70 percent have been wealthy Chinese, many of them business executives and their relatives from the major coastal cities, said the hotel manager, Jeff Wang.
The resort, which includes 84 villas and 42 suites, lies inside a walled compound on the city's unassuming outskirts and was built mostly from stone. The interiors are decorated in bold reds and blacks -- in keeping with the vernacular architecture of the Naxi, a local ethnic minority group.
On a recent Sunday evening, the grounds were quiet as Zhang Gang, a construction executive from Zhuhai, a city near Macau on China's southern coast, ordered mushroom soup at one of the resort's restaurants.
Mr. Zhang, 40, said he would much rather pay 18,365 renminbi, or $3,000, per night for a Banyan Tree villa than stay in Lijiang's touristy Old Town and endure 4,290 renminbi-per-night hotels, which he said are cramped and noisy.
''They weren't my style, but here I feel at peace,'' he said in an empty dining room. The view was of an open-air pagoda framing the snow-capped peaks of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, Lijiang's signature landscape feature.
Mr. Zhang said he expected the resort to prosper as the Chinese elite grow even wealthier, in part because Lijiang is an appealing destination for avid golfers like himself. His only complaint was that Banyan Tree has no locations in North America, where he owns a second home and often travels on business.

HEADLINE: Robert W. Fogel, Nobel-Winning Economist, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.; Bruce Weber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Robert W. Fogel, a Nobel-winning economist whose number-crunching empiricism upended established thinking, most provocatively about the economics of slavery, died on Tuesday in Oak Lawn, Ill. He was 86.
His death was announced by the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, where he had been a distinguished professor. He lived in the Hyde Park section of Chicago.
Professor Fogel, a rumpled former New Yorker by turns amiable and combative, was widely known for work that aroused objections if not open hostility in academic circles, chiefly through his pioneering use of cliometrics, which applies economic theory and statistical methods to the study of history. (Clio was history's muse in Greek mythology.)
He first came to prominence in 1964, when he contended that railroads had been far less important to the nation's growth than economists had long asserted. An outgrowth of doctoral work at Johns Hopkins University, his book ''Railroads and American Economic Growth'' became an immediate classic. 
But it was the publication 10 years later of ''Time on the Cross,'' a two-volume study of slavery, written with Stanley L. Engerman, that propelled Professor Fogel into the critical spotlight and instant celebrity.
They contended that slavery had not been, as widely portrayed, an inefficient system destined for collapse, with slaves living in virtual concentration camps and worked to death.
Rather, after studying medical records, cotton yields and other data, the authors argued that slavery had been highly efficient in utilizing economies of scale and that plantation owners had regarded workers as economic assets whom they were inclined to treat at least as well as livestock. This tended to limit exploitation, Professor Fogel and his colleague found, declaring, in fact, that slave life in the South was generally better than that of industrial workers in the North.
An intellectual firestorm resulted. Some critics accused Professor Fogel, who was married to an African-American woman, of being an apologist for slavery, though he and Professor Engerman had been explicit in acknowledging that slaves had been exploited in ways not captured by statistical data.
Despite the attacks, the authors did not budge from their findings and their main point -- that slavery would not have ended without the Civil War.
''Everything Bob touches is controversial,'' said Claudia D. Goldin, a former student of Professor Fogel's and now an economics professor at Harvard. ''It stems from the fact that he thinks outside the box.''
Professor Fogel received the Nobel in economic science in 1993, sharing it with a fellow cliometrician, Douglass C. North. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Professor Fogel for clarifying railroads' role in American economic development and the economic role of slavery.
He spent the latter decades of his career focused on demography and how standards of living, including nutritional resources, affect health and longevity. Through much of history, he found, shorter people and those with low body mass were more prone to illness.
He analyzed Civil War draft and pension records, linking them to mid-19th-century and early 20th-century census records to show how improved health enhances economic productivity.
He estimated that one-third of per capita economic growth in Britain between 1790 and 1980 was due to improved nutrition.
Professor Fogel's range of inquiry was extraordinarily wide; his monumental study of Britain, for example, involved medicine, physiology, demography and statistics in addition to economics and history. Robert A. Margo, professor of economics at Boston University, called him ''the original interdisciplinary scholar.''
In 2011 Professor Fogel and three co-authors published what The New York Times called the ''capstone'' of a huge project that had occupied decades of his later work: ''The Changing Body: Health, Nutrition and Human Development in the Western World Since 1700.''
Robert William Fogel was born on July 1, 1926, in New York City, the second of two sons of parents who had emigrated from Russia and struggled to run small businesses during the Depression. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and enrolled at Cornell, where, prompted by widespread forecasts of a postwar return to Depression-era unemployment, his interests swung from physics and chemistry to economics and history.
Before pursuing an academic career, Professor Fogel worked for years as a professional organizer for the Communist Party, which he eventually rejected.
In 1949 he married Enid Cassandra Morgan, whom he had met while she headed a Harlem youth group promoting the Progressive Party presidential candidacy of Henry A. Wallace. Their sons, Michael and Steven, both born before he began his graduate work at Columbia University, survive, as do five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Mrs. Fogel died in 2007.
In an essay for the Nobel committee, Professor Fogel wrote that he entered Columbia ''with the naïve belief that by combining the study of history and economics I would quickly discover the fundamental forces that had determined technological and institutional changes over the ages, and that such knowledge would point to solutions to the current problems of economic instability and inequity.''
He discovered, however, how little was known about these large processes and began to look at more discrete subjects, like railroad and steel technologies, employing an unorthodox approach using advanced statistical and analytical methods.
In his railroad analysis, Professor Fogel contended that wheat, corn, pork and beef -- the four major agricultural goods -- would have been shipped on existing water routes and by wagon had railroads not been available. He figured that in the absence of railroads, national output by 1890 would have been reduced by only about 5 percent.
This sharply contradicted the dominant view. A prominent contemporary, W. W. Rostow, had asserted that railroads were a major factor in the American economy's growth after the Civil War.
Many of Professor Fogel's findings have achieved broad acceptance, but criticism of the slavery work was intense. (Professor Goldin said many of the attacks came from people who had not read ''Time on the Cross.'')
One critic or another said the work relied on data from unrepresentative plantations, that the mathematics were imprecise, that it focused on the number of slaves who had been whipped rather than the frequency of the whipping, and that it failed to address the psychological effect of whipping on other slaves.
Professors Fogel and Engerman acknowledged some of the criticisms in later work but stood by their findings.
Professor Fogel taught at Johns Hopkins, the University of Rochester and Harvard in addition to the University of Chicago. He was on the faculty there from 1964 to 1975 and rejoined in 1981. He became director of the Center for Population Economics there.
In his Nobel essay, Professor Fogel paid tribute to his wife, Enid, whom he called his tireless, unpaid research assistant. ''Throughout the years she has been the overseer of my social conscience,'' he wrote, ''pulling me back to reality when she saw that my preoccupation with the abstract aspects of scientific issues had led me to extenuate their deeply human aspects.''

HEADLINE: Academy's Troubles Shadow Key Report

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
When a much-anticipated report defending the beleaguered liberal arts is released on Capitol Hill next week, it will come amid bad news beyond the usual lamentations about declining enrollments, slashed budgets and the perceived unemployability of English majors.
The report, requested with much fanfare in 2010 by a bipartisan group in Congress and produced by a blue-ribbon commission assembled by the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences, is likely to land as controversy continues to surround Leslie Cohen Berlowitz, the academy's embattled president and one of the report's prime movers. 
Last week Ms. Berlowitz stepped away from her day-to-day responsibilities at the academy, the 233-year-old scholarly society in Cambridge, Mass., during an independent inquiry into charges that she had falsely claimed, on grant applications and other documents, to hold a doctoral degree.
The charges were first reported in The Boston Globe, which also raised questions about Ms. Berlowitz's compensation and management style. The academy has attributed the claims about the degree to clerical errors. Ms. Berlowitz has so far declined to comment on the matter.
Ms. Berlowitz, who remains president of the academy and a member of the commission, will not attend the June 19 release of the report in Washington, which will include speeches by its two co-chairmen and the screening of a film featuring commission members like Ken Burns, George Lucas, John Lithgow and Yo-Yo Ma, along with scholars.
Richard H. Brodhead, president of Duke University and a co-chairman of the commission, declined to comment on the report or on Ms. Berlowitz. But John W. Rowe, former chairman of the energy corporation Exelon, the other co-chairman, praised her hard work on Tuesday while expressing hopes that the unfolding inquiry would not diminish the commission's two years of work.
''Leslie did a lot of wonderful work on the report,'' he said, ''but the commission met many times, the recommendations are ours, and the quality and caliber of the members of the commission speaks for itself.''
Such remarks may not quell unease among the academy's roughly 4,000 members, who have been buzzing about the news since it broke last week, even if few are willing to say more than a few words on the record about Ms. Berlowitz or the turmoil in Cambridge.
''I have certainly heard from other members,'' said Jesse H. Choper, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law and a member of the academy's council. ''They were concerned. I can't say more.''
The report itself, billed as the first comprehensive national assessment since the 1980 report of the Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities, is being closely guarded in advance of its release. It was requested in 2010 by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee; and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia; and Representatives David Price, Democrat of North Carolina, and Tom Petri, Republican of Wisconsin, with the mandate to suggest the top 10 steps needed to shore up the humanities, which were described as ''at risk.''
The hope is ''to change the conversation and insert and assert the importance of the humanities and social sciences,'' said Pauline Yu, the president of the American Council of Learned Societies and a member of the 54-person commission.
It arrives at a moment when others are sounding the alarm. In a report issued last week, Harvard University said that humanities majors there had fallen to 20 percent in 2012 from 36 percent in 1954 -- a grim figure until you consider that, nationwide, just 7 percent of bachelor's degrees were awarded in the humanities in 2010, down from 14 percent in 1966.
The academy's report also aims to look beyond universities to the broader culture, some members of the commission said.
''There's a world of people who never do academic humanities again after college, but who remember what they did and carry it with them and believe in it and support it,'' said Anthony Grafton, a historian at Princeton University. ''The Harvard numbers were scary, but the world is much more complicated than 'poor little humanities.' ''
As for the controversy surrounding Ms. Berlowitz, Mr. Grafton praised her as ''the life and soul of the project,'' but declined to comment further.
''We're hoping it's going to get judged on its own merits,'' he said of the report.
Privately, several people connected with the academy have questioned if unflattering attention to Ms. Berlowitz's pay might prove awkward, given that the report is, as Mr. Rowe put it, ''a full-throated plea for more public and private funding.''
According to filings with the Internal Revenue Service, Ms. Berlowitz received compensation totaling more than $598,000 for the fiscal year ending in March 2012 for leading the academy's staff of several dozen -- far more than the leaders of most similar scholarly societies, and more than many college presidents.
But others suggested that worry about Ms. Berlowitz's salary in the context of the report may be misplaced. Anthony K. Appiah, a philosopher at Princeton and a member of the commission, said he had no knowledge of Ms. Berlowitz's salary before the recent news reports, and called it ''a very good salary for a humanist.''
To focus on the salary issue, he said, is itself a sign of a deeper attitude that the humanities ''are an expensive luxury,'' he said, adding, ''I think that's just wrong.''

HEADLINE: The New Subsidy for Layoffs

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: It seems likely that the Affordable Care Act will induce more people to retire and more employers to lay workers off, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
A major provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act helps predict what will happen in the insurance market next year.
Employees and employers often take steps to avoid layoffs, like working hard to encourage customers and clients to continue buying the goods and services provided by the business. 
Sometimes layoffs are not avoided by such efforts, which is why many employers also take steps to ease the burden of a layoff on employees and their families and to minimize disputes between them and the employer. Many businesses voluntarily offer cash severance pay, which is intended to replace the usual paycheck for several weeks or months after the layoff, depending on the length of time that the employee had been with the company. (During the time of unemployment, the former employee can many times collect both the severance pay and state unemployment insurance benefits.)
Employers may also offer to help laid-off workers continue with their health insurance during the unemployment spell. (Indeed, a laid-off worker who intended to spend some severance pay on health insurance premiums would save money on taxes if the former employer were paying those premiums, even if it meant lower severance.) Severance pay and health insurance costs for former employees are significant expenses that employers presumably take into account when they decide the number and timing of their layoffs.

During 2009 and 2010, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act had the federal government pay some costs of layoffs, especially with its premium-assistance program, which paid 65 percent of the premiums that a laid-off employee would pay to stay on the former employer's health plan. People who could join a spouse's employer health plan and people without health insurance on their previous job were ineligible for the program.
Economists understand this premium assistance to be a subsidy to layoffs, making them cheaper and less of a burden. Employers saw it this way, too, according to an Urban Institute study. 
"Some large-firm interviewees reported that before A.R.R.A. they provided some amount of free or reduced cost Cobra coverage for laid-off workers, based upon the prior duration of employment," the study found, referring to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which allows workers who have lost their jobs to purchase coverage. "Several of these companies reported that they reduced or dropped this prior benefit in reaction to A.R.R.A."
Although we will learn more when (and if) the United States Treasury releases its final report on the premium-assistance program, it appears that program participation was high. An interim report indicated that perhaps two million households and even more individuals had their health insurance subsidized within nine or 10 months of starting the program.
The law's premium assistance program ended in 2010, but significant amounts of premium assistance are coming next year as a part of the Affordable Care Act. For families with income between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty line, the Affordable Care Act is even more generous than the Recovery Act, because it helps them pay for both health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs like co-payments and deductibles. Also, health insurance is more expensive now than it was in 2009, which makes a percentage subsidy that much more valuable.
Moreover, unlike the Recovery Act's program, next year's program welcomes people out of work even if they left work by quitting, retiring or being fired for cause. It also welcomes people who have the and people who had no health insurance on their prior job.
Thus, we are about to begin a federal program that subsidizes layoffs to a degree that we have not seen before. Nevertheless, economic and budget forecasts by the Congressional Budget Office and others have yet to consider the effects of the layoff subsidy on the size of the program and the number of layoffs that will occur.
The C.B.O. has concluded that 800,000 people will take early retirements or quit as a consequence of the Affordable Care Act, not from its premium assistance, but based on the assumption that the unsubsidized nongroup health insurance market will operate better. The C.B.O. still needs to estimate how many people will be laid off as a consequence of the new subsidy to layoffs.
Over all, the C.B.O. predicts that 11 million people will receive premium assistance in 2015 (and even fewer in 2014), the vast majority of whom would be employed or dependents of an employed person. Yet the Recovery Act's experience suggests that three million or four million people will receive premium assistance through unemployment alone, not to mention the millions more that receive it while working.
Be prepared for some unpleasant surprises over the next year or two, both as to the amount that the labor market is depressed and the unanticipated federal spending that will be needed to provide the benefits promised by the Affordable Care Act.

HEADLINE: Bridging Approaches to Mental Illness in Sierra Leone

BYLINE: MATT MCCANN


HIGHLIGHT: By working with faith healers and witch doctors, the doctors at a clinic in a war-ravaged district of Sierra Leone seek to draw in mentally ill patients and address medical problems usually framed in spiritual terms. 

 BODY:
War leaves all manner of scars, and the dusty towns in eastern Sierra Leone still bear the marks of a decade of civil strife. 
Cities like Koidu, in the diamond-rich Kono district, were the site of many of the atrocities carried out by rebels backed by former President Charles G. Taylor of Liberia, Sierra Leone's southern neighbor. Unfathomable acts like amputations lend a particularly gruesome hue to the murder, rape and terror that characterized the conflict. 
"The history of the war is everywhere," said Nyani Quarmyne, a Ghanaian photographer who visited last year. "There are bombed-out buildings all over the place. There are people wandering around with both their hands hacked off." 
It's this kind of trauma, shared on such a scale - an entire nation - that can drive a person to madness. "One has a sense that there are a number of damaged people wandering around," Mr. Quarmyne said. "How could there not be?" And, despite some improvements in the quality of life of the people of Sierra Leone, it still lacks effective ways to address chronic and profound corruption, poverty, unemployment and substandard health care. 
And, not least, mental health care.
Mr. Quarmyne had previously worked in his native Accra, Ghana, to document the toll of mental illness. There, he met a Prague-based writer named Catherine Cooper who told him about the Wellbody Alliance, a clinic run by Dr. Mohamed Bailor Barrie of Sierra Leone and Dr. Dan Kelly of the United States. Mr. Quarmyne and Ms. Cooper made a trip there together. With the cooperation of Wellbody staffers and the consent of the patients' family members, who were often present, they set out to understand the patients at the clinic, which blends the services of faith healers and so-called witch doctors with medicine-based psychiatry. 
In a country where mental illness is widely stigmatized, and certainly not viewed in medical terms, it's a pragmatic way to draw in patients. When the afflicted believe they married witches, were cursed by devils or swallowed evil snakes, appeals to empirical reason can seem naïve. There, mental illness is framed spiritually.
According to Mr. Quarmyne, this mixed approach worked reasonably well with the faith healer. "He's a lovely man," he said. "He would refer patients to the clinic, and in that way they received a mix of medical treatment as well as spiritual treatment from the faith healer."
Not so with the witch doctor. Motivated, perhaps, by his ego, he seemed eager to demonstrate his powers. "He had, shall we say, a very robust belief in his abilities," Mr. Quarmyne said. "At the same time, he was afraid that what the doctors really wanted to do was find out his secrets and steal them.
"There was a great deal of distrust or suspicion in that relationship," he said.
That distrust frustrates the doctors' efforts as very real needs go unmet. There was one patient who thought it was 2003, a year after the civil war ended, and who heard voices, planes and helicopters when there was silence. Another case saddened Mr. Quarmyne because the patient struck him as full of promise. Samuel (Slide 11), fiercely intelligent, creative and "remarkably articulate," Mr. Quarmyne said, "had made it as far as university, which in many ways is a really significant achievement considering the background he'd come from." But Samuel believed that he was Haile Selassie, the former Ethiopian emperor, and that he had gotten married in the underworld. He spoke of a figure he'd drawn on his wall as his spiritual interlocutor. 
What Mr. Quarmyne also found unsettling was Samuel's use of drugs, particularly marijuana. He had seen a great deal of cannabis use among mentally ill Ghanaians as well, and it struck a personal chord. Mr. Quarmyne felt that what separated him from them was arbitrary, yet decisive. "Coming from a background of relative privilege, there are a number of things that I look out and think, 'Whoa, were it not for an accident of birth, it could be me under these circumstances,' " he said.
But few others seem to care. Mr. Quarmyne's work is largely unfinanced, and his traveling partner, Ms. Cooper, has yet to find a publisher for her essay about Dr. Barrie's and Dr. Kelly's efforts. Besides the cultural obstacles, the clinic faces enormous logistical problems - maintaining a reliable supply of medications, for example, or trying to integrate its services, and psychiatry and counseling in general, with the larger Sierra Leonean health care system. "The unfortunate fact of it is, it's not a sexy topic anywhere," Mr. Quarmyne said. "Much less in this part of the world, where nobody wants to have anything to do with the mentally ill."
Mr. Quarmyne's photo series and Ms. Cooper's unpublished essay are titled "Heaven, Hell and Earth," reflecting the varying versions of medicine, well-being and spirituality they encountered in the Kono district. There is no electricity or running water in Koidu, and virtually no paved roads. Mr. Quarmyne spent his days hearing about the dark world, demons, sickness and horror. Water was fetched from a well, and at night, it was pitch black. "Some nights you would hear people singing spiritual songs at the home of the faith healer," he said. "Other nights you would hear drumming and chanting, and nobody could tell you what it was."
And there is nothing like total darkness to invite people to explore their own mental recesses. "Both Catherine and I went in there with very clear views of real versus unreal, normal versus not normal, the difference between reality, superstition, etc.," Mr. Quarmyne said. "And that got shaken up pretty well on this trip."

HEADLINE: Vodafone Pursues a German Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Vodafone has approached Kabel Deutschland about a potential takeover. | Interest rates may have reached a bottom. | The JOBS Act and the recent revival in the I.P.O. market. | New York State regulators are taking aim at transactions that life insurers use to alter their books. 

 BODY:
The British wireless giant Vodafone has approached Kabel Deutschland of Germany over a potential takeover that could be worth more than $10 billion, DealBook's Mark Scott reports. An acquisition would allow Vodafone, which owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless, to expand its cellphone operations in Germany and offset increasing competition.
"Kabel Deutschland does not just represent an opportunity for Vodafone to extract synergies but also to better defend its core business," telecommunications analysts at Espirito Santo in London told investors in a research note on Wednesday. The potential acquisition would be Vodafone's largest since it bought a controlling stake in Hutchison Essar of India for $11 billion in 2007, Mr. Scott writes.
THE END OF LOW RATES | Interest rates may have reached a bottom, Nathaniel Popper and Peter Eavis write in DealBook. It has been a fact of life since the early 1980s that the rate charged by lenders has gone down, reaching historic lows after the financial crisis with the Federal Reserve's stimulus measures. But over the last few months, investors and banks have been demanding higher payments for their loans, pushing up interest rates and bond yields. The cost of mortgages has been going up in recent weeks, and governments are now facing the prospect of higher borrowing costs down the road. 
The first tremors were felt in products reliant on low rates, like bonds issued by American companies, but the movement is spreading more broadly. Global markets in bonds, currencies and stocks have experienced spasms of turmoil. "I think you all should be ready, because rates are going to go up," Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told a financial industry conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday.
Recent economic reports suggest the economy is slowly recovering, leading many on Wall Street to prepare for the Federal Reserve to pare its stimulus program. If rates continue rising, a wide array of market participants will have to shift their assumptions. "When past performance has been so consistent, the risk that investors underestimate the risk, I think has consistently been an issue," said Richard G. Ketchum, president of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY OF THE JOBS ACT | The Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act was supposed to help revive new company offerings. Now, more than a year after the legislation was passed, the market for I.P.O.'s is indeed heating up, but the JOBS Act "has had little to do with it," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column.
Take the recent I.P.O. of the upscale grocer Fairway Group Holding. "Fairway's selective use of the JOBS Act shows that it is being used to avoid disclosure of information that may cause embarrassment to the company or alert investors of problems. But at the same time, it shows that the law may have allowed companies to get away with not disclosing financial information that investors value," Mr. Davidoff writes. "None of this has anything to do with whether Fairway would have gone public."
ON THE AGENDA | Coty is expected to price its initial public offering Wednesday evening. H&R Block reports earnings after the market closes. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen is on CNBC at 8 a.m. John Thain, head of the CIT Group, is on Bloomberg TV at 11 a.m.
REGULATOR SAYS INSURERS INFLATING BOOKS | "New York State regulators are calling for a nationwide moratorium on transactions that life insurers are using to alter their books by billions of dollars, saying that the deals put policyholders at risk and could lead to another taxpayer bailout," Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook. "Insurers' use of the secretive transactions has become widespread, nearly doubling over the last five years. The deals now affect life insurance policies worth trillions of dollars, according to an analysis done for The New York Times by SNL Financial, a research and data firm."
"Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's superintendent of financial services, said that life insurers based in New York had alone burnished their books by $48 billion, using what he called 'shadow insurance,' according to an investigation conducted by his department. He issued a report about the investigation late Tuesday. The transactions are so opaque that Mr. Lawsky said it took his team of investigators nearly a year to follow the paper trail, even though they had the power to subpoena documents."

HEADLINE: An Old-Fashioned Business Copes With Modern Tech Issues

BYLINE: EILENE ZIMMERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: What do you think? Should Mr. Reed automate &#8212; or delegate &#8212; more of his operational tasks? Should he change his e-commerce platform? 

 BODY:
This is one in an occasional series of posts that look at how small-business owners manage their technology needs.
The Business: formfunctionform in Orlando, Fla., is a year-old leather-working business owned by Shawn Reed, 35, who makes products such as wallets and watchbands in a home studio. Forty percent of his sales last year came between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which coincided with the introduction of his "Button-Stud Weekender" watch (he designed the band). Mentions in Esquire, Dappered, Free/Man, A&H Magazine and A Headlong Dive, as well as consistent business with Huckberry, has kept sales brisk enough, he said, for him to "scale responsibly and maintain quality."
The Owner: In his previous life, Mr. Reed worked as a landscape architect. After 10 years, he left to get a master's degree in economics at George Mason University and finished in early 2010, a time when the recession was lingering and his interest in landscape architecture was waning. A few years earlier, he had started working with leather, even tracking down a specific leather he wanted to make a bracelet from a tannery in Chicago. He enjoyed the process so much he taught himself to make other items. 
Old School Tools: Mr. Reed begins by creating pencil sketches in a moleskin notebook. His studio is equipped with two large rectangular tables and a variety of hand tools for making holes, a beveler for rounding corners, X-Acto knives for cutting pattern pieces on leather and a burnisher - a small, hardwood wheel attached to a Dremel rotary tool that smooths the leather's edges. The studio also has three hand presses. One, a larger hydraulic press, is a standard shop press that a local welder modified for Mr. Reed, who uses it to carve patterns into leather. "It's like a heavy-duty cookie cutter," he said. Two smaller hand presses made by YKK Snap Fasteners America set rivets and snaps. Everything is hand-stitched using large needles. There's also an electric branding iron Mr. Reed uses to burn his logo into the leather.
New School Tools: After Mr. Reed sketches, he draws his idea on his Apple Mac Pro desktop using AutoCAD, an architectural drafting program he used in his previous career. AutoCAD lets him draw very precisely - to 124th of an inch - and then he prints the drawing full size and uses it as a pattern. When he gets exactly what he wants, he sends the drawing and corresponding measurements to a company in Texas that creates a heavy-duty cutter, called a die, for his press.
For his e-commerce site, Mr. Reed uses WooCommerce, a WordPress e-commerce platform, along with MaxCDN, a content-delivery network that speeds up his Web site by serving it from the closest location to a customer. "I got my load time down from 35 seconds to two," Mr. Reed said. He pays $10 a month to use Outright for bookkeeping, he uses a free version of FreshBooks for invoicing, he uses Google Voice as his free phone service, and he pays $25 a month for ShipStation, which provides shipping labels and tracking information. Some of his corporate customers still use a fax, so he employs a Wacom tablet - another holdover from his life as a landscape architect - to "write" onto PDF forms sent to him and then he faxes those back using FaxZero's free service.
Pain Points: Cutting out patterns on leather would be a lot faster with a laser cutter, Mr. Reed said, but it could cost as much as $20,000. He also wanted to sketch directly on his iPad, rather than in his notebook, but he couldn't find a pen that would work well on the screen. Another sticking point has been Web hosting. Mr. Reed said that in hindsight he wonders if it was the best decision to use a hosting service, DreamHost, that requires a lot of management on his part. "I'm not at the point yet where hiring an I.T. consultant is worth it," he said, even though keeping his site up and running is crucial. "I wonder if one of the managed shopping cart/Web server services like Shopify would have been a better fit for me at this point. I have paid less on paper, but the amount of time I've spent keeping the site up and working correctly has probably eaten into - if not completely offset - what I've saved."
Thinking Ahead: Mr. Reed continually wrestles with his opportunity costs. It's been difficult for him to figure out which tasks he should contract out. Just because he is capable of figuring out how to do all of the things that go into running a business, Mr. Reed said, doesn't necessarily mean he should do them. "I need to budget wisely to maximize my productivity and, subsequently, profits," he said.
What do you think? Should Mr. Reed automate - or delegate - more of his operational tasks? Should he change his e-commerce platform?

HEADLINE: Out of India's Trash Heaps, More Than a Shred of Dignity

BYLINE: SARIKA BANSAL


HIGHLIGHT: Pune, India, has developed a a waste-management approach that is improving the environment, as well as the livelihoods and social standing of some of the city&#8217;s poorest inhabitants. 

 BODY:
PUNE, Inida - "Trash! Trash!" yelled Chandani Nagtilak as she pushed her cart through a residential complex.
An older woman put two bins on her porch steps and exchanged pleasantries in the local language, Marathi. Chandani took the bins to her pushcart, where she and her colleague Rekha Shinde emptied them and began separating the contents into organic, recyclable and nonrecyclable waste.
Chandani wore a magenta sari under her uniform, a dark blue button-down shirt. Earlier that morning, she had eaten a rich breakfast of poha and halwa, washed her hands with soap, and complained to her friends that her teenage son would rather gossip than study.
This is significant. For many years, Chandani couldn't count on eating a good breakfast, washing with soap or rolling a pushcart. For more than 20 years, she has been a waste-picker in Pune (pronounced POO-nay), a city of six million. During most of that time, she dressed in tattered clothes and hauled a back-aching bag as she fought off dogs while scouring for recyclables at a landfill. She sometimes went without meals. She sustained injuries. Most hurtful, people often refused to make eye contact with her - except to call her a thief or a piece of trash. 
"Now people offer me tea when I go to their houses," said Chandani, beaming.

That's because her work has been formalized and people have come to appreciate the value of her services. In addition, waste management, recycling and composting are increasingly coming to be seen as vital to community health, environmental sustainability and quality of life around the world.
So how did Chandani go from being regarded as a thief to a potential house guest?
As with so many social changes, it began with organizing. In 1993, a collective called Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat (K.K.P.K.P.) was established in Pune, with an ambitious goal: to organize waste-pickers, one of the poorest and more marginalized segments of urban Indian society. Waste-pickers are often uneducated, rural migrants who sift through trash heaps or landfills, looking for plastics and glass that they sell to middlemen by weight, who send them to be recycled. This informal system results in recycling rates of almost 50 percent for plastics (as compared with 8.2 percent in the United States) - which is why activists call waste-pickers "invisible environmentalists."
Waste-picking is full of occupational hazards. Waste-pickers sifting through trash with bare hands encounter rusty metal, cut glass, needles and menstrual blood; their life expectancy may be a decade or more below the average. With a daily income of 60 rupees (one dollar) in Pune, most cannot afford proper meals or medical care. Police and security guards harass them, particularly women. Governments offers little protection.
It took years for K.K.P.K.P. to mobilize the waste-pickers, who were scattered and reluctant to take time off work for meetings. As the group came together, however, they found a sympathetic ear in the Pune Municipal Corporation (P.M.C.), the city's governing body.
That led to the innovation that changed Chandani's life and has evolved into a waste-management approach that others can learn from. In 2007, the K.K.P.K.P. and Pune's government got together to create a cooperative called Solid Waste Collection and Handling (Swach). The idea was to engage waste-pickers to handle almost all of the city's waste, a remarkable departure from other cities, where private contractors haul waste to landfills with trucks. The question was: Could Swach save the Pune government lots of money, improve the environment and improve livelihoods for some of the city's poorest inhabitants? The answer appears to be yes to all three.
After collecting trash, waste-pickers like Chandani and Rekha segregate the waste in nearby sheds. They send organic matter to be composted, sell recyclable items and collect nonrecyclable waste (like candy wrappers) for transport to a centralized facility to be incinerated.
The waste-pickers receive fees of about 60 cents per month from each household they serve. The city also extends a modest health insurance scheme to the workers - a hard-won victory for K.K.P.K.P., which argued that after doing the city's dirty work, its members deserved some social protection.
By last count, Swach's waste-pickers were collecting trash from almost 400,000 houses, or 90 percent of Pune's nonslum households. "Pune is only second to Buenos Aires in the number of households from whom waste-pickers collect," said Lucia Fernandez, who works with waste-pickers globally through a network called Wiego.
Swach and the P.M.C. observe several advantages to this model. Malati Gadgil, an organizer with Swach, says the waste-pickers cost the city 6 cents per household, while truck-hauled waste costs about 40 to 50 cents. Capital requirements are also less: pushcarts and buckets are a lot cheaper than trucks.
"P.M.C. hardly spends anything this way," said Suresh Jagtap, P.M.C.'s joint commissioner of solid waste management and key supporter of Swach. "Our spending on health insurance is hardly anything."
The Swach model provides environmental benefits, too. "Trucks are incentivized to focus more on tonnage and less on segregation," said Jagtap. When large quantities of mixed waste enter a landfill, it's harder for waste-pickers to pick out recyclables or compostable items. Uncomposted organics release methane, a gas that is 20 times more heat-trapping than carbon dioxide. By segregating waste in sheds closer to the source - which is safer and more hygienic than working at a landfill - Swach waste-pickers divert far more from waste streams. In fact, several Pune neighborhoods will soon be "zero waste" - recycling or composting virtually everything possible.
Waste-pickers receive income from fees from households as well as from selling recyclables, which combined can double or triple their previous earnings. "I can buy books, uniforms and soap for my kids," said Rekha. "I can run a house on this." And, equally important, Swach's uniforms and identification cards bring waste-pickers a measure of respect that many had not before received.
However, Swach's model has challenges. How do you manage thousands of self-employed waste-pickers? Most of Swach's workers have no bank accounts, so the group has to collect and distribute most of the fees in cash. And asking historically informal workers to provide a municipal service involves behavior change. For example, sometimes workers leave work without notice, leaving trash to pile up. Others do things like swearing or spitting that can offend middle-class sensibilities, noted Jagtap. (Swach offers training programs to improve the waste-pickers' professionalism.)
Some households refuse to pay the fees and some politicians oppose them, too. Indeed, Swach's biggest risk is political. "At the end of the day, Swach is a contract and not a policy," said Fernandez, of Wiego. "If the municipal government changes, [they could decide] it's more important to use a fancy international company than support the urban poor."
In fact, the municipality next to Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, recently dropped Swach in favor of a private contractor, and waste-pickers have returned to the landfill. In other cities, lack of political will and historic social stratification keeps the model from taking off. Prakash Patil, the deputy municipal commissioner of waste management for Mumbai, told me that waste-pickers "have no role" in middle-class society.
To develop political will in Pune, Swach had to clearly demonstrate, and document, the financial and environmental benefits it brings. The group estimates that it saves the city $2.2 million annually. K.K.P.K.P. had also organized 6,000 workers over 14 years before the city decided to contract with them.
In India, several cities have employed or are exploring similar models, including Ahmedabad, where the Self-Employed Women's Association has been organizing waste-pickers since the 1980s. Globally the idea is also gaining momentum. Albina Ruiz, the founder of Ciudad Saludable, a waste management organization in Peru, has been working with waste-pickers for more than two decades. "Twenty years ago, nobody would talk about the waste-pickers," she said. "Now they are visible, they can be 'seen', they attend international forums." In more cities, laws have become more supportive.
But Ruiz and others caution that waste-pickers need to be careful not to sell themselves as a cheap solution to waste removal. "The waste-pickers should only collect the recyclable waste," Ruiz says. If they haul trash, they should charge per ton, she added. Other activists assert that waste collection is part of a city's contract with its citizens. Accordingly, waste-pickers should be compensated in line with the value of their work.
For Chandani and Rekha, the simple opportunity to do this work and earn a reasonable wage and respect has been transformational. "I finally have a good life," Chandani told me. "I never thought I would see the day."

HEADLINE: Indian Tire Maker to Buy Cooper Tire for $2.5 Billion

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The all-cash acquisition of Cooper Tire and Rubber would give Apollo Tyres of India a major foothold in the United States. 

 BODY:
 11:40 a.m. | Updated 
One of India's largest tire makers, Apollo Tyres, announced a deal on Wednesday to acquire the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company for $2.5 billion in cash. 
The acquisition would give Apollo a major foothold in the United States, the world's second-largest auto market after China. Cooper, which focuses on passenger and light- and medium-truck replacement tires, is the fourth-largest tire maker in North America. Its brands include Cooper, Mastercraft, Starfire, Chengshan, Roadmaster and Avon.
It would be the second-biggest acquisition of an American company by a buyer in India, according to Thomson Reuters data, topped only by the $5.8 billion deal (including debt) for aluminum producer Novelis by Mumbai-based Hindalco Industries in 2007.
Under the terms of the deal, Cooper shareholders will receive $35 a share in cash - a 42.5 percent premium to its closing stock price on Tuesday and a 40 percent premium to Cooper's 30-day volume-weighted average price. The Economic Times of India reportedin October that the two companies were near a deal. 
In late morning trading on Wednesday,, shares of Cooper were up more than 40 percent, at $34.54.
 The combined company will be the seventh-largest tire company in the world, with $6.6 billion in total sales. 
"This transformational transaction provides an unprecedented opportunity to serve customers across a host of geographies in both developed and fast-growing emerging markets around the world," Onkar S. Kanwar, chairman of Apollo, said in a statement.
Cooper, based in Findlay, Ohio, has its origins in a business founded in 1914. As of the end of last year, it employed 13,550 worldwide. The company said it would continue to recognize its labor unions and honor the terms of collective bargaining agreements.
Apollo, based in Gurgaon, India, near Delhi, was founded in 1972. It has plants in India, the Netherlands and South Africa. 
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Amarchand & Mangaldas & Suresh A. Shroff & Company advised Apollo. The investment firm Greater Pacific Capital acted as strategic and financial adviser to Apollo. 
Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and the law firm Jones Day advised Cooper.

HEADLINE: Overhaul Efforts in Washington Reflect Few Lessons of Housing Crisis

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Congress is working gingerly toward a solution to fix Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a process dominated by emotional battles and financial interests. 

 BODY:
Nearly five years after the government took over the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Congress is slouching toward remaking how Americans buy homes.
Gingerly, Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, have been working up a bill. Yet it's striking how much the process is being dominated by emotional battles and financial interests.
In the right corner - politically as well as figuratively - we have the contingent that despises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These people continue, against the evidence, to consider them the central cause of the financial crisis. Their preferred solution is to wipe these companies from the earth and somehow get the government out of housing. The hope is that a thousand flowers will bloom on their graves, as private investors rush in to finance mortgages. 
In the left corner - politically speaking, we are talking left of center - is a group of financiers that favors a plan to bring back Fannie and Freddie. The argument, forwarded by the banker James E. Millstein, who served as the chief restructuring officer in President Obama's Treasury Department, is that they can be fixed.
Investors like the hedge fund manager John Paulson and Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management have embraced this idea, contending that Fannie and Freddie can pay back taxpayers, be recapitalized and live again. Not incidentally, they could profit handsomely if this works, as they have bought up positions in Fannie and Freddie. It's a time-honored strategy: make one Wall Street investment and then make a second investment in some Washington lobbying to protect the first.
The Corker-Warner plan creates a government insurance operation, similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that would insure mortgage-backed securities. Private investors would have to shoulder the first losses, probably about 10 percent. Taxpayers would not have to bail out those investors should things go south.
It's an appealing notion and the plan has commendable aspects. But if the system worked as advertised, it could make the next housing crisis worse.
To understand why, we should revisit what we have learned about the American housing and mortgage market.
First, we learned that the housing market is so central to people's wealth and the economy that the government will try to save it in a crash. At least Mr. Corker and Mr. Warner's plan grasps that, unlike the most fervent conservatives.
Second, Fannie and Freddie were fatally flawed. They were hybrids, privately held institutions with government charters - along with too much political influence and too little capital. Investors believed they were implicitly guaranteed by the government, and so they were. (Shareholders got hugely diluted, but not wiped out.) The plan tries to solve this by making the insurance explicit and then supposedly cutting off the private players from the government trough.
Neither of the two senators' offices made anyone available for comment. A statement from Mr. Corker's spokesman emphasized the plan's protection for taxpayers; Mr. Warner's added a goal to maintain access to credit.
The Corker-Warner proposal, which borrows ideas from the recent Bipartisan Policy Center proposal and the left-leaning Center for American Progress, depends on getting three things exactly right. Private investors will need to have enough incentive to buy the securities (or, to use the jargon, there will need to be adequate liquidity in the market). These private entities will also need to put up enough money to have enough skin in the game to prevent taxpayers from losing money on the mortgages. On top of that, these firms and insurance companies will need enough capital to prevent taxpayers from having to step in to take over the companies.
There's reason to be skeptical that Congress will succeed in fine-tuning all of this. Unless the new insurance corporation regulates all housing-related investors, they will be subjected to different oversight from different agencies. Typically, businesses will gravitate to the most lenient agency and the one requiring the least capital.
If the Corker-Warner proposal were to go through, the private companies that have pole position would be the private mortgage insurers. The Republican Party has a fondness for this industry, going so far as to blow it a kiss in the party's 2012 platform. Uncomfortably, private mortgage insurers were quietly a major part of the problem after the housing bubble burst. They were woefully undercapitalized and have been operating almost as zombie institutions.
The 10 percent private investor number also poses a concern. It's a satisfyingly high number. But it's a number that will probably create big problems when housing goes into a downturn. Remember the Great National Housing Crash? Private investors fled. Fannie and Freddie needed to step in to provide liquidity. And the real Big Daddy was the Federal Reserve.
Without some mechanism to ease the requirement, the contemplated reform could worsen a panic, not ease one. A Harvard finance professor, David S. Scharfstein, has a proposal that would remedy this, with the government stepping in during a crisis, ramping up its mortgage insurance business only in a downturn when private investors are fleeing.
What's striking is how much we've learned about housing since the crisis that isn't reflected in the overhaul efforts.
We have learned, for example, that the mortgage servicers have been unholy disasters, foreclosing on homeowners incorrectly, fighting principal reduction and dragging their feet on mortgage modifications that would have helped people stay in their homes. One lesson, then, is that separating mortgage servicing from ownership is a bad idea. The banks that kept loans on their books have been more ready to work out loans to keep people in their homes. The current Washington plans don't do much about this.
We've also learned that having an oligopoly of giant banks controlling the mortgage market leads to higher rates. And, because of the enmity toward Fannie and Freddie, we are in danger of turning against the idea that the government has an important role in providing access to credit for those who might not be able to otherwise buy or rent homes.
Mr. Corker and Mr. Warner nod to providing greater access for small banks to compete with the big boys. And it provides a mechanism to provide access to housing for the credit-impaired. But in their fixation with solving Fannie and Freddie, the current Washington efforts give these important issues short shrift.
The work is in the early stages. But the narrowness of the conversation is troubling.

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Fabled Ferrari Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Ferrari expands its museum to include Formula One racecars and cinematic history, and Fiat revives the limited Gucci edition of the 500. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Ferrari is immortalizing more of its storied cars in an 11,000-square-foot expansion of the Museo Ferrari in Maranello, Italy, Luca di Montezemolo, president of Ferrari, announced on Wednesday. Among the permanent displays will be single seat racecars from throughout the company's history. A temporary exhibit, "From Cinecittà to Hollywood, All Ferraris in the Cinema," will feature Steve McQueen's 275 GTB4, the Mondial T Cabrio that Al Pacino drove in "Scent of a Woman" and the 330 LM-inspired one-off that appeared in Federico Fellini's "Spirits of the Dead." (Museo Ferrari)
 For the first time since I. J. Cooper created the Cooper Corporation in Findlay, Ohio, in 1919, the company is leaving American ownership. Apollo Tyres, an Indian company, just paid $2.5 billion in cash to take over the tire manufacturer. Crain News Service reports that Apollo's acquisition creates a company with about $6.6 billion in sales annually and puts it at the helm of 12 factories spread across India, the United States, China, Mexico, the Netherlands, England, Serbia and South Africa. (Automotive News) 
 Spyker's lawsuit against General Motors for blocking the sale of Saab to a Chinese-backed investor was thrown out by a federal judge. Spyker, the Dutch sportscar manufacturer that had bought Saab from G.M. for $400 million in January 2010, had accused G.M. of intentionally bankrupting Saab to keep it from generating competition in the lucrative Chinese market. Saab went bankrupt in December 2011, but a federal judge determined that G.M. was well within its rights to block the sale of Saab. G.M. said it was satisfied with the court's finding, and Spyker has not indicated if it will appeal the decision. (Reuters)
 If you want a Gucci-inspired hatchback, now's your chance. Fiat just announced that it will be offering a Gucci edition Fiat 500, starting at $23,750. The cloth-top 500C will start at $27,750, almost $10,000 more than the 500 Lounge hardtop. As a matter of fact, the fancy trim puts it in the same price range as the more powerful Turbo and Abarth models. But despite its fashion-over-function spirit, which includes fancy leather, chrome accents and Gucci badging, the last Gucci 500 to be offered sold briskly. (Autoblog)
 Competing against all-electric vehicles including the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Volt and Tesla Model S, the Ford Focus Electric has languished. Ford announced that it would not update the car for the 2014 model year, which has left analysts thinking that Ford may have given up on the car. Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at Edmunds.com, told The Detroit News that Ford's heart does not seem to be in the Focus Electric, and that it might be offered just to aid the company's overall fuel economy numbers and image. (The Detroit News)
 The electric carmaker Coda has gotten the green light from a bankruptcy court to sell its assets to lenders for $25 million. Fortress Investment Group agreed to a cash payment of $1.7 million, with the rest coming from a credit bid allowing lenders to use debt owed to them in lieu of cash. Although Coda announced in May that it was stepping away from the car game, the company said it would be developing and selling energy storage technology through a subsidiary.

HEADLINE: The Great Assimilation Debate

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Pondering immigrant progress as the Senate debates immigration reform. 

 BODY:
Now that the immigration bill is actually moving through the Senate, it seems worth returning to the debate over recent patterns in immigrant assimilation that I discussed in a column back in April. That piece made the point that while today's second-generation immigrants still seem to be making real gains compared to their parents, there's a fair amount of evidence showing a subsequent stall-out in advancement - both educational and economic, and particularly noticeable among the descendants of immigrants from Latin America - that leaves later generations stuck well short of full integration into the American middle class. If true, this would lend credence to the worry, common among immigration reform skeptics but apparently rarer among United States senators, that the accelerated pace of low-skilled immigration contemplated by the current legislation might be a recipe for ever-greater socioeconomic stratification.
But it's also possible that the apparent stall-out isn't actually real, for reasons discussed by my colleague David Brooks in a column early last month: 
Some intelligent skeptics say that mobility is fine through the second generation but stalls by the third. It is indeed harder to rise in a more chaotic and fragmented society. But one of the country's leading immigration researchers, Richard Alba of the City University of New York, calls the third generation stall "a statistical illusion."
Much of the research that shows the effect compares today's third-generation immigrants with today's second-generation group. But the third-generation families originally came to the U.S. decades ago, at a time when segregation was prevalent, discrimination was high and immigrants were harshly treated. You'd expect those families to progress more slowly than families that came to more welcoming conditions a generation later.
This a plausible point, and there is actually a further reason why research comparing the present-day third generation to the present-day second generation might be flawed: Namely, the phenomenon of ethnic attrition, in which subsequent generations become less likely to identify with their ancestral identity, thus throwing off survey data that relies on ethnic self-identification to track immigrant assimilation. In a recent column on this subject, Reihan Salam noted that "the educational attainment of Mexican-Americans who don't identify as Mexican is higher than for those who do" - a pattern that suggests that third generation Hispanic attainment may be understated in studies that don't account for the fact that many of the most successful third-generation Hispanic-American just identify as, well, white.
So those are two possible reasons to think that today's new arrivals and their descendants are, as my colleague David Leonhardt argued earlier this year, "following the classic pattern for American immigrants," rather than gaining some ground and then stalling or slipping back. But now let me offer two counterpoints. First, not every study of immigrant assimilation compares today's third generation to today's second generation, or ignores the problem of attrition. "Generations of Exclusion," for instance, a major 2008 study from two U.C.L.A. sociologists, tracked Mexican-American assimilation longitudinally (that is, comparing patterns for adult immigrants in the 1960s to contemporary outcomes for their children and grandchildren), and found basically the same pattern as the cross-sectional analyses: "While Mexican Americans make financial strides from the first to the second generation," the authors wrote, "economic progress halts at the second generation, and poverty rates remain high for later generations. Similarly, educational attainment peaks among second generation children of immigrants, but declines for the third and fourth generations."
Second, Brooks' key premise - that conditions have grown "more welcoming" for low-skilled immigrants from Latin America over the last two generations - is precisely what's in dispute in this debate. Clearly conditions have improved along some of the indicators that he discusses, like overt racial discrimination. But in other ways the America of 2013 seems like a place where it might turn out to be much more difficult for the descendants of low-skilled immigrants to rise into the middle class than it would have been fifty years ago.
To make that more pessimistic case, just combine this chart showing the current American unemployment rate by education level with this chart showing how social mobility for the bottom 20 percent stacks up against other developed economies. Then factor in the pace at which second-generation immigrants seem to be joining the retreat from marriage, and the way Hispanic family structures are coming to resemble those of the native-born underclass. Then throw in findings like these from a new study by Harvard's George Borjas:
This paper uses data drawn from the 1970-2010 decennial Censuses to examine the evolution of immigrant earnings in the U.S. labor market. The analysis reveals that there are cohort effects not only in the level of earnings, with more recent cohorts generally having relatively lower entry wages, but also in the rate of growth of earnings, with more recent cohorts having a smaller rate of economic assimilation. Immigrants who entered the country before the 1980s typically found that their initial wage disadvantage (relative to natives) narrowed by around 15 percentage points during their first two decades in the United States. In contrast, the immigrants who entered the country after the 1980s have a negligible rate of wage convergence ... 
Of course Borjas is notable among economists for his skepticism of immigration's benefits to non-immigrants. And of course one can answer the case for pessimism with still other data points that offer more reason for optimism, like the recent upward trend in Hispanic high school graduation rates. We see through a glass darkly on these issues: It is hard to say with certainty what is happening with assimilation right now, and it is harder to say what will happen in the near-to-medium future.
But where reasonable people can disagree, reasonable policymakers should at least hedge their bets. And that's precisely what the legislation being considered in the Senate doesn't do. All the to-and-fro-ing about border security notwithstanding, this is a bill that doesn't seem to contemplate any potential downsides to increasing the pace of low-skilled immigration at a time when unemployment is rampant, wages are stagnant, and the native-to-immigrant ratios in our population is already headed toward historic highs.
That optimism makes it a very American piece of legislation, I suppose. But it doesn't make it wise.

HEADLINE: Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Is Aimed at Progressive Luxury Buyers Who Also Like Quiet

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Amid a rejiggering of the company&#8217;s branding, Lincoln is focusing as much on its cars&#8217; features as it is upon customer service. 

 BODY:
Coffee creamer matters. That was one of the lessons offered by Kimberly Cape, marketing manager for Lincoln, at a ride and drive event for the 2013 MKZ Hybrid in Manhattan on Tuesday.
Ms. Cape is helping with a much-needed Lincoln rebranding, and part of that is training salespeople as "brand champions" who present the right image to the younger and more affluent "progressive luxury" buyers who, she said, make up from 20 to 25 percent of the overall luxury segment. The company's Lincoln Academy trains dealers to help meet the needs of premium customers.
According to Ms. Cape, the imperatives of contemporary marketing mean, in many cases, separating Ford and Lincoln showrooms and getting the creamer right as part of the dealer's complimentary coffee presentation. 
"We don't want the powdered stuff," Ms. Cape said. "And we also don't want our customers to see employees standing around outside smoking."
There's more to the personal service concept, Lincoln said, including remembering which customers like Perrier (and bringing them a free bottle), offering car washes for every repair order, guaranteeing loaner cars and offering an online concierge. The "date night" program gives restaurant gift certificates to people who come in and test drive cars.
It's probably too early to tell if the campaign is working, but Lincoln has gotten more than 26,000 visits to the online concierge and has sold 4,012 MKZs in April and 3,490 in May. The hybrid represents 30 percent of the company's sales; more than 50 percent in hybrid-friendly Los Angeles.
The MKZ Hybrid is powered by a 2-liter Atkinson Cycle engine connected to an 88-kilowatt electric motor and a 1.4-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. Leading the hybrid's appeal is an E.P.A. economy rating of 45 miles per gallon both in the city and on the highway, as well as an array of standard equipment for $36,820 (including destination charges). That's the same price as for the conventional MKZ with the gasoline-power 2-liter EcoBoost engine.
According to Tom Ozog, chief MKZ engineer, one tradeoff between the two models is the hybrid's better fuel economy versus the EcoBoost's higher horsepower. He said the hybrid has 188 horsepower net while the EcoBoost has 240.
But a lack of power wasn't apparent in an admittedly speed-limited drive around lower Manhattan. The overwhelming impression the MKZ Hybrid gave on the Big Apple's patchwork of roughshod streets was of quiet isolation, separating the driver not only from the powertrain but also from the city's usual hustle and bustle.
Mr. Ozog said that Lincoln added sound insulation under the hood, in the underbody, in the rocker panels and in the headliner. Unless you accelerate aggressively, the loudest sound you will usually hear inside this car is the climate control system's fan. Rolls-Royce used to assign that honor to the ticking of its cars' electric clocks, but car clocks don't usually tick anymore.
"This is the quietest car Lincoln ever produced," Mr. Ozog said.
That's great, unless you actually want to hear the car. But when that time comes, the MKZ's Active Noise Control, which cancels unwanted acoustic intrusion, amplifies engine sounds when the car is in sport mode, Mr. Ozog said.
As tested, the Lincoln hybrid offered an understated cabin with leather seats (including rear-heated seats) and wood accents. Rear-seat headroom and legroom are excellent. There are assorted gauges and displays that help drivers maximize fuel economy and performance. The push-button transmission that is reminiscent of early 1960s Dodge Darts can also be seen on the current Fiat 500e electric car.
Testing the hybrid's capabilities as a highway cruiser will have to wait for a longer drive opportunity. It makes a largely positive first impression around town, where it achieved 32.2 mpg on a course of mostly congested driving.
