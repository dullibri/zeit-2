HEADLINE: A Third Bidder for Auction World Heft;
Phillips, With a Rich New Parent, Seeks to Join Sotheby's and Christie's Cozy Club

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
As the Justice Department investigation into Sotheby's and Christie's unfolds, the world's largest auction houses are proceeding as if it is business as usual, gathering all the best Impressionist, modern and contemporary art they can for important auctions planned over the next two weeks. But the historical tug-of-war between Sotheby's and Christie's has turned into an expensive three-way fight.
Both Sotheby's and Christie's have their share of exceptional works, but their catalogs of Impressionist and modern art seem bloated with second-rate paintings, drawings and sculptures that carry high estimates. The explanation is simple. Since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought Phillips, the London-based auction house a year ago, it has been going after property at any cost, dipping into LVMH's deep pockets to become a major player. 
 Long a distant third in the auction world, Phillips has 29 works by masters like Cezanne and Renoir, Matisse and Picasso in its evening sale on Monday. Although this is the kind of art that experts at Sotheby's and Christie's would have liked to include in their sales, they were unwilling to risk guaranteeing sellers the high prices necessary to snag them. As it did last spring, Phillips has given most of its sellers either substantial guarantees -- an undisclosed sum promised to a consignor regardless of a sale's outcome -- or other financial incentives to get their business.
Christopher Thomson, chief executive of Phillips, said that "in every instance where Phillips has a financial interest, we have disclosed it."
Last year the auction house ran big ads proclaiming "Phillips, the other way to do auctions," a deliberate dig at Sotheby's and Christie's business practices. Yet this season the Phillips catalog of Impressionist and modern art has dealers, auction house experts and collectors buzzing about some of Phillips's auction methods.
Instead of clearly marking the works in which it has a financial interest on the catalog page where they are shown, Phillips has noted it in small print in the back of its catalog, specifying its stake in nine lots. The usual auction house practice is to note the company's interest on the page displaying the work, to alert buyers that the company has a financial stake in the outcome of the sale. (The New York City Department of Consumer affairs requires auction catalogs to disclose any financial interest a house has in the art it sells.)
Mr. Thomson would not comment on the catalog notation.
Two top works in the Phillips sale, part of a group of paintings being sold by Wafic Said, a Saudi billionaire of Syrian origin, are landscapes by Cezanne and Renoir. Phillips has not said it has a financial interest in the works, but experts familiar with Mr. Said's collection say that it was bought by a third party on behalf of the auction house. This form of financing, known as a third-party guarantee, is unconventional but not illegal and is frowned on in the art world because an auction house could tend to promote that material over other offerings.
Asked about third-party guarantees in this instance, Mr. Thomson added: "There can be occasions when other parties have a financial interest. These companies are independent of Phillips, and this is consistent with legal requirements and market practice."
Auction experts and dealers also say that Phillips has confused buyers by identifying the owner in different ways on different works, making it seem as if they come from different collections and that there are more consignors than there really are. Mr. Said's Renoir, "In the Garden," is listed as "Property of a Gentleman." But his Cezanne, "Hill of Galet, Pontoise," has no property title.
Mr. Thomson declined to comment on the property titles.
Phillips has also hired Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe and now a private art dealer and adviser, as auctioneer for its two big evening sales. While Mr. de Pury is a top auctioneer, several dealers who asked for anonymity because they do business with Phillips argued that this gives Mr. de Pury an unfair advantage. Mr. de Pury, a big auction buyer, they say, will be privy not only to the reserves -- the secret minimum price agreed upon by the seller and the auction house -- but he will also have confidential information on the strategies of the bidders and the auction house that he can use in his own dealings.
Mr. Thomson said that Mr. de Pury would have no access to client records and had not been party to contractual negotiations with consignors, and that the auctioneer's book will have no reference to sellers and he will have no access to the names of bidders who register for the sales. Mr. de Pury will have access to the reserves, but they will be made available to him just before the sale. "Most importantly," Mr. Thomson said, "neither he nor his firm will be allowed to bid at the sale."
The Phillips incursion promises a harder battle this season for Sotheby's and Christie's, which have been consumed by the federal price-fixing investigation. Last month Sotheby's pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws, as did Diana D. Brooks, its former president and chief executive, who has agreed to cooperate in a continuing investigation of her boss, A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's largest shareholder and its former chairman. Officials of Christie's turned over documents to the Justice Department in January and received conditional amnesty.
To fend off Phillips, the major auction houses have been making higher estimates. On top of that, no large estates have come on the market this season, so most of what is on sale has come from discretionary sellers who are betting that a robust economy will encourage collectors to continue buying art.
But a strong economy can be a two-edged sword. When people don't have to sell, it is harder to find good things to put up for auction. "That we still have a strong market is reflected in the fact that while we've seen rising prices over the last few years, there is not the rush to sell that there was in the late 1980's," said Christopher Burge, honorary chairman of Christie's and its principal auctioneer.
Sotheby's and Christie's each have a few exceptional works of Impressionist and modern art. Next Wednesday Christie's is offering a rare painting from Picasso's Blue Period, "Woman With Crossed Arms." The portrait, which depicts a glum-looking woman seated against a background of rich blues, was painted in Barcelona in 1902. It is being sold by Mr. and Mrs. Chauncey McCormick, Chicago collectors since 1936, and had been on loan to the Art Institute of Chicago since 1972. Blue Period Picassos rarely come on the market, and experts estimate that this one will fetch upwards of $25 million. The last Picasso from this period, a portrait of the artist Angel Fernandez de Soto, was bought by Andrew Lloyd Webber for $29.1 million when it was sold at Sotheby's in 1995.
Experts are betting that the Picasso will be this season's most expensive painting. But another big-ticket work, Manet's "Young Woman in a Garden," may give it competition. This rich Impressionist landscape is unusually large -- 60 1/2 by 46 inches -- and shows an American woman, a friend of the artist known only as Mademoiselle Marguerite, reading in the garden behind a Paris house that Manet rented in the summer of 1880. Last shown 47 years ago in an exhibition in Minnesota, it is expected to sell for $20 million to $30 million.
Many works for sale this season are familiar to auctiongoers. Every painting being sold by Mr. Said at Phillips has been on the market recently, and in most cases he paid more than the low estimate in the catalog. Similarly, Sotheby's has four paintings being sold by the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art in Las Vegas. Its former chairman, Stephen A. Wynn, one of the biggest buyers at auction for himself and for the Bellagio for the last five years, sold his company, Mirage Resorts, to MGM Grand Inc. in March. For months MGM Grand has been selling its holdings both privately and at auction. Among the best being sold by Sotheby's is a Modigliani portrait of the art dealer Paul Guillaume, which brought $3.1 million when it was sold at Christie's four years ago. Sotheby's now estimates it will bring $3.5 million to $5 million.
Provenance is always something seasoned collectors carefully note, and this fall Christie's is offering several works being sold by the heirs of Auguste Pellerin, the French industrialist who died in 1929 after amassing one of the world's greatest collections of Cezannes. The artist's "Riverbank of the Marne" from 1888, a landscape of the river with two fishermen in the foreground, is one of the collection's highlights. The painting is expected to sell for $7 million to $10 million.
Sotheby's also has some unusual Picassos, although none are as important as Christie's Blue Period painting. "Rest," a 1932 head of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter in profile, is expected to bring $3 million to $4 million. (It was last on the market at Christie's in London seven years ago and brought $2.2 million.) "The Studio," from 1956, is a nearly monochromatic painting of the artist's studio with a bare canvas as an exclamation point in the foreground. The painting brought $2.8 million in 1988 in a sale at Sotheby's from the collection of the New York collectors Victor and Sally Ganz. Now Sotheby's says it should sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million.
Sculpture has been particularly popular for the last few seasons, partly because it has been undervalued and partly because of the number of public sculpture gardens being formed. This season Christie's has several rare sculptures, one of the finest being a Cubist bust by Picasso, "Head of a Woman (Fernande)" from 1909, which is expected to sell for $4 million to $6 million. "Few Cubist sculptures exist," said Franck Giraud, head of Christie's Impressionist, modern and postwar art departments. "And this is the biggest and the most important. It's also a very early cast dating from around 1910."
Sotheby's contemporary art catalog also features some important sculptures. "We tried to get sculpture because it appeals to today's tastes," said Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide. Besides works by by Alexander Calder, Robert Gober and Donald Judd, three rare Noguchi sculptures from the Lannan Foundation in Los Angeles are being offered.
Sotheby's defines contemporary art as works made after 1945, and while its sale on Nov. 14 begins with work by some younger artists, most are by established masters like Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and Donald Judd. While Mr. Meyer declined to identify the sellers in his sale, contemporary art experts have spotted one interesting consignor. Sotheby's former chairman, Mr. Taubman, a well-known collector, is selling a painting by Mr. Johns, "Disappearance I," and another by Francis Bacon.
On Nov. 15 Christie's will offer puts its classic contemporary art in a separate sale it calls "Post War." After grouping these works with early 20th-century artists like Matisse and Picasso in a sale it had called 20th-century art, Christie's restructured its sales this season, putting early modern masters with Impressionist and modern art, and moving postwar artists into another sale and art from the last 30 years in what it calls its contemporary art sales.
Christie's contemporary art sale on Nov. 16 has drawn much of the attention. The catalog, whose cover displays a naked sculpture of a life-size Ken doll by Charles Ray (estimate, $700,000 to $900,000), has a host of images that range from the explicit to the pornographic by artists of the moment like Jeff Koons and Yasumasa Morimura.

HEADLINE: Rocket Lifts 3 Astronauts To the Station Built in Space

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan, Oct. 31

 BODY:
One American and two Russian astronauts rocketed into orbit today on a quest to become the first residents of the international space station and begin fulfilling the once-fantastic dream of permanent occupancy in space.
"Let's go do it!" shouted Capt. William M. Shepherd of the United States Navy, the space station's first commander, before climbing into a Soyuz rocket and blasting off from the same pad where the Space Age began 43 years ago with Sputnik. 
 "It's history again repeating itself, in a different way," said Joseph H. Rothenberg, head of the human space flight program for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "Space shouldn't be the same again."
The $60 billion-plus station, a joint project among the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and 10 member countries of the European Space Agency, is the largest technological enterprise ever undertaken on a global scale.
"It will be a laboratory like every professor wishes he had here on Earth, and open 24 hours a day," said Jorg Feustel-Buchl, director of manned space flight for the European Space Agency. He monitored the launch with Russian and other space officials at Russian Mission Control in Korolyov, near Moscow.
The 17-story green rocket, transformed into a frosty white by the super-cold fuel, vanished into dense fog three seconds after liftoff from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Its brightly burning engines were visible several seconds later as the rocket gained speed and altitude. The roar, by then, was deafening to the more than 500 gathered at the cosmodrome.
Nine minutes later, Captain Shepherd and his crew mates, Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, were in orbit and giving chase to the international space station. The complex was soaring 240 miles above the Sahara when they took off, more than two years late as a result of Russia's economic troubles, which stalled space station assembly.
The three men will reach their new home on Thursday and settle in for a four-month stay. The station's official language is English, though Russian is expected to be used when communicating with ground controllers outside Moscow.
There was no countdown, only occasional curt reports blaring from loudspeakers. Several seconds before liftoff, the command "zazhiganiye!" (ignition) was given and the 20 engines burst into flames. Clouds of dark smoke rolled across the desert.
NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, waited until Captain Shepherd and his crew were safely in orbit before hugging top Russian officials and giving a high-five to Mr. Rothenberg, his deputy.
The deputy director general of the Russian Space Agency, Valery Alaverdov, pressed a goblet into Mr. Goldin's hands and poured scotch from a bottle. "Success!" Mr. Alaverdov toasted. "Here's to a great space program," Mr. Goldin replied.
"There are so many people who felt maybe we couldn't do it," Mr. Goldin told reporters moments later, referring to the years of agonizing delay. "But it's happening, it's here. We're going to be in space forever with people who are circling this globe, and then we're going on to Mars, back to the moon and with bases on asteroids."
Captain Shepherd and his crew, which NASA calls Expedition 1, face a busy and difficult few weeks. As soon as they arrive at the space station, they will activate all the life-support systems and start tackling all the maintenance and repair chores that have been piling up since the new living quarters joined the rest of the complex in July.
Visiting space shuttle astronauts took care of as many chores as they could in September and again in October, but most of the work had to wait for the experts, Captain Shepherd, an accomplished home mechanic, and his crew.
Space shuttle crews will visit two more times, delivering giant electricity-producing solar panels and the American lab Destiny, before Discovery arrives in February to bring the crew back to Earth. They will be replaced by a fresh crew. And so it will go, for the next 15 years and possibly even longer.
NASA hopes to finish building the space station in 2006 and keep using it for scientific research for at least a decade beyond that. Current progress can be tracked at a Web site, www.spaceflight.nasa.gov.
"There's so much more to do," said C. Michael Foale, a NASA astronaut who is in charge of the expedition crews. "But it's a transition for all of us psychologically to think that we're doing something real rather than something we've always imagined."
Dr. Foale added hopefully, "I have often thought this may be the last time that there were no humans in space, and I really believe that could be today."

HEADLINE: A 'Techno-Peasant' Goes Internet

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Frederick Forsyth, the British author who made his name in the literary "old economy" of spies, mercenaries and assassins, hardly seems a likely candidate to blaze a trail through the literary thickets of cyberspace.
Eschewing word processors, he uses an electric typewriter and sends his manuscripts to be retyped for publication, correcting proofs by hand. He calls himself a "techno-peasant at heart." 
 But having sold 60 million old-fashioned paper-and-ink books in 30 languages, Mr. Forsyth, 61, plans to become the first brand-name British author of best sellers to publish his work on the Internet. Starting on Wednesday, the first of five short stories will be sold for $2.99 a download from electronic retailers like Barnesandnoble.com and Bol.com.
E-commerce, he said today, may not be all that it is talked up to be. "If you want to order a book on the Internet, it still has to come in a jiffy bag," he said. "There are limitations." But for all the Internet technology that eludes him, the Web does have some advantages, he said: "Words are something this thing does handle well. And words are how I make my living."
Of course, the venture into e-publishing is not new. Stephen King led the way among American best-selling writers this year with a novella, "Riding the Bullet," and his current 10-chapter novel, "The Plant."
But Mr. Forsyth's move into electronic books is "very much a pioneering first step" in Britain, said Catherine Jones, head of marketing at Online Originals, which is publishing Mr. Forsyth's series of stories.
Among British authors, Mr. Forsyth and Fay Weldon are among the few to have prominently embraced electronic publishing, while Online Originals, founded in 1996, says one of its writers, Patricia le Roy, is the first electronically published British author to be nominated for a major award -- the Booker Prize -- for her novel "The Angels of Russia."
From a literary perspective, Mr. Forsyth's venture offers the latest twist in what seems a search for a new identity in the aftermath of the cold war. A previous work, "The Phantom of Manhattan," published a year ago, was a cross between fantasy and romance and was not a best seller in the tradition of earlier thrillers like "The Day of the Jackal" or "The Odessa File."
Yet spies and superpowers no longer intrigue him. "There are no Russians, no K.G.B.," he said of his Internet series, titled "Quintet," which will begin with a 20,000-word novella called "The Veteran."
The series, Mr. Forsyth said, stemmed from a conversation last September with his agent, Ed Victor, during which he was considering five separate ideas, none of them big enough for a novel. But, he said, they did seem to work as short stories, all on different themes. Mr. Forsyth acknowledged that Mr. King's example had prompted him to think about the possibilities of electronic publishing, although he does not think the Internet formula works with a 10-part novel like "The Plant."
"A lot of people in our day and age don't want to wait 10 months" to finish a single book, he said. But short stories and novellas, he said, are better suited to the speed of the Internet. The five stories in "Quintet" will be published every 21 days through February. He is now writing the fourth of the series.
From a business perspective, the debate about electronic book publishing is far from resolved. Certainly, Mr. Forsyth's imprimatur will raise the profile of Online Originals, a privately held company whose margins will be reduced by discounts to retailers, encryption costs and Mr. Forsyth's royalty. The standard royalty paid by Online Originals to authors is 50 percent of the retail sale price, Ms. Jones said, compared with the usual 10 percent in traditional book publishing.
Even electronic publishers say the devices available for downloading e-books are at an early stage. "It's not yet at a level where it's cheap enough and pleasant enough for large numbers of people to want to substitute" electronic books for traditional books, said Phil Rance, the managing director of Online Originals. "But it's getting there."
And though some online publishers have stables of lesser-known authors, revenue is likely to be tied to big-name authors. "This will only work for the big blockbuster names which have an established brand name," said Simon Mays-Smith, a media analyst at UBS Warburg.
On the eve of publication, Mr. Forsyth said he was uncertain where his leap into cyberspace would take him, except that success or failure would be measured at the speeds of cyberspace rather than traditional publishing.
"It's very quick," he said. Internet readers "will either hit within five days -- or they won't."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
When Top Jobs Go Begging

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
About 18 months ago, Harvey M. Greenberg, the Polaroid Corporation's vice president for human resources, looked around and hated what he saw -- or, more accurately, what he did not see. Many of the best and brightest of Polaroid's top people were no longer there. Some had retired early, many more had defected to Internet start-ups.
These were the people with the institutional memory, the customer relationships -- and the prime slots in what Polaroid had thought was a well-cushioned succession plan for top management jobs. 
 Polaroid jumped into action. It promoted younger people who, by its old standards, would not have been deemed ready for another three years. It looked deep into its organization for up-and-comers that it could develop quickly and plug into its succession plans. And it is now surveying all employees to find the hot buttons -- high pay? flexible hours? quicker promotion? -- that will make them stay.
"We've recovered well," Mr. Greenberg said. "But it's a darned shame that it took this upheaval to make us look harder at developing high-potential people."
Polaroid's is not an isolated tale. As the first wave of baby boomers turn 54 -- prime time for the second-career itch -- more of them are bailing out of corporate jobs. They are joining dot-coms, starting their own businesses, working for charities or simply calling it quits and enjoying life.
"The retirement of the older people is leaving the younger people without mentors," warned E. Ralph Biggadike, a management professor at Columbia Business School.
The younger people are not necessarily complaining. James S. Davey joined Polaroid less than two years ago; he has been promoted twice, and at 35, is director of global marketing for Polaroid's hugely successful i-Zone pocket cameras.
"I've had the opportunity to prove myself quickly," he said. "From what I've heard, that's a lot different than it would have been in the past."
Still, departures are creating gaping holes in succession plans. "Companies took for granted that they'll have the talent when they need it, so they invested more in technology than in developing people," said Donna H. Davenport, a consultant with the Empower Group, a New York management consulting firm. "Now they have huge talent gaps."
The management trends of the 90's left many companies ill equipped to fill the holes. Mergers and downsizings pulled a lot of talent out of the lineup. As overburdened survivors did triage on their responsibilities, mentoring underlings was often the first thing to go.
The push to divest everything but core businesses, meanwhile, reduced the number of divisions where people could be groomed. The drive to cut management layers and to farm out ancillary functions further shrank the training grounds.
"It's become harder to move people to jobs outside their technical expertise, where they can learn to get things done by managing people," said Michael Beer, a professor at Harvard Business School.
Thomas J. Neff, chairman of United States operations for the executive recruiters Spencer Stuart, says that the problem is likely to get worse. Until recently, he said, the executive population has grown in line with gross domestic product. But these days, supply and demand are going in opposite directions.
Assuming economic growth of 2 percent a year for the next 15 years, Mr. Neff predicted that demand for executives will increase by a third, while the number of those 35 to 44 will decline 15 percent. "The growth of the economy and of management jobs is outstripping the number of people developing in the right age range," he said. "Some companies will wake up one day and say, 'Lord, we don't have the right people anymore.' "
Slowly, more companies are hearing the warnings. They are beefing up retention and development programs, hoping to keep top talent long enough to groom a replacement layer.
In June, Deloitte Consulting promoted eight veterans into the new slot of senior partner, and let them carve out their dream jobs. One chose a three-day week, another decided to work for nonprofit clients.
All have been assigned as mentors to fast-track younger partners. Now Deloitte plans to create more senior partners. Why? Deloitte realized that, by 2001, nearly a quarter of its 850 partners would be 50 or older, prime candidates for a midlife career change. It worried that an exodus of older partners would not only strip the firm of talent but would send a signal to younger partners that Deloitte was not a home for life.
"The retention of our more senior people is a critical element in the retention of our early-year and midyear partners," said Charles L. Biggs, 59, and one of the new senior partners. (He chose to forgo assignments that required travel.)
At least Deloitte has a wealth of younger people to train. Other companies are finding that past downsizings are coming back to haunt them.
In 1992, the United States Postal Service cut the number of executive positions to 650 from 1,500. Recently it looked at its executive roster, which has expanded back to 850 top jobs, and faced a grim truth: "In a few years, between 35 and 40 percent of our executives will be eligible to retire, and we could be up the creek," said Stephen A. Leavey, manager of corporate personnel management. Mr. Leavey said that 35 senior executives had left in the last 18 months alone.
The post office now lets executives do stints in different departments, in hopes of staving off boredom. It will soon offer coaching to all executives, "so that if they are suddenly promoted they can hit the ground running," Mr. Leavey said. It is now expanding its management training programs to 20,000 midlevel managers, and it is starting an internship program for new hires with graduate degrees who can be pushed into management within four years.
Even companies that claim immunity from boomer flight are putting in preventive programs. Johnna G. Torsone, chief human resources officer at Pitney Bowes, insists that Pitney is suffering only normal turnover, and that its staff is not age-skewed. But, she said, Pitney recently undertook a "rigorous assessment of our talent pool," just in case. It spotted a troubling shortage of people who could readily move into general management jobs.
So Pitney made a list of about 30 potential fast-trackers, compared their strengths and weaknesses to those of Pitney's most senior executives, and put them through customized 12-month programs to help each more closely mirror the strengths of the existing senior team.
Pitney is now taking its "be prepared" attitude farther down the roster, looking to groom switch-hitters who can fit into any Pitney division. It is sending 3,500 managers through leadership sessions, at which Pitney's top executives will serve as guest lecturers.
And it has identified a smaller group of high-potential managers, and assigned them mentors from other divisions who are strong in their weak areas. "If people learn about other divisions now, they can be plugged into those divisions if a job opens up," Ms. Torsone said.
Of course, some companies insist they have been doing such training all along.
When the Xerox Corporation dismissed G. Richard Thoman, its chief executive, in May, it had plenty of longtimers to pick from. (It chose Anne M. Mulcahy, 47, a 24-year Xerox employee, who now is president and heir apparent.) And, despite turmoil in its businesses, and a precipitous slide in its stock, Xerox insists its succession plans are intact.
"Every year we do the 'what happens if you're hit by a bus' type of review with all our managers," said Jeffrey J. Simek, a Xerox spokesman, who noted that during the last round of cuts Xerox did not allow plant managers to accept a buyout package unless they had already groomed their successors. "Managers who let that process fall through the cracks get dinged at their own reviews," Mr. Simek said.
Even companies that prefer to fill gaps with outsiders are finding that strategy hard to pursue.
SuperValu Inc., the nation's largest distributor of groceries, used to go outside for nearly a fifth of its top management talent "because we've always felt we need fresh ideas and experiences," said Ronald C. Tortelli, senior vice president for human resources. "But mergers and acquisitions eliminated a lot of the senior management jobs at the companies that once provided our future leaders, and it became apparent we had to plant more of our own acorns."
SuperValu has stepped up recruiting at colleges and is putting the recruits through training that Mr. Tortelli says will let them move into management quickly. Conversely, it is sending experienced people back to school to broaden their knowledge. And it has backed away from such efficiency moves as centralizing customer service functions. "We stopped when it looked like we might lose people whose responsibilities were lessened," Mr. Tortelli said.
Demographics being immutable, the pressure of the aging baby boom should go on for many more years. But, there are bright spots unrelated to age that may yet ameliorate the talent-gap problems. Ever since the Nasdaq went tumbling in April, the temptation to flee to a dot-com has diminished. And more women and minorities are coming into the management pipeline. "That may not solve the problem, but it will ease the brain drain," Mr. Neff of Spencer Stuart said.
Paradoxically, though, the offsetting trends may cause problems of their own. If high-level people do not leave, how easy will it be to retain newly trained replacements who are champing at the promotional bit?
Mr. Leavey of the Postal Service has asked that question. He has no pat answer. "I don't think you can ever be ahead in this game," he said.

HEADLINE: College Initiates Program to Give Back to Its Neighbors

BYLINE: By ERIC GOLDSCHEIDER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Carlos Espinosa remembers when the wrought iron fence that envelops the Trinity College campus was extended across Vernon Street to insulate the liberal arts enclave further from its neighbors. That was in 1994, during a time of drive-by shootings and youth-gang turf wars in a community undergoing a long, steady decline.
Now Mr. Espinosa is a community organizer involved in an effort by the college to reverse course and immerse itself in the neighborhood, in his case by trying to help its neighbors cross the so-called "digital divide." The idea for the experimental program he runs is that the college has much to offer its neighbors in terms of access to and expertise in computing and the Internet. And the community can provide Trinity students with rich experiences, people and viewpoints they might not have encountered before. The question is how far this and similar efforts by Trinity will go in transforming not only the community but the college as well. 
 It is the prospect of mutual growth that has animated not only the project, known as the Smart Neighborhood Initiative, but the entire multimillion-dollar development of the neighborhood set in motion by Trinity's president, Evan Dobelle.
In 1996 Trinity took the unusual step of dipping into its $208 million endowment to invest in the neighborhood in the form of a $5.5 million, no-strings-attached contribution to a large urban renewal project called the Learning Corridor. That contribution bore fruit this year with the opening of four public schools, including a Montessori school and two high school magnets -- one for math and science and the other for the arts -- across from the college's lush athletic fields. The location had been the site of a city bus depot.
If the goal had been to make money, the college would have done better by investing in more traditional enterprises, like shopping malls in Atlanta, said Dr. Dobelle, but doing something to help the neighborhood, he said, would yield more durable dividends.
When Dr. Dobelle assumed the leadership of Trinity College in 1995 he was acutely aware of the symbolism of the barrier that had just been erected across Vernon Street, in effect making it a road open only to the college community rather than the city thoroughfare it had always been. "It was done for all the wrong reasons," he said. It represented "a circling of the wagons."
He frames the college's new, more welcoming attitude toward the neighborhood in terms of enlightened self-interest. The community is definitely hurting, said Dr. Dobelle, citing statistics like the fact that 92 percent of the families are headed by a single parent. But by investing in the neighborhood rather than trying to shut it out, he said, the college is not only living the kinds of "virtues and ethics" it tries to teach its students, but in the long run it makes the campus safer.
Dr. Dobelle also believes that engagement with the community has begun to enrich academic life. Now that word is getting out that Trinity is trying to mesh its liberal arts mission with a new socially conscious attitude toward its surroundings, enrollment applications as well as the quality of the applicants are up, Dr. Dobelle said. "What was supposed to be our greatest liability has turned into our greatest asset," he said.
In 1998 the W. K. Kellogg Foundation made a five-year, $5.1 million grant to further the integration of the campus and the community. About half the money supports the Smart Neighborhood Initiative. Other components of the grant include endowing a professorship of comparative urban studies and creating a center that provides students and faculty with data on the urban experience, particularly in Hartford.
Mr. Espinosa, the son of Cuban immigrants who moved to Hartford from Florida, grew up in the neighborhood and experienced its steady deterioration, starting in the 1980's with the exodus of many property owners who were replaced by lower-income families. By the time the black wrought iron fence went up across Vernon Street, he was a Trinity College student straddling the worlds of privilege and deprivation.
Since April, Mr. Espinosa has been part of a team that is contacting all the nonprofit organizations and small businesses within a one-mile radius of the campus to offer them free or at-cost connections to the World Wide Web. The team also has stationed more than 50 new and refurbished computers in small labs where community residents can gain access to the Internet. Every residence in a 15-square-block area adjacent to the Trinity campus is eligible for a free connection to the Web.
And recently the Trinfo Cafe, the hub of the Smart Neighborhood Initiative, opened its doors to the public. It is housed in a former ice cream shop, which for a while was turned into an evangelical storefront church, just outside the gated perimeter of the Trinity campus. The cafe offers drop-in access to computers and a 17-unit lab where classes in everything from how to point and click a mouse to maintaining a Web site will be taught.
An apprenticeship program to teach teenagers how to salvage components of obsolete computers will be housed in the basement. Donated machines are already piling up there, waiting to be upgraded for a recycling drive aimed at getting hardware into the hands of people who could otherwise not afford it.
Mr. Espinosa, 26, who holds two degrees, including a master's in public policy from Trinity, wears a carving of a clenched fist around his neck signifying, he said, "power to all the people." He refers to the apprentices who will learn basic technical skills as the "farm team." Unless people in small, meagerly financed organizations are eventually able to repair and upgrade their own equipment, the benefits of the Smart Neighborhood Initiative will be short-lived, he said.
Benjamin Todd, also a Trinity alumnus, is the director of the Trinfo Cafe. He remembers as a student getting concerned calls from his mother after a gangland murder near a women's rugby game he himself was attending. The crime affected the college at all levels, said Mr. Todd, 25, not least that students were afraid to venture off the 100-acre campus.
The "smart neighborhood" idea provides ready opportunities for Trinity students to share their knowledge directly with people in the neighborhood.
Mr. Espinosa, who says he feels blessed to have learned how to think at Trinity College, remembers the "social and academic barriers" he was fighting around the same time that the college was physically separating itself from his neighborhood.
He has become a crusader in the drive to distribute computer technology in the areas where he grew up. Skills such as word processing and knowing how to build a computer are of obvious benefit to job seekers. But crossing the digital divide is also about being able to think more expansively, he said. "The folks who don't have access to technology can't even perceive what it can give them," he said.

According to the Dow, Gore's worries are just about over.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE verdict of the Dow Jones industrial average is in, and it says Al Gore is headed for the White House.
The Dow closed yesterday at 10,971.14, up 4.3 percent since the end of July after a roller coaster period that saw it soar during August and then sink in September and early October, only to put on a strong rally in the final two weeks of the month. 
 The Dow's verdict flies in the face of the conventional wisdom of the polls, which show George W. Bush with a narrow lead. But the Dow's record of presidential election forecasting is such an excellent one that it commands respect. It has correctly forecast 22 of the 25 presidential elections since the Dow industrials made their debut in 1897.
The historical pattern is that when the Dow rises from the end of July through the end of October -- the period when the attention of voters is becoming most fixed on the presidential election, the incumbent party keeps the White House. But when the Dow goes down, the insiders are thrown out.
This year the Dow has seemed to be a leading indicator of the polls, at least of the most widely followed tracking poll, the CNN-USA Today Gallup poll. In early August, just after the stock market began its August rally, Mr. Bush enjoyed a 17-point lead. That soon began shrinking, and by Sept. 6, a few days after the market's summer high was reached, Mr. Gore held a 3-point lead. That widened to a 10-point gap, Mr. Gore's biggest in the poll this year, on Sept. 20. By then, however, the rally had petered out, and the market had come down a bit.
The Dow fell sharply through Oct. 18, and by then Mr. Bush was back to a 10-point lead in the polls. That lead then evaporated by Oct. 23, while the stock market was rallying. But within a few days, even as the Dow continued to move up, Mr. Bush's lead reappeared, peaking at 13 points on Oct. 26. But it has since been shrinking as the Dow rallied again, and the latest result gives Mr. Bush a three-point lead.
The likeliest explanation for the Dow's success as an election indicator in the past is not that voters react to the stock market, but that both the market and the election are measures of how Americans feel about the future. A rising market indicates optimism, and such a good feeling can benefit the incumbent party.
The most recent failure of the Dow as an election indicator came in 1968, a year that in some ways is similar to this one. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was an incumbent vice president whose Republican opponent's last name had been on the ballot -- and lost -- eight years before. That election pitted Vice President Hubert Humphrey against Richard M. Nixon, who had lost the election in 1960. Now Mr. Gore is opposing the son of President George Bush, who was defeated in 1992.
Perhaps more important, the country was in what was then the longest economic expansion in American history, a period of growth that would not end until late 1969. That expansion now ranks second, having been eclipsed by the current one that began in 1991. If Mr. Bush wins this year, perhaps it will be right to conclude that voters are less focused on the economy after a very long period of prosperity dulls the memory of recession.
The other times that the Dow failed as a forecaster were in 1932 and 1956. In 1932, a recovery in the Dow was tiny compared with the fall from the 1929 peaks and had no chance to restore Herbert Hoover's reputation or popularity. In 1956, Dwight D. Eisenhower cruised to re-election despite a dip in the Dow.
On all those three failures of forecasting, the Dow did reverse itself in the couple of weeks before the end of October, rising in 1956 and falling in 1932 and 1968 -- a move that could be seen as qualifying the otherwise incorrect election forecast.
This year, however, the last couple of weeks in October were strong ones for the Dow, and if Mr. Gore nonetheless loses, it would seem to indicate a clear failure for the Dow as an election indicator. Nor does the weakness of the Nasdaq provide a convincing contrary forecast. Even after yesterday's 5.6 percent rally, the Nasdaq composite is down 10.5 percent since the end of July.
Unfortunately for Republican hopes, the Nasdaq's record as a market forecaster is not very good. In the seven presidential elections since it began in 1971, the Nasdaq has correctly forecast just four of them. It rose in 1980 and 1992, when incumbents were nonetheless defeated, and fell in 1988, when the incumbent party kept the White House.

Chart: "As the Dow Goes, So Goes Gore?"
The Dow rose 4.3 percent from the end of July through the end of October, which in the past has meant that the incumbent party candidate would win the election. This year, Al Gore's polling results have improved within a week or two of the market beginning to rally, and have fallen shortly after the Dow began to slip. Most recently, however, George W. Bush has done well despite a rising Dow.

Competition Is Too Much For Treasuries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as rising stocks and Fannie Mae's sale of $7 billion in new debt overshadowed earlier reports pointing to a slowing economy.
"The stock market is becoming a very tough competitor for bonds again," said Frederick Cavanaugh, who has bought high-yield corporate bonds for the $1.2 billion John Hancock Strategic Income Fund in Boston. The average yield on a subinvestment-grade corporate security is 7.68 percentage points higher than that of a 10-year Treasury note, according to a Merrill Lynch index. 
 The 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32, to a price of 100. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.75 percent from 5.73 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32, to 106 19/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.78 percent from 5.75 percent on Monday.
Stock gains sapped demand for government debt with the Nasdaq composite index surging 5.6 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising more than 2 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 1.3 percent.
The 10-year note and 30-year bond led the market lower as Fannie Mae, the No. 1 buyer of mortgages in the United States, began selling $5 billion in 10-year notes and $2 billion in 30-year bonds, according to people close to the transaction.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 50-day cash management bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.114
Investment rate: 6.38%
High rate: 6.53%

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Drops, but New-Home Sales Surge

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence dropped sharply in October, to its lowest level in a year, but sales of new homes in September surged past Wall Street expectations, two reports showed yesterday.
The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, said that its consumer confidence index fell sharply, to 135.2 in October from 142.5 in September, well below the record of 144.7 registered in May and January. 
 The Conference Board index, based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households, is closely watched because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The report offers concern for retailers, said Sung Won Sohn, executive vice president and chief economist with Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.
"I'm sure some of the retailers are sweating a bit, too, if consumers will come back shopping," Mr. Sohn said. "This could mean that we could see more discounts and promotions to move the merchandise early."
The October drop in the consumer confidence index was set off "by a cooling economy and apprehension regarding soaring oil prices and volatility in the financial markets," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research center. The last time it was this low was in October 1999, when it stood at 130.5.
Recent developments, including stock market jitters, a rise in jobless claims and interest rates, and the uncertainty of next week's elections made the slump in confidence almost inevitable, economists said.
Even so, a separate report from the Commerce Department showed that sales of new homes soared in September by a surprising 9.2 percent to the highest level in six months as cheaper mortgage rates encouraged buyers to lock in deals.
Mr. Sohn said there were still signs consumers remained in a buying mood, albeit a more cautious one.
"If consumers are willing to buy more homes and cars, they must have fairly strong confidence, otherwise they would not be making commitments for these big-ticket items," he said.
The economy remains strong, with growth slowing to a more sustainable pace and consumers still relatively confident, said Gary R. Thayer, chief economist for A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
"People may not be saying things are quite as rosy as they were, but I think they still feel pretty good about the overall economic picture," he said.
The 9.2 percent increase in new- home sales, the largest since an 11 percent rise in July, was not expected. Many analysts were predicting new-home sales would fall 0.7 percent.
Americans bought new single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 946,000 in September, the highest level since a rate of 947,000 in March, the Commerce Department said.
New-home sales fell 5.8 percent in August, according to revised figures, a weaker performance than the 3 percent drop the government reported one month ago.
Declining mortgage rates contributed to the rise in new-home sales, economists said.
In September, mortgage rates continued to creep down as the moderating economy reduced pressure on long-term interest rates. The average interest rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage was 7.91 percent last month, down from 8.03 percent in August, but higher than the 7.82 percent rate in September 1999.
Even so, consumer optimism about the economy has begun to wane somewhat, with more expressing doubts about business conditions and their ability to find new jobs, the Conference Board said.
Just 16.5 percent of people polled in the newest survey expected an improvement in business conditions over the next six months, down from 19 percent in September. The percentage anticipating conditions to worsen rose from 5.6 percent to 7.2 percent.
In addition, 13.1 percent of consumers surveyed said they expected fewer job openings, up from 10.9 percent last month. In another sign of dimming expectations, just 24.2 percent expected their incomes to rise, a steep drop from the 28.1 percent who shared that viewpoint in September.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Border Industries Facing Some Import Taxes

BYLINE: By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Mexico's maquiladoras, the thriving assembly-plant industries, have received the news they have been dreading for years -- they will now have to pay taxes on some of the imports used to assemble finished goods for export.
The Mexican government has given the maquiladoras two months to learn and apply a labyrinthine tax system, the structure of which has yet to be announced by the treasury department. 
 The news has led some industry leaders to wonder aloud if they should move elsewhere -- to a country that can guarantee them long-term legal and fiscal certainty, something Mexico is not famous for.
The new tax regulations, announced by the commerce secretary on Monday, say that maquiladoras, barring certain exemptions, will have to pay tariffs ranging from 2 percent to 25 percent on imported components from countries other than the United States and Canada -- Mexico's North American Free Trade Agreement partners. This radically changes the landscape in which maquiladoras have operated in Mexico for decades.
Most of the maquiladoras are situated in the north of Mexico, close to the United States border and have helped drive the growth of the Mexican economy in the six years since Nafta was approved.
The incentive for multinationals to base their operations in Mexico had stemmed from a lack of import duties. But now confusion abounds over what kind of tax system will be imposed when the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.
Rocio Ruiz, the director of export services for the commerce ministry, defended the new taxes at a news conference on Tuesday.
"The bad news is that maquiladoras are going to have to start paying tariffs," she said. "The good news is that the tariff will be zero in most cases," adding that only 20 percent of the maquiladoras would have to pay the new tax.
But the chief complaint from the industry is not that it will have to pay taxes on imports. The companies have known that since 1994, when the trade accord took effect. But they maintain that they needed more notice of what the new regulations would entail -- a longer period, presumably, than the two months they have been given.
Representatives of the maquiladoras say the greatest fear is in having to deal with the treasury department bureaucracy, which has also not announced what kind of system it will use to collect the taxes.
"We don't think we have to be subject to controls that incur added costs to operations," said Humberto Inzunza, president of the National Maquiladora Industry in Mexico. "The maquiladora industry has to have legal certainty to be able to plan ahead and forecast operations in 5, 10, 15 years from now. If we don't have this, it's going to be hard to compete in Mexico."
The timing could not be much worse for President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada, who takes office on Dec. 1, and does not want to jeopardize the industry, which generates more than $10 billion in foreign income. It represents 46 percent of the country's exports -- billions of dollars in sales -- and employs 1.3 million people in 4,000 plants. The maquiladora industry has been credited with creating 3 of every 10 new jobs in the last six years.
Members of Mr. Fox's transition team say they are working closely with industry leaders. "Our overall policy is that Mexico's industry should be competitive," said Carlos Angulo Parra, a member of Mr. Fox's international economic affairs team. "If taxes prevent the maquiladoras from being competitive, the tax system should be fixed." Mr. Angulo said Mr. Fox might undo changes made by the current administration if he thinks they will inhibit these exporters' competitiveness.
Mr. Inzunza said Mr. Fox's advisers "guarantee they will change the rulings if they are wrong." He added, "We have an open door with these guys to continue operating with competitiveness."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Technology Breeds Volatility and All Major Gauges Advance

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks moved sharply higher yesterday, continuing the turbulence of recent weeks, as investors bid up many of the same technology shares that they sold heavily last week.
For at least one day, investors put aside worries that the economy is slowing and rediscovered the allure of technology stocks, especially high-growth networking equipment companies like Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase. Led by Cisco, which rose 12 percent yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index soared 178.23 points, or 5.6 percent, to 3,369.63. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 30.74 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,429.40, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 135.37 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,971.14. In the Dow, Procter & Gamble fell $5.06, to $71.44, but other blue chips more than made up for it. J. P. Morgan rose $6.13, to $165.50; General Motors gained $2.31, to $61.19; and I.B.M. climbed $5.06, to $98.38.
The Nasdaq's gain was the 10th-largest rise in the index's three decades. But analysts were reluctant to call the move the beginning of a long-term rally because wide swings in the Nasdaq have become commonplace. On Oct. 9, the Nasdaq ended at 3,355.56, almost exactly the level at which it ended trading yesterday. In the three weeks since then, the index has had three of its biggest one-day gains and lost 2 percent or more of its value seven times.
Many technology issues have faced even greater volatility. Yesterday, for example, JDS Uniphase, the leading manufacturer of fiber optic components used in high-speed telecommunications equipment, rose $10.13, or more than 14 percent, to $81.44, after falling 25.3 percent last Wednesday and rising 13.8 percent on Oct. 20.
Uncertainty and volatility are likely to continue for some time, money managers said yesterday, because investors are uncertain how quickly the economy and corporate profit growth are slowing.
"We're closer to clueless than another spot in the knowledge spectrum," said Jim Weiss, chief investment officer of State Street Research in Boston, which manages $56 billion. "There's a high degree of confusion as to what's going on with the economy and what's going on with corporate profits." Yesterday's rally in technology was unrelated to any fundamental change in the outlook for the economy, Mr. Weiss said. He noted that Oct. 31 is the end of the fiscal year for many mutual funds.
As a result, mutual fund managers had sold shares of beaten-down technology stocks throughout October to realize capital losses they could use to balance capital gains that their funds posted earlier this year. That tax-loss selling pressure had artificially depressed the shares of many technology companies, and when it ended yesterday morning, the stocks rallied, Mr. Weiss said.
Because the rally was technical rather than fundamental, "it's going to be very difficult to have strong follow-through tomorrow," he said.
Still, Mr. Weiss said he was cautiously optimistic for 2001, saying he thought corporate profits would rise 7 to 10 percent for the year. "I believe that productivity is going to continue to surprise people with its strength and be a help of corporate profit growth," he said.
Charles L. Hill, research director of First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' profit forecasts, said he was worried that money managers like Mr. Weiss might be overly optimistic about next year's earnings.
Analysts are still predicting profit growth of 13.3 percent for the S.& P. 500 in 2001, Mr. Hill said. But they have recently been slashing earnings predictions for the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001, and those cuts are likely to continue as economic growth slows, he said.
For all of next year, earnings growth for the S.& P. 500 "could be 2 or 3 percent," Mr. Hill added.
Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed Financial in Overland Park, Kan., which manages $40 billion, said he was also pessimistic. Yesterday's rally "is going to prove to be a head fake," Mr. Herrmann said. "I think in the end you're going to have to deal with the reality of pressure on profits."
Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said investors had been unable to find a market sector that seemed worth buying. High-growth technology stocks have fallen sharply but are not cheap by historical measures, especially because their profit growth appears to have peaked.
Cyclical stocks, whose profits are especially sensitive to economic growth, are cheap on a price-earnings basis, Mr. Wien said, but few investors want to own them with the economy apparently slowing. Financial stocks, which are a natural choice if the Federal Reserve plans to lower interest rates, have risen this year and are also no bargain, he said.
"The market is not predicting anything in particular," Mr. Wien said, "the market is fully priced."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: MICHIGAN;
In a Tossup State, This Town Turns Inside Out

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich., Oct. 31

 BODY:
Never has this place meant so much to so many.
"This state has the ability to decide this close election," Vice President Al Gore told a throng of 5,000 here on Sunday. "You have the ability to decide what this state decides." 
 Lynne Cheney, the wife of the Republican who wants Mr. Gore's job, seconded the motion this afternoon, telling volunteers stuffing envelopes that "every stamp you're putting on there could make the difference."
Bob Dole is coming to rally the troops at V.F.W. headquarters on Wednesday. John McCain is scheduled for Saturday. Tipper Gore may show up on Thursday. Laura and Barbara Bush were here last week, Ralph Nader last month and George W. Bush back in primary season (don't cross him off the guest list for this weekend).
Such is life in a tossup city in a swing district in a battleground state. Not only is the presidential race neck and neck here, but Lansing is the home of the Democratic challenger in one of the nation's tightest races for the United States Senate, and the center of one of the country's most fiercely contested open House seats. There are also two knock-down fights for open seats in the Michigan House, a bunch of judgeships on the ballot and a county commissioner or two running for re-election. Plus a statewide initiative on school vouchers.
All of which means, in the words of Rusty Hills, the Republican state chairman, "more pizza, less sleep."
Or, from the vantage point of Dimitri's, a diner downtown: "We don't get anything except bored," said Mark Anderson, a breakfast regular.
Lansing, a town of 125,000 normally swathed in the green and white of the Michigan State University Spartans, is pocked with red, white and blue yard signs, its airwaves packed with political advertisements that residents can recite by heart. It is hard to find people who have not been polled -- twice. You wouldn't be the first to call it ground zero.
"The amount of activity and the amount of money being spent is a couple of orders of magnitude beyond what we've ever seen," said the Democratic state chairman, Mark Brewer, a 25-year veteran of Michigan politics. "Number of volunteers, paid staffers, phone calls -- everything is just up, significantly."
Smack in the middle of the palm of the hand that is Michigan's map, Lansing is normally a somewhat sleepy state capital that has confounded generations of schoolchildren. (No, the capital is not Detroit. Or Ann Arbor.) About 20,000 local people work for the state government, 16,000 for three G.M. plants in town and 12,000 for the university, in neighboring East Lansing.
The area's unemployment rate registers barely 2 percent, and median income is $32,000, solidly in that middle class every candidate loves to talk about. The city itself is heavily Democratic, and about 19 percent black, but the surrounding suburbs and farms are white and Republican; hence the tossup politics. A recent survey suggested that as many as 1 in 4 people remained undecided about the presidential race.
"I don't really like what Bush stands for, but I like what Gore stands for even less," said George Campbell, 62, a lawyer nursing a coffee at Dimitri's, home of the governor's favorite rice pudding.
"I don't trust any of them," added Mr. Campbell's table mate, George Tesseris, 69 and retired. "Don't let anybody stay in office too long: they learn how to steal better that way. Stir the pot, stir the pot."
And so Mr. Tesseris and Mr. Campbell plan to vote for Mr. Bush, perhaps part of the trend that has the Republicans inching up in the polls in this swing state recently.
Indeed, interviews with about two dozen voters here over the last two days -- at Dimitri's and at Kelly's, a Capitol watering hole, as well as at the Flap Jack Shack in a shopping center nearby -- suggested a slight advantage for Mr. Bush.
There are lots of Roman Catholics here, many of them Reagan Democrats who prefer Mr. Bush's anti-abortion stance, and plenty of hunters afraid of Mr. Gore's advocacy of gun control. People are talking about the marriage tax and the estate tax, and wanting to choose how their Social Security is invested. But this is also state headquarters for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and local unions plan a huge blitz to get out the vote.
With so many hot races, there is something for everyone.
Lenny Burns, the owner of Kelly's, can't wait to pull the lever for Dianne Byrum, a Democrat, for the Congressional seat; she's a regular, and, as a hardware store owner, "she knows business," he said.
The guys at Dimitri's have eaten frequently with Spencer Abraham, the Senate incumbent, and besides, they think the challenger, Debbie Stabenow, "will say anything to get the vote," as Mr. Tesseris put it.
Bea Payne, a 60-year resident of Lansing who was having a coffee at the Flap Jack on Monday, is focused on the voucher initiative, which looks as if it is headed for defeat.
Meanwhile, David Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State, gave his 287th interview of the year this morning.
In a word, it's intense.
As the campaigns enter their final week, Lansing is aching from all the attention, residents' groaning about airwaves overloaded with lies, motorcade-induced gridlock, mailboxes packed with mudslinging. But for every person who just wishes it would end, there is someone like Mike Kossey or Linda Henderson, both of whom are turning their schedules over to the season.
Ms. Henderson, 46, has a a family-law practice but cannot afford health insurance. Her knees are too weak for door-to-door canvassing, so on Monday night -- and most nights last week -- she spent four hours in the trailer of an 18-wheeler, wearing a headset, one of a dozen volunteers in a high-tech operation that dialed 5,982 numbers of Democrats and independent voters.
"Helen?" Ms. Henderson said, sounding as if she were calling an old friend. "I'm a resident of Lansing, Mich., down the road from you. This election is so close, I decided to put some personal time in."
There was a script, but Ms. Henderson ignored it, gesticulating wildly at the wall as she tried to persuade a man to trust Mr. Gore to keep the economy going, convince a woman that the vice president would protect her Social Security check and get an undecided voter to commit, or an apathetic one to turn out.
"There is something very enriching about communicating with people who you don't know but who are your neighbors," she said. "The whole point is not just to get the message out, but to get them to think about it. The way to get them to think about it is to show somebody who cares."
Mr. Kossey has no script at all.
For about two months now, Mr. Kossey, 51, who retired from the Marine Corps Reserve as a lieutenant colonel in 1993, has spent some 13 hours a day answering phones at Bush statewide headquarters in the basement of a shopping mall here. "Whenever the phone rings, it's an adventure," he said, then interrupted himself to answer the phone.
"Everybody out there in the political process thinks they're a political consultant: why doesn't Bush do this or say that?" Mr. Kossey said. "It's like being an armchair quarterback in a Monday night football game. Except this lasts much longer than a football game."

HEADLINE: Trade Dispute More Likely as Telmex Sues on Connection Fees

BYLINE: By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 31

 BODY:
A long-simmering telecommunications dispute between the United States and Mexico appeared to be heading more rapidly toward a World Trade Organization arbitration panel today.
The dominant Mexican phone company, Telefonos de Mexico, announced late Monday that it would ask a court to overturn a recent ruling by Mexican federal regulators to reduce by nearly two-thirds interconnection fees, which the company charges competitors to begin and end international calls in Mexico. The ruling would allow foreign rivals of the big carrier, known as Telmex, greater access to Mexico's telecommunications market. 
 Earlier this month, Mexico's telecommunications regulatory panel, Cofetel, ordered a 63 percent reduction in interconnection fees, to 1.25 cents a minute from 3.36 cents. The new regulations are scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1.
Rivals like AT&T and WorldCom have repeatedly complained that the interconnection fees make competing for a slice of Mexico's $12 billion telecommunications market a losing battle. They also argue that these practices violate trade agreements.
In July, United States trade officials threatened to take Mexico before a W.T.O. arbitration panel unless regulators ordered Telmex to abide by agreements signed by both countries. Earlier this month, a deputy United States trade representative, Richard Fisher, traveled to Mexico and said he left hoping that Mexican officials would force Telmex to reduce its interconnection fees. At the time, Washington had relaxed its public stance, saying it would resort to a W.T.O. trade panel ruling only if needed.
"This is a giant step backward in the process," Mr. Fisher said today, after learning of Telmex's decision to try to overturn the fee reductions. "This is what we were worried about -- that Telmex would use the judicial system to thwart the independence of the regulatory agencies."
Now, he said, Washington must wait to see how the courts would deal with Telmex's request. But "this does not relieve Mexico from living up to its commitments under W.T.O. telecommunications agreements," Mr. Fisher said. "Let's see what the Mexican government does."
Telmex, a former state enterprise, has sometimes been accused of operating above the law -- repeatedly tying up regulatory decisions by filing court appeals and exploiting the Mexican government's weakness in enforcing antitrust regulations.
The company, controlled by one of Latin America's richest men, Carlos Slim Helu, was deemed a private monopoly two years ago by federal regulators. The decision, if enforced, would have resulted in a significant easing of the company's grip on the telecommunications market. Its share of long-distance traffic in Mexico has rebounded to 81 percent after falling to about 70 percent. It still has more than 95 percent of local service.
President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada, who takes office on Dec. 1, has said that regulatory agencies will have to be strengthened to allow more competition across the board.
A legislator from Mr. Fox's National Action Party, Emilio Goicoechea Luna, said he was working with the transition team to prepare legislation that would increase regulatory agencies' power, notably in enforcement. The proposed law would limit the appeals process and prevent companies from skirting regulatory decisions with endless judicial appeals. "We need in this country better laws for competition and for telecommunications," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN COSTS;
Air Time Is at Premium As Election Draws Near

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Thomas R. Carper, the Delaware governor who is running for the United States Senate, is finding what many other politicians across the country already know: that the closer it gets to Election Day, the more expensive it is to get campaign commercials on the air.
Two months ago, the Carper campaign paid $1,250 for a 30-second spot on a nearby Philadelphia station. Now, the same spot costs $1,650. And when the Democratic Party wants to advertise on Mr. Carper's behalf, the price is an even stiffer $3,250 per spot because of federal regulations allowing broadcasters to charge political parties more than candidates. 
 With time running out before Election Day, candidates and interest groups across the country are waging bidding wars over the dwindling supply of television air time. As a result, rates for campaign commercials -- and broadcasters' revenues -- are reaching eye-popping levels.
In addition, federal rules designed to provide discounted television time for candidates are proving to be of little help as anxious candidates are willing to pay top dollar for prime television spots and have driven up prices for everyone.
Television stations are estimated to gain $600 million to $1 billion from the bumper crop of political advertisements this year, according to industry and Wall Street estimates. The money is coming directly from candidates and issue groups, desperate to win and flush with cash. Moreover, with campaign media buyers earning 5 percent to 10 percent of every commercial placed, the more they air, the more money they make.
"The political system is flush with money and there is a win-at-any-cost mentality that finds its way into political races," said Paul Taylor, executive director of the Alliance for Better Campaigns, a Washington group seeking free air time for candidates. "But also, you have a broadcast industry that is putting a price on democracy and gouging, and no one has called them on it. These are folks who know how to turn a buck."
In Seattle, one Republican media buyer said that at the end of August, he could buy 30 seconds of air time at $400 per ratings point. A ratings point is the percentage of television-owning homes tuning in to a given program. The price rose to $530 a ratings point three weeks ago. Now it is $800 per ratings point and, according to the buyer, "going up."
And Kyle Osterhaut, who places advertisements for Democrats, said rates have tripled since August, especially in battleground states. "It's getting extremely tight and extremely expensive," said Mr. Osterhaut, vice president at Media Strategies and Research in Lakewood, Colo. "And, it's also radio. Campaign money is creating a bidding war and television stations are benefiting."
Federal regulations require television stations to provide political candidates with special low rates. In the 60 days before an election, candidates are able to receive air time at the "lowest-unit rate," which is equal to the lowest price of any commercial in that same time slot that week.
But there is only so much air time available before Election Day, Nov. 7, and the demand for it is intense. So like the price of seats on a crowded airplane, the lowest-unit rate for commercial time slots has been rising steadily. "It's the lowest-unit rate based on what is available today," said Louis Schultz, chief executive of Initiative Media, a media buying company in Los Angeles.
In addition, many stations say politicians are forgoing the lowest-unit rate and instead are paying premium prices to ensure that their commercials are not pre-empted by higher-paying advertisers.
"Lots of candidates could care less about lowest-unit charge," said one Federal Communications Commission regulator.
Moreover, government regulations providing candidates with discounted air time does not apply to political parties or to the hundreds of other interest groups airing commercials. These groups pay the same as any other broadcast advertiser -- and sometimes more -- because political organizations cannot negotiate the same volume discounts as commercial advertisers.
These interest groups, too, are relatively undeterred by rising prices. Jonathan Lichter, a media buyer in Chicago for several conservative groups supporting Gov. George W. Bush, said that television stations were charging three times the normal rate for air time -- and that his clients are not objecting.
"I'd tell some of these clients that we could get air time, but we'd have to pay three times the normal rate," Mr. Lichter said, "and they'd say, 'We understand, no problem. We want our message out.' "
The bulk of this money is falling to local broadcasters in battleground states and is seen as helping to buoy a broadcast industry whose revenues have been stagnant in the last few years. Political advertisements in the current campaign represent 10 percent of all commercials, putting them behind those for auto and retail, but ahead of those for fast food, consumer products, telephone and beer, according to the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns.
"We're seeing monstrous growth," said Victor Miller, a broadcast industry analyst at Bear Stearns. "The bottom line is that political advertising is becoming a higher and higher category of ads -- and a lot of the money coming in, obviously, is not being sold at the lowest-unit rate."
Leland Westfield, a broadcast analyst with PaineWebber Inc., estimated that television stations will get $1 billion in revenues from political advertisements this year, while the Television Bureau of Advertisers, a trade group, puts the number closer to $600 million. During the 1992 presidential election year, $300 million was spent on broadcasting, and $400 million was spent in 1996, according to Bear Stearns.
This fast growth rate has left some campaigns fuming.
"Television stations are gouging political campaigns," said Neil Oxman, the media buyer for the Carper campaign. "They are really, really gouging. We have this huge, wonderful economy, so the costs of television ads are at an all-time high."
Television stations point to politicians, who they say have so much cash and are so desperate for air time that they are pushing up rates for everyone. Moreoever, they say not everyone is getting rich. National broadcasters are being bypassed by candidates looking to buy only in specific states, as are local stations in states where races are not close.
Besides, broadcasters say, this sudden wealth happens only during election years.
"I'm not saying that there is not an incredible and obscene amount of money out there," said Ken Goldstein, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin. "It's appalling and that's why rates are rising. It's not something I get worked up about though. That's the marketplace working and if interest groups are stupid enough to spend it -- well, God bless them."
Scott Hayner, sales manager for KOMO-TV in Seattle, said that it is "getting difficult, getting extremely difficult" for some political groups to get the air time they want. Mr. Hayner said that his station is providing whatever it can, but that to some groups "we have to say what they want is not available."
Mr. Hayner noted that "had it not been for political ads, our September would have been disastrous" because many regular advertisers stayed away during the Olympics.
In Detroit, where the presidential race is tight and there are many hot local races, the demand for air time is "horrific," said Grace Gilchrist, station manager at WXYZ-TV. Ms. Gilchrist said that both presidential candidates are buying last-minute air time, which is the most expensive form of advertising.

HEADLINE: Comments on AIDS Weaken Mbeki

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 31

 BODY:
For months, President Thabo Mbeki doggedly endured a relentless shower of censure, refusing to agree that H.I.V. causes AIDS and dismissing his critics as "blind defenders of the faith." The government's announcement two weeks ago that Mr. Mbeki was reducing his role in the debate came too late to lift many South Africans' deepened confusion about AIDS and its origins.
The real question now may be how seriously he has damaged himself. 
 In the past year, Mr. Mbeki's approval ratings have dropped to 50 percent from 70 percent. While that may be due as much to the faltering economy as to his views, it is his stance on AIDS that has garnered major attention, at home and abroad.
His public musings on AIDS have led senior American officials and legislators, privately, to question his judgment. South African trade and banking officials fear his stance may be troubling skittish investors. The press has become increasingly critical, with one commentator asking in The Sowetan, "Is Mbeki Fit to Govern?" Government officials are finding it hard to hide their dismay at the shadow that the H.I.V. controversy has cast on the Mbeki presidency.
The presidential minister, Essop Pahad, flew to London recently to meet with newspaper editors to try to stem the stream of negative stories about Mr. Mbeki. And Tito Mboweni, chairman of the Reserve Bank, has urged government officials to watch their words because they might deter potential investors.
On Monday, the government announced the creation of an international marketing council, made up of government officials and business people, to counter a host of negative perceptions about crime, AIDS and Mr. Mbeki's response to the troubles in neighboring Zimbabwe. "It is worrying," Mr. Pahad said. "For us it is important that we should attract quality investment to South Africa. If there is a negative message that is going out, if it is the reason why we're not getting as much quality investment as we should, obviously that would be worrying."
Mr. Mbeki has also, increasingly, reached out to the public, acknowledging that the government must improve South Africa's image. But last week, in a wide-ranging interview with foreign reporters, he repeatedly declined to say whether he believed that H.I.V. causes the disease that is ravaging this country. And while he emphasized his passion for fighting AIDS, he made it clear that despite the negative reaction, he did not regret entering into the debate on AIDS's causes.
"Whatever the controversy, people are dying from AIDS," Mr. Mbeki said at the Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria on Wednesday. "People are dying from AIDS and there is no vaccine. This is a very serious problem. And if the attention by the president to a matter of that kind is being described as unhinged, I'm afraid I can't help you. But I certainly am not going to be discouraged from helping to confront this catastrophe as best as I can."
Taking steps to rebuild credibility this month, the government finally began an anti-AIDS advertising campaign, which stressed the importance of condoms, fidelity and abstinence. Officials have also decided to expand research into the effectiveness of the anti-AIDS drug Nevirapine in combating mother-to-child transmission of the virus.
Last week, Mr. Mbeki issued his sharpest condemnation yet of the continuing occupations of white-owned farms by black squatters in Zimbabwe and the political violence condoned by its president, Robert Mugabe. "These things are wrong," Mr. Mbeki said. "These things must stop. They must be addressed. And we'll continue to say those things."
The Sunday Times of Johannesburg praised those moves, taking particular note of Mr. Mbeki's decision to scale back his role in the AIDS debate and his tougher talk on Zimbabwe. "In the past few weeks," the paper said in an editorial this weekend, "President Thabo Mbeki has done what South Africans have been pleading with him to do for months."
Political analysts say he had no choice. "The AIDS policy and the communication of that policy was simply an unmitigated public relations disaster," said Chris Landsberg, a political analyst and lecturer in international relations at the University of the Witwatersrand here. "I really think he is coming to the belief, and rightly so, that whether he's right on his AIDS view or not, it has caused such a stir now that his mind, his integrity, his very presidency has been called into question," Mr. Landsberg said.
Mr. Pahad -- though he blames the media for distorting Mr. Mbeki's message -- acknowledges that the government has not handled the AIDS furor very well. But officials say they believe the drop in Mr. Mbeki's popularity may have more to do with the struggling economy than with the AIDS debate.
On Monday, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel reduced his growth forecast for the year to 2.6 percent from 3.6 percent, citing the troubles in Zimbabwe, depressed gold prices and soaring oil prices.
Still, Mr. Mbeki has often been his own worst enemy, repeatedly disregarding the advice of his government's doctors and seemingly oblivious to the impact his statements were having on efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. AIDS counselors say they now encounter people who assume they can engage in risky sexual behavior, because the president and scientists he supports have minimized the role of H.I.V. and suggested that poverty, more than a factor contributing to AIDS in Africa, is its direct cause.
Last month even Mr. Mbeki's partners in government, the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party, stated publicly that H.I.V. causes AIDS and called on the president to make the same statement.
So far Mr. Mbeki has not done so, going only so far as to tell Parliament last month that the government's AIDS policies are based on the "thesis" that H.I.V. causes AIDS. The distinction has only compounded the frustration of some critics.
At the Wednesday news conference, the president emphasized his desire to grapple with the virus, which infects an estimated 4.2 million people here, or about 20 percent of the population -- more than anywhere else in the world. But he showed no signs of backing away from the issue that stirred the furor in the first place.
"I'm not quite sure what use it serves, the question," he said, when a reporter asked whether he had said that H.I.V. does not cause AIDS. "If you are looking for pop answers, you are not going to get them from me. Because the science is not reducible to campaign slogans in the street.
"What you and I read is that the greatest possible threat to the future of this continent is H.I.V./AIDS. This is the one thing that is really going to destroy this continent. We had to respond to this thing. How does the president of South Africa say, 'I stay away from this great catastrophe?' "

HEADLINE: Angry at U.S., Arabs Widen Contacts With Iraq

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 31

 BODY:
A growing number of Arab entertainers, intellectuals, politicians and business people have been flying off to Baghdad over the last two weeks, thumbing their noses at international sanctions and giving the Iraqi government a shower of publicity after its 10 years of near isolation.
The support for Iraq is a spillover from the recent outbreak of Palestinian-Israeli violence, which has prompted a resurgence of public support for the idea that the West, led by the United States, behaves badly toward the Arab world. 
 That has never been far from the oratorical surface. But once again, in a way that must please the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, the rallying cry for people from across the Arab political spectrum is "double standard," a shorthand reference to what is seen as American reluctance to hold Israel to account for its treatment of Palestinians.
To express their disaffection, in a dozen instances people in Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Yemen and Jordan have not only embraced the Palestinian cause but have also chartered airplanes to fly to a hero's welcome at Saddam International Airport. Iraq reopened the airport in August as a challenge to the United Nations sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The latest to bow to the public mood and sign up for a flight was the Jordanian prime minister, Ali Abu al-Ragheb. He said he would fly to Baghdad on Wednesday to attend a trade fair aimed at "promoting the good relations between the two countries." Mr. Abu al-Ragheb, who will take 100 Jordanian journalists and politicians with him, would be the highest-ranking Arab official to arrive by air since the embargo went into effect.
In the view of the Clinton administration, some of the flights have violated the sanctions because they did not deliver aid for civilians or did not receive advance United Nations clearance.
Other countries, notably France and Russia, have argued that civilian flights were never specifically banned, although no one tested the point until recently.
Some who have recently made the journey say the point now is to contrast American support for the Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak with American opposition to lifting the embargo on Iraq and to make a point to Ariel Sharon, the leader of the right-wing opposition Likud Party in Israel.
"We are sending a message to Barak and Sharon that we shall not stand with our arms tied while you are killing Palestinians," said Muhammad Monieb, a Cairo lawyer who organized a flight to Baghdad last weekend for about 150 Egyptian celebrities.
Flying to Iraq is not meant to show personal support for the Iraqi president, added Mr. Monieb, a former chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights.
"We fully support the return of Iraq to the Arab family," he said. "All Arab regimes are dictatorships. All Arab leaders commit mistakes against their own people. If the Americans consider Saddam a dictator, then let them tell us who is not a dictator in the region."
Iraq has responded to the recent political support from Arab countries by stepping up its campaign to have the sanctions lifted or to undermine them. It announced Monday that the state-owned airline, Iraqi Airways, would resume some domestic service on Nov. 5.
The airline canceled all internal flights in 1992 when the United States and Britain instituted no-flight zones aimed at protecting rebellious Kurds in the northern part of Iraq and Shiite Muslims in the south from attacks by Iraqi military planes and helicopters. American and British aircraft still patrol the zones and Iraq says their attacks on antiaircraft installations since the end of the gulf war have killed more than 300 people.
With stronger Arab public support, Iraq has also found a newly receptive audience for its assertion that it is the only true defender of Arab and Palestinian interests.
During the last week, as Arabs from other countries have been flying into Baghdad with food and support for Iraqis, Iraq has been sending food and supplies for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. As Arab doctors have flown in with medicines for Iraqis, the Iraqis welcomed a Palestinian plane that brought several people wounded in clashes with Israelis to Baghdad for medical treatment.
Still, the public support is unlikely to translate into open sanctions-busting by Arab governments, most of which have urged the United Nations to lift sanctions but have pledged to follow the international rules.
Arab governments also have decidedly mixed views on Saddam Hussein. While several of the smaller Arab states have quietly re-established diplomatic relations with Iraq over the past few years, the West's main allies, like Egypt, have not reopened their embassies.
The Iraqi president's constant badgering of his fellow Arab leaders has not helped relations. After the emergency Arab summit meeting this month to respond to the Palestinian-Israeli violence, Iraq urged the overthrow of Arab governments. The bellicose demand was particularly stinging because the Arab League's invitation to Iraq to attend a summit meeting was the first in nearly 10 years.
Arab governments will nevertheless be obliged to take account of the public mood and to offer support for the Iraqi people, said Soliman Awaad, director of multinational relations in the Egyptian foreign ministry, adding, "We are under tremendous pressure from public opinion -- and I'm not confining this to Egypt only, but all through the region as well as from our civil society -- which is being promoted by the West and the U.N."
Mr. Awaad, who advocates lifting the sanctions, said his office had been inundated with requests from private groups to fly to Baghdad to show support for Iraq, while normally apolitical taxi drivers and shopkeepers have been badgering him about the sanctions.
"They are wondering about the silk glove used by the U.N. and its organizations in dealing with Israel, and comparing it to the clumsy rough hand with regards to Iraq," he said.
The sanctions on Iraq have become a constant irritant at the United Nations, particularly between Security Council members with different views on how to measure Iraqi compliance with the requirement that it no longer produce or store any weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has refused entry to inspectors.
Various United Nations bodies now have a number of sanctions-related issues before them.
Iraq recently announced, for example, that it would accept only euros in payment for the oil that the United Nations allows it to sell, instead of dollars, which it described as the currency of its enemy. The United Nations officials who oversee oil sales as part of the embargo rules said Monday that they have asked Iraq to delay carrying that out so they can study the idea.
For months, Iraq has also refused to accept an independent monitoring team proposed by the United Nations to survey civilian living conditions. To try to overcome its objections, Secretary General Kofi Annan proposed Monday that Thorvald Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian foreign minister and United Nations high commissioner for refugees, lead the survey committee.

HEADLINE: A Bitter Race in Connecticut Reflects National Platforms

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: WATERBURY, Conn., Oct. 31

 BODY:
In a subdued debate, the major candidates in the closely fought race for Connecticut's Fifth Congressional District cast their contest today as a microcosm of the presidential campaign. The Democratic incumbent, James H. Maloney, and the Republican challenger, Mark Nielsen, each firmly aligned himself with his party's nominee on the core issues of the economy, taxes, Social Security and education.
"This is a terrific way to get a glimpse on how this race connects up with the national race," Mr. Nielsen said in response to a question about tax policy. 
 "The difference between us on this vital issue is that I would go to Washington and I would vote for President George W. Bush's tax cut. My opponent would not."
Mr. Maloney quickly replied, "You are right; I would not, because it would send us back down a road of red ink and budget deficits."
The debate, at a luncheon sponsored by the Waterbury Chamber of Commerce in the Mattatuck Museum here, was the third meeting of the two candidates, who are locked in a bitter rematch of their contest in 1998.
In that race, Mr. Maloney barely fought off a challenge by Mr. Nielsen and won re-election to a second term by just 2,343 votes. They were joined today by a third candidate, Joseph Zdonczyk, of the Concerned Citizens Party.
The race is being watched closely at the national level by both parties, because it could be a factor in the fight for control of Congress. So far, no independent poll has been conducted in the race, giving the candidates and the public little feel for who may have the edge.
The Fifth District, which stretches from Danbury in the west to Meriden in the center of the state, is nearly evenly divided among registered Democrats and Republicans, with most voters in the district unaffiliated.
So even as they expressed basic party loyalty today, the candidates sought to shed partisan stereotypes, with Mr. Maloney portraying himself as an aggressive tax-cutter who favors some limits on abortion rights and Mr. Nielsen describing himself as an advocate of both abortion rights and gun control.
The campaign has been bitter and angry, with the candidates viciously attacking each other's ethics and broadcasting harsh campaign commercials. And for a brief moment at the start of today's event, it seemed the debate would be similarly ill tempered, as Mr. Nielsen used his opening statement for an attack, criticizing Mr. Maloney's position on taxes and accusing him of being beholden to special interests.
"I believe that our inability to make better progress in a number of important areas -- education, the environment, health care -- is traceable to excessive special interest influence in Washington," Mr. Nielsen said.
Mr. Maloney, however, began by praising the city and boasting of his own efforts in Congress. "It's not a coincidence that I-84 from the New York border to Southington, through Waterbury, is all under expansion and construction," he said, referring to the district's largest highway.
He also fired back: "There are differences between Mr. Nielsen and myself. One is that he starts his presentation to you with the negative and false information that he has permeated his campaign with."
At that, the candidates settled into a relatively sober 75-minute discussion of the issues, responding in turn to 11 questions posed by a panel of local journalists.
Both Mr. Maloney and Mr. Nielsen pointed to education as the most important issue, though they disagreed on how to improve schools. Mr. Nielsen called for an end to teacher tenure. Mr. Maloney urged investing more money to reduce class sizes and repair school buildings.
On the economy, Mr. Maloney accused Mr. Nielsen of catching "the fuzzy math disease," employing the phrase used by Mr. Bush to criticize Vice President Al Gore in the first presidential debate.
Mr. Zdonczyk, who described himself as a "constitutionalist," frequently injected humor into the debate, at one point criticizing his opponents for raising more than $3 million, a state record for a Congressional campaign. "I don't have any money," he said. "I don't have soft money. I don't have hard money. I don't have any money in between."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Focusing on Gore Hyperbole

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:

There is an air of mischief in the Bush campaign advertisement that began running on Halloween night in highly contested states in the East, Midwest and Pacific Northwest. The 30-second spot replies to a recent attack advertisement by the Gore campaign by needling Vice President Al Gore on his reputation for exaggeration.
 
PRODUCER -- Maverick Media
 
ON THE SCREEN -- Framed by a television screen within the screen, Mr. Gore is seen in video footage greeting a pharmacist in his store. The scene freezes, and an article from The Washington Times, headlined "Aides Concede Gore Made Up Story" is superimposed. Cut to another shot of the vice president and the word "nonsense." Scene shifts to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in a hard hat, talking to factory workers, and finally, back to Mr. Gore, in mid-debate with Bill Bradley. 

SCRIPT -- Announcer: "Remember when Al Gore said his mother-in-law's prescription cost more than his dog's? His own aides said the story was made up. Now Al Gore is bending the truth again. The press calls Gore's Social Security attacks 'nonsense.' Governor Bush sets aside $2.4 trillion to strengthen Social Security and pay all benefits."
 
Mr. Gore: "There has never been a time in this campaign when I have said something that I know to be untrue. There has never been a time when I have said something untrue."
 
Announcer: "Really?"
 
ACCURACY -- The commercial is a rebuttal to a pair of spots the Gore campaign broadcast in recent days in which economic experts are said to have found Mr. Bush's proposal to partly privatize Social Security "does not add up." As for the reference to his mother-in-law and the dog, the Gore campaign was indeed forced to acknowledge that the anecdote was not gleaned from the candidate's own experience, but from a Congressional study. (Versions of the "dog" story, in fact, have cropped up in commercials by Congressional candidates who are emphasizing the prescription drug issue.) The "nonsense" citation -- attributed generically by the announcer in the commercial to "the press," is from an editorial on Thursday in The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page is known for its conservative leanings. Mr. Bush has been promising audiences that he will put aside $2.4 trillion from the budget surplus to protect Social Security in the future. Mr. Gore's sound bite is from one of his debates with Mr. Bradley in the Democratic primaries.
 
SCORECARD -- The spot is funny, devastating -- and clearly intended to zing Mr. Gore more than to defend Mr. Bush. It only indirectly addresses the criticism in the Gore advertisements, one of which cites conclusions drawn by "eight Nobel laureates" that Mr. Bush's plan promises the same $1 trillion to young people and the elderly. But it cleverly changes the subject by suggesting that Mr. Gore's attacks are merely further evidence of a propensity for stretching the truth. The spot's payoff is the mocking clip in which Mr. Gore asserts that "there has never been a time" when he uttered an untruth, and the announcer's cynical comeback. The commercial deftly shifts the focus from whatever doubts voters may have about Mr. Bush's proposal to questions about Mr. Gore's character. PETER MARKS

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: ECONOMIC PROSPERITY;
Few Voters Credit Democrats for Gains

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: UNIVERSITY CITY, Mo., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Twice as many American families own mutual funds as in 1992, when Al Gore was first elected vice president. That might seem a plus for Mr. Gore in his race against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, since the stock market has quadrupled during Mr. Gore's time in office.
But interviews with voters in the last week in the suburbs of St. Louis -- the sort of politically mixed region that has become so important in this year's unusually close presidential race -- show that many of these voters, including Gore supporters, credit other factors for the nation's prosperity and market gains. 
 For some of these voters, the increase in stock ownership and the time spent fretting over 401(k) choices and other investments has brought a greater fluency about the market and economics. They repeatedly cited factors such as gains in worker productivity from the technology boom, and the success of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in engineering a smooth monetary policy.
And while few gave a lot of credit to the Clinton administration, a number of voters said that having one party capture the White House and the other controlling at least one chamber of Congress could help prevent the government from going overboard on spending or tax cuts.
In University City, an enclave just west of St. Louis, Larry McClendon, a train conductor, said he supported Mr. Gore but gave Democrats only partial credit for the good economy.
"When Clinton came into office is when a lot of e-commerce started to come into effect," Mr. McClendon said.
And Bill Fortenbury, a lawyer in Olivette, another close-in suburb, plans to vote for the vice president because he likes his positions on abortion, the environment and other social issues, not because of the strength of the economy. Whoever is in the White House "makes no difference" to the stock market, he said.
The failure of Mr. Gore to capitalize on the nation's prosperity perplexes many of his supporters, who have encouraged the vice president to spend this last week of the campaign hitting that theme hard. Some supporters even fear this may be one negative effect of Mr. Gore's distancing himself from Mr. Clinton for much of the campaign.
Still, to some experts in politics and economics, the health of the economy is playing a surprisingly small role in the race -- especially compared with 1992, when the Clinton-Gore campaign used fears about the economy to win many middle-of-the-road voters who felt President Bush was not doing enough to pull the country out of recession.
"Every econometric model I know of relates the presidential election to the state of the economy, but if Bush wins, they're all going to be wrong," said Charls E. Walker, an economist and former tax lobbyist who has served in several Republican administrations.
Susan Flom, a retiree in Ladue, another suburb close to St. Louis, favors Mr. Gore. But she said the stock market might do better under a Republican government -- just not Mr. Bush, who she feels is too inexperienced. "If Bush gets elected, I think the market is going to go down."
It is harder to find that sentiment in the more conservative areas further west of St. Louis, where most people interviewed said they felt Mr. Bush would be better for the stock market. At the same time, however, for many of them the future of the stock market is not as important as how each candidates' economic proposals would affect their own line of work.
Mark Ratterman, who lives in St. Charles, about a half-hour west of St. Louis, and owns Domino's Pizza franchises, said he is still disturbed by the health care plan pushed by Hillary Rodham Clinton early in her husband's administration, which he said would have greatly hurt his business. Mr. Gore's populist rhetoric is eerily reminiscent of Ms. Clinton's statements on health care back then, he said.
"I like Bush because he would let the market prevail, while I feel like Gore wants to give money to everybody," he said. At his business, his biggest problem has been rising labor costs, though he says that has been offset, to some degree, by improved technology that has brought streamlined order-taking, accounting, and other functions. Such productivity gains from technology get much of the credit for the strong economy and stock market, Mr. Ratterman said. "That's what's done it," he said. "I can't believe politicians try to take credit for it."
Tom Slater, another small business owner in St. Charles, favors the Bush tax proposals, particularly the repeal of the inheritance tax. Trying to get his daughter, who lives in California, interested in the election recently, he said he spoke to her over the telephone and put things in a practical light: "I asked her, 'Do you want half my estate, or do you want all of my estate?' "
If Mr. Gore is not benefiting from the economy with a lot of voters, this may also mean the market volatility of the past two months, which has seen the Nasdaq drop 20 percent, is not hurting him, either.
Polls still show very high levels of confidence in the economy. A New York Times/CBS News poll taken last week in Florida, another battleground state, found that 78 percent of registered voters who are investors felt the stock market would be the same or improved in six months, while only 12 percent thought it would be worse.
In Jacksonville, Fla., one poll respondent, Marilyn Leachman, a registered nurse who works as a paralegal, said the market could still get bumpy, depending on tensions in the Middle East and oil prices. "But we're not going to see the bottom fall out or anything," she said. Though she said she will vote for Mr. Gore, she does not attribute the strong economy to him, or to Mr. Clinton. "I guess I credit other factors, though I think they allowed some natural progression in the markets to take place," she said.
Many voters may be relatively sanguine over the future course of the stock market in part because stocks bounced back so quickly from the last big dip in the market, in October 1998, when the near-collapse of the Russian economy and a large hedge fund roiled stock and bond markets worldwide: Since then, the Nasdaq has more than doubled, and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index has risen more than 40 percent.
At a restaurant in St. Charles last week, members of the First Capital Investment Club, a group of 35 investors who meet every month to review their portfolio, shook off any fears about a continued market downturn and voted to buy more stocks, including shares of Motorola, Intel and Worldcom.
One club member, Dan Barklage, an attorney in St. Charles and a strong supporter of Mr. Bush, favors drug stocks and shares of Microsoft. Drug stocks will get a boost if Mr. Gore is defeated, as investors will no longer have to fear Mr. Gore's rhetoric against the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Barklage said. Microsoft, which is battling the Justice Department and a court order to break up the software giant, would also get a boost, he said, because "once Bush gets in, they'll stop picking on it."
To a number of the Missouri voters interviewed, the best situation for the stock market and the economy would be a divided government, where each party captures either the White House or at least one chamber of Congress, as has been the case in Washington since 1994.
According to Alan F. Skrainka, the chief market strategist at Edward Jones, the retail brokerage firm based in St. Louis, during the past century stocks have performed best under a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while they did the worst when Republicans held both the White House and Congress.
That rings true to Neil Clavers, an advertising salesman in Richmond Heights, a close-in suburb of St. Louis, who said he would probably vote for Mr. Bush. "I basically think Republicans are better for the market." But a split government may be even better, he said, "to balance each other out."

In His Own Words

 BODY:

AL GORE
Remarks yesterday at Portland Community College, in Portland, Ore.:
"I have to assume that my opponent's tax plan was designed in some kind of supply-side vacuum. Because, no matter how you add it up, it means a return to massive deficits. According to the American Academy of Actuaries, his plans make paying down the debt -- and I quote -- 'impossible.' 
 I will not let us be dragged back into a cycle of big tax giveaways to the wealthy, big deficits, big debt and repeat recessions.
That wouldn't just be bad for our budget and our economy, it would be potentially devastating for America's families and American business. That huge tax cut would mean higher interest rates, which would make it harder to buy a home and which would choke off borrowing and investment in the private sector. And that, in turn, would mean lower productivity and lower levels of economic growth.
Don't take my word for it: eight Nobel Prize winners have concluded that the Bush plan is an economic loser for America.
Our people have worked too hard and achieved too much to waste it on the wrong kind of tax cut that puts the economy at risk. We need targeted, affordable tax cuts for families that keep our budget balanced and keep our prosperity growing.
My opponent likes to criticize my tax cuts for being targeted. So let's be clear on this. Both of us have proposed targeted tax cuts.
The difference is, the Bush plan targets the benefits primarily to the top 1 percent -- families who make, on average, $1 million a year. My tax cut targets the benefits to middle-class families. And that's the second big difference between us.
Senator McCain said it best when he raised concerns about then governor's plan during the primaries: "I don't think Bill Gates needs a tax cut, but I think you and your parents do."

HEADLINE: Flower District Considers a Repotting;
Wholesale Market Feels Pressure As Neighborhood Is Transformed

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
For much of the past century, wholesale flowers have been sold amid the fur fabricators of the West 20's. But in recent years, many wholesalers have closed up shop, and those that remain in the flower market, now concentrated on two blocks of 28th Street, say they may soon be pulling up roots.
Reacting to a wave of new construction in their neighborhood, worsening traffic congestion and a scarcity of parking spaces, the wholesale florists banded together last year and formed the Flower Market Association of NYC. Not long ago they began meeting with city officials to try to identify a site where the dealers, who are determined to move en masse, can set up a market together. 
 "It's better if everyone is in one place," said Pete Sutton, the owner of Mutual Cut Flowers, a company that carries a broad line of what he described as "middle of the road" flowers. "No one wholesaler can carry every type of flower."
Although it has never carried an official designation like the Hunts Point produce market or the Fulton Fish Market, New York's flower district once had a bigger footprint, stretching from 26th to 28th Street and running along the Avenue of the Americas.
Today, many of these family-owned businesses are gone. The market has shrunk to about half its former size, now numbering 31 wholesale florists and several purveyors of pots, planters and baskets spread out along two blocks of side streets.
Before 5 a.m. on a recent weekday, the sidewalks and curbs on 28th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue were already lined with orange dahlias and other seasonal products -- pumpkins, of course, but also branches of red-and-brown maple leaves and green gourds shaped like snakes, bottles and horns.
As workers unloaded a refrigerated truck, flower buyers holding paper coffee cups and cell phones were circulating, indicating their choices with a pointed finger or a quick word. Vans were beginning to clog the narrow street.
By 6 a.m., Luis Collazo, decked out in black leather, had already settled on $2,000 worth of merchandise for Lotus, his Greenwich Village flower shop. His van was filling up with varieties of flowers: the agapanthus from California, the eucharis lily, the hydrangea and the amaryllis from the Netherlands. He bought orchids that only a day or two before were growing in Thailand. The predawn visit to the flower market is a ritual for Mr. Collazo: he is there three times a week. "You get an early start," he said, "you pick up the best stuff."
No official sales figures have been compiled, but Gary W. Page, the president of the Flower Market Association, estimated that the market takes in about $100 million to $120 million a year in sales to retail florists, floral designers and buyers for restaurants, hotels, special events, parties and weddings. The market employs about 300 people, many of them immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries. (Another 300 or so people are employed by wholesalers in other boroughs, according to figures from the State Department of Labor. There are about 500 retail florists in New York City, employing about 1,800 people.)
Heavy pressure on the flower market has come from rezoning on Seventh Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas over the past five years; the changes permit residential development in places that were once restricted to industrial uses. In an area that had little new construction for nearly a quarter-century, 2,100 units of housing are being added in seven buildings, ranging in size from 10 to 37 stories.
Commercial rents in the area are climbing rapidly, raising fears among wholesalers like Mr. Page, the owner of G. Page, a company specializing in exotic flowers, which has only two years left on its lease.
As retail florists and floral designers grow increasingly frustrated with the traffic and parking problems, the market is sure to suffer, the wholesalers predict. They worry that retail florists will be tempted to give more of their business to the dozens of dealers who travel door to door and sell directly off their refrigerated trucks, a competing source of wholesale flowers that emerged 15 years ago. They are also concerned about the potential threat from the Internet and competition from wholesalers in the suburbs.
Rob Houtenbos, the president of Dutch Flower Line, a tenant on 28th Street for 11 years, said the wholesale market has to move and modernize in order to survive. "If we stay here," he said, "we are suffocating ourselves. We need to create a market that sells flowers in a modern way."
Pronouncements like this one have been heard before. In the 1980's, the wholesalers said their market was facing extinction, and some talked about moving to College Point, Queens. A decade later, the focus shifted to the Harlem River Yards in the South Bronx. The market's largest wholesaler, Kiamos & Tooker, moved to Zerega Avenue in the Bronx, but that company was the only defector from 28th Street.
Jim Lebberes, the president of Kiamos & Tooker, which now occupies 54,000 square feet of space and has three-quarters of an acre for parking, said that many of his Manhattan customers who used to go in person to 28th Street now buy from him by telephone or shop somewhere else. "I would prefer for my own purposes that more come here and buy," Mr. Lebberes said. "If they see the product, they would buy more."
While a few people in the industry are open to moving to another borough, most say that the high-end florists and the floral designers will not travel outside Manhattan.
"I know where my customer base is," said Mitchell Vlachos, an owner of Harry Vlachos Inc., a company started by his father in 1930, when 70 percent of the flowers sold at the market were grown within 100 miles of the city.
Michael George, a veteran floral designer, agreed that it would be a mistake for the market to move to another borough. "I'm not schlepping to Hunts Point," he said. "I'm not in the fruit business. If you're not in Manhattan, you might as well be in Hong Kong."
City Councilwoman Christine Quinn, whose district includes the flower market, said there are several sites that might be suitable, although she stressed that the discussions were only in the preliminary stages. Among the sites being mentioned are Pier 57 along the Hudson River, just south of Chelsea Piers; the wholesale meat market near Gansevoort Street; the Fulton Fish Market; La Marqueta, the marketplace in East Harlem; and the market on Essex Street on the Lower East Side.
"As much as everyone would like to keep the flower market where it is," Ms. Quinn said, "that isn't really viable anymore. At the end of the day, we need to find them a new space."
Ricardo Soto-Lopez, a former city planning official who recently became the director of planning and economic development for the Flower Market Association, said that the wholesale florists should be housed under one roof, with easy access to loading docks, and that they should have the capacity to pool services like maintenance, trucking, refrigeration and billing.
If the wholesalers were housed in one place, said Juliette Babincak, the flower buyer for Surroundings, an Upper West Side florist, they could ban customers without proper identification, as is done at the flower market in Boston. She said this would address a common complaint among retailers: that wholesalers undercut their business by selling to the public. Wholesale prices can be one-third of retail prices or less, depending on the variety of flower.
In its current location, said Lesly Zamor, the owner of Bloom, a florist in the Flatiron district, the market is too accessible to retail customers, including hotels and restaurants. "I'd say we lose $250,000 to $400,000 a year just in restaurant business," Mr. Zamor said.
People who shop for hotels and restaurants, however, can obtain resale licenses that entitle them to buy flowers wholesale, and most actually do function as floral designers, said Mr. Page, the association's president. Like other wholesalers, Mr. Page said he does very little retail business. But he said that if a new market is built, it should be closed to the public.
"It's ridiculous to have an open market in New York," he said. "People should be required to have badges to enter."
Mr. Page and the other wholesalers said they hoped to get help from the city. In their view, the city needs to recognize that even though the flower market is small, it plays an important role in the city's restaurant and tourism industries. Officials at the City Economic Development Corporation did not respond to a telephone request for comment.
But Mr. Lebberes, the wholesale florist who moved to the Bronx, said his former neighbors on 28th Street were deluding themselves if they thought that city officials would be eager to help an industry that employs so few people.
"I think the people that are left in the market have unrealistic expectations," he said. "They can sit there forever waiting for the city to give them something they won't ever get."
Others in the industry are more hopeful. "The flower market has been overlooked and taken for granted," said Mr. Sutton, the owner of Mutual Cut Flowers. "This is one of those little sectors that adds so much to the city. People walk into a lobby and see the flowers -- and it never occurs to them how the flowers got there."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
More Acquisitions Narrow the Field

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Several agencies and specialty companies are being acquired.
Roper Starch Worldwide in Harrison, N.Y., acquired Langer Associates in New York, a research company, for undisclosed terms. Langer, with clients like Pitney Bowes, Prudential and J. Walter Thompson, is being renamed the Roper/Langer Qualitative Research division of Roper Starch. Judith Langer, president at Langer, becomes a senior vice president at Roper Starch and director for the new division. 
 True North Communications in Chicago acquired Genus Media in London, the parent of MBS Media and Expert Media, which specialize in media planning and buying. Terms were not disclosed.
Genus will operate as an autonomous unit of TN Media, the True North media services agency; Glenn Burton, 50, continues as chairman at Genus. MBS has about 55 employees handling media duties for accounts with billings estimated at more than $225 million from clients like Deloitte & Touche and Michelin. Plans call for combining the media buying handled at MBS with the media buying handled at Banks Hoggins O'Shea/ FCB in London, part of the FCB Worldwide unit of True North.
Finally, Itemus Inc. in Toronto, a so-called incubator, agreed to acquire an 80 percent stake in the multimedia operations of Shooting Gallery Inc. in New York in a stock transaction valued at $56 million.
Shooting Gallery, which provides high-speed Internet access, Web site design and interactive multimedia production services as well as strategy and creative work, has more than 200 employees at offices in Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia. Revenue is estimated at $24 million from clients like DDB Worldwide and Saatchi & Saatchi. In addition, the film, television and music development and distribution businesses of Shooting Gallery will be spun off to current shareholders as a stand-alone company called Shooting Gallery Entertainment.
The top executives at Shooting Gallery -- Larry Meistrich, 34, chairman and chief executive, and Stephen Carlis, 34, president -- will continue in those posts at both Shooting Gallery and Shooting Gallery Entertainment.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Accuses Bush of Waging 'Class Warfare'

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., Oct. 31

 BODY:
Turning his opponent's language against him, Vice President Al Gore delivered a stinging rebuke of Gov. George W. Bush's tax-cut plan today, calling it a redistribution of wealth that amounted to "class warfare on behalf of billionaires."
Mr. Gore also continued a new line of attack on Mr. Bush, saying that his pledge to get along with people in Washington really meant that he would go along with the special interests. 
 In a speech to supporters in Portland, Ore., the vice president said Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut would be a disaster for the economy and "potentially devastating for America's families and American businesses."
Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush's proposed elimination of the estate tax would give $25 billion a year to the wealthiest 3,000 families in America, a plan that he branded "unbelievable."
"What he is actually proposing is a massive redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the wealthiest few," Mr. Gore said. "It is in fact a form of class warfare on behalf of billionaires."
Mr. Bush has accused Mr. Gore of conducting class warfare by appealing repeatedly to "working families." And indeed, the vice president has been sharply denouncing the "special interests" with a populist message that his campaign has long hoped would attract independent voters from all along the political spectrum, from supporters of Senator John McCain, a Republican, to those of former Senator Bill Bradley, a Democrat, and perhaps most critically, supporters of Ralph Nader, the Green Party's nominee.
In fact, Mr. Gore, speaking today to a couple of hundred people in the gymnasium of Portland Community College, summoned the name of Senator McCain -- who campaigned with Mr. Bush yesterday -- in heaping scorn on Mr. Bush's tax proposal. Mr. Gore said: "Senator McCain said it best when he raised concerns about the governor's plan during the primaries: 'I don't think Bill Gates needs a tax cut, but I think you and your parents do.' "
Mr. Gore continued: "Again, nothing against Bill Gates or the folks who are in that category. But if you focus almost half of all the benefits on folks in that category, the wealthiest 1 percent, who make on average $1 million a year, then there is not enough money left to give good middle-class tax cuts, balance the budget, pay down the debt and invest in our priorities, like schools and health care and the environment."
Mr. Gore also took Mr. Bush to task for saying he would "get along with people in Washington."
"The real question is, Who does he want to get along with?" Mr. Gore asked, before answering the question himself. "The special interests who want to pry open more loopholes in the tax code? The H.M.O.'s? The insurance industry?"
Mr. Gore said that he would not go along just to get along at any price and that he would stand up to the powerful interests.
Mr. Gore arrived on the West Coast this morning after an overnight flight from Milwaukee, where he had just finished a two-day bus tour in the Midwestern swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin.
"I love the West Coast," the vice president told reporters flying with him to Portland in the wee hours this morning. "I look for any opportunity to go there."
It is not as if opportunities abound in the final week before the election. But Mr. Gore has carved out time from his intense stumping across the industrial Midwest to tend to California and Oregon, two states that have been good to Democrats in recent years.
State polls show Mr. Gore's lead over Mr. Bush in California dwindling and put him neck and neck with Mr. Bush in Oregon. Mr. Bush, smelling blood -- or at least the chance for a theatrical head game on Democratic turf -- scoured those same states for votes today, flying from California to Portland and passing Mr. Gore somewhere midair on his way from Portland to Burbank.
Mr. Bush had been in Burbank to appear on "The Tonight Show." Mr. Gore taped a segment to appear tonight.
Mr. Gore was in a relatively buoyant mood, expressing confidence about his campaign and shrugging off the suggestion that, given the nation's economic prosperity, he should be coasting to victory in the election.
"I have made up a 15-to-20 point deficit," he said. "I think we clearly have the momentum. I feel good about the race. Until recently, the other side had a two-to-one advantage in finances and chose to use it in a way that focused on negative personal attacks."
He also said voters had yet to really focus on the race. "There are some signs that in statewide races, voters are waiting later and later to make up their minds," Mr. Gore said. "This may be happening on a national level." Voters, he said, are "working harder, longer hours, are stressed out, and I think they're waiting."
Asked on "Tonight" whether he would campaign with President Clinton, Mr. Gore said no, he had to win the election on his own. But he said he was happy to be campaigning later tonight in Los Angeles with the actor Martin Sheen, who plays the president on the television series "The West Wing."
As for the Nader voters, Mr. Gore has publicly tried to play down his pursuit of them, but reporters keep asking him how he is going to blunt Mr. Nader's appeal, and his campaign has put on a full-court press in Oregon and elsewhere to convert Nader votes into Gore votes.
And the fact that Mr. Gore was spending time in Oregon and California this late in the campaign was telling in itself.
Carter Eskew, a top Gore strategist, said today that the fact that Mr. Gore was in Oregon at this point was extraordinary, but added: "I would say it's also extraordinary that George Bush is only four points ahead in Nevada and only four points ahead in New Hampshire and is losing Florida."
Mr. Eskew said the topsy-turvy nature of the race reflected the fact that this year was "unlike any other," adding: "We're going to follow a strategy that gets us to an Electoral College victory, whether or not we have to go to places that people thought once should have been in the bag. Who cares? This is not about pride. This is about winning votes."

HEADLINE: Job Contracts With Noncompete Teeth

BYLINE: By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
A year ago, Dr. Pamela Mancini was pulling in six figures as a pediatrician at a Fredericksburg, Va., medical center.
Today, she's bankrupt, emotionally deflated and desperately searching for a job elsewhere in Virginia. "This has been a hell of a year," said Dr. Mancini, who has been a pediatrician for more than 18 years. 
 The cause of Dr. Mancini's misfortune was an agreement she signed at the request of her employer, Pratt Medical Center, when it was bought by another company in 1998 -- eight years after she had begun her employment there. The new contract stipulated that she would not be able to practice pediatrics within 25 miles of the center for one year if she left Pratt.
But last April, Dr. Mancini said, she had numerous conflicts with management, so she took a risk and left the company, opening her own practice in downtown Fredericksburg. In six months, working alongside her husband, David, the office's manager, she accumulated nearly 2,000 patients.
But all that changed in September. After a lawsuit by Pratt, which contended she was in violation of the noncompete agreement, Dr. Mancini was ordered by a Virginia court to close her practice pending the outcome of the case. Now, she can no longer afford legal counsel. "This whole thing has been a disaster," Dr. Mancini said.
Officials from Pratt Medical Center are unsympathetic. "She voluntarily signed this agreement and is therefore bound to its terms," said John R. Walk, Pratt's lawyer.
The career limbo that Dr. Mancini finds herself in is ensnaring an increasing number of professionals these days. In the current hot economy, companies are taking a harder line against former employees who signed noncompete agreements -- and not always to prevent them from stealing their business away. In many cases, employment specialists say, they want to send a warning to their current employees that the contracts they signed have teeth.
"Employees are companies' hottest commodities right now," said Michael B. Carlinsky, a lawyer with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in Manhattan. "More and more employers are using noncompetes, and similar tactics, to hold onto their workers."
Many noncompete agreements prohibit employees from working in a specific geographical area -- or for a specific competitor -- for a year or more after the end of their employment. Others restrict employees from taking clients with them when they resign or from revealing trade secrets.
Such pacts are thriving in all industries, Mr. Carlinsky said, but particularly in high technology, where an extremely mobile work force and the high value of intellectual property have some companies drafting and trying to enforce strict noncompete clauses for employees at all levels.
In certain cases, companies are suing to restrict employees from moving to competitors even when there is no noncompete agreement, citing the need to protect their trade secrets.
Lucent Technologies recently filed a suit against 10 former employees in its optical manufacturing site in North Andover, Mass. The employees resigned earlier this year to join Cisco Systems, which was opening a competing optical networking plant in Salem, Mass. They ranged in experience from one of the top-tier managers at the Lucent plant to a 23-year-old employee. The suit asserts that the former employees -- none of whom signed noncompete agreements -- were making off with proprietary information and should be prevented by court order from working at Cisco.
To the employees' relief, a federal district court in Massachusetts recently issued an order allowing them to continue working at Cisco pending the outcome of the suit. "This case has put a lot of stress on my family," said Daniel Tymann, a former manufacturing director at Lucent who is named in the suit. Before the August court ruling, Mr. Tymann said, he had to sit down with his wife and 14-year-old daughter "and discuss the possibility of us relocating; that was extremely upsetting."
Mr. Tymann said when he left Lucent, his superiors never said they might sue him. "I was certainly aware of my obligations to keep any proprietary information of Lucent's proprietary," he said. "I'm disappointed that they questioned my integrity."
The lawyer for the former Lucent employees, Gregory L. Lippetz, contends that Lucent filed the suit to send a message to other employees who might be thinking about jumping ship. "There are some companies who use noncompetes as a retention tool to hang over employees' heads," Mr. Lippetz said.
A Lucent spokeswoman, Mary Lou Ambrus, maintains that the 10 employees agreed to a noncompete clause that was included in a stock option grant. "We feel the company has a right and an obligation to protect confidential information," she said.
Although more companies are trying to enforce noncompete agreements, not all are victorious. In a recent lawsuit, Heartland Securities filed a claim against several employees for violating noncompete agreements. In one situation, an employee, Jared Gerstenblatt, signed an employment contract with Datek Online Brokerage Services (now owned by Heartland), promising to pay back up to $200,000 in "training costs" if he left the company before completing four years of employment. He left shortly before his four-year anniversary to become a day trader. A federal district court in New York ruled in March that the contract was overly restrictive. "It was a clever attempt to create a disincentive for people to leave," Mr. Carlinsky said.
Heartland's lawyer declined to comment.
Experts say that unpopular as noncompete contracts are with workers, when used properly, they are a legitimate way for employers to protect their interests.
"I encourage all my clients to have employees sign noncompetes, especially those who work in the tech arena," said Michael D. Golden, a partner at the Atlanta law firm, Arnall Goden & Gregory. "Why should you let somebody run off with your clients or your intellectual capital?"
Kathleen Gadd, one of Mr. Golden's clients, and senior managing director of Office Innovation, an office products company based in Lawrenceville, Ga., agrees. Her company makes sales representatives agree in writing not to take accounts with them when they leave. In addition, senior executives are asked to sign a pact promising not to reveal portions of the company's business plan. "I've spent the last four years building this business from scratch," Ms. Gadd said. "I have a right and a responsibility to protect it."

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Workplace page on Wednesday about "noncompete" agreements, in which workers accept restrictions on future employment after leaving a company, misspelled the name of a law firm in Atlanta at which one partner, Michael D. Golden, encourages employers to use the device. It is Arnall Golden & Gregory, not Goden.

HEADLINE: Working at Home Today?

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
TWO days a week, Christine Parupia, an executive at Charles Schwab & Company, drives for five minutes from her house in Walnut Creek, Calif., to a towering office building and starts her workday. Her spacious corner office overlooks one of the San Francisco Bay area's most congested freeways, which Ms. Parupia can gaze out on with all the smugness of someone beating the system.
Each Wednesday and Friday, instead of making the hourlong commute to Schwab's headquarters in downtown San Francisco, Ms. Parupia works from what Schwab calls a "hoteling" center, also known as a telework or drop-in center. The suite of 42 offices is available to Schwab employees trying to reduce the strain of a long commute. 
 For years, telecommuting has been a topic surrounded by hope, hype and disappointment. The word itself has grown musty, smacking of yesterday's trend. The work-at-home utopia for all has not materialized, but the nightmare of two-hour commutes has led to the necessity of people working away from the office, either at home, at satellite offices like the Schwab center or at an ever-changing series of shared desks.
More than 16.5 million people in the United States, or about 12 percent of the work force, now work at home one or more days a month, according to the International Telework Association and Council, an industry group in Washington.
A few large companies in San Francisco and around the country are now pushing the concept of drop-in centers, which provide employees with a desk, a computer workstation, a telephone, administrative support and plenty of parking. Employees make reservations, check in and check out. Regulars like Ms. Parupia try to reserve the same office each time.
The push is being felt hardest in California, but remote work is growing more popular around the rest of the country. For several years, 17 telework centers in the Washington, D.C., area have been used primarily by federal employees but are gradually attracting interest from the private sector. The centers are run by a variety of organizations, including community colleges, economic development commissions and two private companies, Lockheed Martin and IBA, a technical consulting company in Falls Church, Va.
For the first several years, said Darryl Dobberfuhl, the executive director of the Washington telework sites, the centers were not filling up, but that is changing. "We have some people who spend one and a half or two hours commuting one way," he said. "By the time they get to work they're pretty high strung. People really look forward to the days they can work from the center."
Mr. Dobberfuhl also pointed to federal legislation that was signed last month offering the telecommuting option to all eligible federal employees. "The timing is better now," Mr. Dobberfuhl said. "More managers are understanding the concept."
The Schwab drop-in center in Walnut Creek, which the company calls Hotel Schwab, has many of the same amenities as a hotel, including a fitness center and a "concierge," who carries out basic administrative tasks and makes the occasional deli run. It is also every bit as sterile, with few personal touches. If people want to store files, they use hallway lockers. Ms. Parupia said she usually brought in a framed photograph of her 13-year-old son to put on the desk.
Two years ago, Sun Microsystems opened three drop-in centers scattered around the Bay Area as an experiment. The decision as to where to put them was based purely on demographics.
"Instead of chasing space, we're chasing people," said Ann Bamesberger, Sun's director of workplace effectiveness. "Instead of thinking, 'Where can we get a big chunk of land?' we're thinking, 'Where do people want to work?' "
Sun's drop-in centers have grown so popular that the company is planning to open others around the region. Some employees stay at the centers all day, while others go early in the morning and wait for the traffic to thin out before continuing on to the office. Schwab is opening two additional centers to the north and south of San Francisco.
Traffic is not the only reason companies are looking for alternatives. The paucity and expense of office space have forced some companies to require that employees share a work space. Sun now has some 10 percent of its 40,000 employees, including Ms. Bamesberger, permanently "unassigned."
"It means you're virtual everywhere," said Ms. Bamesberger, who works in a group of 30 people who share 15 seats at Sun's offices in Mountain View, Calif. She can also travel from Sun office to Sun office and use any of a number of drop-in "stations."
Brent Daniel, who works for Ms. Bamesberger, said that once a week, instead of making the 1 1/4-hour drive to Mountain View, he worked from Sun's drop-in center in San Francisco, a 15-minute ride on public transportation from his house.
"Whatever seat I would have used in Mountain View can be used by someone else," Mr. Daniel said. "Compare that to the scenario where I have an assigned seat in Mountain View. If I'm in San Francisco that day, that seat would be empty." Mr. Daniel welcomes not only a day without driving but also the change of pace and the chance to spend a day in the city.
The concept of a telework center isn't new. Between 1991 and 1997, in various experiments to gauge the change in air quality if commuting time was reduced, 40 or so publicly subsidized telework centers opened throughout California. When the subsidies expired, however, nearly all the centers closed because they were not being used very much.
But five years later, with traffic congestion worse than ever and real estate prices soaring, employers are increasingly open to exploring alternatives to the workplace norm.
Of 2,700 Sun employees who responded to a recent survey, nearly 80 percent said they worked from home at least part of the time. Telecommuting is popular at Cisco Systems, too. Half the company's 35,000 employees work from home at least one day a week. The company will provide a high-speed line to the Internet in employees' homes if requested.
Bill Finkelstein, a senior partner at Cisco, often spends Fridays working from his home in Santa Rosa, Calif., 100 miles north of Cisco's San Jose headquarters.
"It increases productivity enormously," Mr. Finkelstein said. By eliminating time in the car, he can start his workday at 6 a.m. with a conference call with the East Coast or Europe. During the calls, he can put on his headset and wander over to his large picture window to watch a covey of quail that lives in his yard.
Mr. Finkelstein's high-speed data line, supplied by Cisco, makes computer work as fast as it would be if he were in San Jose. "The problem I have is disciplining myself to get out of the office," he said. "I'm in there for 10 hours plus." When he does take breaks, he goes into his kitchen to make a cup of tea or he walks out to the mailbox.
One alternative to expensive corporate real estate is none at all. Alan Gunshor, chief executive of Passpoints.com, a company that runs an online loyalty program, works from his apartment in San Francisco. He stays in touch with his 13 employees, who are scattered from Lake Tahoe to Los Angeles, via instant messaging, e-mail and frequent conference calls. "We decided very early on that we wanted to spend our money on people rather than office space," Mr. Gunshor said.
Harriet Donnelly, president of Technovative Marketing, a public relations firm, directs 23 employees, all of whom, like Ms. Donnelly, work from home Ms. Donnelly said her employees all preferred the flexibility of working from home. One employee, she said, had set up her schedule so that she could ride her horse in the morning before starting work. "If someone wants to stop at 2 p.m. to take their child to a soccer game, as long as they take a cell phone or call in every hour and a half for their messages, that's fine," she said.
In her own home office in Berkeley Heights, N.J., Ms. Donnelly said, she had created just the right atmosphere for herself. She keeps the television on behind her, with the volume turned very low, not so that she can watch "Oprah" but so that "it feels like people are in the room with me." She keeps her office door closed so that telephone conversations aren't disrupted when her three dogs start up a chorus of barking.
Corporate clients, Ms. Donnelly said, are more accepting of her creative workplace arrangement than they were four years ago, when she began it. "People used to ask about it, but now they don't really care," she said.
Trust is a topic that frequently arises around the topic of remote work. Employers lose a sense of control over employees who work remotely. But telecommuting proponents discount the concern.
"Employers are very hung up on the fact that if they see people at their desks, they can assume they're working and not doing their personal Internet browsing, which is a false assumption," said Joanne Pratt, a consultant in Dallas who does research on telework.
"One of the basic tenets of the Cisco culture is trust," Mr. Finkelstein said. "If you can't tell what an employee is doing without seeing them physically planted in a chair, how are you running your business?"
Ms. Donnelly said she did a minimum of employee monitoring, and she agreed with Mr. Finkelstein's assessment. "If companies have to police their employees, then they've hired the wrong people," she said.
Still, working from home is not for everybody. Ms. Parupia said she had a home office, but she preferred to use the Schwab drop-in center, partly because she was less easily distracted and partly because the telework center provided her with a fax machine, a photocopier, a high-speed computer line and other office requirements.
At lunchtime, Ms. Parupia usually goes home, where she does some gardening, then returns to Hotel Schwab, rejuvenated and happy to resume her spot overlooking the freeway she doesn't have to be on.

At the Top, Prices Have Flattened Out

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

 BODY:
PRICES of upper-end properties, the creme de Manhattan's creme, have eased in recent weeks, according to a report to be released next week. The report, by Brown Harris Stevens, known for its white-glove listings, examines a series of sales on the Upper East Side, from Third Avenue to Fifth Avenue, along with Central Park West, Sutton Place, Beekman Place and assorted doorman buildings on East 86th and East 57th Streets, as well as the sales in some of the newest condominium loft buildings in TriBeCa.
The report on Manhattan's high-end segment found that this year's 35 percent jump in the average price of a co-op apartment was the highest in the last 11 years. 
 "But most of it happened this winter and spring," said Lawrence Sicular, the Brown Harris Stevens statistician, who emphasized that the real estate market -- especially for these top-end properties -- is still steaming along, although not skyrocketing the way it was earlier in the year.
"For months, we have seen stability across the board, except for the very highest end, and now we are seeing it there, too," said Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which is in the process of compiling its own statistics. Traditionally, she said, the biggest spenders -- those buying Park Avenue triplexes or Duane Street luxury lofts -- "were more insensitive" to the fluctuations of the economy as a whole. "Now, at least, they have one eye open and they are not going to overbid," she added.
Ms. Beck, Mr. Sicular and brokers interviewed were quick to emphasize that Manhattan's real estate market remained strong.
"There are buyers out there with tremendous money, buying at tremendous prices," said Susan Renfrew, director of East Side sales for Douglas Elliman, the city's largest residential real estate brokerage firm. While the market as a whole may be flattening, Ms. Renfrew says she believes that prices for specific sectors of the luxury market are still rising sharply, especially for the newest condominiums, like Donald J. Trump's new tower across from the United Nations.
Mr. Sicular said he was surprised when he compared a series of individual apartments -- not the brand-new condominiums now being introduced, but the buildings with established resale records -- sold between the hot spring market and now. His conclusion: There was little change in price. Because his report examines apartments just put under contract -- as opposed to closed sales in which prices were set several months earlier, when the contract was signed -- his information is the most current look at today's market.
One TriBeCa condominium loft, at a location he described as good but not great, sold in June for $1.4 million. On Oct. 5, a loft two floors higher (and therefore more valuable) sold for $1.5 million. If prices were still going up, the loft sold most recently would have gone for a higher price, Mr. Sicular said.
At 103 East 84th Street, the statistician said he found that several six-room apartments, all in the same line in the rear of the building, sold between spring and fall. Their prices were all around $800,000.
On Park Avenue in Carnegie Hill, the price of a nine-room co-op was just negotiated for $4.8 million. A nearly identical apartment sold in August for $4.75 million.
In all three buildings, prices had soared for the two years prior to this spring.
In TriBeCa, in buildings comparable to the one Brown Harris examined, similar-size lofts were selling for less than $1 million a few years ago.
For the East 84th Street building, two comparable six-room apartments had sold in the last two years: one for $587,000, another for $500,000.
In the same Park Avenue building, one similar apartment sold for $3 million and another for $3.5 million, both in August 1998.
About his analysis, Mr. Sicular concluded: "For this end of the market, prices are at least stable, maybe a bit higher. But to say prices are stable is totally supportable."
Reports released by other brokerage firms have painted a similar picture for the real estate market as a whole. They also used closed sales, not signed contracts, as their yardstick.
All the reports, however, have noted an increase in the number of apartments that have been on the market. Brown Harris Stevens reported that on average, there are 20 percent more apartments for sale on the Upper East Side than there were in the winter and spring. (There were, for example, 16 prewar six-room co-ops on the Upper East Side for sale in March; 34 were listed in October.)

HEADLINE: Jordanian Struggles to Keep Ties to Israel

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan

 BODY:
Omar Salah, the 33-year-old chairman of the Century Investment Group, a diversified Jordanian holding company, was sitting in his office surveying the wreckage of the new Middle East.
Suddenly there were no regional investment conferences on the horizon; no more Arab trade offices quietly setting up shop in Tel Aviv; no Jewish-American delegations touring Jordan in search of bridge-building business opportunities. 
 After a month of violence across the Jordan River claimed more than a hundred lives, almost all of them Palestinians, nearly every Arab nation except Jordan had announced a freeze in their already minimal trade relations with Israel. Scores of fledgling Israeli business partnerships from North Africa to the Persian Gulf were instantly and angrily severed.
And in Jordan, where most people are Palestinian refugees or their children, there is intensifying pressure to roll back plans for border industrial parks, a new shared Red Sea airport and other collaborative projects with Israel.
"It took so long for Israel to build up these relationships, and they are so fragile," Mr. Salah said. "This is not in Israel's own interest."
One of the few relationships that has survived, he said, is his own.
Mr. Salah's business has been built on cooperation with Israel. Half of his company's 5,000 employees work in joint ventures with Israeli partners or in factories that depend on Israeli suppliers. Under continual public attack by Jordanians who oppose any normalization of ties with Israel, he takes great pride in his friendships with Israeli business and political leaders.
He began visiting Israel after the 1993 Oslo peace accords, and now travels there so often that he has rented an apartment in Tel Aviv. Israeli business leaders sit on the boards of his companies, while he has become a ubiquitous figure at regional seminars sponsored by Israeli universities and dovish research institutes.
"I am the poster child for normalization," he says with a wan smile.
But for the first time, he is angry, he said -- angry at the violence across the border, and angry at the toll it has taken on friendships and business partnerships alike.
"This is the worst tension and racial animosity I have seen in seven years of doing business," Mr. Salah said. "The damage is not irreversible, but it may take years."
The conflict has also made Mr. Salah feel more Palestinian. Like many Jordanians, his family came originally from the West Bank and what is now Israel, and he has driven along the coast north of Tel Aviv looking wistfully at high-priced seaside property that once belonged to his grandparents.
"I was raised, like all of us, to be anti-Israeli," he said. "But I have tried very hard in business to see how the world looks through their eyes, how they feel that they are this small society under seige, surrounded by enemies. But this, all these deaths . . ."
The phone rang, interrupting him. An Israeli business associate was calling from Jerusalem to cancel a long-planned meeting in Amman. He no longer felt safe there, he said. Mr. Salah was politely incredulous.
Battles between Israeli tanks and Palestinian sharpshooters were raging around Jerusalem, yet his friend was afraid to visit sleepy Amman?
But uncharacteristically violent demonstrations outside the Israeli Embassy here the week before prompted Israel to warn its nationals against visits to Jordan. A few days earlier, Mr. Salah had received another call from a Jewish-American business partner who was so concerned about the demonstrations that he canceled a $100 million manufacturing venture he and Mr. Salah had agreed to start over the summer.
The company, Vishay Intertechnology Inc. of Malvern, Pa., an electronics manufacturer, had conceived of the plant as a complement to its fast-growing Israeli subsidiary, which is managed by the company president's son.
"We would no longer feel exactly safe there," Felix Zandman, Vishay's president, said in a telephone interview.
Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Salah felt that he was in the vanguard of a movement that would ultimately transform the tense relationship between Israel and its Arab neighbors -- and create thousands of jobs and millions in profits in the process. The leaders of Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories were all working toward a negotiated regional peace. All three economies were enjoying strong, sustained growth in per capita income for the first time in years, and Jordan's exports to Israel had jumped by 50 percent.
This summer, in his most audacious Israeli business move yet, Mr. Salah purchased a bankrupt sweater company in Ofakim, an Israeli town that had become a national symbol of the disappearance of blue-collar factory jobs. "It's the Allentown of Israel," said Mr. Salah, who said his familiarity with middle American industrial geography owed more to Billy Joel than to his five years studying at Purdue University in Indiana.
The $1.8 million he paid to the Israeli bank receivers was one of his best investments ever, Mr. Salah said. The reopened factory secured new contracts to supply the Gap, J. C. Penney and other American retail chains, and its unlikely new Jordanian owner become a hero to the 70 newly re-employed workers there.
In Jordan, conditions seemed favorable for a further expansion of the American-endorsed "qualifying industrial zones" that allow Jordanian manufacturers to piggyback on Israel's duty-free access to the United States market.
To qualify for zero-customs status, the Jordanian export must be at least 7 percent Israeli -- a condition resented by many Jordanian entrepreneurs. But Mr. Salah, who helped negotiate the agreement with the American and Israeli governments, enticed Motorola, Sara Lee, Jordache and other brand-name American manufacturers into lucrative joint ventures in the new industrial zones, and made Century Investment one of Jordan's biggest employers.
But now, he said, it may be time for Jordan to look beyond its next-door neighbor and concentrate instead on selling to the American market without Israeli partners or intermediaries. The free trade agreement Jordan signed with the United States this month, though it is still subject to Congressional approval, will make it possible for Jordanian businesses to avoid further dependence on Israel, he said.
"It was like a marriage between the Montagues and the Capulets," Mr. Salah mused. "Now that the marriage is suddenly off, yes, you can still be friends, but you also realize that the friendship was predicated on an event that is no longer going to take place."

Web Sites With Civil War Lore Are as Popular as the Battlefields

THE CIVIL WAR ON THE WEB: A GUIDE TO THE VERY BEST SITES

(Scholarly Resources, $18.95 paperback.)
 
VALLEY OF THE SHADOW: TWO COMMUNITIES IN THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR
By Edward L. Ayers and Anne S. Rubin
(CD-ROM for Windows and Mactinosh; W. W. Norton & Company; $49.95.)
NO event in the history of the United States attracts more public interest than the Civil War. Visitors flock to its battlefields, where re-enactments are the rage. Truckers and accountants boldly storm Gettysburg's Little Round Top or Chickamauga's Horseshoe Ridge in the tailored uniforms of "Billy Yank" and "Johnny Reb." The Civil War shelves in bookstores are crammed with best-selling novels and histories like Michael Shaara's "Killer Angels" and James McPherson's "Battle Cry of Freedom." More than 40 million people watched some or all of Ken Burns's 1990 documentary, "The Civil War." 
 The interest is understandable. The Civil War pitted brother against brother in the bloodiest conflict in American history. The North put 2.2 million men in uniform, half of its entire draft age population; the South mustered 800,000 men, an astounding 75 percent of its white draft-age population. More soldiers died -- about 625,000 -- than in all of America's 20th-century wars.
Some states took decades to recover. A third of Mississippi's 78,000 soldiers were killed in battle or died from disease. And more than half of the survivors brought home a lasting disability of war. Mississippi resembled a giant hospital ward, a land of missing arms and legs. In 1866, one-fifth of the state budget went for the purchase of artificial limbs.
The sheer carnage led each side to stress the virtues of the cause. The winner thanked Providence for a victory that had preserved the union and cleansed it of slavery. The loser viewed its ghastly sacrifice as proof of the gallantry of the "Southern way of life." In myth and in history, the Civil War became synonymous with freedom, courage, regional pride and national reconciliation.
No outlet better reflects the war's enduring popularity than the World Wide Web. The reach of the Internet has opened a vast archive of Civil War material to the public. Anyone bold enough to check a search engine for, say, Robert E. Lee will find several hundred thousand matches. There are sites for every political and military figure of the era, every battle and skirmish, every regiment and artillery piece.
How does one maneuver through this information logjam? A new book, "The Civil War on the Web," offers much needed help. After exhaustive investigation, the authors -- Dr. William G. Thomas, director of the Virginia Center for Digital History at the University of Virginia, and Alice E. Carter, project manager for education at New York Times Digital -- recommend 95 sites based on the richness of sources, ease of navigation and visual appeal. These criteria are flexible, they say, because most sites were not made by professional Web designers but by "librarians and archivists, re-enactors and preservationists, students and educators -- people more interested in the Civil War than in slick appearances or sophisticated menus." Put simply, most sites are stronger on content than on aesthetics.
Dr. Thomas and Ms. Carter take a broad approach to their subject. Their survey gives equal time to both the battlefield and the home front, where important social, cultural and racial changes occurred. One chapter reviews the best Web sites on women in the Civil War, and another examines sites on slavery and emancipation.
But even the chapters on Web sites concerned with military matters go beyond battles and armaments to the experiences of common soldiers. Want to learn about the treatment of wounded troops? The University of Toledo has a good Web site (www.cl .utoledo.edu/canaday/quackery/quack8 .html). Need some material about Jews in the Civil War? Click on www.jewish-history.com/civilwar.htm. Curious about the layout of the Civil War prison at Andersonville, Ga.? A National Park Service Web site, www.nps.gov/ande, has details.
Among the most prominent Civil War Web sites is the Valley of the Shadow, (valley.vcdh.virginia.edu) a remarkably ambitious project that began at the University of Virginia in 1992. (Both Dr. Thomas and Ms. Carter have also worked on this project.) The Web site examines two Shenandoah Valley counties -- Franklin in Pennsylvania and Augusta in Virginia -- in the late 1850's and 1860's.
Created by Dr. Edward L. Ayers, a history professor at the University of Virginia, the Valley Web site contains primary information, including maps, photographs, letters, diaries, newspapers, census data, church documents and military records. The objective is to make the raw materials of history available to the widest audience, allowing users to ask their own questions and draw their own conclusions about the Civil War by studying one Northern county and one Southern county in detail.
The Web site averages about 7,000 page-views per day. Although the site attracts scholars and history buffs, it also appeals to students. A survey published in 1999 showed that a typical week included requests from Harvard and Stanford, a community college in New Mexico and high schools in California, Wyoming and Indiana. An eager fourth grader recently asked the project: "Fax me everything you have on the Civil War."
That would take awhile. The sheer size of the Valley Web site archive can be daunting. A well-directed student should have no problem navigating through the mammoth collections, but others may be confused.
That is not the case with the Valley of the Shadow's new CD-ROM, a user-friendly guide that spotlights Augusta and Franklin Counties in the critical years between 1858 and the spring of 1861. Titled The Eve of War: Valley of the Shadow, it comes with an excellent book by Dr. Ayers and Dr. Anne S. Rubin describing both the history of the region and the roots of the conflict. Even better, the CD contains reference tools that allow a novice to find material.
Navigating the CD is a snap. Each collection is carefully introduced and indexed by name, subject and date. On one level, the user can search the census data to find an individual's occupation, race, religious affiliation and level of wealth, then follow that person through letters, newspaper accounts and enlistment reports. On another level, the user can peruse larger subjects, under headings like Race Relations and Arts/Entertainment/Leisure, to get a feeling for the pulse of daily life in the Shenandoah Valley.
The CD contains wonderful photographs, a foot-tapping music score and a time line linking Augusta and Franklin Counties to national events, like the Dred Scott decision and John Brown's raid on the federal arsenal in nearby Harper's Ferry, W. Va.
What comes through clearly in The Valley of the Shadow are the similarities of these two counties, only 200 miles apart, and the reluctance of their residents to go to war. Both were prosperous farming communities, known for their grain and livestock; both were settled by people from Germany and the British Isles; both were deeply racist places, with whites viewing blacks as inferior. The defining difference, quite simply, was that Augusta County had slavery, and Franklin County did not.
One can sift through the documents to see how slaves lived and worked in Augusta County, and how valuable they were to the local economy. Or the searcher can explore the mixed emotions of Franklin County's whites concerning the evils of slavery and its further expansion. Some viewed slavery as the proper station for those with dark skin, while others accepted its presence in the South but opposed its spread into new territory. A few demanded its abolition on moral grounds.
It is painful to read the diaries and newspapers from the Shenandoah Valley as the events of this era, like Lincoln's election and South Carolina's secession, tear the nation apart. In once-cautious Augusta County, a newspaper headline calls: "Men of Virginia, to the Rescue!" In once optimistic Franklin County, a newspaper headline retorts: "Ready, Aim, Fire." Few could imagine the horrors that lay ahead.
Although this saga ends with the coming of the Civil War, Dr. Ayers and Dr. Rubin intend to carry it forward in two future CD-ROM's. The death of Stonewall Jackson, the thunder at Gettysburg, the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, the abolition of slavery, the promise of Reconstruction -- all are part of the the Great Valley's amazing next chapter, and the young nation's as well.

Give No Awards On Broadway
This is how it used to work: The Grammy Awards would simply alternate between Manhattan and Los Angeles. Since the late 80's the prestigious music awards show had spent two years in one city, then two years in the other.
But in a news conference on Tuesday at the Staples Center here, the Los Angeles mayor, Richard J. Riordan, and Michael Greene, the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (which presents the Grammys), said that the awards would stay in Los Angeles for a third consecutive year. 
 The 43rd annual Grammy Awards, Mr. Greene said, have been scheduled for Feb. 21 at the Staples Center. They are to be broadcast at 8 p.m. on CBS. The nominees are to be announced in early January.
But what about Manhattan? Will the Grammys ever return? It seems that "forgive and forget" is not in the vocabulary of Mr. Greene or Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. In the news conference in January 1998 to announce that year's Grammy nominees, Mr. Greene and Mayor Giuliani butted heads after the mayor's role in the conference was cut and City Hall said that Mr. Greene treated a mayoral aide uncivilly. Afterward Mayor Giuliani wished the Grammys back to Los Angeles, never to return during his administration, and vowed to "replace the prestige of the Grammys."
Mr. Greene said there were several reasons why the Grammys remained in Los Angeles. "There are probably three things I would say to keep me out of trouble," he began. "Because we were involved in the design of the Staples Center, we created an easy and economical place to do the show. And because we did the Latin Grammys there just a few months ago, the crew and the unions there are getting very good at setting up."
"Also," he said, "it's important to us that people at all levels of government are very supportive of the educational and cultural programs leading up to the Grammys, and that nothing distracts from the artists. If you look at which city has the greater likelihood for there not to be any political intrigue to get in the way, it is L.A. at this moment."
As for whether the Grammys will return to Manhattan in 2002 when a new mayor is in office, Mr. Greene said, "We will be back in New York very soon."
 
Icelandic Picks
Responding to Tuesday's article in The New York Times on the thriving and eclectic rock scene in Reykjavik, the teeny capital of Iceland, several readers wanted to know what Icelandic albums to buy beyond Bjork.
Despite its small population, Reykjavik's musical output is prodigious. Each of the four record stores on the pedestrian street Austurstraeti has a section for local music that dwarfs the equivalent in cities 10 times its size. "Two or three years ago, there wasn't anything like this," said Karl Henry Hakonarson, the singer in the slow-rock band Utopia. "But now the music is changing so quickly, and there is so much new stuff going on."
Here, then, are five albums to serve as a map for a journey through two decades of innovative Icelandic rock, from its late-blooming punk movement to its early-rising post-rock scene. Some of these are available at Other Music in Manhattan, at Amazon.com and directly from the source: Smekkleysa Records (the name means Bad Taste), P.O. Box 1263, 121 Reykjavik, Iceland; e-mail: badtase@saga.is.
*Various Artists, "Rokk i Reykjavik" (Smekkleysa): Documenting the punk explosion of the early 80's, this two-CD companion to the movie of the same name features live three-chord stompers from Tappi Tikarrass (Bjork's early band); Theyr and Purkur Pillnikk (both featuring future Sugarcubes members); and Q4U, Ego and more than a dozen other lost legends. Picture the Sex Pistols, the Clash, Killing Joke, and X-Ray Spex singing in Icelandic.
*Sugarcubes, "Illur Arfur" (One Little Indian): In the late 80's, seemingly out of nowhere, the Sugarcubes (Sykurmolarnir in Icelandic) burst out of Reykjavik and helped alternative rock reach its creative crest with the woman-child vocals of Bjork and a careening mix of drums, guitar, trumpet, and electronic effects. This album is the Icelandic-language version of the band's second album, "Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week," though the band's first album, "Life's Too Good" (Elektra), is the superior English-language album.
*Various Artists, "Popp i Reykjavik" (Elf/Dennis): A soundtrack to a 1998 documentary of "the world's most desperate night life" (to quote from the film), this CD features 17 of Iceland's best new artists, including popular exports like Gus Gus, experimental electronic groove riders like Surefni and Aria; and high-quality original rock bands like Maus, Slow blow and Ensimi, whose Steve Albini-produced "BMX" is one of Iceland's best collisions of modern rock guitars and techno keyboards.
*Sigur Ros, "Agaetis Byrjun" (Smekkleysa): A masterpiece not just of contemporary Icelandic rock but of the entire international genre of post-rock, this entrancing CD-length journey is Radiohead's "Kid A" pushed one step further into beautiful abstraction.
*Mum, "Yesterday Was Today -- Today Is Okay" (TMT): The compilation "Tilraunaeldhusith 1999" (Kitchen Motors) may provide a more complete glimpse into the Reykjavik equivalent of the Knitting Factory scene, featuring live experiments from the guitarist Hilmar Jensson; a collaboration between Mum and the electronic-instrument collector Musikvatur; and a 13-guitar orchestra featuring members of Sigur Ros. But this innovative electro-acoustic album by Mum is infinitely more listenable, standing out as an Icelandic equivalent of the Aphex Twin's ambient works.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton in the Eye of History

BYLINE: By David M. Kennedy; David M. Kennedy, professor of history at Stanford University, won a Pulitzer Prize this year for "Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945."

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
It's a time of transition, a time to look to the judgment of history. The case before us is the first Democratic president in six decades to be elected to two terms. Voters understood at the outset that he came before them trailing conspicuous liabilities: His party had been deeply discredited by its questionable role in a divisive war just a generation earlier. He himself had avoided military service in that war. His presidential campaign was marred by salacious rumors of sexual misconduct, to which, in effect, he publicly confessed -- a confession that the public, somewhat surprisingly, appeared to understand and accept. And thanks to a splinter populist movement that siphoned off some of the strength of the incumbent Republican president, he was elected.
In office, he favored more restrictive spending policies but more expansive trade policies. He fancied himself a reformer, a legatee of a liberalizing tradition handed down from his party's glory days a generation or two earlier, but a reformer chastened by past policy and political failures. He called himself a new Democrat. But neither the country nor the Congress was in a mood for much reform. He announced grand schemes but accomplished little. His situation was made especially difficult by the inability of his party to pull together sufficiently to control the Congress. Democrats were the majority party in both chambers for just two of his eight years in office. No wonder he was frustrated. 
 The president in question, of course, was Grover Cleveland. It was the Civil War that had discredited the Democrats of his day, because they were thought to be the party of disunion. As the draft law of the era allowed him to, Cleveland had hired a substitute to serve for him in the Civil War. His sexual scandal was an accusation of having fathered an illegitimate child. The third-party candidate who helped him win was James B. Weaver of the Populists. And his big reform issue was lower tariffs, an important step in the direction of what our era has come to call globalization.
I've taken this exercise of assimilating Bill Clinton to Grover Cleveland about as far as it will go: not only were Cleveland's two terms not sequential, but, more fundamentally, his second term was swamped by an economic crisis the likes of which the country had never seen. The notorious Depression of the 1890's shut down the Democrats' bid in those years to become a long-term majority party. As historians never tire of saying, each historical moment is unique and must be understood on its own terms. And yet it is worth lingering in these apparently remote historical precincts just a bit longer.
When Cleveland left office for good in 1897, he ended the presidency of the only Democrat elected to the office since James Buchanan 36 years earlier. When William McKinley followed Cleveland in 1897, he ushered in a period of precisely 36 years when Republicans dominated the national political scene. They held the White House consecutively until 1933, except for the brief interlude of Woodrow Wilson's presidency, itself made possible only by the major split in Republican ranks in 1912, when Theodore Roosevelt bolted to form the most successful third party in American history. That pair of 36-year intervals is intriguing. They form part of a pattern that has by now become something of a chestnut among students of American political history.
The pattern is the remarkable periodicity of something called American party systems: sequential historical eras characterized by distinctive relationships between the contending political parties and constellations of electoral majorities. In this accounting, there have been five clearly defined party systems since the nation's founding: the first from 1789 to 1828, the second stretching from Andrew Jackson's election to Abraham Lincoln's, the third spanning the era from Lincoln's presidency to McKinley's, the fourth running from 1897 to 1933, and the fifth dominated by the Democrats and Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition.
The idea that some deep, mysterious mechanism has shaped those three-and-a-half-decade cycles of political realignment raised the possibility that in about 1968 we would see the wheel of history turn again with the emergence of a sixth political system. Precisely that prediction formed the premise of Kevin Phillips's provocative political tract of 1969, "The Emerging Republican Majority."
Yet if there has been a sixth system, it has been a much messier proposition than the earlier ones. So messy, in fact, that the theory of a built-in periodicity in American political history has been rather discredited in recent years. But it may be that in time we will come to see the years from 1968 to 2000, or perhaps 2004, as constituting a coherent unit of analysis. Our own era bears some arresting resemblances to Grover Cleveland's late 19th century. As then, we live in a time of precarious political balance between the two parties (divided government, it's sometimes called), of checkmate and stasis in the political system, swelling energy in the private economic sphere, and an inchoate but building sense that the capacity of our formal political institutions is growing dangerously incommensurate with the scale and power of the forces at work in the economy at large.
A similar sense a hundred years ago gave birth to the progressive movement, a broad-based effort at reform whose principal historical project was to devise the theory and the institutions of activist government -- to substitute drift for mastery, as Walter Lippmann once described it. That reform ferment yielded meaningful results at last in the New Deal, which defined both the political universe in which we have lived ever since and the terms in which the very legitimacy of our government is still argued.
The challenge of the future is to devise -- and to legitimate -- a set of new institutions that will allow for a measure of politically accountable control over our own economic and social environment. Those institutions are not likely to look like the ones the New Dealers created. They will not be national institutions, but international ones. They will be scaled to deal with the array of issues generated by globalization: the vast increases in the flow of capital, technology, information, goods, culture and even peoples that have been the signature creation of the post-World War II era.
Bill Clinton has, in fact, taken the measure of globalization and has foreseen the necessity of reforms both domestic and international to navigate into that future, indeed to survive in it. Yet he has been unable to do much about that vision, and for reasons that have little to do with Monica Lewinsky or the threat of impeachment. That scandal and its political fallout were but the last and redundant nails in the coffin of the Clinton presidency. He has been effectively a crippled duck almost from the outset, and for reasons that Grover Cleveland would have understood: political paralysis and the inability of either party to build a stable electoral majority.
Yet the party and the political leaders who can take on the question of the commensurability of political institutions with the economic and social realities of our time, and who can make a plausible case both to the American people and to peoples elsewhere about the necessity of political change that will match the phenomenally rapid changes that the new millennium is bringing in the circumstances of our lives, will be in power for a long time to come. They will preside over their own durable party system, whatever ordinal number history will assign it.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Pull Back as Investors Cash In and Volatility Ebbs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Blue chip stocks and technology issues closed lower yesterday as investors cashed in some of their winnings from the big rally earlier this week.
A last-minute round of buying late in the day offset some of the damage. Analysts attributed the sell-off to profit taking rather than a return of investor anxiety about stocks. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 71.67 points, or 0.7 percent, at 10,899.47. Broader stock indicators also fell. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index slipped 36.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to 3,333.39 after rising 178 points on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 8.18 points, at 1,421.22.
"Bargain hunting does come to mind here," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "We've been selling off stocks for about eight weeks now, and the indices are starting to look pretty good."
Early in the day, investors seemed to take a step back after Tuesday's frenzied session, when the Dow and the Nasdaq rallied well over 100 points each. Telecommunications and financial issues, which had shot up on Tuesday, were among the biggest decliners.
But about 45 minutes before the market closed, investors appeared to have a change of heart. Money poured into stocks that had spent much of the day lower, limiting losses in many cases.
In the Dow, J. P. Morgan fell 38 cents, to $165.13, after dropping about $2 earlier in the day. Johnson & Johnson closed down $1, at $91, recovering from an earlier loss of $2.88.
JDS Uniphase lost $2.88, to $78.56, after rising more than 14 percent on Tuesday. Nortel Networks slipped $1.56, to $43.94.
Future earnings also remained a focus. WorldCom plummeted $4.81, to $18.94, a 20 percent drop, after the telecommunications company warned of disappointing revenues next year and announced it was creating a separate stock to track its long-distance business.
But the online auctioneer eBay rose $2.52, to $54.02, and the Web portal Yahoo was up $5.73, at $64.36.
Also yesterday, the market got conflicting signals about the health of the economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that United States manufacturing activity slowed in October, while the Commerce Department said construction spending jumped 2.4 percent in September, the biggest gain in 10 months.

Treasuries Advance
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after a manufacturing report suggested six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve had slowed economic growth, fueling speculation the Fed may cut rates next year.
Declines in the three major stock measures also helped demand for government debt.
"The economy has shifted to a pace of slower growth, and that's good for Treasuries," said Dana Johnson, head of research at Banc One Capital Markets in Chicago. "Yet the dominant story in fixed income has been the turmoil in stocks for several weeks" in driving bond prices higher or lower, he said.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32 , to a price of 100 3/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.74 percent from 5.75 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32 , to 106 20/32 . The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.78 percent.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported its index fell to 48.3 from 49.9 in September, below the forecast of 49.5 expected by analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News. The decrease follows a larger-than-expected decline in the regional survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE UNIONS;
Labor Tailors Its Vote-for-Gore Message, State by State

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: KENOSHA, Wis., Oct. 31

 BODY:
At the giant DaimlerChrysler engine plant here, 75 volunteers from the United Automobile Workers distributed a leaflet today seeking to reassure the factory's employees, many of whom hunt on weekends, that Vice President Al Gore's gun control proposals would in no way hurt sportsmen.
In Florida, labor is deluging union retirees with mailings saying that Gov. George W. Bush's privatization proposal could endanger their Social Security benefits and that Mr. Gore would do more to cushion the cost of prescription drugs. 
 In California, where many union members are low-wage, newly naturalized immigrants, labor's campaign literature is often in Spanish or Chinese and frequently emphasizes bread-and-butter messages like Mr. Gore's call to raise the minimum wage and extend health insurance to millions more children.
And in New York State, with its giant teacher and government employee unions, labor's leaflets often dwell on Governor Bush's reducing contributions to Texas' teacher pension funds and his seeking to privatize state government jobs.
Organized labor, making its biggest political push ever, is relying increasingly this fall on such customized, state-by-state messages. This more sophisticated strategy, by a movement once considered a monolith that took a one-size-fits-all approach, is intended to appeal specifically but simultaneously to engineers and janitors, to teachers and garment workers. Labor leaders hope it will excite union members and help put Mr. Gore over the top.
"We tailor our message to different regions and to different types of workers," said Steven Rosenthal, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political director. "But the message is basically the same: that there is a stark contrast between Bush, who's antilabor and antiworker, and Al Gore, who has long been a good friend of workers."
Last weekend unions in this blue-collar city distributed to 7,600 union households customized leaflets saying that Kenosha could hold the key to what happens in Wisconsin and that Wisconsin could hold the key to whether Mr. Gore wins the election.
Overseeing a phone bank at a U.A.W. hall, Curt Wilson, president of the Kenosha Central Labor Council, said a town-specific, get-out-the-vote leaflet made sense because when cities here in southeastern Wisconsin rolled up a large Democratic majority, the Democratic candidate usually won the state despite Republican majorities in northern Wisconsin.
These leaflets are part of a last-minute blitz in which John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, has asked every union in the 13-million-member federation to distribute one piece of pro-Gore literature to every union member today, another piece on Thursday and another next Monday. And from this Friday through next Tuesday, Election Day, thousands of staff members are being released by unions to work full time on the campaign. As for volunteers, the painters' union alone said 17,000 of its members would do campaign work for Mr. Gore this week.
Of labor's all-out effort, John Drew, president of the U.A.W. local that represents 1,850 engine plant workers here, said, "If Bush wins, we could wake up Wednesday morning with a Republican president, Senate and House, which would mean it would be very difficult to stop an agenda that would seek to weaken unions."
Many experts say that if Mr. Gore wins battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, it will be unions that are responsible.
"If the unions weren't active, Gore wouldn't have a chance in these states," said David W. Rohde, a professor of political science at Michigan State University. "And without those states, he doesn't have a chance nationwide."
Unions' enthusiastic support for Mr. Gore follows anger expressed by large numbers of them over his backing for the legislation that liberalized trade with China. Union leaders now say it makes sense to support him because his opponent is, if anything, worse on the trade issue and because his positions are so close to labor's on other matters, including health care, Social Security and the minimum wage.
In fact, for the union movement the stakes in this election are huge. In his five years heading the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Sweeney has worked hard to reverse labor's decades-long slide and increase its political influence. A Gore loss would be a stinging setback to those efforts, made all the worse if the Democrats fail to gain control of the House, a goal for which labor has deployed 1,100 staff members to work full time in 71 Congressional districts.
Labor leaders hope Mr. Gore will attract at least as large a share of union votes, 59 percent, as President Clinton got in 1996. That may not be easy, given workers like Terry Plant, a Bush supporter who belongs to the machinists' union.
"I think the Democratic Party is morally bankrupt," said Mr. Plant, who works at a General Electric medical equipment factory in Milwaukee, although "it's hard being a union guy and not following the Democratic Party. I feel some regret that I voted for President Reagan 20 years ago, because the first thing he did was go after the unions."
Bob Hopkins, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the governor was holding his own with the union rank and file. Pointing to Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri, Mr. Hopkins said: "In state after state that has a strong labor presence, Governor Bush is neck and neck with Al Gore, or leading. He would not be able to do this unless his message was reaching independent voters, swing voters and rank-and-file union members."
Mr. Hopkins said Mr. Bush's promises in particular to cut taxes and improve education had resonated with working families.
When Mr. Gore barnstormed through Wisconsin on Monday, he tailored many of his remarks to union members. In one speech after another, he promised to raise the minimum wage and push for laws making it easier for unions to organize. He has made similar labor-friendly remarks in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where, as in Wisconsin, voters from union households accounted for more than 30 percent of all voters in 1998.
One leading example of labor's customizing its message was what happened in early October when union leaders in the hunting-popular Midwest concluded that it was crucial to distribute a flier defending Mr. Gore on the gun issue. The vice president had called for a variety of new gun controls, and in mailings and television spots the National Rifle Association was trying to peel Midwestern union members away from him. "Al Gore Wants to Ban Guns in America," one N.R.A. brochure proclaimed.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. responded with a brochure, distributed in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, that said: "Al Gore doesn't want to take away your gun. But George W. Bush wants to take away your union."
And the Wisconsin State A.F.L.-C.I.O. recently printed tens of thousands of fliers warning union members that the N.R.A. was trying to distract them from fundamental economic issues.
"How do you stay on target?" the flier said. "Don't be tricked by issues that don't affect your family's bottom line. Realize every candidate opposes crime and supports sportsmen and hunters."
Unions are customizing in numerous other ways as well. In Chicago, they are distributing fliers in Polish. In Florida, Haitian-American workers have received leaflets in Creole. When building trades unions distribute campaign literature, it usually mentions that Mr. Gore wants to preserve a federal law guaranteeing union-level wages on government construction projects and that Mr. Bush has called for watering down the law.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has created a Web site where presidents of union locals can order federation-designed campaign fliers on which the locals can include their own community-specific message. Locals have ordered more than three million customized fliers this way, labor officials said.
With Mr. Gore so far ahead in New York and Massachusetts, unions in those state have sent hundreds of campaign workers to other states. New York City's largest health care union, 1199/S.E.I.U., has dispatched 40 full-time campaign workers to Pennsylvania and Michigan for four weeks.
"This resembles the Second World War," said Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, "when the United States was sending arms to the British so they can fight the Germans."

HEADLINE: Fed Report Seen Offering Little Reason To Lift Rates

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The economy grew moderately last month, but many parts of the country reported evidence of slowing activity in critical sectors like retail sales and housing, the Federal Reserve said today.
The Fed said its latest survey of business conditions around the country, compiled by its 12 regional banks, indicated "additional signs of slowing growth in some areas." 
 It reported that business activity had slowed in five regions -- Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia and Richmond, Va. -- while other areas indicated that growth was continuing at about the same moderate pace.
The Fed said that retail spending had softened in some parts of the country and that the outlook was "a little less positive" for the tourism industry. A slowdown was also indicated in home sales and construction activity generally.
The central bank survey found little evidence that rising energy prices or continued tight labor markets were causing overall inflation pressures to accelerate.
The latest survey of economic activity, compiled from information gathered before Oct. 23, will be used by Fed policy makers when they meet on Nov. 15 to decide whether interest rates should be changed.
The views expressed in the report, known as the beige book for the color of its cover, will probably reinforce the view of most economists that the Fed will leave rates alone, convinced that six rate increases from June 1999 to May of this year have achieved the desired aim of slowing economic growth to keep inflation under control.
In another report today, the National Association of Purchasing Management said activity in manufacturing contracted in October for a third consecutive month, with its index dropping to 48.3. A reading above 50 on the index indicates growth in manufacturing, while a reading below that level indicates a slowdown.
Not all reports released today showed weaker activity. The Commerce Department said construction spending increased 2.4 percent in September, the biggest gain in 10 months, reflecting strength in home remodeling, office building and government projects. The gains pushed spending to an annual rate of $819.3 billion, the second-highest level on record. The rise in construction spending was the biggest since a 2.6 percent gain in November 1999.
The September increase reflected a 2.1 percent rise in private construction, led by a 3.4 percent surge in nonresidential activity. Office building soared 6.2 percent, and gains were also registered in the construction of factories, hotels and hospitals.
Residential activity rose 1.1 percent, with all the gain coming from a 6.4 percent rise in home remodeling.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Economics as the Path to Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
DAVE H. WILLIAMS, the new chairman of the Foreign Policy Association, grins when asked if he can name the political leaders of Taiwan, India, Pakistan or Chechnya.
"No," Mr. Williams, an investment banker, answers without batting an eye, "I cannot." 
 (You may recall the incident a year ago, which seems like light-years in campaign time, when Gov. George W. Bush flubbed a similar pop quiz.)
It's not that Mr. Williams finds foreign policy or unfamiliar leaders dull. On the contrary, he wants to know how well various countries are run. What about the names? "I can always look it up; I don't need to clutter my brain with that."
His interest in the subject dawned after he graduated from the University of Texas in 1956 with a degree in chemical engineering and joined the Navy. He spent three years aboard the U.S.S. Maury, mapping the bottom of the Atlantic. The mapping aided the placement of listening devices that eavesdropped on prowling Soviet submarines, and monitored the plop of test rockets fired from Cape Canaveral.
If you are thinking his interest in foreign affairs grew out of steamy port calls, you're wrong.
"Some of the islands in the south Atlantic were not the most exotic liberty ports," he says.
But the Navy fertilized his awareness of a wider world that multiplied in tandem with his four decades as an investment banker in New York City. (There was an intermittent stop at Harvard Business School for an M.B.A. in 1961.) The importance of things foreign in his field intensified from 1977 to 1999, his years as the chairman and chief executive of Alliance Capital Management, a money-management firm.
"There is probably less interest in foreign affairs from the standpoint of whether we are going to have a nuclear war," he says, "but probably more interest from the standpoint of business and commerce."
Groups like the Foreign Policy Association have found the appeal of what they do (and hence donations) fading along with the cold war and fear of Communist domination. Conversely, businessmen have needed to learn more about foreign countries leaping into competing markets.
"Whether we like it or not, that is where a lot of opportunity for American business has come from and looks to be in the future," Mr. Williams says.
His desk doesn't exactly radiate power banker, or perhaps not the Hollywood version. It is too messy, for one, the note pads and reports jumbled with stuff like a little red doll from a granddaughter and a chunk of the flight deck from the U.S.S. Intrepid, a souvenir of helping underwrite New York City's Military Salute Week last June.
The office walls are hung with prints by W.P.A. artists from the 1930's, part of a collection of 6,000 amassed by Mr. Williams and his wife, Reba White Williams. The couple gave several hundred such works by African-American artists to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, on whose board Mr. Williams sits.
HE retains something of a trim, military bearing, speaking and dressing in a quiet, understated way. Now 68, though he looks younger and says he tries to run 20 to 30 minutes a day no matter where in the world he is, he stepped aside last year from making the day-to-day decisions at Alliance, but he remains chairman. Alliance is is now a subsidiary of a French insurance giant, Axa Group; there is a miniature French tricolor amid the clutter.
Which leads us back to the Foreign Policy Association. He has been on its board for 10 years, first drawn there when Alliance wanted to open an office in India to arrange such things as mutual fund transactions in rupees. Mr. Williams found attending association meetings on policy changes emerging from New Delhi's tangled bureaucracy easier than trekking to the subcontinent.
The association is frankly not the most high-profile foreign-policy group going. It was started after World War I to help familiarize Americans with all sides of international problems. It is best known for its Great Decisions Program, in which small groups scattered around the country, especially students, debate policy papers the association produces with names like "The Euro's Challenge to the Dollar: King Kong versus Godzilla?"
Mr. Williams's main goal during his tenure is to extend the association's reach through the Internet, specifically by pumping up its $3.5 million annual budget. He may not know the names of foreign leaders quite like he knows fund-raising.
He was chairman of a corporate fund-raising event at the Met in 1994 that raised nearly $1 million in one night. During the current election cycle, Mr. Williams says, he raised up to $250,000 for the Republican Party, most of it for George W. Bush, but some for Rick Lazio as well. (He and his wife were major supporters of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani until 1998, when Mrs. Williams famously resigned as president of the city's Art Commission after repeated skirmishing with the parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern, over the design of public stuff like yardarms on flagpoles.)
Mr. Williams finds the current emphasis on foreign policy in the New York Senate campaign dubious.
"They get more simplified in a campaign; there is polarization that wouldn't be there but for courting voters," he says. "Silly season really applies to the discussion of foreign policy in a campaign."

HEADLINE: Why West's Billions Failed to Give Russia a Robust Economy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Western powers gave tens of billions of dollars in aid to Russia with no comprehensive strategy, and, at least partly as a result, the programs failed to bring about the desired capitalist transition there, a Congressional study has concluded.
The study, by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, raises questions about what has arguably been the highest foreign policy priority of the United States: making sure Russia did not become hostile after the collapse of Communism in 1991. Many Clinton administration officials supported a huge amount of international aid and a "big bang" approach to change in which Russia was encouraged to sell state companies rapidly and overhaul banks as a way of making the nation both capitalist and democratic -- and of ensuring that Communists could never regain control of the economy. 
 A cumulative $66 billion in aid from the United States, Europe and the leading international lending agencies did prevent Communists from returning to power and kept the nation from descending into anarchy. But the aid programs failed to build robust capitalist institutions or produce sustained economic growth in Russia, which produces roughly one-third less now than it did a decade ago, the report says.
The accounting office review said donors did not coordinate programs sufficiently and tended to distribute money hurriedly.
"While the worst fears of the early transition period, such as anarchy or return to Communist rule, have not been realized, Russia's economic decline has been more severe and its recovery slower than anticipated," the report says.
The report seems likely to offer support for both sides in the continuing battle over Russia policy. It gives ammunition to Republican critics who say the Clinton administration and the leading aid agencies squandered billions in Russia while tolerating widespread corruption. But it suggests that the goal of stabilizing a former foe still seems valid and places much of the blame for the failure of aid on Russia itself.
Russia has been plagued by corruption, a rebellious Parliament, heavy turnover among government ministers and limited grass-roots support for capitalist changes. Moreover, a new economic elite prevented many changes from taking hold. Local support for change is a prerequisite, the report says.
The report notes that the Group of 7 wealthy nations tried to coordinate Western aid strategy in the early 1990's, but adds that the collective effort soon dissolved. That left the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and individual nations to pursue aid programs largely independently, with varying aims and mixed results.
An even bigger failure may have been Western support for a major privatization scheme in the mid-1990's, the report notes. The "loans for shares" program put many of the nation's most productive enterprises in the hands of a small elite. But analysts say that state assets were effectively stolen during that process, and that privatization brought few benefits to the overall economy.
James A. Leach, an Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking Committee and first asked for the study of Russian aid, said it shows that aid was "worse than wasted."
The Clinton administration, which responded to the Congressional report in a letter, said the main conclusions were balanced, agreeing that a central problem was Russia's own failure to embrace change.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
The U.S. tax system is discouraging married women from working.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel; This column appears here every Thursday. Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise, and Progress." Four economic analysts -- Ms. Postrel, Jeff Madrick, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
THE single women of "Sex and the City" read the New York Times wedding announcements and mock a bride who was "until recently" employed as an account executive. Now that she's found an investment banker to marry, they scoff, she doesn't have to pretend to be interested in her career. These independent women are contemptuous of such behavior. They're looking for love, not a meal ticket.
But maybe the new Mrs. Investment Banker doesn't deserve their scorn. Maybe she's just a rational "economic woman," responding to incentives. 
 Marriage has kicked her into the highest bracket. With federal, state and Social Security taxes, she's now losing about half of every dollar she earns -- starting with the very first one. You've got to really love your work to do it for half price.
The Census Bureau recently said that both spouses now work in 51 percent of married couples with wives of childbearing age -- the first time that number has surpassed 50 percent since the bureau started tracking it. More wives would work if our progressive income tax structure didn't sock second earners with high marginal rates.
"There is a relationship between taxes and labor-force participation," said Nada Eissa, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley and the National Bureau for Economic Research. "We think it's fairly strong. In fact, we think it's strongest for married women," who are usually the family's secondary earners and are more likely to consider not working outside the home.
Far more than men or single women, married women act like supply siders. Cut their marginal tax rates, and they get jobs. Raise their taxes, and they stay home.
By disproportionately punishing married women's work, the tax system distorts women's personal choices. And by discouraging valuable work, it lowers our overall standard of living.
This is a tax story you won't hear from politicians. The "marriage penalty" debate tends to frame the issue as one of family formation: how does the tax code affect a couple's decision to marry? But marriage isn't primarily an economic decision.
The more pertinent question is how does the tax code affect a married woman's decision to work? There are obvious political reasons not to ask that. Democrats don't want to admit that soak-the-rich taxation wallops working wives, lest they split feminists and redistributionists. And Republicans don't want to admit that cutting taxes will lead more married women to get jobs, lest they split economic libertarians and social conservatives. So everyone stays mum.
But the empirical evidence is pretty clear. Tax rates are a feminist issue.
Professor Eissa has studied how the tax bite affects behavior at both ends of the income distribution. In a 1995 paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, she looked at how married women responded to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. That law created a natural experiment. It chopped the top marginal tax rate to 28 percent, from 50 percent, but had only a minor impact on middle-income taxpayers. That gave her an opportunity to compare the responses of different groups of wives before and after the change.
Before it, the women in the 99th percentile of family income (the top 1 percent) on average paid about 52 cents in taxes on the first dollar they earned. In some states, a wife who earned less than $30,000 a year could have paid in taxes as much as 70 cents of the first dollar she earned.
The 1986 law flattened federal rates and, as a result, slashed the average marginal rate faced by such wives to 38 percent. The percentage of these married women who worked jumped from 46 percent to 55 percent -- a 19 percent increase -- and those who had jobs increased their hours 13 percent.
To make sure this increase was caused by the tax change rather than other trends, Professor Eissa compared it with the behavior of women in the 75th percentile, who got a much smaller tax cut. Their labor force participation and hours worked also rose, but by significantly less -- a 7 percent jump in those working and a 9 percent increase in hours worked.
Since 1986, rates have become steeper, as Washington pursued increased revenue and lost interest in supply-side incentives. "There's been less discussion of the behavioral effects of taxation," Professor Eissa said.
Policy makers have, however, tried to reform the incentives faced by poor women. And here, too, Professor Eissa finds they've managed to prejudice married women against work. The 1993 tax bill expanded the Earned-Income Tax Credit, a subsidy that goes to the working poor and is administered through the tax-filing system. The credit is intended partly to counteract the discouraging effects of Social Security payroll taxes, which hit wage earners at their first dollar.
Like the rest of the tax system, the credit's sliding scale applies to households rather than individuals. One spouse's income is enough to qualify for the subsidy, and the credit is phased out as total family income increases. So if a husband earned $11,650 in 1997, his family of four got $3,656 from the earned-income credit, assuming his wife did not work. For every dollar she earned, the credit was reduced 21 cents -- in effect, a marginal tax rate of 21 percent on top of Social Security and state taxes.
In a 1998 paper, Professor Eissa and her colleague Hillary Williamson Hoynes found that the expanded tax credit did increase married men's labor force participation. But married women were 5 percent less likely to work if their family incomes were high enough that anything they earned would cancel out some of the credit. And if they did work, the tax credit led them to reduce their hours 20 percent.
By paying one spouse to work and reducing the payments as household income rises, Professors Eissa and Hoynes wrote, the tax credit "is effectively subsidizing married mothers to stay at home." It's possible that's what policy makers intended. But it's more likely that they didn't fully consider how married women would react to what amounted to high marginal tax rates.
That's a pervasive problem throughout the tax system. Once a woman is married, it seems, the tax laws don't really want her to work.

HEADLINE: U.S. Auto Sales Sag, Another Slowdown Sign

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Not even aggressive discounting by automakers could lift sales of new cars and light trucks last month, and bloated inventories of unsold models have led to the closing for a week of 8 of the nation's 55 auto assembly plants.
Auto sales are the first important economic indicator to come out at the beginning of each month, and today's results were another sign that growth in the American economy has been slowing somewhat recently. Although sales have leveled off at a high level by historical standards, they are increasingly being sustained by ever more generous rebates and low-rate loans, rather than by strong consumer demand. 
 In early October, General Motors began offering zero-interest loans for up to five years to help customers buy its minivans, midsize sport utility vehicles and some midsize cars. It was the only large automaker to report a rise in sales last month, with an increase of 6.5 percent. DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor and foreign automakers have been helping their buyers with low-rate loans to a lesser extent -- such programs are costly after the Federal Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates since June 1999.
The pace of sales slowed sharply from September, even after adjusting for seasonal differences, and was little changed from October of last year, even though that had been one of the industry's less strong months in 1999. Estimating sales for three small automakers that did not report sales today, Mark Cornelius, an auto consultant in West Olive, Mich., said that the overall industry's sales appeared to have fallen roughly 0.8 percent from the year-earlier period.
Automakers are having trouble selling models not covered by various discount programs. This week, G.M. has closed 3 of its 25 assembly plants in North America: two factories in Lansing, Mich., that make small cars and a factory in Orion, Mich., that makes full-size cars. DaimlerChrysler has quietly closed this week 7 of its 16 factories in North America, including two plants that make sport utility vehicles, two that make pickup trucks, and one each that makes small cars, large cars and full-size vans.
Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for North American sales and marketing, said that other automakers might also need to close their factories briefly because of rising inventories. "You may see more of those before it's over," he said.
G.M. and DaimlerChrysler each said that the closings were only scheduled to last one week. Many of the factories are in Midwestern states that are expected to be crucial in next Tuesday's election: in addition to the three G.M. factories in Michigan, one of the DaimlerChrysler factories is in Michigan, another is in Ohio, a third is in Missouri and a fourth is in Illinois. Two more are in Canada, and the last in Delaware.
Under the automakers' contracts with the United Automobile Workers union, workers continue to receive 90 percent of their base pay when temporarily laid off. But because many workers have nearly doubled their pay with extensive overtime for the last seven years, this could still represent a small financial setback for many families, as well as a warning that the economy might not be as strong as it once seemed. Under a new provision negotiated last year, the automakers' employees will be given a holiday on Election Day for the first time this year, and the U.A.W. has begun an elaborate effort to make sure that workers do go to the polls and vote Democratic on their day off.
Jim Betty, the president of the union local at a DaimlerChrysler pickup truck factory that is closed this week in Warren, Mich., said that he doubted the factory closings would affect his workers' votes. "They're not blaming anyone -- we've been on a run for 10 years and things are getting slow, we've been telling them that for months," he said.
Mr. Jameson said that DaimlerChrysler had chosen this week to close the factories without considering any possible political implications.
Ford will close two Canadian factories for a week beginning next Monday, but the company said this decision did not reflect weak sales. The company said it was shutting the factories to free up side air bag modules for minivans and large cars, which the company is replacing in large numbers at dealerships after three recent incidents in which the air bags deployed while vehicles were being assembled.
Della DiPietro, a company spokeswoman, said that Ford had begun using a new kind of air bag module that caused the problem. Only 1,600 were sold before the problem was detected; these have been recalled, and Ford is not aware of incidents involving accidental air bag inflation on the road, she said.
Some of the auto industry's most profitable models, notably full-size pickup trucks, did not sell well last month. General Motors announced today that it would reduce further its already discounted interest rates on loans for full-size pickups, while Ford said that it was studying what to do about an 11 percent drop last month in its sales of big F-series pickups. Separately, DaimlerChrysler said that it would begin discounting leases on its new minivans -- a sign of difficulty for a freshly redesigned vehicle.
Ford said that sales dropped 16 percent for Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. But overall sales of Ford sport utility vehicles nonetheless rose 11 percent, as some customers appeared to have switched to other Ford models. Ford attributed the decline in Explorer sales to bad publicity from the deaths in Explorers equipped with Firestone tires; the decision of some customers to wait for the introduction of a completely redesigned Explorer early next year; a shortage of Explorers in some markets because Ford stopped production at a factory for three weeks to make replacement tires available; and the introduction of the slightly smaller Ford Escape sport utility vehicle, which competes to some extent with the Explorer.
Ford's overall sales were down 6.2 percent, excluding its purchase of Land Rover. Nissan Motor's sales were down 3.6 percent; Honda Motor's, down 5.6 percent; and Toyota Motor's, down 5.7 percent. DaimlerChrysler's sales fell 8.4 percent excluding Mercedes, and dropped 7.4 percent including Mercedes.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: OUTSIDERS;
Observing, Yet Shunning, Political System

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Outside the Shady Rest tourist cabins, a relic of the 1930's flaking away on old Route 66, Charles W. Murphy and his low-rent neighbors along this margin of the American dream broke the seal on a half pint of Kentucky Deluxe whiskey.
"We are the people, you know," said Mr. Murphy, taking the lead in an animated, garrulous midday gathering that amounted to an antidote to all the ponderous focus-group preenings of this campaign season. 
 "But on Election Day, I'll be sitting in that room," Mr. Murphy announced, pointing at his small gray tourist cabin standing atilt near a chained-up dog.
"I'll be watching the TV votes, but I will not vote and for a very good reason," said Mr. Murphy, a grizzled, amiable man waxing fierce as his opening nip of "Ky-Dee" at the motor court picnic table. "I never saw a politician come anywhere near all of us living here in what is just Bum's Rush, Okla., the cheapest place in town. Never heard one knock on my door like they do and say, 'Can I have your vote?' "
Mr. Murphy nodded firmly at his sense of being politically unnecessary. It is his justification for not partaking in a campaign in which manifold slices and slivers of the focus-grouped public have been targeted for the candidates' finely honed slogans.
The dozen tenants of Shady Rest amount to a nonfocus group, but a talkative one that registers a dire frustration with politics driven by their subsistence here in $80-a-week shelter. On one level, they are just another part of the nonvoting American majority. But on another, they marshal the added excuse for not voting of being down and out, not up and coming.
"The only change in my life across eight years of Clinton was the taxes kept rising on the cigarettes that give me comfort," summarized Janet McFarland, the night clerk at the Gateway Motor Inn. She emerged from cabin No. 11 in her morning kimono, passing up the whiskey but not the political discussion.
One by one, other residents appeared over three hours of disorganized but heartfelt socializing. Like the ordinary humans dramatized by Eugene O'Neill, the group conceded life's seediness even as they toasted their common wit and fate.
"We're like a family here," Mrs. McFarland said.
"And I'm the Pa," exulted Mr. Murphy, a 62-year retiree who described a roustabout career from the Korean War to silver mining to pool shark. He sounded like O'Neill's Hickey easing the underclass wait for life's betterment by suddenly brandishing a book of his poetry writings. "Here's one: 'Freedom is just another word you often hear/ From people in plastic houses they hold so dear.' "
Mrs. McFarland's husband, Jim, emerged on a bicycle from the trailer-truck racket of Route 66, after a job hunt in the booming economy he hears about. "The position at McDonald's was already filled," he announced. "But I've got friends in other places."
The gathering was as up to speed as other Americans on the investment proposal for Social Security and on Al Gore's kissing his wife for votes. As much as they clearly knew about the candidates' basic differences, they insisted that politicians could never convincingly get past the burned-out "welcome" sign by the roadside weeds.
"I used to listen to the politicians a lot on the radio," said Louise Hopkins, who showed up fresh from a court hearing in a drunken driving case and plopped a six-pack of beer on the discussion table.
"The politics now seems like the rich are getting richer, like they say, and the poor poorer," said Ms. Hopkins, concocting a boilermaker of beer and the Ky-Dee. "I'm entitled to a little fun, right?" she defensively told her friends concerned at the drink.
As they talked, Ms. Hopkins, Mr. Murphy and others spoke to one of the campaign's big issues, the inability to afford all the medication they need for their mounting ills. But they insisted the candidates' talk of this problem was just that. "Clinton had eight years and didn't solve it," Mr. Murphy said.
Mr. McFarland gently observed, "The last time a politician really excited me was John F. Kennedy asking what we can do for the country."
His wife interrupted with a question: If Jesse Ventura can be governor of Minnesota "why can't Hulk Hogan be president?" There were smiles but no outright dismissal of the notion.
The youngest tenant, 18-year-old William Cooley, arrived back from his job as a dishwasher at Ollie's Restaurant to await his father, who was newly released from jail after a domestic dispute. "It's very important to vote," Mr. Cooley declared, bucking the group consensus. "I have my goal -- a diploma and a trade," the young man said in an aside. "It's not a bad little shindig here, but there are better places."
At the common table, tenants pursued politics as the American majority does: as a provocative topic but an uninviting endeavor. The poetic relief from Mr. Murphy deepened with the level of the Ky-Dee bottle. "I'd rather knock at the door of heaven," he darkly intoned to his neighbors, "than live in this pit of hell."
Not really, he quickly amended, brightening as he offered a nonfocus group conclusion worthy of Shady Rest: "Bush blows smoke, Gore rides Clinton's shirttails, and the race is going to be close."

HEADLINE: U.S. Proposes Changes in Electricity Marketing in California

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Citing the "seriously flawed" nature of the California electricity market, which was plagued with price spikes and brownouts this summer, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed changes yesterday in the sale and pricing of electricity intended to overhaul deregulation in the state.
The commission's review was set off by widespread outrage after consumers in San Diego saw their electricity bills triple this summer. 
 Once viewed as a pioneer in developing an efficient electricity market, California is now thought to embody the many problems that can arise from deregulation. States that are taking a go-slow approach to deregulation are sure to follow closely the changes proposed for California.
Commission and industry analysts warned that the proposed measures, which would affect 85 percent to 90 percent of the California market, were but a first step to undoing the complicated knot of factors that led to high prices. They said the measures were not a guarantee that prices would be lower next summer.
"Some people want, to use a psychobabble word, closure on all this," said Robert Michaels, a deregulation expert and professor of economics at California State University at Fullerton. "But the California institutions are so complex that no one measure by F.E.R.C. will resolve it. The process will go on for a long time."
The commission oversees the progress of deregulation across the country although states determine the specific conditions. The commission will accept commentary on the proposals and issue a binding order in December, a spokeswoman said.
California electricity prices rocketed last summer largely because consumer demand for power outstripped supply. As a result, the commission warned, California officials will have to find ways to build more power plants and transmission lines.
The commission's recommendations center on the sale of power through institutions set up as part of California's deregulation process. Many investor-owned utilities no longer generate power, but buy it on the wholesale market. Currently, utilities can buy and sell power only through the California Power Exchange, a state-run electricity marketplace. The commission has proposed eliminating that requirement so utilities can shop around for long-term electricity contracts, a move most analysts welcomed.
"This gives us more flexibility to obtain affordable power for customers," said Shawn Cooper, a spokesman for the PG&E Corporation, the major utility in Northern California. "Right now, we're limited on the energy product we can buy."
Turning to the exchange, Mr. Cooper said, "is like going to a car lot and being able to buy only one or two models."
But experts said the other proposals might be easily thwarted by power-generating companies seeking top dollar. The commission proposed, for example, to lower the price cap for a megawatt hour to $150 from $250. Power suppliers that bid over $150 would be paid their price but would be required to explain the reasons for their bid. Such a system, some experts say, would prove a sizable loophole.
James Bushnell, a research associate with the Energy Institute of the University of California, said, "I think a clever engineer at any power company could come up with a whole bunch of reasons for whatever they want their costs to be."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Concern for the Economy Upstate

BYLINE: By Randal C. Archibold 

 BODY:
This is a new 30-second commercial that Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign began broadcasting yesterday.
 
PRODUCER -- Callahan Creative 

ON THE SCREEN -- A series of street interviews, intercut twice with text reading "Who is the right choice for New York?" and "Hillary has a plan to create 200,000 jobs."
 
THE SCRIPT -- FIRST WOMAN: "My husband and I have five children, and three out of five moved away to get jobs. We're still hurting here, and I don't think Mr. Lazio has helped." FIRST MAN: "He's really out of touch." SECOND MAN: "More concerned about downstate than upstate." SECOND WOMAN: "It's important to have a very detailed, economic growth plan for upstate." THIRD MAN: " Hillary has shown a definite interest in the upstate New York area." THIRD WOMAN: "She's about helping people who need help." FOURTH MAN: "I'm a registered Republican, and I think Hillary is what we need in this area."
 
ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, unveiled an economic plan in February to address the needs of upstate New York, where jobs have been increasing but not at the same pace as in New York City and its suburbs. Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, does not have a plan aimed at upstate New York. But he has an overall economic plan of tax cuts that he contends will spur economic growth statewide. Both candidates also promote the idea of cultivating high-tech businesses in areas that have lost manufacturing and other industrial jobs. Mr. Lazio has drawn some criticism for being more optimistic about the upstate economy..
 
SCORECARD -- The man-in-the-street format gives the ad a grass-roots feel, of hearing real people's concerns. And Mrs. Clinton strikes a chord -- the loss of the upstate region's young people -- that is likely to resonate. But the fact that the upstate economy generally is improving by most measures is overlooked, and, though he has not released a plan specifically aimed at the region, the ad wrongfully leaves the impression Mr. Lazio has not addressed economic concerns at all.

Revlon to Close 3 Plants As Loss Beats Forecasts
After posting its eighth consecutive quarterly loss, Revlon, the cosmetics giant controlled by Ronald O. Perelman, announced yet another round of cutbacks. The moves include the closing of three plants, which will result in the layoffs of 1,115 employees.
 Excluding a charge for reorganization, the company lost $12.6 million, or 25 cents a share, which was slightly better than Wall Street forecasts of a loss of 32 cents a share but still far short of the kind of turnaround numbers that spur investor interest. Page C6.

HEADLINE: Chief Who Put Newell Rubbermaid Together Quits

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
A troubled merger and an inability to raise prices have combined to topple the chief executive of Newell Rubbermaid Inc., the maker of Levelor blinds and Rolodex office supplies.
Rattled by a year of disheartening earnings and faced with ebbing investor confidence, Newell Rubbermaid announced yesterday that John J. McDonough, the chief executive esteemed for his vision but criticized for failing to carry it out smoothly, had resigned. 
 The announcement came one week after Mr. McDonough warned analysts to scale back their forecasts for the third time this year, a move that helped drive Newell's stock to its lowest level since 1994.
Once regarded as a stalwart engine of predictable growth, Newell long benefited from an expansive line of relatively inconspicuous products that weathered the ups and downs in consumer spending through much of the 1990's. But the company is staggering under the weight of its $5.8 billion purchase last year of Rubbermaid Inc., a problem-plagued company that has proved exceedingly difficult to turn around. The deal demonstrates just how costly some mergers can be.
Newell has also been grappling with its dwindling influence over what large retailers like Wal-Mart charge for its products, an increasingly common difficulty for consumer products companies that rely on routine price increases for growth.
The problem has been particularly pronounced for Newell because many of its plastic products, from dish trays to wheelbarrows, use resin, a raw material whose price rises with the cost of oil. Without the ability to dictate store prices, the company has been unable to pass these higher costs onto consumers.
During his three-year tenure as chief executive, Mr. McDonough tried to bolster Newell's bargaining strength with stores by shifting the company's tight focus on the United States to overseas markets, where many retailers have expanded in recent years. Since 1998, Newell has made sweeping purchases of picture frame, window dressing, office products and hardware manufacturers in Europe, continuing the acquisitive strategy the company has pursued at home for decades.
With its widely recognized name, Rubbermaid offered Newell a chance to enhance its overseas presence significantly. But unlike the small companies swallowed in Europe, most of which had annual revenues of $100 million to $300 million, Rubbermaid was nearly three-fourths the size of Newell at the time, boasting $2.4 billion in sales, compared with $3.3 billion for its suitor.
Many analysts derided the $5.8 billion sales price as too high, warning that Rubbermaid's sagging profit margins would take too long to reverse. But Mr. McDonough hailed the acquisition as "a terrific strategic fit" and set about repairing Rubbermaid's blemished image as an unreliable manufacturer, prone to disappoint retailers with late or incomplete deliveries.
The rehabilitation proved more difficult than anticipated. After replacing many Rubbermaid officials with Newell executives, leaving a new corps of executives to run Newell's own divisions, analysts say, the company became distracted, losing sight of some of its more established brands. In the quarter that ended Sept. 30, Rubbermaid sales fell 1 percent, while Newell's home decor division was flat, and its cookware unit, which includes Calphalon and Mirro, grew a mere 2 percent.
When the company announced in a conference call last week that its fourth-quarter earnings would be 43 to 48 cents a share, instead of the 55 cents that many analysts had expected, the mounting frustration with the company was palpable.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore and Bush Trade Jabs On Pensions and Spending

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore warned elderly and middle-age voters today in a campaign sweep across central Florida that Gov. George W. Bush's Social Security proposals would threaten their retirement and the country's economic well-being.
"Join with me," Mr. Gore told his audience at a civic center this morning in Kissimmee, near Orlando, "and we won't make promises just to break them. We'll keep our promises to the seniors who gave us everything that we have today." 
 Mr. Gore, who spent the day traversing the crucial Interstate 4 corridor, devoted most of an address in Kissimmee to attacking Mr. Bush's plan, which would let individuals invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in stocks and bonds. Mr. Gore restated his position that the Bush plan would remove $1 trillion from the Social Security system, a sum that he said would be needed to make payments to current and future recipients.
"Instead of a system where everyone's in it together, the Bush plan would turn Social Security into a grab bag where everyone is out for himself," he said. "You might call it social insecurity. And that's wrong for our values."
Mr. Gore emphasized that today's Social Security decisions should matter not only to elderly Americans but also to middle-age workers. That reflects the sense of Gore strategists that Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals can be used to sow broad doubt about his competency.
"It cuts a couple of different ways," said Carter Eskew, a top Gore adviser. "It's both a pocketbook issue and a readiness issue."
With six days to go before Election Day, campaign activity in Florida is as intense as officials in either party can remember. Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, campaigned separately across the state today, hitting four media markets between them. Mr. Lieberman, who visited two retirement communities, a mall, a fire station, and a sheriff's station, and held rallies in Boca Raton and Daytona Beach, emphasized the importance of Florida to the Democrats' hopes on Tuesday.
The vice president's central message focused on Social Security. Besides attacking the Bush plan, Mr. Gore promoted his own, which would dedicate nearly all the Social Security surplus to paying the $3.4 trillion national debt within a dozen years.
That, theoretically, would free general tax revenues equal to the amount of interest saved from debt reduction -- $250 billion a year by 2016 -- that could be used to extend Social Security's solvency to 2054, from the current projection of 2037.
"For 45-year-olds today," Mr. Gore said, "Social Security would be secure, without any cuts or changes, until their 100th birthdays."
Mr. Gore's campaign is convinced that the argument -- along with his stands on Medicare and the environment -- is crucial to winning Florida's 25 electoral votes, and that those votes may determine the election.
He returned here today with recent polls contradictory. One tracking poll conducted for Reuters and MSNBC shows Mr. Gore with a lead of 12 percentage points in the state. A Los Angeles Times poll taken from Oct. 27 through 29, meanwhile, gave Mr. Bush a four-point advantage. Gore aides and state Democratic Party officials said they believed Mr. Gore had a lead of two to four points.
Mr. Bush, who took a bus tour across the state last week, is tentatively scheduled to return this weekend, and his running mate, Dick Cheney, traveled to four Florida cities today. Mr. Bush's parents -- former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara -- joined their son Jeb, the state's governor, at a rally in Orlando on Tuesday night.
Mr. Gore's aides do not preclude the possibility that the vice president will return for one last visit in the final two days of campaigning.
Both parties also have huge ground operations under way, involving millions of phone calls and mailings, and TV broadcasts are punctuated morning and night by streams of political commercials, many of them focusing on Social Security.
"In many ways," Mr. Gore said today, "Florida is the key to this race."
Mr. Lieberman made the same point to a crowd of 4,000 people at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. He paraphrased the song "New York, New York," by singing, "If we can win it here, we'll win it everywhere, it's up to you, Florida."
But plenty of Floridians remain undecided. One of them, Jim Tuten, a 46-year-old systems engineer, came to hear Mr. Gore at an afternoon rally in a downtown park in Tampa. A true swing voter who supported both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, Mr. Tuten said he was tempted to vote Democratic because he wanted the country to stay its economic course.
But he said he still did not have much of a feel for Mr. Gore. "I'm not sure about Gore because he's really been behind the scenes," Mr. Tuten said. "Other than the screwups he's had, like with the Internet, you didn't hear that much about him."
Mr. Tuten also said he was concerned that both parties were too eager to squander the federal surplus. "Each party has 50 different ways to spend it," he said.
Here in Tampa, where the singer Jimmy Buffett warmed up a substantial crowd for Mr. Gore, the vice president focused on environmental issues. "Everyone in Tampa Bay knows that Florida depends on clean beaches and clean air," he said. "While my opponent refuses to take a clear stand on this, I will. So let me pledge to you again, I will ban all new oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida and California."
And Mr. Gore again used his economic policies -- in this case his Social Security plan -- to suggest that he would have the backbone to stand up to special interests while Mr. Bush would not.
"Sometimes," he said, "a president has to stand up and say no so that our families can have a better life. I'm not running for president to go along and get along at any price. The presidency is really not just a popularity contest. If you want someone who smiles and looks the other way while special interests have their way, then I'm not your guy."
 
In His Own Words
AL GORE
 
Remarks yesterday in Kissimmee, Fla.:
 
"Instead of a system where everyone is in it together, the Bush plan would turn Social Security into a grab bag where everyone is out for himself. You might call it social insecurity. And that's wrong for our values. It's also wrong for our economy. Even though he has promised it to two different groups of people, we still don't know where the trillion dollars comes from in the first place. The money is nowhere to be found in his budget.
 One of the authors of Governor Bush's proposal wrote that Social Security would start borrowing heavily to make the program solvent under their approach. The borrowing would actually come to $3 trillion. In other words, under the other side's plan, according to one of its authors, Social Security would go bankrupt fairly soon and then go into massive deficits, competing for investment capital that is needed elsewhere in the economy, all while many of today's seniors are still counting on Social Security and a strong economy, both of which would be jeopardized under his plan.
Under our plan, Social Security will remain financially sound for more than 50 years . . . Join with me and we won't make new promises just to break them. We'll keep our promises to the seniors who gave us everything that we have today.
Seniors are not the only people who are counting on a secure retirement. And if you'll forgive me if I have a special place in my heart for middle-aged workers. They're working for two or three decades and have every intention of working some more. . . .
Today's middle-aged workers are the heart of our work force and the heart of family life in America. They're the ones who are often forced to choose between the needs of their children and the needs of their aging parents. They're the ones who bear the burdens, pay the taxes and live the American dream. And they should not have to worry whether Social Security will be there for them when they retire.
Under our plan, we therefore make the responsible choices by balancing the budget, paying down the debt and using the interest savings to strengthen Social Security."

HEADLINE: Yes to Transportation Bonds

 BODY:
New Yorkers will be doing more than electing hundreds of officeholders throughout the state on Tuesday. They will also have an opportunity to approve a $3.8 billion bond issue that, if enacted, would speed improvements in New York City's mass transit system and upgrade highways and rail links crucial to the upstate economy. Incurring new borrowing is not something to be done lightly by a state already heavily burdened by $37 billion in debt. But the projects to be financed by this issue are so crucial that a "yes" vote is merited.
Residents of New York City would reap an especially important advantage from the bond issue. The city's Independent Budget Office estimates that 44 percent of the proceeds would finance improvements in the city. Since the city represents about 40 percent of the state's population and provides about the same portion of its tax revenues, that proportion is a modest bargain. 
 The bond issue would help finance part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's $17 billion capital plan over the next five years, which is primarily aimed at completing the Long Island Rail Road access to Grand Central Terminal and a new Second Avenue subway from 125th Street to 63rd Street. Both projects are vital to relieving transit congestion in the city. The bond issue would also help finance the State Transportation Department's plans to improve rail lines and highways upstate and to speed development along the Erie Canal. The anemic upstate economy would benefit.
All these schemes have flaws. The M.T.A.'s $17 billion capital plan, for instance, would increase debt service payments and thus put more pressure on the transit fare. To meet transportation needs beyond the reach of this bond issue, the state should do more to tap its budget surpluses, especially now that another $1 billion surplus is expected in the budget for the year under way.
In addressing New York City's needs, the M.T.A. is also spending money to plan for several possibilities, including extension of the Second Avenue subway to lower Manhattan, a rail link from Midtown to La Guardia Airport and extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square down to 34th Street and over to the Hudson River, where it would connect with a possible stadium and an expanded Javits Convention Center. As this page has suggested in the past, the No. 7 line may well prove to be a higher priority than the La Guardia link or perhaps even the Second Avenue subway extension, especially if it can be seen to help develop the whole underused area on the West Side south of 42nd Street.
The transportation priorities outlined by Gov. George Pataki, the leaders of the Legislature and the M.T.A. are, in the end, well drawn up and sensitive to the region's needs. We conclude that the bond issue, if enacted, would address needs that are essential to the future economic health of the state.

HEADLINE: Offer of Free Computers for Schools Is Withdrawn

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, Plainfield High School in Central Village, Conn., signed up for a free computer lab from the ZapMe Corporation. The highflying company was promising to connect the nation's schools to the Internet, asking only to deliver advertising to the students' computer screens to pay the freight.
Last week, the Plainfield school superintendent got the bill. 
 An e-mail message from a company employee explained that times were tough for ZapMe, which had come under attack as a tool of commercialization in the schools and had experienced a drop in its stock to just over $2 from a high of $13.75. As a result, the superintendent was told, the company was quitting the free-computer business.
Starting in February, the message explained, "there will be a fee charged for the service and equipment." It said the school could go ahead and install the computers, wait until a price list arrived in November before making a decision or make arrangements for ZapMe to pick up the equipment.
"It was quite a shock," said the superintendent, Mary Conway. Her school had spent $4,000 to prepare a room for the computers -- a lot of money for Plainfield, which ranks 161st out of the state's 169 school districts in spending.
ZapMe says it has given millions of students access to the Internet in 2,000 schools nationwide; a total of 15,000 had signed up for the service. At its height last fall, ZapMe's stock was worth half a billion dollars; the company was emblematic of the new economy, a place where good deeds, vision and commerce form a single elegant braid.
Now it has all unraveled: ZapMe says it is refocusing on selling its technologies for high-speed Internet access and services via satellite to business. It says, meanwhile, that it is trying to find ways to keep the school network alive without forcing the schools to pay.
"We are exploring many opportunities," said the company's founder and chief executive, Lance Mortensen, "including -- but not limited to -- partnerships, the outright sale of the network, joint ventures and alternative options to schools that would allow them to keep the labs, which means, obviously, for pay."
The story of ZapMe and schools like Plainfield shows the ripple effects of the dot-com downturn that extend far beyond Silicon Valley and Alley. To its founders, ZapMe had a noble vision defeated by a handful of naysaying activists opposed to any commercialism in schools and ready to jump to conclusions about the company's use of data about the students' computer use. While schools were still eager to sign up, Mr. Mortensen said, the bad publicity worried potential advertisers "about having an association of their brand with our brand."
To its critics, ZapMe represented a bad idea that collapsed under its own weight. Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert, a group affiliated with Ralph Nader that opposes "excessive commercialism" in society, was involved in a public relations war that Mr. Mortensen cites as the key factor in his company's decline. Mr. Ruskin counters that "their business model of violating the privacy of children and forcing them to watch ads was a total flop."
Mr. Mortensen insists that he hopes to keep the service free to the schools through subsidies from business, foundations and government. "We're looking for people to adopt these schools," he said, but noted that ZapMe still had bills to pay. He said the company was spending about $3,000 a month on each of the smaller schools it served to pay off the equipment costs -- typically 5 to 15 computers -- and supply high-speed Internet connections.
"We personally anticipate, through a number of efforts, to get that cost discounted down," he said.
At first, ZapMe, based in San Ramon, Calif., made an offer that thousands of schools found too tempting to pass up: a complete computer lab with PC's, teacher training and access over high-speed satellite connections to a collection of 13,000 child-safe Web sites.
The company insists that while it reserved the contractual right to track students' surfing habits individually, it never gathered anything more than their age, sex and ZIP code -- information it then shared in aggregate form with advertisers. When the company announced a program called ZapPoints, which would have given students points toward prizes while gathering personally identifiable information about them, the outcry was so swift and loud that ZapMe quickly discontinued the idea.
Nancy Willard, a consultant at the University of Oregon's Center for Advanced Technology in Education, said the ZapPoints program was the company's fundamental flaw. "The ZapMe model was going to fail because of the level of commercial intrusion into the schools" required by the ZapPoints program, which was an essential part of reaching profitability, she said.
Mr. Mortensen said the e-mail message that Plainfield received was a mistake. "That's an action by one employee and not the corporation," he said. He did not deny that the company might ask for money to keep the program running but said "there would be no forced issue," since the company could simply pick up the PC's.
"We never gave the computers to the schools" outright, Mr. Mortensen said. And William R. Connon, a Hartford lawyer who represents the Plainfield Township schools, said the ZapMe contract gives the company the right to charge for its services or to take them back.
A half-dozen schools with existing labs contacted by a reporter said they had not heard from ZapMe about the future of their programs. Schools that have not yet received computers are also waiting to hear what ZapMe has in store. William G. Smojver, director of technology and information services for the school district of Waukesha, Wis., near Milwaukee, said he called the company recently to ask about the pending delivery of machines and was told that a letter would be going out soon describing the company's new policy. "We are fairly pessimistic about receiving anything," he said.
George Smith, director of technology for the Green Bay School District in Wisconsin, said he had not yet heard from ZapMe about the 45 computers the company had provided. He did say, however, that technical problems had limited the usefulness of the computer labs. "They can come pick 'em up and take 'em back," Mr. Smith said. "Nobody will shed a tear."

HEADLINE: Ralph Nader's High-Wire Politics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Nader Sees a Bright Side to a Bush Victory" (news article, Nov. 1): 
 A vote for Ralph Nader is a vote for George W. Bush, and as your article makes clear, Mr. Nader likes it that way.
It is false for Mr. Nader to say that Al Gore and George W. Bush are indistinguishable. They operate at opposite sides of the American mainstream. It is fantasy to think that a Bush administration would, by its conservative excesses, pave the way for a liberal comeback.
To speculate that by promoting political reaction now, one would reap political benefits later is a strategy for disaster. If Mr. Nader thinks people will forget that he has been willing to bring grave harm to this country, he is in for a big surprise.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Republican Declares Rival a Throwback on Fiscal Policy

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush sharply attacked Vice President Al Gore today as a Democratic throwback to an old era who would bring the nation "spending without discipline, spending without priorities and spending without an end." 
 With just six days left before Election Day, Mr. Bush stepped up his assault on Mr. Gore, seeking to sever him from the fiscal policies of the Clinton years and the nation's record economic expansion.
"Al Gore's massive spending would mean slower growth and higher taxes," Mr. Bush told thousands of people gathered here in an airport hangar on a foggy, drizzly day. "And it could mean an end to this nation's prosperity."
"These aren't the policies of the 1990's," he shouted hoarsely into a microphone, speaking under a banner proclaiming. "Bringing America Together." "These are the same policies that threatened our economy in the 70's. When Ronald Reagan changed those policies in the 80's, my opponent was there opposing him all the way."
Mr. Bush's decision to campaign in Minnesota, which is usually a reliable Democratic state in presidential elections, underscored the volatile nature of this race. Across the nation, polls show this to be potentially the tightest presidential contest in four decades, and those numbers have sent the candidates scrambling to states that have normally decided on a candidate by this time.
Mr. Bush, whose own record in Texas has come under relentless attack from Mr. Gore, reached back almost two decades to showcase votes that Mr. Gore cast as a member of Congress from Tennessee.
"In 1981, the vice president voted in favor of a 70 percent top income tax rate," Mr. Bush said, adding, "I want you to hear the facts."
He said that if Mr. Gore's "views had prevailed, a family of four, making $50,000 would pay three times more in federal income taxes than they pay today." And he said the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative research group, had rated Mr. Gore as a "big spender" 12 times while he was in Congress.
"Three of those times, he earned the worst rating of any member of Congress," Mr. Bush said to cheers, "and considering the competition, that's quite an achievement."
Playing off President Clinton's pledge when he was re-elected to find the "vital center" of American politics, Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore, "Just when progress on important issues seems within reach, he's left the vital center of American politics."
Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of proposing $2 trillion in new spending over 10 years but gave no clue as to how he had reached those figures. Aides later said he was relying on estimates by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and by the National Taxpayers Union and another private group, Citizens Against Government Waste.
The Gore camp dismissed the National Taxpayers Union as a "right-wing group." And Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, said: "Governor Bush continues to practice fuzzy math and displays fuzzy priorities. Bush's proposals would bankrupt the Social Security system, squander the surplus and risk our prosperity. That's not what a real leader does for America."
The Gore campaign says it has proposed $700 billion in new spending over 10 years.
Mr. Bush did not concentrate only on Mr. Gore's spending plans. He ridiculed the vice president's proposal for a tax cut of nearly $500 billion as full of "fine print," and he tried to tap into resentment of the Internal Revenue Service.
"Fine print creates more rules and regulations and bigger bureaucracies," he said. "It looks as if some in Washington are already preparing for the Gore tax plan: the I.R.S. just announced they are going to hire an additional 2,079 bureaucrats."
He then sought to wield Mr. Gore's own campaign mantra against him.
"My opponent talks about fighting for the people against the powerful," Mr. Bush said. "But it works out a little differently. In this case more audits for people, more power for the I.R.S."
Mr. Bush's presence here so close to Election Day was savored by local Republicans. Minnesota has supported the Democrat candidate in every presidential race since backing Richard M. Nixon in 1972. But it displayed a maverick streak with the election of a former professional wrestler, Jesse Ventura, as its governor and recent polls have shown the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, eating into Mr. Gore's liberal base.
A survey released by St. Cloud University last week portrayed the race in Minnesota as a tossup, with Mr. Gore at 39 percent, Mr. Bush at 38 percent and Mr. Nader at 10 percent.
Mr. Gore campaigned here last Saturday night, calling the state the "heart and soul of the Democratic Party." Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, one of the Senate's most liberal members, took the stage before Mr. Gore did and urged the thousands not to vote for Mr. Nader.
Yet even as Mr. Bush proclaimed he would win Minnesota, he had to fend off questions today about whether he was faltering in Florida, where his brother Jeb is the governor.
Asked about one recent poll that showed him substantially trailing Mr. Gore in Florida, Mr. Bush said, "I don't believe it."
Mark McKinnon, his media strategist, said the poll, by John Zogby, was flawed because it sampled people only in the daytime, a method he said could lead to skewed results by sampling too many retirees who were at home during the day.
While Mr. Bush emphasized spending and cutting taxes, the two tickets also kept up a battle over Social Security.
In advertisements and on the stump, Mr. Gore has homed in on the issue, saying Mr. Bush's plan to divert some Social Security taxes to individual investment accounts promises the same $1 trillion over 10 years to younger workers and to current retirees. Because the Social Security system essentially uses the payroll taxes of current workers to pay the benefits of retirees, any transition to private accounts has a temporary large financing gap, worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
The Bush campaign, which has fired back with its own advertisement challenging Mr. Gore's credibility, argues that $2.4 trillion in surplus Social Security revenue will provide enough money over the next decade to permit about two percentage points of the payroll taxes to be used for younger workers to create private accounts.
Mr. Bush criticized his opponent over the issue, saying Mr. Gore offered "an old and tired approach" to the looming financial troubles of Social Security.
And his running mate, Dick Cheney, today enlisted his Persian Gulf war colleague, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, to try to convince elderly voters that the Republican proposal to privatize part of the Social Security system would not endanger their benefits.
General Schwarzkopf, who, at 66, was introduced as a "senior American," described the debate over the pension system in militant terms.
"I enlist all of you in the battle that we're about to wage," he said at a rally in Punta Gorda, Fla. "We're going to replace a campaign of fear with a counterattack of the truth."
 
In His Own Words
GEORGE W. BUSH
 
Remarks yesterday in Minneapolis:
 
"Vice President Gore offers an old and tired approach. He offers a new federal spending program to nearly every voting bloc. He expands entitlements, without reforms to sustain them.
 And when others, Republican or Democrat, propose needed reform in Social Security, Medicare or education, he opposes and attacks and demonizes them. Just when progress on important issues seems within reach, he's left the vital center of American politics.
Until recently, I didn't even have to point all this out. He was out there claiming credit for all this new spending. But lately he's been backpedaling. Even with these 285 new or expanded programs, he says he is committed to cutting government. He says he won't hire even one new government employee.
Think about that. Two hundred and eighty-five new or expanded programs, and $2 trillion more in new spending - and not one new bureaucrat to file the forms or answer the phones. Let me tell you what I think: I think he might be exaggerating.
And it's not the first time. He says his efforts at 'reinventing' government have substantially reduced the federal work force. But this week, Newsweek magazine calls that claim 'misleading.' The magazine concludes that the vast majority of reductions came from 'military downsizing.'
You might call that short-sighted. You might call that unwise. But you can't call it 'reinventing government."'

HEADLINE: Entertainment Web Venture Expects Layoffs

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Urban Box Office Network, one of the largest Internet companies specializing in hip-hop and Latino entertainment, appears headed for the expanding dot-com graveyard.
The company plans to lay off between 70 percent and all of its 300 employees by tomorrow, said Adam Kidron, the chief executive of the network. He said an anticipated investment from a Texas venture capital company had fallen through. 
 "We might be out of business by Friday," Mr. Kidron said.
The venture capital company, Interfase Capital of Austin, said it was willing to provide interim financing but could not support a business that was losing nearly $1 million a week. Mr. Kidron did not deny the company's "burn rate" was that high but said it was immaterial to the financing agreement. Mr. Kidron said a total of $34 million had been invested in the company so far.
Aside from the loss of jobs, the collapse of Urban Box Office would be a setback for economic development efforts in Harlem. The company had put together a separate package of public and private financing for a $12 million renovation of a building at Amsterdam Avenue and 126th Street and was planning to move there next year from its offices at 31st Street and Seventh Avenue.
Mr. Kidron said the company had counted on a total of $35 million to $50 million from Interfase and other investors. He accused Interfase of reneging on its commitment to provide $20 million of the total.
Interfase officials, however, said they withdrew their financing offer in part because Urban Box Office had failed to meet a requirement that it establish strategic partnerships with other, larger companies. Urban Box Office officials said they had forged a couple of alliances with such companies but were not able to identify them publicly at this point.
In some ways, Urban Box Office has been fighting an uphill battle since February.
Mr. Kidron came up with the idea for a Web portal linking several sites for urban music, entertainment and information. But during its first year of development, the company was more closely associated with George Jackson, the former Hollywood producer and record company executive who helped found the company with Mr. Kidron, a longtime British music industry producer, and Frank Cooper, former vice president for business affairs at Def Jam Recordings.
But on Feb. 10, just as the company was about to start its first major Web site, Mr. Jackson, 42, died of a stroke.
In recent months, Mr. Kidron said, Urban Box Office had come into its own. The number of visits to its Web sites had quadrupled since July, and the company was about to sign an advertising agreement with Pepsi-Cola. But 25 employees were laid off after IndiePlanet.com, one of the Web sites, failed to catch on, he said.
People drawn to so-called urban entertainment have plenty to choose from on the Internet, including such sites as Hookt.com, Volume.com, Bet.com and 360hiphop.com. But Urban Box Office Network planned a wide array of original content, including situation comedies, dramatic series, talk shows and animation.

NEW YORK CITY ECONOMY GROWING

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
Although the national economy appears to be slowing, business conditions in New York continue to improve, according to several economic reports released yesterday. A periodic survey of economic conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank, informally known as the beige book, reported that inflationary pressures in New York were waning and that the "economy has shown few, if any, signs of slowing." And the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that New York City had added far more new jobs -- 101,000 -- than any other metropolitan area in the country during the last 12 months.

Ring Lardner Jr., whose satirical screenplays twice won the Academy Award but whose career collapsed in 1947 after he refused to tell Congress if he had ever been a Communist, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 85.
Mr. Lardner was the last surviving son of Ring Lardner, the baseball writer, humorist and short-story author. He was also the last surviving member of the Hollywood 10, the blacklisted group of writers, directors and producers who were sent to Federal prison in 1950 for terms ranging from five months to a year because they all refused to tell the House Un-American Activities Committee if they were or ever had been members of the Communist Party or if they knew of any Hollywood colleagues who were. 
 Ring Lardner Jr. shared an Academy Award for best original screenplay with Michael Kanin in 1942 for "Woman of the Year," a comedy that marked the first teaming of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. In 1970 he forcefully re-established himself with an Oscar for best screenplay for "M*A*S*H," which was based on Richard Hooker's novel about an irreverent Army medical unit during the Korean war. These two movies were at either end of a lengthy period between 1947 and the early 1960's when Mr. Lardner found it difficult to get work in Hollywood under his own name.
In 1947 Mr. Lardner was an unrepentant and fiercely outspoken witness when he was interrogated by the committee's chairman, the famously aggressive J. Parnell Thomas, Republican of New Jersey. Mr. Lardner was, in fact, a Communist, but he refused to answer Thomas because he felt that his political leanings were none of the government's business.
 
'I'd Hate Myself In the Morning'
At one point Thomas demanded to know if Mr. Lardner was or ever had been a Communist. Mr. Lardner started to reply, then hesitated.
"It is a very simple question," the congressman said sharply. "Anybody would be proud to answer it -- any real American would be proud to answer the question, 'Are you or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?' "
"I could answer the question exactly the way you want," Mr. Lardner replied, "but if I did, I would hate myself in the morning." An angry Thomas had him removed from the witness stand.
In late 1947, 20th Century-Fox, which had been paying Mr. Lardner $2,000 a week, announced that "his employment with the company has been terminated." Two weeks after that, Mr. Lardner and the nine others who refused to answer were indicted and subsequently convicted of contempt of Congress.
Lawyers for the Hollywood 10 succeeded in getting the court to agree to procedural delays, but all their ploys were unsuccessful in protecting their clients, who, in addition to Mr. Lardner, were Albert Maltz, Dalton Trumbo, Samuel Ornitz, John Howard Lawson, Herbert Biberman, Adrian Scott, Lester Cole, Alvah Bessie and Edward Dmytryk. There were many others in Hollywood who also ran afoul of the committee, and they were blacklisted, too. Of the Hollywood 10, only Mr. Dmytryk, after serving his jail term, named names. Mr. Dmytryk, deciding he was making a martyr of himself for an ideology in which he no longer believed, went on to cooperate with the committee, salvaging his directing career.
Mr. Lardner was sentenced to a year in the federal prison at Danbury, Conn. As the time approached when he had to turn himself in, he put his house in Santa Monica, Calif., up for sale and attracted buyers with an advertisement that carried the caption "Owner Going to Jail." He said he took a $9,000 loss on the house, which was purchased by a physician.
But by the time he began to serve what turned out to be a little more than nine months in 1950, he learned that Congressman Thomas was also imprisoned in Danbury after his conviction on defrauding the Government by putting fictitious workers on his Congressional payroll. They "became reacquainted," he wrote later.
After Mr. Lardner left prison, he accepted his forced unemployment with laconic wit. As a nonworking writer, he said, "My tennis game improved, my wife conceived and bore another child, making five for whose rearing and education I was financially responsible." Some of his less fortunate former colleagues, he said, went into carpentry, selling women's clothes, bartending, driving a school bus and waiting on tables. He did none of these things, searched for writing assignments and thought the whole thing "would blow over like other periodic tempests in the movie business."
But it did not blow over and Mr. Lardner found himself working briefly in Mexico, in New York and in London, writing television series in the late 1950's and early 60's, the best known of which was "The Adventures of Robin Hood," starring Richard Greene. The show was produced in London and sold to American networks.
During this period, Mr. Lardner used several pen names to conceal his identity, including that of Oliver Skene. On one occasion, in 1958, he used the name Philip Rush as the credit on a movie he wrote for Sidney Poitier called "Virgin Island," and was quite chagrined when a British historian of the same name turned up and sent a tart letter to The Times of London, saying that he had absolutely nothing to do with the movie.
Some people in Hollywood tried to help Mr. Lardner. In the early 1960's, the producer and director Otto Preminger was criticized by the American Legion and other groups after he hired Mr. Lardner to adapt "Genius," a novel by Patrick Dennis, for the screen. The project was ultimately shelved.
During the same time period Mr. Lardner collaborated with Ian Hunter on several projects, including "Foxy," a Bert Lahr musical that failed on Broadway. Mr. Lardner did have some success, however, as the author, with Terry Southern, of the 1965 movie "The Cincinnati Kid," which starred Steve McQueen and Edward G. Robinson.
Among Mr. Lardner's other screen projects, either as author or co-author, were "Meet Dr. Christian" (1939); "Courageous Dr. Christian" (1940); "The Cross of Lorraine" (1943); "Tomorrow the World" (1944); "Cloak and Dagger" (1946) and "Forever Amber" (1947). Among the screenplays he either wrote or contributed to under pseudonyms were "The Forbidden Street" (1949) and "Four Days Leave" (1950). One of the other screenplays he wrote after the blacklist was "The Greatest" (1977), starring Muhammad Ali.
Ringgold Wilmer Lardner Jr. was born in Chicago on Aug. 15, 1915, one of four sons born to Ring Lardner and the former Ellis Abbott. The other three sons, James, David and John, also became writers but died relatively young. James, 24, fought and died in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer with the Lincoln Brigade. David, 25, was killed by a land mine in Germany while covering the World War II battleground for The New Yorker. John, 47, a critic and journalist, died of a heart attack in 1960.
Mr. Lardner's first byline appeared in 1919, when he was just 4 years old. It was a travel story called "The Young Immigrunts" but it was really written by his father and described the family angst of a cross-country trip by automobile.
 
Introduced To David O. Selznick
When Mr. Lardner was about 6, his family moved to Greenwich, Conn., and then to Great Neck, on Long Island, where neighbors or regular visitors included the journalists Herbert Bayard Swope, Grantland Rice and Heywood Broun, the authors H. L. Mencken, Dorothy Parker and Alexander Woolcott and the composer and critic Deems Taylor. Mr. Lardner was naturally a left-handed person, but his parents instructed him to write and eat with his right hand. He thought this probably caused him to develop a stutter as a child.
He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and went to Princeton, where he joined the Socialist Club. After his sophomore year, he sailed to Hamburg, where he caught a train to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Anglo-American Institute of the University of Moscow, a center established to encourage young Americans to support the Soviet system. Young Lardner was won over. He returned to New York and in 1935 got a job working for Stanley Walker, then editor of The Daily Mirror. He did not remain there long. His roommate at Princeton had been Herbert Bayard Swope Jr., whose father, a former executive editor of The New York World, introduced him to David O. Selznick, who was then in the process of starting his own movie company.
At first, Mr. Lardner was assigned to work with Mr. Selznick's publicity director. But after a year or so passed, Mr. Selznick asked Mr. Lardner and a co-worker, Budd Schulberg, a reader in the story department, to rewrite some scenes for a new movie featuring Fredric March and Janet Gaynor. It was called "A Star Is Born" and it already had four writers assigned to it full-time. The pair is credited with the famous line at the end of the film, "This is Mrs. Norman Maine speaking." Mr. Selznick liked their work and said that the two should consider themselves scriptwriters.
Not all Mr. Lardner's judgments were wise ones, however. Mr. Selznick asked his secretary, Sylvia Schulman, and Mr. Lardner, who was dating Miss Schulman (and later married her ) if they would read Margaret Mitchell 's novel "Gone With the Wind.' and tell him if they thought it was good enough to be made into a movie. Miss Schulman gave it an enthusiastic "yes," but Mr. Lardner thought that "Gone With the Wind" had no future as a movie.
By 1937 Mr. Lardner, he would later recall, had been recruited by the Communist Party in Hollywood and was attending a Marxist study group and similar meetings four nights a week. In time he became a member of such groups as the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, the Citizens Committee for the Defense of Mexican-American Youth, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Against the War. He also served on the board of the Screen Writers Guild.
In 1941 he got an important boost to his career when the writer Garson Kanin gave Miss Hepburn a story called "Woman of the Year," which Mr. Kanin's brother, Michael, had written with Mr. Lardner. Miss Hepburn liked it so much that she went to Louis B. Mayer at MGM, and said she wanted to play the title role, a world famous political commentator who gets such a comeuppance from a sportswriter (played by Spencer Tracy) that she marries him. Miss Hepburn demanded $200,000 for the story, took $100,000 for herself, and gave the rest to Mr. Kanin and Mr. Lardner. Their script received an Academy Award in 1942; since then "Woman of the Year" has been turned into a successful Broadway musical and another film in 1976.
During World War II, Mr. Lardner served in the Army Signal Corps and was sent not into battle but to Astoria, Queens, where he spent most of his military career writing the script for a training film.
 
Credit, of Course, For M*A*S*H
Mr. Lardner felt that for him, if not for all the other members of the Hollywood 10, the blacklist ended at some point in the 1960's and there was no question about his receiving credit for the work he did on "M*A*S*H." After "M*A*S*H" proved to be a big moneymaker, he was asked if he thought it could be adapted for television. He said that "M*A*S*H" had no future as a television show. (It became one of television's most successful series, from 1972-83.)
In 1981 Mr. Lardner turned from screenwriting to concentrate on books. In addition to "The Lardners: My Family Remembered," he was the author of two novels, "The Ecstasy of Owen Muir" and "All For Love." His final book, "I'd Hate Myself in the Morning" (Nation Books), a memoir, is scheduled for publication in January.
Mr. Lardner's marriage to Miss Schulman ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Frances Chaney, his brother David's widow, whom he married in 1946. Also surviving are three sons, Peter, of St. Augustine, Fla., James, of New York, and Joseph, of Los Angeles; two daughters, Ann Waswo of Oxford, England, and Katharine, of New York; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Joseph and Katharine were Ms. Chaney's children from her marriage to David Lardner.
Although Mr. Lardner allowed his Communist Party membership to lapse in the 1950's, he returned to Moscow in 1987 and told Philip Taubman of The New York Times, "I've never regretted my association with Communism. I still think that some form of socialism is a more rational way to organize a society, but I recognize it hasn't worked anywhere yet." Mr. Lardner wrote in his final book that he never wanted the United States to be remodeled along Soviet lines and always believed in the democratic process.
The House inquiry into suspected disloyalty in Hollywood left some of its victims bitter and angry that some of their colleagues, like the writer Budd Schulberg, co-operated with the committee.
One day, Mr. Lardner, accompanied by his wife, Miss Chaney, encountered Mr. Schulberg in a restaurant. Mrs. Lardner looked the other way because she did not want to talk to an informer. But Mr. Lardner took the hand of his old friend and co-worker and shook it. "I shake hands with anybody," he said. "I don't believe in blacklisting."

HEADLINE: Clinton Now Running on Husband's Record

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., Nov. 2

 BODY:
Moving into the final leg of her campaign for Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton sprinted from Buffalo to Manhattan to Long Island today, trying to do in New York State what Al Gore has studiously avoided doing across the nation: run on the record of the Clinton administration.
Looking fatigued and swigging bottled water to fight a dry cough, Mrs. Clinton disparaged Representative Rick A. Lazio at every opportunity, describing her opponent's campaign as "a charade" intended to hide what she called his conservative and caustic ideology. But even as she attacked Mr. Lazio today for running a "campaign of insults," she released the latest in a parade of notably negative advertisements, this one featuring a clip of Mr. Lazio confronting her in their first debate, demanding that she sign an agreement on campaign financing. 
 At a moment in campaigns that politicians typically use to sum up the case for their candidacy, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly returned today to the record of her husband's years as president. While she was sparing in mentioning the president himself, her eagerness to affix her fortunes to his administration during the most-watched stretch of a campaign contrasted sharply with Mr. Gore, the other Democrat who has been seeking to emerge from Mr. Clinton's shadow and has not wanted the president to campaign with him.
"We've had eight good years: people are working, people are employed, people are buying homes, unemployment is down, and I think the Clinton-Gore administration has done a darn good job on the economy," the first lady shouted, her voice hoarse, at a raucous labor rally at a hall in the Manhattan Center on West 34th Street. "My opponent is saying eight years is enough. I don't know what planet he's on, but I think that eight years has not been enough."
"I remember what it was like in 1992 -- it has taken eight years to get this country going in the right direction," Mrs. Clinton said. She got so wrapped up that she even invoked the signature theme of her husband's 1992 campaign, telling an audience of students to "put people first."
Mrs. Clinton's aides said today that the president would come to New York to attend three get-out-the-vote rallies Saturday, in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem. Mrs. Clinton will not be with him at those rallies, though an aide said they might well make several joint appearances before Tuesday. Mr. Clinton also plans to be in New York on Tuesday to listen to the election returns with his wife.
Mrs. Clinton's remarks came on a day when both candidates moved into a high gear of campaigning, each setting a frenetic pace -- in their travels, the release of new advertisements, and a seemingly endless parade of e-mail attacks -- that aides to both said would continue through Monday. And once again, much of the battle was engaged upstate.
Mrs. Clinton also moved to take advantage of what her aides argued was a mistake by Mr. Lazio, whose campaign released and then pulled back a radio advertisement that attacked her support of the Kyoto treaty on global warming. The advertisement, which was broadcast only upstate, described the pact as "radical" and suggested that it would cost jobs in a part of the state where the economy has had some difficulty.
Mr. Lazio dropped the advertisement under pressure from environmental groups, and amid concern by some Republicans that the episode could undercut his effort to present himself as a moderate Republican. Mrs. Clinton mentioned the incident today as she said Mr. Lazio was running a negative campaign and had "no plan" to address economic problems upstate.
"My opponent has no plan to bring and attract and keep good jobs here in upstate New York," she said. "And in the absence of a plan, which he has been promising for a week, he put up a misleading and inaccurate radio ad as a smoke screen to try to cover up the fact that he has no plan for the upstate economy."
Even as she attacked Mr. Lazio for attacking her, her campaign released one of the toughest advertisements of the contest, including a clip of the moment in which Mr. Lazio walked from his lectern over to hers during their debate in Buffalo and demanded that she sign a written agreement restricting use of soft money in the campaign. "Right here, right here, sign it," Mr. Lazio is shown saying to Mrs. Clinton.
The confrontational scene was repeatedly played on television at the time, and aides to both candidates believe that it hurt him, particularly among women.
Mrs. Clinton learned of a bombing in Jerusalem while touring a supermarket warehouse in Buffalo. She retired to a private office and spoke on the telephone before coming out and condemning the attack and calling on Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to put back in jail the terrorists he had freed in recent weeks.
Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had no idea whether any of those people were involved in the bombing but said, "It just makes common sense that if you are committed to ending violence and terrorism, you would not let out of prison people who are known to be terrorists."
Mrs. Clinton's repeated efforts today to run on the Clinton administration's record came after 16 months in which she has often seemed unsure about how closely to associate herself with a politician who remains one of the most popular Democrats with New York voters. Mr. Clinton has been only an occasional visitor to New York since she started her campaign.
But today, speaking to union members, the most solid kind of Democratic audiences, the first lady shed any ambivalence about the association. "I'm proud of the fact that I am committed to continuing the policies of the past eight years," she said.

HEADLINE: MARATHON 2000;
Distance Runners No Longer Lonely

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Just after his daily 6 a.m. bargaining session with the snooze button, and before his desk job would begin hours later, Josh Cox would start a 10-mile training run by quickly summoning his matador instincts.
As he trotted along the shoulder of San Diego's Highway 54 during part of his route, he was faced with the snorting tractor-trailers and charging cars that wind-whipped his body. Sometimes, he could sidestep peril. Other times, he would find himself ensnared on a hood ornament. 
 "It happened a few times; and once I ended up on top of a hood, looking at a lady through her windshield," Cox said. "She was turning right, and I thought we had made eye contact. Obviously, we didn't. Luckily, I was all right."
There was no one to warn Cox, no training partners to shout, "Watch out," and no safer place for him to run. In many ways, Cox was the typical American marathoner: a solo act, running at his own risk.
But in a new effort to regenerate this fading class of athlete in the United States, and restore American prominence in a sport in which Americans have experienced a free-fall since the 80's, Gabriele Rosa has set up the same kind of program he has used to turn unknown Kenyans into marathon icons. In August, Rosa selected Cox as one of six men and three women to move to a training site financed by the apparel company Fila in Mount Laguna, Calif., where they are free to focus only on running.
If the program succeeds, the crowds that watch the New York City Marathon will soon have an American to cheer on to victory. For now, Sunday's field will still belong to the Kenyans, the Mexicans and the Ethiopians.
"What I'm trying to do is begin a new strategy in America," said Rosa, a medical doctor and Italian coach who has trained several elite runners who will compete in Sunday's marathon, including Kenya's Japhet Kosgei. "It's not easy for Americans. The athletes like to enjoy outside things and want to have girlfriends and stay out, too. So it's a difficult situation.
"In Kenya, it's a different social and economic atmosphere. At first, I wasn't sure if this idea would work in America. But now, I think it can. There's only one way to reproduce the mentality and philosophy and the mission of running. This program is the way."
Rosa's approach is simple in design: create the perfect setting to succeed. The Fila training facility is about 50 miles east of San Diego, at an elevation of 6,000 feet, which mirrors the terrain of Kenya. There are cabins that house two runners each, chefs from the Job Corps who cook up the 6,000 calorie-a-day diets for the athletes, and a high-mileage regimen that has already produced results.
The 25-year-old Cox finished 10th in the Chicago Marathon last month, beating his personal-best time by more than five minutes, finishing in 2 hours 13 minutes 55 seconds.
"Before I came to the camp, my high mileage building up to the Olympic trials was 135 in a week, and I probably averaged 110," Cox said. "Now, 135, that's a normal week at camp."
If he hadn't run in Chicago -- an event that annually depletes the New York field -- Cox would probably be the first American to cross the finish line on Sunday. So there is hope for the future -- particularly with other training facilities like Rosa's starting to pop up in other parts of the country -- and there is also motivation for American marathoners like Cox.
On one wall of his cabin, next to the calendars and posters, Cox has taped an article as an inspirational reminder of his purpose.
"In a magazine on the West Coast, they put out an article about why we were so terrible," Cox said. "It was about American distance running. Personally, I'm tired of hearing how we're behind, how we're slow. Yeah, we are behind right now. But I can't worry about what everyone else is doing. I can only worry about myself. I know there are critics out there saying Americans don't work hard enough. I'm doing everything I know how to do. I would put Dr. Rosa's program up against what anyone else in the world is doing. If they say we're not working hard, they can come up to camp and follow us around for two weeks.
"I have that article on the wall to remind me to stay motivated. When it's all said and done, I want to know that whatever God gave me when I was born, I want to be able to multiply that gift by as much as I can."
Now, he has a support system to do it. When the alarm jars his senses at 6 a.m., he hustles out the door, knowing there are five other runners waiting on him. When he doesn't feel he can squeeze another mile out of his body, he has training partners to push him. When he runs the trails that wind around Mount Laguna, he can focus on the path, not the perils of Highway 54.
"On Mount Laguna, the biggest thing we have to wait for is the cows to go by in the pasture," Cox said. "You get a stampede of those once in a while. Other than that, it's smooth sailing."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
IN STRATEGY SHIFT, GORE ADS QUESTION BUSH'S CAPABILITY

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 2

 BODY:
In a late shift in his advertising strategy, Vice President Al Gore sought to heighten anxieties about Gov. George W. Bush today by broadcasting a tough new advertisement that bluntly questions whether Mr. Bush is "ready to lead America."
The new commercial, which criticizes Mr. Bush's Texas record on the environment, health care and the minimum wage, and attacks his proposals on Social Security, is scheduled to run often in all 17 battleground states where Mr. Gore is advertising. In most of those states, it will constitute half of the campaign's advertising in the final five days of what remains an intensely competitive race. 
 The end-game maneuver came on a day when the vice president drew the largest crowd of his campaign at a center city rally in Chicago, a Democratic stronghold in a state that had been leaning to Mr. Gore but where the race now seems to have tightened.
Speaking to a crowd that filled Daley Plaza and flowed over into surrounding streets, Mr. Gore used his remarks to paint Mr. Bush as a captive of special interests and portrayed himself as a fighter with the backbone to stand up for working families.
"I believe the presidency is not just a popularity contest," Mr. Gore said as the cheers of the crowd echoed off the surrounding skyscrapers. "I believe it is a day-by-day fight for real people who face real challenges. And you know what, I can say no to special interests with a smile."
Mr. Gore said that millions of dollars had been invested in the 2000 race "to try to put the special interests in charge." But on one day every four years, "you have the power," he said. "That day is dignity day."
Mr. Gore roared through a break-neck schedule spanning 18 1/2 hours and 4 states, including Illinois, which was once considered a safe bet for him but where tracking polls now show a very close race. Police officials estimated the crowd in Chicago at 51,000 people. Buying hours by crossing time zones, Mr. Gore also spoke today in Scranton, Pa., and Las Cruces, N.M., and planned to end his day at 1:30 a.m. Friday in Kansas City, Mo.
At each stop, Mr. Gore repeatedly drew contrasts between himself and Mr. Bush. But his most powerful message was delivered in the advertisement, the timing of which was debated for days within the Gore headquarters in Nashville.
Only Wednesday, the campaign released another Gore advertisement that focused on admirable chapters of the vice president's biography, like his service in Vietnam, and promoted his "experience, vision, values." But with the race still quite close, his strategists concluded that they had to put some advertising might behind their efforts to raise doubts about Mr. Bush.
In the last two weeks, that case has been made with escalating force by Gore surrogates, initially by members of Congress and then by his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, in television interviews on Sunday.
But Mr. Gore, who has pledged not to make personal attacks, had avoided directly questioning Mr. Bush's capacity to lead in either his speeches or his advertising.
Mr. Gore's Chicago rally was held at the downtown square named for former Mayor Richard J. Daley, the father of the current mayor, Richard M. Daley, and of Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley.
The Gore campaign built the crowd with the organizing skills of the Daley brothers and with significant help from trade unions in this traditionally Democratic city with its reliable Democratic power structure. It did not hurt that Stevie Wonder and Hootie and the Blowfish performed as opening acts, continuing the Gore campaign's practice of summoning crowds with heavily amplified popular music .
Waving the Gore-Lieberman campaign's distinctive blue placards, as well as inflatable red hands, the throng packed in against police barricades and flowed over into surrounding streets as office workers peered down through the windows of surrounding buildings.
The crowd estimate was provided by Deputy Chief Dennis Lesniak of the Chicago police, which is controlled by Mayor Daley.
In Scranton this morning, Mr. Gore summarized his policy agenda and his distinctions from Mr. Bush in an address at an auditorium at Lackawanna Junior College. Normally at such an event, Mr. Gore would enter the stage from the wings, but today he chose to walk down an aisle as heroic music swelled and the crowd chanted "We want Al." The campaign placed people wearing veterans' caps, doctors' lab coats and hard hats on risers to his side.
Mr. Gore, who has been urged by some Democrats to make a stronger case for the achievements of the administration of which he was such a crucial part for eight years, began by detailing what he called the economic successes of the Clinton team.
"Now the question before us is where do we go from here," he said, his tone confident and firm. "What will we do with our prosperity? Well, I want to put it to work for you, the hard-working families of this country and make sure you get your fair share of the pie."
Mr. Bush, he said, "has a very different view. He wants to change the very best things about the economic course we're on. He wants to go back."
Mr. Gore added: "I have a simple message. We have worked too hard on this economy to put it all at risk."
Mr. Gore then went on to question Mr. Bush's proposals on tax cuts, education, health care, Social Security and the environment.
After outlining each policy distinction, Mr. Gore announced: "The choice is yours and it's on the ballot on Tuesday."
The script of Mr. Gore's new advertisement makes a similar point. As the screen shows images of a sheepish Mr. Bush along with pictures of oil wells, a smoggy city and a woman caring for a sick child, a narrator says:
"As governor, George W. Bush gave big oil a tax break while opposing health care for 220,000 kids. Texas now ranks 50th in family health care. He's left the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour, Let polluters police themselves. Today Texas ranks last in air quality. Now Bush promises the same $1 trillion from Social Security to two different groups. He squanders the surplus on a tax cut for those making over $300,000. Is he ready to lead America?"
"It's clearly obvious the worse Al Gore does in the polls, the more negative he gets," said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman.
The advertisement began running in what campaign aides called "a very substantial buy." In most places, it will run in rotation with the new advertisement about Mr. Gore's experience and a third advertisement criticizing Mr. Bush's Social Security plans. The Gore campaign plans to spend $7 million on television advertising until the election Tuesday. The Democratic National Committee is spending $9 million on advertising this week, with much of that sum also devoted to attacking Mr. Bush on Social Security.
Mark D. Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager for communications, said there was never much internal debate over whether to run the new advertisement, but that there was significant discussion about timing. The advertisement became viable, he said, after Mr. Bush acknowledged in the last debate that his proposal to partly privatize Social Security would draw $1 trillion from the current system; after he suggested 10 days ago that NATO forces be withdrawn from the Balkans; and after the Bush campaign began broadcasting an advertisement this week that harshly questioned Mr. Gore's truthfulness.
"I think people, not just in the Gore campaign but in the country, have known for a while," he said, "that Bush's readiness to lead has been the elephant in the room for this entire election."

HEADLINE: City to Charge Truck Drivers For Parking

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Saying that traffic has brought many Midtown streets to a near standstill, the city has decided for the first time to charge delivery trucks for parking when they are loading and unloading around Times Square.
The plan is a first strike in a new battle to impose order on the city's most chaotic streets, ones that have confounded city planners for years. To drivers, the streets are an all-too-familiar trial: trucks parked and double-parked, many following no discernible rules and others that are not making deliveries at all. 
 Truckers like Robert Arias agree that traffic is a nightmare, but say that it will take nothing short of a revolution to improve it. "I don't see anything working," Mr. Arias said yesterday, sitting in his private mail delivery truck. "All I want to know," he asked, "is who's going to pay me for paying to park?"
But the plan, which will go into effect on Nov. 13, is intended to accomplish much more than extracting quarters from commercial drivers in loading zones. It will be the city's first attempt -- and the first of its kind in the country, experts say -- to use an economic idea called congestion pricing to control commercial parking by varying the rates depending on the time of day.
The carrot-and-stick approach is now used on the New Jersey Turnpike, and on toll roads in California and other states to discourage driving during rush hours: higher tolls are charged for cars during peak hours. Variable parking rates, depending on the time of day and the duration of the parking, have also been used in Europe, but not in the United States, experts said.
The city's pilot plan, which will last for a year and half, will use computerized parking meters recently installed in Midtown that print receipts after coins or debit cards are inserted. The receipts are placed on the dashboards of cars or trucks, showing ticket agents how much parking time has been bought.
Between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., the busiest hours of the day, truckers making deliveries between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, from West 43rd to West 48th Street, excluding 47th Street (where, generally, "no standing" rules apply), will have to feed these meters. And they will have to pay for spaces that they have long been able to grab for free, if they could find them.
Parking prices in the loading zones will escalate -- $1 for one hour, $3 for two hours and $6 for three hours -- to encourage shorter use of the spaces, city officials said. The spaces will remain free all other hours, to encourage deliveries at night or in the early morning.
Iris Weinshall, the city's new transportation commissioner, said the loading zones, where trucks have generally been allowed to park for up to three hours, had become de facto long-term truck parking on many streets. Because police enforcement has often been lax, some spots are occupied all day by cars and vans that have commercial license plates, but do not make deliveries.
This sometimes forces truckers making deliveries to circle blocks again and again, adding to the congestion. Many truckers give up and double-park, which clogs the streets even more and spreads congestion outside the Times Square area.
"The economy is changing," Ms. Weinshall said. "More people are buying things on the Web; more things have to be delivered. And I can't expand the streets. So instead, we're trying to move the spots over more and more by making a financial incentive to the trucks to make their deliveries and leave faster."
Ms. Weinshall emphasized that the parking plan was only an experiment. The Police Department has agreed to strictly enforce the new rules and to help the transportation department collect information on whether it is actually changing parking patterns in the areas.
"This is not cast in stone, and we will change it if we need to," Ms. Weinshall said. "Every place I go now, people talk to me about this concept of congestion pricing, and we just don't have any empirical data in New York to know whether it will work or not."
The idea, which has been discussed seriously by city officials, civic groups and the business community since at least 1995, was applauded yesterday by longtime critics of the city's transportation policies.
"This is a really important step forward for transportation planning in New York City," said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a cyclist and pedestrian rights group. "It's an extremely rational use of a scarce resource -- curb space -- and I would expect it to work extremely well."
Others were not as enthusiastic.
Douglas Durst, a major commercial landlord in the area, said he appreciated the effort. But, he said, "I don't think this is really going to alleviate the traffic problems in Times Square. The major culprit is not the trucks. The major problem is private cars, and the city must at some point look into regulating private cars in this part of the city."
Earnest Rice, the community relations manager for Manhattan for the United Parcel Service, said he thought the new system might help the company avoid some of the approximately $2 million in ticketing and towing charges that it pays every year in the city. But he said a $6 charge for three hours was not steep enough to encourage truckers to move sooner.
In addition, he said, some delivery trucks, including many U.P.S. trucks, have legitimate reasons for staying in spots longer than three hours.
"I think it's a great idea to try," Mr. Rice said. "I would agree with trying anything because it's so bad out there right now."
Others also pointed out that unless the police department monitors the plan closely, it will be possible for drivers to skirt it, just as they do other parking regulations. For example, drivers could return to their trucks every hour to replace one-hour receipts with new ones; in that way they could park for three hours, but pay $3 instead of $6. Or they could stay longer than three hours by replacing a three-hour receipt with a new one.
"It will happen, you know?" Mr. Arias said yesterday. "It's a big game out here and everybody's hustling one way or another."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman). 

 "GIORGIO ARMANI," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 17). The Guggenheim has served up another plateau of urban history: a retrospective of the Milanese fashion designer Giorgio Armani. What it lacks in depth it makes up for with sparkle, and Robert Wilson's architectural transformation of the museum's rotunda may be the best yet. In an inverted version of a life class, instead of the undraped body, the show offers just the drapes. The mannequins have been pared down to the edges of the costumes, and they cluster in groups in the building's structural bays, spatial modules with the proportions of shop windows. Hours and admission: See above (Herbert Muschamp).
 
 * "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that to anyone who doesn't know Chinese can seem unapproachable. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students 12 and older and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
 "AN ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLK ART: CYRIL I. NELSON'S GIFTS TO THE MUSEUM OF AMERICAN FOLK ART," 2 Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Jan. 7). This show celebrates the largess of Mr. Nelson, a book editor and folk art collector who has given 113 objects to the museum with the promise of more. The works, from the late-18th to the mid-20th centuries, cover the traditional areas of folk art -- portraits, landscapes, sculptures, painted and decorated furniture -- but the focus is on American needlework: quilts, coverlets, blankets and the like. Among the quilt spectaculars is the "Samuel Steinberger Log Cabin Quilt, Courthouse Steps Variation," by a 19th-century immigrant. Painted furniture, too, shines in this show. The painting and sculpture pieces make a more modest impression, but over all, what's on view represents a refined, solid ensemble that is very visitable. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Grace Glueck).
 
 "HIP-HOP NATION: ROOTS, RHYMES AND RAGE," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Dec. 31). The complex cultural amalgam of music, poetry, break-dancing, art and fashion that is hip-hop poses a serious challenge to any art museum, but with the proper resources and curatorial expertise, it could have been done. Instead this show offers a partial outline of hip-hop history, conveyed by photographs, posters, magazine and album covers, memorabilia and monotonous expanses of clothes that make the show nearly indistinguishable from the gift shop. Garnished with graffiti art, it bypasses many other equally interesting connections to contemporary art. Because the show omits music videos, it manages to be virtually devoid of the sounds, words and moving bodies that are the essence of hip-hop. The results are a cross between a mall and a mausoleum. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 "IN THE PRESENCE OF SPIRITS: AFRICAN ART FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ETHNOLOGY IN LISBON," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Dec. 31). The more than 140 objects on view relate to the secular and the supernatural in African culture: masks, power figures, dolls, decorated stools and chairs, pipes, posts and other artifacts. Outstanding is a group of initiation masks made from wood and more fragile materials like feathers, fabrics and barkcloth fibers. Ranging from fierce to benign in expression, they are giddily imaginative. Impressive, too, is a selection of dolls, important in the socialization of girls, from the Ambo people of southwestern Angola. The objects in the show were chosen for their high aesthetic value, and it doesn't disappoint. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for children, students and the elderly; free on Sundays (Glueck).
 
 LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).
 
 "MOROCCO: JEWS AND ART IN A MUSLIM LAND," Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Feb. 11). When Arab Muslims arrived in Morocco, Jews had already been living there for centuries, and the two cultures formed a cooperative and uneasy bond. Their relationship is explored in this exhibition, which offers a little bit of many things, mostly dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. In elaborate jewelry, shimmery textiles, liturgical objects and folk amulets, Jewish and Islamic ingredients often form a distinctive hybrid blend. A selection of European Orientalist paintings, by Delacroix among others, provide a firsthand outsider view of a once-vibrant interaction. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students over 11 and the elderly (Cotter)
 
 "OPEN ENDS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of "MOMA 2000," the millennium-marking rethinking of the Modern's permanent collection, is off and running, with the first of three staggered floor-through sections in place. The dates covered are 1960 to the present, so there's some sense of how a bastion of modernism is dealing with a postmodern world. Pretty well, judging from recent acquisitions of work by Pipilotti Rist, Matthew Barney and Cai Guo-Qiang. The real interest is in smart theme shows that play with such contemporary fixations as childhood innocence and adult experience, and the blend of art, abjection and design. (The third-floor galleries open on Sunday.) Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 "PIERRE ET GILLES," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the highbrow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but those are few. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Smith).
 
 "POWER AND DESIRE: SOUTH ASIAN PAINTINGS FROM THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART, EDWIN BINNEY 3RD COLLECTION," Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 517-2742 (through Jan. 7.) The album-size paintings known as Indian miniatures, produced for an elite clientele who demanded the finest workmanship, are rightly renowned for their suave forms and brilliant colors. They also embody the moral values, political ambitions and personal aspirations of the culture that produced them. All of these ingredients come into play in this show of 67 top-of-the-line examples from the 16th to 19th centuries. They add up to a kind of grand but intimate theater, equal parts farce, melodrama and mystery play, where men strut like gods, gods have the failings of men, and nature is a gorgeous curtain behind which infinity lies. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 * BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but a beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 * SCYTHIAN GOLD. "The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 4). "Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 21). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind of treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally, the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's smash-hot "In the Land of the Scythians" of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above ( Cotter).
 
 * EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 4). A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organized aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, "The Family of Man." We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays and Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * "UNTITLED PASSAGES BY HENRI MICHAUX," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through Dec. 20). The books of the great Belgian-born French poet and writer Henri Michaux are not exactly unknown on these shores, but his considerable achievement as a visual artist -- a self-taught one -- has yet to gain a solid foothold. This exhibition of more than 100 works on paper should change things. Spanning the late 1920's to the late 1970's, it includes examples of his finely textured "mescaline" drawings, his raucous ink-scapes and his animated, often preening calligraphies. It reveals an artist profoundly influenced by Asian art who assiduously mined the fault line between language and sign, text and drawing, image and abstraction, manifesting the flow of human thought and energy in different, often hypnotic ways. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free. A related show, "Henri Michaux: Works on Paper," is at Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, 212 988-1623, through Nov. 25 (Smith).

"REMBRANDT AND THE VENETIAN INFLUENCE," Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through Nov. 18). The Venetian influence in Rembrandt's later paintings has long been noted; this show is an attempt to demonstrate by specific examples. But the topic is more suited to a museum presentation; this one mounts only a dozen paintings, three by Rembrandt and one labeled "Studio of Rembrandt," along with oils by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. It is too small and catch-as-catch-can to make the case. The most salient example here of Venice in Rembrandt is his great painting "Flora" (circa 1654). Next to it, the other works in this show pale (Glueck).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
 JOHN MASON AND PETER VOULKOS, Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 (through Nov. 11). During the 1950's, Mr. Voulkos and Mr. Mason shared studios and an ambition to give ceramic sculpture an unprecedented physical expressiveness. Though the lesser known of the two, it is Mr. Mason who steals this show. His tower of mooshed-together clay chunks glazed green and his rumpled orange slab imprinted with the letter A make Voulkos's plates, pots, stacked vessels and totem-like sculptures look conservative (Johnson).
 
 TABITHA VEVERS, "Flying Dreams," Kraushaar, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 307-5730 (through Nov. 11). Updating medieval manuscript illumination, Ms. Vevers combines handwritten texts and deftly painted narrative imagery to document dreams of flight, her own and those of friends. One of these small, mysterious works illustrates the artist's dream of running a seaside flying school for babies, who are equipped with little golden parachutes (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
FRANCES BARTH, Donahue/Sosinski, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-1111 (through Nov. 11). Ms. Barth's medium large, semi-abstract pictures are an odd combination of muted Color Field painting and geological diagramming. Sketchy topographical signs, patterns and textures scatter across broad, stained areas of canvas, and are set off against narrower bands representing stratified cross-sections. The paintings have a curiously dry yet somehow romantic eccentricity (Johnson).
 
 JAMES ESBER AND KATIA SANTIBANEZ, P.P.O.W., 476 Broome Street, (212) 941-8642 (through Nov. 11). Mr. Esber's paintings of distorted and fragmented cartoon characters look like collaborations between Peter Saul, Philip Guston and R. Crumb, but have their own creepy-comical sensibility. The best, made of colored modeling clay applied directly to the wall, have a weirdly vivid palpability. In Ms. Santibanez's neat, easel-size abstractions, color-coordinated grass made of strokes of gouache seems to grow from the seams of smooth, cool-white stripe, grid or nested square compositions, to quietly eye-buzzing effect (Johnson).
 
 GUDRUN MERTES-FRADY, Rosenberg + Kaufman, 115 Wooster Street, (212) 431-4838 (through Nov. 18). The works of this veteran abstract painter, who moved from Germany to New York two decades ago, are academic but sumptuous. She drags, squeegees and scrapes paint this way and that, creating layered, blurred, checkered surfaces that are richly material yet vaguely illusory, like paintings by a less adventurous Gerhard Richter (Johnson).
 
 RAPHAEL MONTANEZ ORTIZ, Mitchell Algus, 25 Thompson Street, (212) 966-1758 (through Nov. 11). A sculptor, performance artist, film and video maker and self-styled modern shaman, Mr. Ortiz became famous in the 1960's for destroying pianos. Here he shows recent large psychedelic digital prints that mix Aztec, Cabalistic and Christian iconography. More persuasive are mesmerizing Cubistic videos made in the 1980's from clips of Marx Brothers movies and "King Kong" (Johnson).
 
 DAVID RABINOWITCH, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Nov. 18). Restricting his vocabulary to circles, ovals and straight lines, and his means to pencil, ink or colored pencil, this Constructivist-Minimalist sculptor produced this series of extremely spare drawings during the early 1970's. Called "Construction of Vision," they are resolutely abstract and quasi scientific. But the ellipses and angled lines, cleanly drawn with mechanical drafting tools, have a subtly playful animation (Johnson).
 
 JASON RHOADES, David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, (212) 966-9074 (through Nov. 18). In one room of Mr. Rhoades's latest essay in sculptural extravagance stands a sort of giant Tinkertoy sawmill -- Sutter's Mill, birthplace of the California gold rush -- made of polished aluminum pipes and clamps. In another room is an identical but incomplete version. During the exhibition, an assistant will always be building or dismantling one or the other mill, acting out a Sisyphean loop of construction and deconstruction (Johnson).
 
 CHRIS VERENE, American Fine Arts, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 941-0401 (through Nov. 11). With often piercing intimacy, this 31-year-old photographer chronicles the lives of friends and relatives in his hometown of Galesburg, Ill. Each of 60 richly colored, squarish images in this two-gallery show has a brief handwritten text added by the artist. Under the picture of a cousin, Steve, and his young daughter at a McDonald's, the text says, "His wife had just left them to go to a battered women's shelter" (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
ISA GENZKEN, AC Project Room, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 645-4970 (through Nov. 18). Ms. Genzken, a German sculptor who has been exhibiting since the mid-70's, presents an Arte Povera-style homage to New York City in the form of slapdash skyscraper models made of colored tape, sheets of colored plastic or Plexiglas and found things like a pizza box, a fan propeller or oyster shells. A set of photographs of sleek office buildings offers a sharp contrast to the funky sculptural aesthetic (Johnson).
 
 JENNY HANKWITZ, Catherine Moore, 140 West 30th Street, (212) 279-8977 (through Nov. 11). Contemplating Ms. Hankwitz's abstract paintings is like looking through the window of a churning washing machine. Working from drawings made on a computer, the artist layers flat, crisply painted swirls, blobs and bubbly shapes into radiating, spiraling compositions, producing a sudsy mix of formalist flux and Pop buoyancy (Johnson).
 
 DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).
 
 SCOTT RICHTER AND BILL SMART, Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666 (through Nov. 11). In opposite but equally engaging ways these two artists address basic elements of painting. Mr. Richter piles up paint into great heaping stacks of viscous color, exaggerating its sumptuous materiality to the point of absurdity. Mr. Smart reduces paint to almost pure primary colors in a series of square monochromes that have rounded corners and white circles like punch holes, giving Minimalism a subtle Pop spin (Johnson).
 
 ALEXIS ROCKMAN, Gorney Bravin + Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372 (through Nov. 11). Inspired by a trip into South American jungles, Mr. Rockman's Pop-realist paintings depict a Northerner's lurid fantasies of tropical adventure and danger. One shows the artist himself gripped in the tentacles of a man-eating plant; another portrays him surrounded by parasites and dangerous fish. Something political about tourism is implied, but the satire is less biting than it should be, and the painting looks like overblown magazine illustration (Johnson).
 
 RANDY WRAY, Derek Eller, 526-30 West 25th Street, (212) 206-6411 (through Nov. 11). To make his oddly confounding paintings, Mr. Wray first creates a funky, coffee table-scale abstract sculpture that he then photographs; the photograph is in turn digitally transformed into a kind of paint-by-numbers diagram that the artist copies in paint using brushes and various sorts of extruders, adding three-dimensional canvas elements as well. The final products are ambiguously suggestive and slightly creepy, hovering between pixilated abstraction and surrealism (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
"PASTORAL POP!," Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Dec. 15). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's "Grande Jatte," Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stonewall planter, Katrin Asbury's miniature diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
ROE ETHRIDGE, Andrew Kreps, 516-A West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849 (through tomorrow). Mr. Ethridge's clever orchestration of his own almost hallucinogenically clear photographs includes portraits of UPS delivery men in their trucks, head shots of two pretty young female models, close-up studies of young pine trees and a big picture of an ambulance that had just crashed. Believe it or not, these disparate images are persuasively connected by the theme of perfection and its tragic impossibility (Johnson).
 
 DAN FLAVIN, Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through tomorrow). Flavin's simple fluorescent-light works from the 60's illuminate this posh new gallery to simultaneously matter-of-fact and mystically radiant effect. The white ones have classic Minimalist rigor; examples consisting of just two or three colors are almost hedonistically sumptuous (Johnson).
 
 JOHAN GRIMONPREZ, "Inflight!," Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300 (through tomorrow). Mr. Grimonprez's 1997 film "Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y" documented the history of skyjackings through vintage film and video footage to riveting effect. This time he offers a parody of an inflight magazine -- free to all visitors -- filled with excerpts from books and magazine articles about skyjackings. A mock airline waiting room provides a theatrical context. One gets the point about how the media turns history into infotainment, but this project is not as compelling as the film (Johnson).
 
 LAWREN STEWART HARRIS, Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950 (through Sunday). A co-founder of the famous Group of Seven, a collective dedicated to the advancement of a truly Canadian vision in painting, Harris (1885-1970) produced his best work in the 1920's and 30's. In this engaging retrospective, his wilderness scenes of icy mountains, remote lakes and lonesome houses rendered in a simplifying style like Georgia O'Keeffe's have a poignant romanticism and visionary radiance (Johnson).
 
 * JACQUES HENRI LARTIGUE, Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 750-7070 (through tomorrow). This magical exhibition of more than 60 vintage prints was drawn from the private collection of the French photographer's widow, who died in May. Concentrating mostly on small, wonderfully lively pictures made when he was a teenager, it vividly conveys his boyish enthusiasm for childhood games and horseplay, his fascination with flying, racing cars and fashionable women, and his excitement about the miracle of photography itself (Johnson).
 
 JANE AND LOUISE WILSON, 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121 (through tomorrow). The British twin-sister video makers here direct their haunting ultraformalist vision to sites of post-cold war resonance: two centers of research, training and development for the Russian space program. Focusing mostly on architecture and high-tech equipment, their four projections take you on a mesmerizing Cubistic journey through places that seem at once futuristic and dilapidated, a mix of "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Blade Runner" (Johnson).
 
 CINDY WORKMAN, Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 941-0012 (through tomorrow). Laminated to the reverse side of Plexiglas panels that are attached to the wall by heavy bolts, Ms. Workman's layered, digitalized montages of found imagery -- little girls, scientific or technical diagrams, girly cartoons and old smut photographs -- meditate on innocence, experience, consumerism and modernity (Johnson).

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology;
Hybrid Cars Show Up In M.I.T.'s Crystal Ball

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Massachusetts Institute of Technology and DaimlerChrysler have given their assessments on the future of the automobile, and have both come out in favor of hybrid gasoline-electric cars. But scientists at M.I.T.'s Energy Laboratory, working with computer models, had an easier time predicting costs and benefits of the cars than DaimlerChrysler, working in steel and glass, is likely to have selling them.
M.I.T. completed a two-year study last month comparing a gasoline-powered 1996-model sedan with some cars that might be feasible by 2020, including advanced gasoline models; hybrids that combine a gasoline or diesel engine with an electric motor and batteries; cars running on fuel cells with a raw fuel of either natural gas, gasoline or methanol; and electrics running on batteries. The study was a "well to wheels" comparison that took into account the energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions at every stage, from making the gasoline or other fuel to burning it in the vehicle. It also looked at the costs to consumers of the various technologies. 
 The engineers found that the best car would use an electric drivetrain and get its energy from a small internal-combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel fuel or compressed natural gas. More exotic technologies like fuel cells or pure battery-electric cars would be more expensive and, taking into account the energy required to make their hydrogen or electricity, did not compare favorably on energy use or greenhouse emissions. But a hybrid car could cut greenhouse emissions, perhaps by half, though it would cost about 20 percent more than a conventional gasoline automobile.
DaimlerChrysler said the extra charge would be $3,000 for a hybrid version of the Dodge Durango, a hefty four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle. The engineers would substitute a V-6 engine for the Durango's
V-8 and disconnect it from the front wheels, which would be powered instead by a 100-horsepower electric motor. The motor would draw on a battery, and the battery would be recharged by letting the front wheels drag a little -- using the motor as a generator, converting torque to electricity instead of vice-versa. It would do that during braking, thus recapturing some of the energy lost at each stop sign.
The hybrid's acceleration would be equal to, or better than, a gasoline Durango. Short-distance performance off road would be equal, but for long off-road drives, the electric side would have trouble recharging, engineers said.
One expected result is an increase in fuel economy, to 18 m.p.g. from 15. But the actual cost to the company is not clear; for one thing, the plan is to use lithium-ion batteries, the kind now in high-end laptop computers, and those have not yet been built on the scale the Dodge would require.
Adding three miles a gallon for $3,000 means, with gas at $1.60 a gallon, that 1,875 gallons would have to be saved to break even. If the vehicle went 12,000 miles a year, the ordinary version would use 800 gallons, and the hybrid version, 667. With savings of 133 gallons a year, the added cost of the hybrid would take 14 years to pay for itself, or 168,000 miles -- a challenge for a Dodge truck. An economist would calculate that the savings would have to be even larger to break even, to take account of the interest payments that the $3,000 could have earned if left in the bank -- or if not borrowed from the bank as part of a car loan.
Consumers who weigh the energy efficiency of appliances they are buying usually look for a three-year payback. The Durango could do that if gas was $7.50 a gallon (133 gallons a year for 3 years is about 400 gallons, divided into $3,000).
DaimlerChrysler executives had said they would not build the car unless Congress approved a tax credit. But now, perhaps goaded by Ford and G.M., DaimlerChrysler plans to go ahead regardless. Also in 2003, Ford plans to sell a hybrid version of its Escape, an S.U.V. slightly smaller than an Explorer, and G.M. is working on hybrid pickup trucks and buses. Toyota and Honda are already selling small hybrid-powered cars, and G.M. has been working with Toyota on a small hybrid S.U.V.
Bernard Robertson, senior vice president for engineering technologies at DaimlerChrysler, said in announcing the 2003 production date for the hybrid Durango that his company hoped eventually to sell 100,000 hybrid vehicles a year of various models, perhaps 30,000 of them Durangos (or 15 percent of Durango production).
But the purpose seems more to break the ice than to save gasoline. At $3,000 a vehicle, and 100,000 vehicles a year, the added cost would come to $300 million a year. Asked if that much money would save more gasoline if it were invested in marginal shifts like better engines and lighter bodies, he said it was possible, though he had not done the calculation.
The Durango came out better on cost, though, than another car shown off by Chrysler in October, a Jeep Commander concept car powered by fuel cells. DaimlerChrysler says it wants to sell fuel-cell buses in 2003 and fuel-cell cars in 2004, but Mr. Robertson acknowledged, "There are a lot of challenges left."
The biggest is to cut the cost of fuel cells to $50 per kilowatt of capacity -- about what that much power costs from an internal-combustion engine; engineers will not be specific, but at the moment the figure is perhaps 100 times that. The car carries 50 kilowatts of fuel cells. Moshen D. Shabana, chief fuel cell engineer on the project, acknowledged with a smile that this was "the most expensive vehicle I ever touched."
M.I.T. seems confident that the costs of fuel cells will fall, along with the costs of batteries and other components of advanced vehicles. But plain old gasoline is likely to be the cheapest power source.
Malcolm Weiss, a researcher who was the lead author of the M.I.T. study, said in an e-mail message that if payload, performance and range stayed constant, the new, more fuel-efficient vehicles would always cost more. They "cannot pay for themselves in fuel savings based on any personal rational economic analysis," he said; there would have to be other reasons to buy them.
He wrote, "Perhaps customers will come to value fuel efficiency as a social good they're willing to pay for -- or perhaps taxes will go way up (politically absurd), increasing the value of fuel savings, but don't hold your breath." He calculated that the owner of a hybrid Durango would lose $387 a year, at current gasoline prices, compared with the owner of a conventional Durango.
His study, which tried to predict the state of technology by 2020, listed a margin of error on its estimates of 10 to 30 percent, which made its conclusions less than authoritative. And the authors acknowledged looking at the feasibility of technology, not the actual process of inducing change in a multibillion-dollar industry.
The M.I.T. study mostly looked at energy consumption and gases that play a role in global warming. It assumed that all vehicles would meet the current federal "Tier 2" standards for smog pollutants and did not concern itself further with such conventional pollution, although a proponent of fuel cells could argue that they are cleaner.
The study compared a 1996-model Toyota Camry, the "reference" vehicle, to an advanced internal-combustion car, a hybrid using gasoline, diesel or compressed natural gas, a fuel cell car using gasoline, methanol or hydrogen, and a battery electric car.
The battery car, which was the car of the future a decade ago, is too expensive and is not the best on energy consumption and greenhouse gases, the study concluded.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
A Market in Search of Direction Settles for Mixed Results

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Buyers moved selectively back into the stock market yesterday, snapping up financial and technology issues after the market's decline on Wednesday. Selling in basic material and retailing stocks left the overall market mixed.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 18.96 points at 10,880.51. Broader stock indicators fared better. The Nasdaq composite index rose 95.63 points, or 2.9 percent, to 3,429.02, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 7.10 points, or half a percent, at 1,428.32. 
 The market seemed in search of a direction a day after the Dow and Nasdaq fell on a mix of profit taking and a profit warning by WorldCom.
Technology issues led the gainers, with Intel up $1.81, to $46.69, and Sun Microsystems rising $3.19, to $109.06.
Shares of Oracle fell, however, after rumors rippled through the markets early in the session that its chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, and chief financial officer, Jeffrey O. Henley, planned to resign. The software company's stock plunged as much as 13 percent before public denials from Mr. Ellison and Mr. Henley convinced investors the rumors were false. Still, Oracle shares fell $1.81, to $29.56.
Financial issues were higher across the board. Merrill Lynch rose $1.31, to $69.81, after dropping Wednesday.
But weakness in issues of materials companies like the aluminum manufacturer Alcoa, which fell $1.31 cents, to $27.75, and in energy companies, like Exxon Mobil, down $3.88, to $88.19, kept the Dow treading water.
"There has been a pop-up in retail and material company stocks over the last couple of days, but it didn't seem to have fundamental support. Rather it was more of a rotation toward stocks that hadn't moved up yet," said Ronald Hill, investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "I think now we're seeing that gain was short-lived."
Retailers received a mixed response. Many retailing issues have been trading down for months on worries that moderating economic growth will hurt their bottom lines.
J. C. Penney was up 75 cents, to $12, after initially falling on weak October sales. Wal-Mart Stores was up $1.25, to $48, after reporting strong monthly sales but warning of a weak fourth quarter.
The warehouse retailer Costco rose 44 cents, to $36.19, recovering from earlier losses after Banc of America Securities downgraded its stock. But Home Depot, a Dow component, slipped $1.13, to $42.88.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Mixed
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday after a report showing a jump in unit labor costs dampened expectations that the Federal Reserve might soon shift to a neutral stance on interest rates.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to a price of 100 4/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.73 percent from 5.74 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32, to 106 19/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.78 percent.
Recent data have fueled optimism that the Fed may soon drop its bias toward tighter credit in favor of a neutral stance. But an unexpected jump in worker compensation kept bonds close to Wednesday's levels.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
'Green' Tower at Battery Park City

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
While it will be the 22nd residential tower in Manhattan's Battery Park City, the 266-unit rental scheduled to rise there next will be the first designed as a so-called green building: one that is energy efficient, environmentally sensitive and healthier for tenants.
The Albanese Development Corporation of Garden City, N.Y., is developing the 27-story structure, estimated to cost $110 million, to meet environmental and design guidelines set by the Battery Park City Authority. The building, billed as the nation's first green residential high-rise, will be at Terrace and Murray Streets, overlooking the Hudson River. 
 It will feature such advanced engineering technologies as a central heating and cooling system fueled by natural gas to increase energy efficiency. The system also includes a fresh-air heating, cooling, filtering and humidifying system that will serve all apartments. And to conserve water, it will have a water recycling plant in the basement to treat waste water from showers, sinks and washing machines and reuse it for irrigating plants and flushing toilets.
Each of the one- to three-bedroom units, averaging 750 to 1,500 square feet, will have its own temperature controls. Each will also be equipped with energy-efficient appliances, including washers and dryers. And the developer will limit the project's impact on the environment by using materials that, among other things, have recycled contents and reduced toxicity.
Outside, Cesar Pelli & Associates has designed the building's glass and masonry facade with photovoltaic panels that convert sunlight into electricity. The panels will be arranged mainly in a vertical pattern -- and in some places used instead of brick -- over the main entrance to the building to supply 5 percent of the building's electrical load. The roof will also be covered with lightweight soil and plantings, creating a parklike setting that will provide added insulation value to the roof.
In addition to the project's environmental features, planned amenities include a health club, children's playroom and garage parking. All of the apartments, designed by Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron, will have floor-to-ceiling windows in the living rooms to maximize light and views. A third of them will be three-bedroom units, which are in short supply and high demand in the downtown rental market, said Russell C. Albanese, president of the development company. He said construction would start in the first quarter of 2001, with completion 18 months later.
The Battery Park City Authority recently issued requests for proposals to develop two more green buildings on North End Avenue between Murray and Warren Streets, near the Albanese development in what the authority calls the north neighborhood.
Those buildings, which could hold 250 apartments each, will continue development in that neighborhood, which began in 1995 and has since filled with five residential buildings, totaling some 1,440 rental units, more than 200 of them for the elderly.
Four more residential and two commercial buildings that will complete the development of Battery Park City will also be green, said James F. Gill, chairman of the authority. "With this project," Mr. Gill said, referring to the Albanese rental, "we are trying to demonstrate that developers can build buildings that are advanced environmentally and from a health point of view and still turn a profit."
The Albanese building will be the first to be built under New York State's $25 million environmental tax credit program, which is intended to encourage the construction and rehabilitation of environmentally friendly buildings. Under the program, which was signed into law in May and will become effective in January, property owners can apply for tax credits to offset the cost of designing buildings with higher energy efficiency and lower impact on the environment.
Mr. Albanese said his company got involved with the project "because it was a great opportunity and the economics make sense." He estimated that adding the environmental features to the building would account for 12 to 15 percent of the $110 million construction cost. But, he added, his company is confident it will recoup much of the cost in the long term through lower operating costs.
And though monthly rents have not been set, Mr. Albanese said that given the building's riverside location, larger units and amenities, it not only "will achieve top rental rates, but push the market upward."
Douglas Wagner, president of Benjamin James Associates, a residential brokerage company in Manhattan, said average annual rents at buildings in and around Battery Park City were $44.35 a square foot. That means monthly rents would be $4,435 for a 1,200-square-foot two-bedroom apartment and $5,543 for a three-bedroom unit with 1,500 square feet.

HEADLINE: Private Buildings Sought for Public Schools

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Trying to address a shortage of sites on which to build new schools, Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday that he wanted to ask private real estate developers to construct mixed-use buildings that would put commercial offices or apartments on top of new schools.
The idea, which has been used infrequently over the last three decades, has gained reinvigorated currency recently as the Board of Education has developed a growing backlog of new school proposals. 
 At least 12 new schools, meant to serve more than 5,000 students, have languished on the School Construction Authority's drawing board for more than a year because the Board of Education cannot find sites for them. Rising prices for property, opposition in some communities and environmental problems on many of the available parcels of open space in the city have hampered the search for sites.
Under Mr. Levy's proposal, which is still in the early stages, developers could gain tax advantages or expanded building rights if they agreed to include schools on the bottom floors of buildings they plan to construct on their own property.
Theoretically, that could open a host of new, privately owned sites to potential use by the Board of Education. Another option would have the school system sell the air rights above current school buildings to private developers, and those buildings could then be expanded as part of larger mixed-use complexes constructed over the existing schools.
Education officials said Mr. Levy's staff had already discussed the idea with several developers. Mr. Levy said he had directed David Klasfeld, the Board of Education's deputy chancellor for operations, to explore "how we might be able to work with real estate developers to multiply the number of classrooms we have."
"The New York City school system is probably the largest real estate owner in the city," Mr. Levy said. "This could be another vehicle to get new schools and classrooms, potentially faster than we could otherwise build them."
Some or all of the construction costs could be financed using the bonding authority of the Educational Construction Fund, a city agency that has sold bonds for similar uses in the past but which has been been inactive in recent years. The fund is separate from the School Construction Authority, which operates on a budget allocated by the City Council.
One large New York City developer applauded the idea of public-private partnerships yesterday. Henry Elghanayan, chief executive of Rockrose Development Corporation, said he believed that many real estate companies would be interested in a plan to put up mixed-use buildings on Board of Education property or their own building sites.
At least two such sites already exist in New York City. In Battery Park City, Public School-Intermediate School 89 occupies the bottom few floors of the Tribeca Bridge Tower, a 25-story, 151-unit rental building at the corner of West and Chambers Streets. The building was developed by the Battery Park City Authority, a state agency.
The type of public-private partnership envisioned by Mr. Levy is more likely typified by Norman Thomas High School, which occupies space in a commercial building on Park Avenue between 33rd and 34th Streets.
That building was developed in 1974 by Cohen Brothers Realty and Construction Corporation on the site that once held the 71st Regiment Armory. The property had been owned by the state and was conveyed to the Board of Education for school use. The board leased the air rights to Cohen Brothers and issued bonds that would be paid off through future lease payments to finance school construction. The school's entrance is on 33rd Street, around the corner from the building's Park Avenue commercial entrance.
Mr. Levy disclosed his interest in the development plan yesterday at a meeting of the School Construction Authority in response to a question about the possibility of housing schools in mixed-use buildings from Howard Wilson, chairman of the construction authority's trustees.
Mr. Wilson was appointed to the construction authority board by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who along with Mr. Levy, also a construction authority trustee, has advocated varying forms of public-private partnerships throughout the city's school system.
Anthony P. Coles, deputy mayor for planning, education and cultural affairs, said that while City Hall had not seen the specifics of Mr. Levy's proposal, it was an idea that the city had successfully implemented in the past and was worth considering again. Certainly money is not the main obstacle to solving the problem of overcrowded schools, which affects every borough in the city, said Adam L. Barsky, director of the city's Office of Management and Budget.
In addition to the $7 billion included in the five-year capital plan, which would pay for construction through 2004 by the School Construction Authority, the mayor's office last year set aside $150 million, to be administered by the Economic Development Corporation, for use by private developers that want to build new schools.
Nevertheless, school overcrowding is rampant, particularly in Queens, where each of the seven community school districts operates above capacity and some schools have 60 percent more students than they were intended to hold.
Six new schools that were planned for construction in Queens beginning last year have still not been started because of trouble finding sites for them, according to the School Construction Authority. Last spring, dozens of residents of Maspeth, Queens, attended a City Council hearing to protest plans for a new elementary school, saying they wanted the site to be used for a Staples office supply store instead.
Even finding a potential site is no guarantee that a school will be built. For one proposed school in District 6 in Upper Manhattan, the School Construction Authority has conducted 13 feasibility studies of how and where to place the school on various sites.

HEADLINE: Bill Gates Turns Skeptical On Digital Solution's Scope

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., Nov. 1

 BODY:
As the "Creating Digital Dividends" conference drew to a close in Seattle recently, the final speaker arrived and started asking skeptical questions. The premise was that "market drivers" could be used "to bring the benefits of connectivity and participation in the e-economy to all of the world's six billion people," according to conference materials, but the speaker would have little of it.
"I mean, do people have a clear view of what it means to live on $1 a day?" the speaker, William H. Gates, asked. "There's no electricity in that house. None." 
 When a moderator brought up solar power, Mr. Gates shot back, "No! You can't afford a solar power system for less than $1 a day." And, "You're just buying food, you're trying to stay alive."
It is a theme to which Mr. Gates, the world's richest man, returns in an interview at his office here at the Microsoft Corporation, the giant software maker he founded. Pacing the room, waving his hands, he conjures up an image of an African village that receives a computer.
"The mothers are going to walk right up to that computer and say, My children are dying, what can you do?" Mr. Gates says. "They're not going to sit there and like, browse eBay or something. What they want is for their children to live. They don't want their children's growth to be stunted. Do you really have to put in computers to figure that out?"
For a man often thought of as the world's chief evangelist for technology, Mr. Gates is assuming a surprising role these days, in which he seems to be taking his own industry to task for having far too much faith in digital solutions to the planet's worst ills. He openly dismisses the notion that the world's poorest people constitute a significant market for high-tech products anytime soon. Such thoughts, he says, may undercut the case for urgent aid to the most impoverished people.
But in a way, the man who has also become the world's biggest philanthropist seems to be taking himself to task, offering the confession that he himself was "naive -- very naive" when he began his charitable endeavors six years ago.
When he did so, he said in the interview, he expected that projects involving computers and information technology would make up the bulk of his giving. But now his priorities are otherwise, with health care, especially development and distribution of vaccines, soon expected to account for at least two-thirds of the grants offered by the $21 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Or, as he put it at the Seattle conference, the world's poorest two billion people desperately need health care right now, not laptops.
Mr. Gates said he had certainly not lost his faith in the long-term promise of technology to deliver a better world. But he has lost much of the faith he once had that global capitalism would prove capable of solving the most immediate catastrophes facing the world's poorest people, especially the 40,000 deaths a day from preventable diseases. More philanthropy and more government aid -- especially a greater contribution to foreign health programs by American taxpayers -- are needed for that, he says.
And it also explains, he said, why he has taken on the unaccustomed role of self-described "troublemaker" about the promises of technology. It is a role he assumed at the Seattle conference, which created a stir in his industry and irritation among at least some of the organizers, but one that he seems to have played at other recent appearances.
"Whenever the computer industry has a panel about the digital divide and I'm on the panel, I always think, 'O.K., you want to send computers to Africa, what about food and electricity -- those computers aren't going to be that valuable,' " he explained in a speech last month before the Global Foundation in Melbourne, Australia.
"They want to sit on the panel and talk about how the computers will solve all the world's problems," Mr. Gates continued. "They're amazing in what they can do, but they have to be put into the perspective of human values. And certainly as a father of two children, thinking about the medicines I take for granted that are not available elsewhere, that sort of rises to the top of the list."
Some people in Mr. Gates's industry have commended him for his recent comments, while others have accused him of setting up a straw man. Nothing in the quest for a more wired world, they say, is at odds with the notion that food and health care remain a more immediate concern.
And still others, including some of Microsoft's principal competitors, argue that Mr. Gates is downright wrong. They say there are all kinds of tangible, profitable products that their industry is developing that will help improve people's lives, including the world's poorest people. Some directly involved in the conference here, sponsored by the nonprofit World Resources Institute, seemed annoyed by Mr. Gates's comments.
"After listening to three days of serious analysis and work, and then to have Gates rather flippantly say, 'You've got to have clean water and food,' to hear that simple repetition of Maslow's hierarchy, that wasn't exactly furthering the point of the entire meeting," said John Gage, the chief research officer for Sun Microsystems and the founder of Netday, a global volunteer effort to connect schools to the Internet.
Mr. Gage's reference was to Abraham H. Maslow, the psychologist who suggested that human beings reach fulfillment through satisfying a series of needs, which begins with basic physiological needs like food and water and rises to others that include love, self-esteem and personal expression. Where Mr. Gates has it wrong, Mr. Gage argued, is that technology is rapidly being used to satisfy even the most basic needs on the hierarchy.
Mr. Gage, known as a periodic critic of Mr. Gates, said that the declining cost of cell phones and other hand-held mobile technology would soon make them immensely useful for even the poorest people. They might use the devices to share important information about health care and food conditions, he said.
Others in the industry were more measured in their response to Mr. Gates's recent comments. "I think he's right and he's wrong," said James F. Moore, chairman of GeoPartners Research Inc., which specializes in technology and economic-development issues. "He's right, and I'd emphatically support him on this, that other divides are more important than the digital divide: the divide on health care, the human-rights divide, the education divide."
But in the view of Mr. Moore, a policy adviser to Hewlett-Packard, which recently announced a $1 billion program to focus on new markets in the third world, "what's going on here is that people are really trying to think about the essence of high technology and what it can do. And I would say I think he's missing something by being so dismissive of these markets."
Mr. Gates, however, seems adamant on the point. "Anybody who says, 'Oh sure, we'll sell to the people who live on a dollar a day,' they just don't get it," he said.

Now, the College Bowl

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

DATELINE: SCRANTON, Pa.

 BODY:
These days, the Gore campaign really cannot say enough good things about the Electoral College.
"The Founding Fathers were men of vision," Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said sunnily. 
 If this were a normal country, where getting the most votes equals winning the election, the Gore people would be in the classic sullen campaign-on-the-skids mode by now. But they're actually pretty chipper, in a manic, sleep-deprived sort of way. (You have never seen so many eyes with huge pupils outside of a detox center.) The national polls are not really going their way, but Mr. Gore seems to be either slightly ahead or tied in the big up-for-grabs states like Michigan and Florida and Pennsylvania. If he wins there, he could rack up enough Electoral College votes to take the presidency.
Reasons it might be fun to have an election where one candidate wins the popular vote but loses the White House:
* Makes up for our having missed the last one in 1888.
* Sudden demand for documentaries on the Electoral College provides job opportunities for people who have been unemployed since the millennium roundups ended.
* Chance to see how spontaneous combustion really works when Trent Lott gets the news.
Best of all, the whole situation makes every voter feel important. (This of course does not include people who live in non-swing states like New York or Massachusetts, where there are so few signs an election is going on that the citizenry must think it's been postponed.) The whole game could hinge on a very small number of votes in a few very key places -- a precinct or two in central Florida, the level of turnout in Flint or Detroit. The vice president has been driven into an absolute frenzy of activity by the possibility that one more speech, or one more minute at the right table at the right senior citizens breakfast, could make all the difference.
"I need your help! I need your help!" he cried at a late-evening rally in Scranton. Mr. Gore was working on two hours' sleep and he had just come from a long day of campaigning in Florida. ("Listen," said an aide proudly, as the vice president delivered an address on Social Security at one stop. "He just said the name of the town. He definitely knows what state he's in.")
In Scranton, you would have thought he was fresh as a daisy, except for the fact that his words tended to come in bursts, as if his brain were in danger of short-circuiting. Searching for a non-abortion-related Supreme Court issue that might interest Catholic union members, he finally blurted out "those anti-working people provisions they're trying to come up with."
But the crowd was not so much listening to his points as waiting for opportunities to jump in and lend a hand by cheering wildly. Mr. Gore took off his coat to demonstrate his determination to fight hard. Then he rolled up his shirt sleeves, delighting the people even more. If the temperature at the outdoor rally had not been in the mid-30's, he might have gone one step short of the full monty.
This is called energizing your base, a political task that requires a great deal of stamina and a willingness not to dwell too long on the exact point behind all your effort. It's the job Mr. Gore has been training for all his life. At last we have an explanation for why his father the senator forced young Al to spend an entire summer clearing 20 acres of underbrush with a hand ax.
Who knows what will make the difference? Tipper Gore has put in hours and hours giving interviews while balancing delicately on the arm of her husband's chair, in case there's somebody left who doesn't know they're happily married. True, anyone out there now who's truly undecided is probably either too dim to find the polling place or too sensitive to live outdoors. But still, maybe the next hand you shake will belong to the aunt of that one swing voter who will turn the precinct that turns the county that turns the state that provides the last critical electoral vote.
"It may come down to you," Mr. Gore told members of the Tampa football team this week, on the outside chance that any of them actually lived in Florida.
Finally, a single vote does matter. And it belongs to a Tampa Bay Buccaneer.

HEADLINE: Productivity of Workers Increases, as Do Labor Costs

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The productivity of workers, which has underpinned the nation's record economic expansion, grew more strongly than expected in the third quarter even as some inflation pressures increased, the Labor Department reported today.
The report said that productivity in nonagricultural occupations -- the hourly output for each worker -- increased 3.8 percent compared with the previous three months, below the 6.1 percent rise recorded in the second quarter and above market forecasts of a 3.1 percent increase. 
 Unit labor costs, closely watched for signs of inflation as the largest part of total production costs, increased 2.5 percent after falling 0.2 percent in the second quarter, exceeding expectations of a 1.5 percent rise.
The strong unit labor cost reading was not enough to change investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady when its policy-making panel meets on Nov. 15. "The economy is cooling, but productivity is holding up and containing unit labor costs," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Compared with figures in the period a year earlier, unit labor costs were up only 0.1 percent, the report said. It also said the second-quarter productivity gain had been revised upward from an originally reported 5.7 percent increase.
The productivity report came on the heels of other data showing that the economy had lost some of its vigor. Economic growth slowed to 2.7 percent in the third quarter from a breakneck pace of 5.6 percent in the second quarter, perhaps reassuring Fed policy makers that six interest rate increases between June 1999 and May 2000 had succeeded in cooling the economy.
And the Conference Board, a private research group, said today that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a key measure of economic activity, was unchanged in September at 105.7, in line with expectations.
Productivity growth was again strongest in manufacturing, where it increased 6.4 percent from the previous quarter. Year over year, manufacturing productivity was up 7.5 percent, its biggest increase on record, the Labor Department said.
Overall productivity in the nonfarm sector was up 5 percent compared with figures in the period a year earlier, the report said.
"It's suggesting this structural change playing out in the U.S. economy seems to still be continuing," said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at the Bank of Montreal/ Harris Bank.
The report also said that hourly compensation rose by a strong 6.4 percent, its highest rate of increase since an 8.8 percent gain recorded in the first quarter of 1992.
In a separate report, the government said the number of Americans seeking first-time unemployment benefits remained unchanged last week at 308,000, pointing to a continued tight labor market -- another potential inflation risk that has been prominent on the list of Fed worries.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales in October Up a Disappointing 2.9%

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
At the Lord & Taylor flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, decorators are hard at work on the circus-themed holiday windows to be revealed in two weeks. Sony Play-Station 2, the season's hottest gift item, is already almost impossible to find. But even as the season's rituals unfurl with predictable flourish, many retailers are preparing to deal with a rising tide of consumer malaise.
Retail sales for October in stores open at least a year, a crucial industry measurement, rose just 2.9 percent, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index. That was one of the smallest increases this year and well below last year's October gain of 4.9 percent. 
 Those lackluster numbers came after the Conference Board reported on Wednesday a sharp monthly decline in consumer confidence, and they seemed to offer further proof that shopper enthusiasm, while strong by historical standards, was declining going into the all-important holiday season.
Merchants typically generate some 40 percent of their business around Christmas. And two consumer surveys released this week held out hopes that Americans might yet open their wallets wide for the holidays and bail out retailers. But most investors and economists remain unconvinced.
"Don't count on the consumers," warned Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, summing up the darkening industry mood.
Facing high gas prices, stock market volatility and increased interest rates, many large merchants have been lowering their sales estimates during the year. The trend continued yesterday.
After the stock market closed on Wednesday, Gap Inc., which has been struggling to get its fashion mix and back-up delivery systems right this year, announced that its third-quarter profits would be slightly lower than analysts had expected. In October, the ubiquitous chain reported that sales declined 2 percent over October 1999, a performance actually better than the 4 to 6 percent decline the company had originally predicted.
Even Wal-Mart Stores Inc., by far the nation's largest merchant, announced that sales growth for the fourth quarter would be a solid but unspectacular 3 to 5 percent. That is down sharply from last December, when Wal-Mart had 9.1 percent year-over-year sales growth. Stock analysts had been expecting growth more in the neighborhood of 4 to 6 percent a month.
Slowing economic conditions contributed to the mediocre sales, but fashion missteps by some retailers may be making the problem worse. The merchants that had the right fashion mix had strong gains, most notably the Limited Inc., whose high-flying Express division reported a stellar 22 percent sales growth over the previous October. Its stores were loaded to the hilt with the hippest items -- gold-tone jeans, leather and rabbit trim everything.
"Fashion is getting a lot flashier," said Irma Zandl, president of the Zandl Group in New York, which tracks teenage buying habits. "To succeed, you want to have that pimped-out look, which is so much harder to get right than your basic khaki."
A fortunate note is that many retailers had anticipated the clouding sales picture and had taken steps to protect their bottom line. "The managements have accepted that we are in a slower economy," said George Strachan, a retail analyst with Goldman, Sachs, "There has been a lot more conservative planning for the second half. Even companies that are putting out bad numbers have their inventories controlled."
There were also reasons to hope the holiday season might yet still shine. The 15th annual Consumer and Retailer Mood Survey: Retail Holiday Outlook, conducted by Deloitte & Touche in affiliation with the National Retail Federation and released Wednesday, predicted that consumer spending on general merchandise, apparel and home furnishings would rise by a strong 5.5 to 6.5 percent in November and December.
The survey based its positive assumptions partly on sound consumer fundamentals like low unemployment and partly on a September poll of 1,000 consumers, 82 percent of whom said they planned to spend at least as much as they did last year. "Look, it's not going to be a barn-burner, but it is not going to be a disaster either," Irwin Cohen, global managing director of the consumer business practice at Deloitte & Touche, said of the holidays.
The American Express retail index, released yesterday, had similarly optimistic findings. Polling 800 consumers, American Express concluded that holiday spending would rise 8 percent over 1999. The survey also found that consumer budgets across every category of holiday spending were at their highest levels since the survey began in 1995, and that spending could exceed these estimates, because 44 percent of all respondents said they usually spent more than they budgeted.
In keeping with previous seasons, clothing is expected to top holiday shopping lists, according to American Express, followed by gift certificates and money, music, compact discs and movies, toys and games.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Less Venture Backing for Start-Ups Is Seen

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
The nation's venture capital firms, while continuing to invest at a steady pace, are bolstering companies in which they already have stakes at the expense of financing new ventures, according to an industrywide report to be released today.
The numbers suggest that venture capital financing has leveled off as investors fundamentally reassess where they place tens of billions of seed money, shifting it away from Internet start-ups. 
 The report was compiled by the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group, and Venture Economics, a research division of Thomson Financial Securities Data.
Over all, the venture firms -- typically high-risk, high-reward investors that seed companies in their early stages -- invested $25.9 billion in 1,774 companies in the third quarter. That is a slight drop from the $27.8 billion and 1,830 companies they invested in in the quarter before, and an indication that the level of venture capital financing has leveled off after exploding in the previous two years, researchers said.
"The faucet has been turned down a bit," said Jesse Reyes, vice president for global product management for Venture Economics. "We'll continue to see some slowing down over the next couple of quarters."
The figures gel with a report issued earlier this week by the Venture-One Corporation, a market research firm that measures a less broad universe of venture investors. The VentureOne report found that in the third quarter, venture capitalists invested $16 billion in 879 deals, 6 percent fewer dollars and 16 percent fewer deals than in the previous quarter.
But researchers who compiled both studies said that more remarkable than the overall investments is their composition, in particular the emphasis on investments in companies already in the venture capital portfolios.
According to the report released today, venture capitalists invested $5.2 billion in 623 start-ups during the third quarter, compared with $7.1 billion in 695 start-ups in the second quarter. By contrast, in the third quarter, venture capitalists put $18.32 billion in follow-up rounds of financing into 1,010 companies.
Sasha Talebi, director of research for VentureOne, said his firm's own research reflected in part an overly zealous atttitude toward investments during the dot-com boom. "Many of them have been burned this year, and many of them have been burned by markets that have not matured," he said. "They are putting more time and energy into making their existing portfolio companies successful."
And, by their own admission, they are putting time and energy into closing some investments that will never have a chance at success. With the public-market investors no longer favoring consumer and retail-oriented Internet companies, venture capitalists say they have begun to shed those companies from their portfolios, assuming they no longer have a place to resell their investment.
The phenomenon has resulted in a spate of layoffs and closings of Internet companies, which should continue, said Jim Breyer, a partner in Accel Partners, a venture firm.
"We expect to see a dramatic increase in the number of bankruptcies and mergers," Mr. Breyer said. "A lot of private companies are actively targeting the holiday season as a do-or-die time."
Still, the recent spate of failures far from fully dampens a historic period for venture capital firms. Investment leapt from $14.3 billion in the third quarter of 1999 to $25.9 billion in the fourth quarter, the figure around which it has hovered since, according to the report from Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Association.
The organizations said that investment in the third quarter of this year -- $25.9 billion -- would probably wind up being a higher figure as the researchers get additional information on deals in the weeks after the report is filed.
Still, the venture capitalists have for several months been reworking the balance of their portfolios away from consumer-based Internet companies. According to the VentureOne study, the beneficiaries are biotechnology companies, in which investment rose 140 percent in the third quarter over the previous quarter and medical and health companies, which had a 70 percent jump.
Investment in Internet companies over all accounted for 70 percent of the venture capital allotment, a drop from 80 percent in the quarter before, according to the report.
Mr. Talebi, from VentureOne, said his firm's research found that the percentage of investment in Internet-related ventures fell in the third quarter and the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Stamford Janitors Are Seen, Hoping Wage Plea Is Heard

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Nov. 2

 BODY:
For years, this city of gleaming office towers has prided itself on its prosperity. But suddenly, Stamford has been rocked -- and embarrassed -- by a janitors' strike that has forced the city to pay attention to its often-ignored underside.
Using sometimes confrontational tactics, the janitors have thrust their poverty-level wages into Stamford's face and made residents examine the fairness of their earning less than $1,000 a month, less than the rent for most modest apartments here. 
 On Tuesday, seven members of the clergy were arrested for protesting in the lobby of GE Capital in support of the 400 striking janitors, whose pay averages $6.15 an hour. On Wednesday, the police arrested four leaders of the State Legislature, including the deputy House majority leader, when they blocked traffic to highlight the janitors' cause.
And today, six janitors began the ninth day of a hunger strike intended to pressure a dozen cleaning contractors to raise their wages to $9 an hour and to give them health insurance. Huddling inside a tent, the fasting strikers, looking drained from hunger and cold, are camped at a downtown intersection across the street from International Paper, one building affected by the strike.
The janitors' tactics, which have included boisterous picketing outside a charity auction, have angered some Stamford residents. "People are very much aware of this dispute," said John Condlin, president of the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. "But I don't think they help their cause when they block traffic and tie up the train station."
The strikers' highly visible actions have opened the eyes of many Stamford residents to a largely immigrant work force that is largely invisible, working at night in sleek, glass-sealed office buildings. At a time when the city's building rents are soaring, the walkout has caused much of Stamford to voice support for the janitors' wage demands.
"A lot of people feel that it's shameful," said Carmen Domonkos, president of Stamford's city council, known as the Board of Representatives. "Everyone who lives in Stamford realizes that it's a boom economy and that the janitors are a vital part of a work force that helps make these building owners successful. No one I know, and I think probably even the building owners agree, you can't live in Stamford on the wages these janitors are earning."
Nonetheless, many of the cleaning contractors singled out by the janitors have resisted the demands to raise wages by nearly 50 percent. The contractors say raises that large might put them out of business.
Several cleaning company executives said they did not have the money to meet the janitors' demands, insisting that it should come instead from the building owners. But many building owners have sought to wash their hands of the matter, saying that they are not the employers and that the contractors are responsible.
Leonel Arenas, a janitor from Guatemala and one of those on the hunger strike, said he needed an immediate raise. Living in a rundown neighborhood three blocks from a large luxury office building, Mr. Arenas, who makes about $7 an hour, shares a two-bedroom apartment that rents for $1,200 a month.
Mr. Arenas, his brother and an unemployed friend squeeze into one of the bedrooms, which is furnished with a single bed, a foldout couch, a Guatemalan flag and photos of faraway relatives. The three pay $600 in rent, and share a kitchen and a modest living room. To afford the rent, Mr. Arenas works one cleaning job for eight hours during the day, and another for four hours in the evening.
"A lot of us have to work 80 hours a week to survive," he said. "The rents are way too high."
Several of the clergy members arrested this week said they were inspired by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s appearance with striking garbage workers in Memphis in 1968.
"The Reverend King said he was doing that because these workers are the least of us," said the Rev. James W. Carter, executive director of the Council of Churches and Synagogues of Southwestern Connecticut. "It's the same situation with the janitors. These are folks that nobody sees or wants to see."
The Service Employees International Union, which has organized the strike and is working to unionize the county's janitors, argues that something is awry when the Stamford area, according to a recent study, has the nation's third-highest residential rents, yet the average janitor's wages are much lower than comparable wages in other cities. In New York, unionized janitors earn $17 an hour, and in Hartford, where rents are far lower than those in Stamford, a new union contract raises wages to $10 an hour.
"The cleaning contractors who employ these janitors settled a contract in New York City this spring that includes wages at $17 per hour, full-time work, a pension, health care and a computer for every family," Mr. Carter said. "I'm not sure why 35 miles up Interstate 95 the same companies contribute to working poverty."
One reason the janitors' pay is so much lower in Stamford is that for years the service employees' union local in Fairfield County was mob-infested and did little to unionize janitors or raise their wages, union officials said. Last year, the parent union gave control of the Fairfield County local to new leaders, who then began the current campaign to unionize the county's more than 2,500 janitors.
Richard A. Wilsker, the cleaning companies' lead negotiator, said today that union and management had agreed on several issues and would meet again on Friday.
George C. Jepsen, the State Senate's majority leader, said today that he, too, might engage in civil disobedience if no settlement is reached soon. Mr. Jepsen, who has pressed the companies to raise the janitors' wages, defended their tactics.
"Even people who are parties to the negotiations have conceded to me privately that without the union taking direct aggressive action, no one would pay any attention to the janitors' predicament," Mr. Jepsen said. "This issue was out there, and nobody wanted to deal with it, and it's only with the action by the union, the clergy and community leaders that it's moved to the front burner."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ENVIRONMENT;
On a Favorite Issue, Gore Finds Himself on a 2-Front Defense

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore has labored long and hard to make environmental protection his signature issue, but in the closing days of the presidential campaign, he is finding himself in an unexpected position.
With the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, on one side and the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, on the other, Mr. Gore is being forced to defend himself as neither a heretic nor a zealot. 
 That dynamic has made it more difficult for Mr. Gore to delineate the deep differences over the environment between himself and Mr. Bush. Indeed, on oil drilling, pollution control, global warming and timber policy, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have offered starkly different views. Mr. Bush is emphasizing state regulations, voluntary guidelines and greater access to public lands for mining, logging, grazing and drilling. Mr. Gore is pressing for more federal control, mandatory guidelines and more protection for public lands.
At the same time, the debate has raised questions about how the support that each candidate has voiced for the environment might translate into practice. Mr. Gore, for example, is being backed by most major environmental groups, but in other quarters, his past statement that environmental protection should become "the central organizing principle for civilization" is being portrayed by his opponents as evidence of either betrayal or bad judgment.
"This administration tries to take credit for our economy, but they seem to have forgotten what makes it turn," Mr. Bush said over the summer, in outlining what he has portrayed as a more practical view. "Even today, in our new, high-tech economy, America runs on oil and gas and coal gained from the earth and water held behind our dams."
Mr. Gore still clearly sees the environment as a winning issue, and his campaign has tried to focus attention on Mr. Bush's environmental record in Texas, which Gore aides say should raise deep doubts about the governor's commitment to protection. "When it comes to the environment, I've never given up, I've never turned back, and I never will," Mr. Gore said at recent rallies.
Mr. Nader, with his calls for an end to all logging in the national forests and his insistence that all international trading agreements should include environmental protections, has succeeded in driving home the notion that Mr. Gore's true colors are far less green than he has made out.
"Al Gore is suffering from election-year delusion if he thinks his record on the environment is anything to be proud of," Mr. Nader said recently. "He should be held accountable by voters for eight years of principles betrayed and promises broken."
Even though the Clinton administration has disappointed them on some issues, such as its failure to tighten automobile fuel-economy, most leading environmentalists have rallied to Mr. Gore. He, more than anyone else, they argue, deserves credit for the administration's environmental achievements. Furthermore, as president, they reason, he would finally have the freedom to put his own agenda in place.
With Mr. Nader himself admitting that he has no chance of winning election, all three of the major environmental organizations that endorse presidential candidates have signed up for Mr. Gore, even while expressing what Brent Blackwelder, who heads Friends of the Earth, called "environmental disappointments with Gore."
Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, the country's largest environmental organization, wrote recently in urging members to cast their lot with Mr. Gore: "When Clinton and Gore were elected eight years ago, many environmentalists thought that internal revolution would be handed to them. It was not, and frustrated hopes have left many in a grumpy mood, as pessimistic about the possibilities of enlightened governance as any libertarian Texan. But past disappointments should not blind us to the historic opportunity before us to clean up our air and water, heal our cities and protect our natural treasures. Real people, forests and wild creatures will be significantly better or worse off depending on what happens Nov. 7."
In their public statements, both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have cast themselves as committed to environmental protection, but in laying out their views, they have left little doubt that they would move in very different directions. Mr. Bush has called for "a new era" in which he, as president, would "maintain a strong federal environmental role but return significant authority to states and local communities."
Mr. Gore has sees the federal government as the dominant force in the quest for environmental protection. He has called for a ban on logging in all remaining roadless areas of the national forests, including the Tongass in Alaska, a position that goes beyond even a draft plan being reviewed within the Clinton administration.
That approach -- along with another Gore-backed effort that has set aside millions of additional acres of federal lands as national monuments as a barrier against future development -- has been sharply criticized by Mr. Bush, who has accused the Clinton Administration of riding roughshod over local opposition.
Perhaps the starkest difference between the two major candidates in the environmental arena has been their stance on the Kyoto Treaty, the 1997 pact that was designed to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases blamed for global warming. Mr. Gore helped broker the accord, and he has remained a strong proponent of its ratification by the United States Senate.
Mr. Bush has said that global warming poses a problem but that there is not yet sufficient evidence to point to a solution. He opposes the Kyoto Treaty in large part because it requires industrialized nations to move more quickly than developing ones in reducing outputs of so-called greenhouse gases, an approach that Mr. Bush has called "ineffective, inadequate and unfair to America."
The two main candidates have also offered very different ways to combat higher gas prices.
Mr. Bush has called for increased exploration for domestic sources of energy, and has said that as president he would allow oil drilling to begin in parts of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. Gore, who would put a higher priority on energy conservation, has vowed to oppose drilling in the refuge.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Says if He Can't Run, Gore Is the 'Next Best Thing'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Responding to a radio host's lament that the Constitution barred him from running for a third term, President Clinton said today that Americans should vote for "the next best thing" by electing Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday.
Mr. Clinton's comments, on a radio show broadcast hours before he arrived here for the first of several rallies aimed at persuading blacks and Hispanics to vote, underscored the tense nature of the relationship between the president and Mr. Gore, whose campaign has resisted using Mr. Clinton more extensively for fear he would steal the limelight at a moment when Mr. Gore is reciting daily that he is running as "my own man." 
 Late this afternoon, Mr. Clinton made a case for Mr. Gore before a muted crowd in the predominantly black Baldwin Hills neighborhood in south Los Angeles. Mr. Clinton devoted much of his talk to a description of the successes of his own administration, arguing that he had made "people in Watts feel they have as much say in the White House as my friends in Beverly Hills." From there, Mr. Clinton went to visit those wealthy friends at a series of fund-raisers.
The Gore campaign has restricted Mr. Clinton's appearances, keeping battleground states off limits for fear that the president's arrival could alienate moderate, undecided voters who are leery of casting a vote that is likely to be read as a referendum on Mr. Clinton's presidency.
That plan, however, has been under negotiation between the White House and the Gore campaign all week, and Mr. Clinton's precise schedule is still in flux.
Last week, the Gore campaign was taken aback by the release of an interview Mr. Clinton gave to Esquire magazine, in which he said Republicans should apologize to the nation for impeaching him. The White House said that Mr. Clinton thought the interview would not be released until after the election.
There is no question that the president is far more popular among minority voters than Mr. Gore, and his appearance today on "The Tom Joyner Morning Show," broadcast nationwide on the ABC Radio Networks, was part of a strategy to spur a large Democratic turnout for a candidate who many minority voters say leaves them cold.
During the interview, Mr. Joyner, whose show is particularly popular among urban black audiences, lamented that Mr. Clinton could not run for a third term.
"It would be nice if we could get four more years from you. It's been a good eight years for us," Mr. Joyner said.
Mr. Clinton quickly responded: "But you can get the next best thing. I'll tell you, we've got to win this election, and I feel very strongly that we're going to win it if our folks vote."
The president has been careful not to publicly criticize the Gore campaign for what he clearly views as underusing his skills on the stump. His friends and colleagues, however, say Mr. Clinton is ready to do a last-minute battleground swing that might force the Bush campaign to pour more resources into states Mr. Clinton visits.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged today that the race is virtually tied, though he did not say in public what some associates say he has said in private -- that with the economy this good, Mr. Gore should be far ahead.
"All these polls that show it close and show Governor Bush a point or two ahead -- all those polls are premised on an assumption that African-American and Hispanic voters and first-generation immigrants will not vote in the same percentages that the Republican base will vote," Mr. Clinton said.
The rally today at Baldwin Hills was something of an oddity: Mr. Clinton has rarely appeared at a campaign event this year that did not carry a high entry fee for the participants. The event took place in a relatively new mall that was built partly by Magic Johnson, the retired basketball star, who was supposed to join Mr. Clinton but did not appear.
Mr. Clinton told the crowd of 1,000 to 2,000 people that Mr. Gore "understands the future, how it will be shaped by the Internet and the global economy." But the applause was hardly spirited, even when Mr. Clinton mocked the math behind Gov. George W. Bush's plans for spending the government surplus.
And one of the primary arguments Mr. Clinton made for his vice president was somewhat negative. "Someone has to be there if this crowd stays" in control of Congress, he said of the Republicans, "to stop their extremist action."

HEADLINE: Is Social Stability Subverted If You Answer 'I Don't'?;
Fears for Children's Well-Being Complicate a Debate Over Marriage

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The statistic has not yet lost its power to shock: about a third of the births in this country each year are to unmarried mothers.
By almost any measure, the rise in the proportion of babies born outside marriage, from less than 1 in 20 in 1960 to 1 in 3 now, has been among the most profound changes in American society. 
 "The United States and most of the rich countries are moving toward what scholars call 'post marriage society,' in which marriage would no longer be a dominant institution," said David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values, adding that ambivalence about marriage had become widespread, from feminists who believe that it harms women to young people whose parents' divorces have made them cynical about its chances for permanence.
The change has led to heated debate about family values, moral decline and fatherless children, and politicians talk about the hot-button questions of gay marriage, teenage pregnancy and welfare reform. A nascent marriage movement is pushing for premarital counseling and education and more stringent divorce laws. And this season's books include "The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce," in which Judith Wallerstein, Julia Lewis and Sandra Blakeslee argue that divorce inflicts long-term damage on children, and "The Case for Marriage," in which Linda J. Waite and Maggie Gallagher detail the benefits of marriage.
Meanwhile, many scholars are beginning to think along different lines, asking more broadly, as Tina Turner would put it, what's marriage got to do with it? Given the sizable body of research showing that children of single parents are generally more likely to be poor and to drop out of high school, the fundamental issue, they say, is making sure that children are well cared for, whether or not their parents are married.
Some even go so far as to suggest that marriage is part of the problem, not part of the solution.
"This obsession with marriage prevents us from looking at our social problems and addressing them," said Martha Fineman, a professor at Cornell Law School. "Marriage is nothing more than a piece of paper, and yet we rely on marriage to do a lot of work in this society: It becomes our family policy, our policy in regard to welfare and children, the cure for poverty."
Ms. Fineman would end marriage as a legal category, and turn the nation's attention, instead, to finding broader ways to support those who care for children, the elderly and the disabled.
"People could still get married, if they wanted to make a religious statement of commitment, but I don't think it should have any legal impact," she said. "I would like to see all the social subsidies redirected toward caretaking. For children, the important thing is that there be enough adults to care for them, whether it's by married biological parents or two or three or four others. If that's what we want people to do, that's what we should focus on, not marriage."
The starkness of the categories -- married parent or single parent -- fails to reflect a complicated reality: over the last few years family scholars have learned that many -- perhaps half -- of single women who give birth are living with the baby's father.
"In recent years, we have become much more aware that an unmarried woman is not necessarily a lone parent," said Larry Bumpass, a family demographer at the University of Wisconsin. "We found in a study in the early 90's that about 40 percent of all unmarried births were to cohabiting couples. The numbers have probably gone higher in the last few years."
So the whole concept of single parenthood may need rethinking. "It may be time to think about this in terms of unions rather than marriages," said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. "The line between married and single is getting blurred, as more people cohabit. Most of the increase in births outside marriage is in births to cohabiting white mothers. I think the big question, as we go forward, is whether we are going to extend to cohabitors the benefits and responsibilities of marriages, which is the Scandinavian and French solution, or whether we're going to try to keep a sharp line between married and not-married."
The policy in the United States, as set forth in the welfare reform law, specifically includes reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancy, promoting marriage and encouraging the maintenance of two-parent families.
Whatever their views on marriage, family scholars agree that, for children, two caring adults are better than one: between them, they are likely to have more money, more time, more resources in case of emergency.
At the same time, there is clear evidence that cohabiting couples break up more often, and sooner, than married couples, disrupting children's lives. "While cohabitation before marriage has become the norm, long-term cohabitation is rare," said Norval D. Glenn of the University of Texas, research director of the Council on Families. "In this country, most people cohabit only for a few years and then either get married or split up."
To gain better understanding of unmarried parents, the Fragile Family study is following 3,600 unmarried couples and 1,100 married couples in 20 cities, from their child's birth to age 4. At the time of birth, half the unmarried parents were living together and an additional 30 percent were still romantically involved -- and most believed they had a good chance of marrying.
By the time their babies were a year old, almost two-thirds of the cohabiting parents were still living together, and 11 percent had married. And among those who were romantically involved but not living together, 18 percent had moved up to cohabitation or marriage and 33 percent were still a couple.
"The first thing we've learned is that these really are families, even though they're not married," said Irv Garfinkel of Columbia University, one of the researchers, "and we ought to take care to support, and especially not to disrupt, their commitment to raising a child together."
Scholars of all political stripes agree that it is important to protect the well-being of children. But they disagree vehemently on whether the best approach is to encourage marriage or adjust to new social mores by finding better ways to support unmarried parents.
Even among those in the marriage movement, there are sharp divides on gay marriage and on the question of whether to penalize those who have children outside marriage or make divorce more difficult to obtain.
Robert Emery, director of the University of Virginia Center for Children, Families and the Law, where a conference on marriage policy will be held next weekend, is typical of academics seeking a middle ground: he supports the marriage movement, generally, but takes pains to draw his own lines.
"I support a pluralistic view of marriage, one that could, for example, include same-sex unions," he said. "But at the same time I believe there are benefits in publicly, legally, proclaiming the union, so I think cohabiting couples should be encouraged to marry and take on the obligations and benefits that come with it. But I don't think we should get there by taking the negative approach, re-stigmatizing illegitimacy, or ending no-fault divorce."
Others, including Mr. Blankenhorn, go further in advocating measures to encourage couples to marry: having public agencies, for example, refer unmarried parents who express interest in marriage to counseling or marriage education to help them pursue matrimonial plans.
"We're at a pivotal moment," he said. "Young people still say, overwhelmingly, that they want to get married, that marriage is their name for true love. But at the same time, divorce is becoming normative, and people spend less of their lives married."
"This idea of 'let's fix up cohabitation so it's the same as marriage' accepts as inevitable a trend I don't think is inevitable," he said. "There is a lot of evidence that marriage is good for children and adults, that they do better both economically and in terms of health and mental health."
But Ms. Fineman cautions against accepting that research as an endorsement of marriage. "You have to be very careful about the research, which does not show cause and effect," she said. "It seems to me very likely that it's the healthier and wealthier people who are the ones getting married, not that marriage confers those benefits."
Despite the efforts of demographers and sociologists to provide scientific research on the subject, the debate over marriage inevitably veers into a discussion of politics and values.
"Unfortunately, there's a culture war here," said Mr. Emery. "The most contentious piece of the debate is the underlying battle over the vision of family. It doesn't often get spoken, but the real conflict is less about the law, or the government's role, than it is about religion, gender roles and tradition. It's hard to have the conversation because it's become so politicized that people talk about the 'm' word, which carries many layers of meaning."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Out on a Limb, Another Effort To Lift the Euro

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Looking more and more like an institution that has been backed into a corner, the European Central Bank intervened in global currency markets again today to prop up the woebegone euro.
But the move was different and riskier than the intervention six weeks ago, because the European bank acted today without support from the United States or other major central banks. 
 In a two-sentence statement today, the European Central Bank emphasized its fear that the weak euro was aggravating inflation by increasing the cost of imports from outside the zone of 11 nations where the euro is the common currency.
The bank said it was "concerned about the national and worldwide effects of the euro's exchange rate, including its consequences for price stability."
The initial effect was modest. Although the euro jumped briefly against the United States dollar to its highest level in six weeks -- 87.89 cents, up from 86.28 -- it later receded and closed at 86.68 cents. That was up from 86.01 on Thursday.
"It is a desperation move by the E.C.B.," said Tony Norfield, chief foreign exchange analyst in London at the Dutch bank ABN Amro. "They are acting completely on their own behalf. The problem is that the underlying capital flows have not changed."
The intervention was the latest in a long series of attempts to reverse the euro's relentless plunge in value against the dollar. Since the euro was adopted at the start of January 1999, it has lost more than 30 percent of its value against the dollar and even more against the Japanese yen.
Six weeks ago, the European Central Bank stirred world markets when it announced a coordinated intervention on behalf of the euro, supported by the United States Treasury. But after rising a few cents on the day of the intervention, the currency soon began floating down again and hit a new intraday low of 82.30 cents on Oct. 26.
At least part of the reason for the euro's hapless position has been the increasingly clear refusal of the United States to take part in a more sustained rescue effort.
Hours after the intervention, the United States treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, said the government stood by its policy of favoring a strong dollar but said he shared Europe's concern "about the implications of the broad movements in the euro for the world economy."
The question now is: Will the central bank be more effective on its own if it has more freedom to act? In short, is it better to have the United States as a reluctant partner or to act alone as a decisive player?
Though not entirely unexpected, the intervention today caught investors off guard. Most experts had concluded that there would be no more intervention until after the United States presidential election next Tuesday, on the assumption that the Clinton administration did not want to be seen as weakening the dollar just before Americans went to the polls.
But it was clear by the euro's drift back downward that currency traders and money managers were far from convinced that the euro's revival was at hand.
Analysts estimated that the European Central Bank had intervened fairly modestly, buying up about one billion euros, or $860 million at today's depressed exchange rates.
If that estimate is accurate, the intervention would be more limited than the one orchestrated on Sept. 22 by the European Central Bank, the United States Treasury and the central banks of England, Canada and Japan. Then, the banks were said to have bought $2 billion to $7 billion worth of euros.
But the timing of today's move was fairly shrewd. By catching traders by surprise, the central bank was able, at least briefly, to jolt them out of their complacency. The central bank also moved just as the euro had begun to stage a tiny rally of its own. After sinking to the record last week, it had gained a few pennies in value this week. That allowed the central bank to reinforce a trend, which most analysts believe is more effective than trying to fight one.
"I think the E.C.B. selected a very good moment," said Martin Hufner, the chief economist at Hypovereinsbank A.G., Germany's third-largest bank. "Today's intervention decision was the signal to international financial markets that the European Central Bank is now showing its decisiveness."
The euro's weakness has already pushed inflation above the central bank's declared upper limit of 2 percent a year. Inflation is running at 2.8 percent, with the most inflationary pressure coming from oil prices, which have tripled in two years. Moreover, the euro's weakness has added a huge surcharge for Europe because oil is priced in dollars.
Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference on Thursday that inflation would remain above the designated targets for longer than the bank had originally expected. In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, import prices have surged 13 percent in the last year and producer prices have climbed steeply.
Yet despite efforts on almost every front, the euro has yet to revive. Originally conceived in part as a strong rival to the dollar, the new currency has instead become an ever-present suggestion that Europe's economy simply is not as robust or attractive as the economy in the United States.
Most analysts continue to say that the euro's weakness has little to do with short-term speculators but that, rather, it stems from the huge flow of direct investment into the United States from Europe and the rest of the world.
In Germany, a growing number of prominent economists are begging the European Central Bank to intervene in a big way and more than once. Although many British and American experts are skeptical that orchestrated interventions can have a lasting impact, some argue that now, the time is right.
But the risks are substantial and growing higher. Each time the European Central Bank intervenes unsuccessfully, it loses more credibility. That, in turn, makes each subsequent attempt even more likely to fail.
"The E.C.B. needs to make it clear that the euro devaluation is over," said Mr. Hufner of Hypovereinsbank.
In a market where trillions of dollar cross borders daily, however, that is much easier said than done.

George W.'s America

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
It's now official: We have learned far more about George W. Bush and Al Gore than they know about themselves. The press has at last plumbed the shallows of both men, and even the "November surprise," a Fox reporter's revelation of Mr. Bush's police blotter during his blotto years, is not up to Rupert Murdoch's top scandal standards. There may be little choice now but to move on to those nostalgic staples of photo-finish horse races: What if it's a tie? What if the popular-vote victor loses the Electoral College? Most entertaining of all is this year's last-minute human-interest sideshow, "Dead Man Running": If Missouri elects a corpse to the Senate, can it still purport to be the "Show Me" state?
Whatever happens on Tuesday, the presidential race remains a contest over character. It's not the immutable personalities of the two contenders that are in play, though, but that of the country. Democrats are having fits that Mr. Bush, whom they see as a nincompoop, has a serious shot at winning. But the Texas governor's unexpected prowess cannot be attributed merely to the staggering ineptitude of Mr. Gore's candidacy. Mr. Bush, who applies his selective memory equally to his personal history and the country's, may have actually caught the cultural wave of the moment. Love it or leave it, we just may be living in George W.'s America. 
 It's a happy place for many people, including Mr. Bush, who has governed Texas only during prosperous times. Not only are the skies not cloudy all day but fewer and fewer Americans remember what clouds look like. As Robert Dunn Jr., an economist, wrote on this page this week, "voters now have to be almost 40" to recall the last severe economic downturn -- the early 80's, with its nearly double-digit jobless rate. Many college students, Mr. Dunn added, think recessions are "something that happened to their grandparents."
In George W.'s America, we are inured not only to high employment, low inflation and a high Dow, but also to a whole new faith in economic invulnerability. A company like Amazon need not turn a profit to be a great American success story, and, whatever Napster's fate, many believe that there will always be a free lunch, or at least a free download, on the Web. Even as both candidates plan how to spend what they present as a certain surplus, America is merrily oblivious to the fact that Congress and the incumbent president may spend 40 percent of it on pork and tax cuts before Inauguration Day.
Since rampant violent crime is now as distant a memory as recession -- the murder rate is at its lowest since 1966, according to the F.B.I. -- we have the additional luxury of debating the aesthetics of bloodshed in Hollywood movies rather than brooding over it in real life. The apocalyptic fears of the cold war -- or any war -- have faded into the memory hole along with the sketchy details of George W.'s Vietnam-dodging sashay through the Texas Air National Guard. Also forgotten, at least by wealthier and younger Nader amnesiacs, is the Reagan-Bush activist record on restricting poor women's access to abortion and empowering anti-abortion zealots; they can't imagine that day returning any more than they can joblessness.
In its cover story this week, Time magazine sees "an electorate caught in times of harrowing change -- when the day starts with a choice of 15 kinds of coffee and five ways to get your e-mail." Latte or cappuccino? Laptop or wireless? Never in recorded history has harrowing change been this much fun.
Mr. Bush's opponents brand him as stupid, but there is nothing stupid about the don't-worry-be-happy campaign he unveiled at the convention in Philadelphia. The governor may not know who's in the peacekeeping forces in the Balkans, or whether two men or three, or whatever, have been sentenced to death in the murder of James Byrd. His only plan for some future crisis may be to get Alan Greenspan or Colin Powell on the phone. But he arrives at a time when a satisfied nation isn't all that interested in the fine print. What we don't know hasn't hurt us, either -- at least not within memory.
The broad stands on which the governor has run his campaign reflect his ethos, starting with his education policy. It may seem odd that a man who said he couldn't remember a single specific book he read in childhood would now run on his abilities as an educator. But the Bush system in Texas doesn't prize education as much as cramming for a dumbed-down statewide standardized test -- the same pedagogical theory that, by the way, allowed Mr. Bush to skate through the debates (and possibly Andover and Yale long before that).
Lesley Stahl of "60 Minutes" reported that one minority high school in Houston had no library but had spent $20,000 on test-preparation materials. An education professor at Rice told Ms. Stahl that even high school students who pass the Texas test couldn't necessarily read. But in the era of the fast profit, a quick educational fix built on the B-school principle of numerical "accountability" is no less plausible. If multiple-choice tests are good enough to turn game-show contestants into overnight millionaires, they just might work as a national curriculum.
For every other civic problem, Mr. Bush offers cheery bromides like "leadership" and "vision" and a laissez-faire, let-the-other-guy-do-it solution. Let our "friends" shoulder problems abroad. Let a tax cut and "faith-based charities" lift up the poor. Let industry regulate its own pollution. Declare a new era of "personal responsibility" that requires no national sacrifice. Mr. Bush doesn't so much resemble Ronald Reagan, who had a firm international worldview, as the Republicans who presided over the 1920's boom but were gone by the crash: Warren Harding, a likably lightweight senator drafted by his party's powers-that-be as their genial front man, and Calvin Coolidge, Harding's successor. Coolidge's sole credo was the rock-ribbed Republicanism of huge tax cuts (the estate tax included) that largely benefited the wealthy, and minimalist government.
"His frugality sanctified an age of waste, his simplicity an age of luxury, his taciturnity an age of ballyhoo," Arthur Schlesinger Jr. once wrote of Coolidge. "He was the moral symbol the times seemed to demand." Substitute "inarticulateness" for "taciturnity" and George W. may be the moral cheerleader our own, much different age of luxury demands. His personal history -- in which his business failures have always been bailed out by an old-boy network -- and his policies both fit the revised American Dream of our turn-of-the-century, in which the right connections, the leveraging of other people's money and the receiving of stock options are way cooler than the old Horatio Alger rags-to-riches attributes of hard work and business-building. Such is the current preference for the deal-maker over the titan, no one looks askance when it's reported that Mr. Bush puts in less than banker's hours as chief executive of Texas, much of them devoted to P.R. duties. In 2000, the fool is the guy who works 24/7 and lets us see all the sweat.
That would be Al Gore, who is a hyperventilating fount of worst-case scenarios and details we don't want to bone up on (Dingell-Norwood, anyone?). He is the truly stupid one, for he has given George W. the opening to embody the contented America that his own administration helped to create, even as he has failed to weave all his endless policy details into an articulate message that might offer more than populist sloganeering as an alternative to don't-worry-be-happy. The vice president hasn't even been able to make his criticism of his opponent coherent. "I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience," he lied to Jim Lehrer in his very first answer in the first debate -- even though he had questioned it in the past (and rightly so).
Mr. Bush, by contrast, has never backed away from his consistent critique of Mr. Gore -- "He seems guided by polls and focus groups that drain politics of its courage" -- and the vice president's inability to give a direct, unequivocal answer to almost any question put to him made the accusation stick. As for the courage of Mr. Bush's politics, it isn't of greatest-generation caliber, but it may well befit his America. It's the courage to say and do nothing that might disturb the country during one of its longest-running naps.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Held at 3.9% Last Month

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The unemployment rate remained at a 30-year low last month, even as evidence mounted that the nation's economic growth is slowing.
American companies continue to add jobs, employing 117,000 more people in October than in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. But that increase was significantly lower than during the first half of this year or during the previous three years. 
 Combined with other reports this week that showed falling consumer confidence and slowing growth in productivity and retail sales, the jobs data suggest that the Federal Reserve will almost certainly not raise interest rates at either of its two remaining meetings this year, economists said. The Fed has raised rates six times in the last year and a half, and the growth of corporate and consumer spending has slowed in response, economists say.
Still, the 10-year economic boom, the longest in United States history, shows little evidence of ending. The unemployment rate remained 3.9 percent last month and has not exceeded 4.1 percent for more than a year. The jobless rate for Hispanics fell slightly in October, to 5 percent, and is now at the lowest level in the 27 years the government has tracked it.
"This is a happy continuation, at a slightly less hectic pace, of a long expansion," said Chris Varvares, the president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis.
The unemployment report was the final piece of major economic data to be released before the election Tuesday, and it means voters will go to the polls with a historically strong economy but one that is modestly weakening.
Since 1993, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore took office, the unemployment rate has declined from 7.3 percent to its current 3.9 percent. It is the lowest level for a presidential election since 1968.
But as was the case that year, the Democratic Party is struggling to retain control of the White House in spite of the economy. Then, a party badly divided by the Vietnam War was swept from office by Richard M. Nixon. This year, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas holds a slight advantage over Mr. Gore in national polls, although the vice president leads in some tallies of state-by-state polls intended to predict the Electoral College result.
Mr. Gore's campaign aides used yesterday's report in their latest attempt to tie the economic boom to the current administration and to persuade voters to stay the course. "We didn't get here by accident," said Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor, who has campaigned for Mr. Gore. Ms. Herman said Mr. Gore would continue the government's policy of lowering the national debt and would further increase productivity by investing in education and technology.
Mr. Bush has said that the government does not deserve credit for the boom and that Mr. Gore's spending plans would lead to higher interest rates, which would end the expansion. "The American people should be proud of their hard work, and they recognize that jobs are created by the private sector," said Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign spokesman.
Part of Mr. Gore's struggle to receive credit for the boom, economists say, stems from the fact that wage growth has remained mild for most Americans despite the tight labor markets. Last month, hourly wages ticked up 0.4 percent, ahead of September's pace, but wages are still growing only slightly faster than inflation this year. If inflation catches up over the next two months, this would be the first year since 1996 in which real wages did not jump.
More broadly, between 1992 and 1999, the median hourly wage for workers grew 2.7 percent, when adjusted for inflation, according to data collected by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. The main reason that families earn higher real wages than they did eight years ago is that many people are working longer hours.
Last month, however, the average workweek declined slightly to 34.3 hours, suggesting that the slowing economy is lowering companies' need for production. Overtime hours in manufacturing showed a particularly steep drop.
"To me, the labor market is not as tight as the 3.9 percent number indicates," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis. For instance, the portion of the population that is employed has actually fallen slightly in recent months, indicating that there remains an untapped labor pool in the United States, even if it is a small one. (Because the unemployment rate counts only those people who lack a job and are searching for one, it can remain constant even as the portion of employed Americans drops.)
Still, economists said the acceleration of wage growth last month represented the one reason for concern in the jobs report. With economic growth slowing significantly in recent months, the Federal Reserve could be stuck wanting to lower interest rates to jump-start growth while also wanting to raise rates to head off inflation.
For now, analysts expect the Fed to choose a middle course of inaction. In a recent survey of 21 economists who follow monetary policy, all of them predicted that the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making panel, would leave rates unchanged for the rest of the year. Only one-third of the analysts thought a rate change was likely in the next year, according to Macroeconomic Advisers.
Construction companies gave the nation's payrolls the biggest lift last month, adding 34,000 jobs, the government said. The recent decline in mortgage rates and an unusually dry month of October probably increased the amount of homebuilding, said Thomas L. Nardone, head of the government division that compiles the employment report.
The overall unemployment rate for teenagers continued falling last month, dropping to 12.6 percent; it had been 14.4 percent in August, adjusted for seasonal variations. The jobless rate for blacks increased to 7.3 percent, from 7 percent, while the rate for whites fell slightly, to 3.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Joseph Greenwald, 82, Delegate To International Trade Groups

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Joseph A. Greenwald, a diplomat who helped guide international trade policy for the United States over two decades, died on Monday in Washington. He was 82.
The cause was leukemia, said his son John. 
 Mr. Greenwald was appointed in 1969 to the post of ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, which represents industrialized countries. In 1972, he left that position to become the United States representative to the European Common Market in Brussels.
Mr. Greenwald graduated from the University of Chicago in 1941 and served in the merchant marine during World War II.
In 1947, he joined the State Department as an economist, and he earned a law degree from Georgetown University in 1951.
His government service spanned a time in which tariffs and trade barriers were reduced and the scope of global trade expanded drastically.
In 1952, he became a representative to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the worldwide agreement that covered state subsidies, tariffs and other trade measures. A year later, as a delegate to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, he sought to negotiate increased trade between the two sectors of a divided Europe.
By the 1960's, Mr. Greenwald was forced to grapple with what would became a recurring trade theme in the decades that followed: how to financially stimulate the developing world through international trade. He led the United States' effort to give more favorable tariff treatment to developing nations.
After leaving government in 1976, Mr. Greenwald became the president of the Japanese subsidiary of the Bendix Corporation and oversaw its operations in Asia.
He then practiced international law, serving as an arbitrator in international trade disputes.
In addition to his son John, Mr. Greenwald is survived by his wife, Virginia Doyle Greenwald, of Washington; another son, Bruce, of New York; a daughter, Jane, of San Francisco; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Judicial Threat to Clean Water

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's continuing debate over federal power reached a critical juncture on Tuesday. The justices heard arguments in a closely watched case from Illinois with potentially devastating consequences for environmental protection and, more broadly, Congress's traditional authority under the Constitution's Commerce Clause to address pressing issues of national concern.
At issue was a decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to deny a permit to a group of local governments in Illinois that wanted to build a landfill at a site dotted with dozens of isolated ponds that serve as habitats for migratory birds. The local townships disputed the federal government's jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, contending that Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce does not extend to regulating isolated waters within one state in order to protect migratory birds. 
 That argument was properly rejected by a lower appellate court last year. The court noted that the cumulative effect on the economy of the "millions of people" who hunt, trap or observe migratory birds was such that the preservation of habitat protecting these birds was properly a matter of federal interest. Even if there were no effect on commerce from the destruction of a particular isolated habitat, the ruling said, "the aggregate effect is clear, and that is all the Commerce Clause requires."
Should the justices reject this "aggregate effects" analysis, it would call into question a slew of environmental laws, as well as civil rights statutes that rely on a broad definition of Congress's Commerce Clause authority -- a point underscored in a thoughtful brief filed by an impressive coalition of civil rights and public interest groups. Those on the other side scoff that the reach of Congress's Commerce Clause power should not be defined by the migratory habits of birds. That obscures the point. What is being regulated here is waste disposal, an economic activity plainly within the scope of Congress's commerce power.
In the end, however, the court may not reach the constitutional issue, instead deciding the case on statutory grounds. A number of justices seemed inclined toward a ruling that would focus on language in the 1972 Clean Water Act giving the Army Corps authority over "navigable waters." From the tone of their comments, these judges could well decide that "navigable waters" do not include isolated ponds.
However, such a ruling would overturn a quarter-century of sound regulatory practice and judicial interpretation. It would also ignore wording elsewhere in the statute, as well as legislative history that demonstrates Congress's desire to broadly protect the nation's waters and wetlands, navigable or otherwise. Indeed, Congress debated -- and rejected -- a "navigability" requirement when it amended the Clean Water Act in 1977. A cramped reading of the statute or the Constitution in this case will be a major setback not only for the birds but for cleaner water everywhere.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PRESIDENT;
After 'Next Best' Thing, Clinton Carefully Praises Gore

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3

 BODY:
The crowd yelled, "Four more years! Four more years!" and their cheers brought a huge smile to President Clinton.
But pleased as he might have been by his reception here and in nearby Oakland today, Mr. Clinton carefully avoided a repeat of his declaration on Thursday that Vice President Al Gore would be the "next best thing" to a third term. Instead, he roared through Northern California, making a more spirited argument for his vice president than Mr. Gore sometimes makes for himself. 
 "They want to build on what is working," Mr. Clinton said at a rally in Oakland this morning that drew about 7,000 people. Americans who want to "keep the prosperity going," he said time and again today, "only have one choice: Al Gore, Joe Lieberman and the Democrats."
Mr. Clinton arrived here as polls showed that the race was tightening in California, even though Mr. Gore still held a lead of three to eight percentage points. And for the first time in his visit, Mr. Clinton himself seemed energized, campaigning with the kind of vigor he has usually reserved for his own races.
If the Gore campaign was still angry about Mr. Clinton's off-hand comment to a radio interviewer on Thursday that electing Mr. Gore was the next best alternative to a third Clinton term, its officials were hiding their anger. The comment, one official said, was driven off the air by reports of Gov. George W. Bush's arrest 24 years ago for driving under the influence of alcohol.
"It didn't do us any real damage," one senior campaign official said.
Mr. Clinton himself, aides said, seemed surprised that his comment had caused a flurry and joked that he should be "read my Miranda rights" before every campaign appearance, presumably starting with his right to remain silent.
The debate between the White House and the Gore campaign about where and whether Mr. Clinton should appear has clearly been resolved in favor of the Gore camp, which has feared the president could overshadow their candidate. He will spend Saturday in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem, urging minorities to vote and stumping for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in what appears to be an increasingly tight Senate race.
Saturday night the president will go home to Little Rock, Ark., the only swing state Mr. Gore's campaign is allowing him to visit. It appears unlikely that he will go to Detroit, where there had been discussion of his appearing in an effort to court Michigan, a state vital to Mr. Gore's pursuit of an electoral college victory.
In Oakland today, Mr. Clinton seemed to take joy in ridiculing Gov. George W. Bush's math, trying to reinforce the sense that the Texas governor has not added up his own plan.
"Look, this is simple math," Mr. Clinton said. "The surplus is supposed to be $2 trillion. I doubt if it will be that much, but let's give our Republican friends that." He quoted Mr. Bush's call for a $1.6 billion tax cut over the next 10 years, and said that the effort to privatize part of the Social Security program would cost another $1 trillion. And Mr. Bush, he said, has "promised some spending -- about $500 billion," adding up to $3.1 trillion.
"That's the problem with their economics," Mr. Clinton said. "Three point one trillion is bigger than $2 trillion."
He was talking to the converted, a cheering crowd that screamed "Thank you, Bill," and included many Asian-Americans, Hispanics and other minorities. Norman Y. Mineta, a former California congressman recently appointed secretary of commerce, declared: "I'm not from central casting. I'm the secretary of commerce!"
California's lieutenant governor, Cruz M. Bustamante, drew hoots and laughter when he warmed up the crowd for Mr. Clinton by declaring "We don't need no son of a Bush!"
Mr. Clinton was careful to avoid direct attacks, but he was clearly not squelching them. He then went on to a boisterous rally in San Francisco, where he repeated much of his Oakland speech, and then to San Jose, before flying back to New York this evening.

HEADLINE: In Blow to True North, Chrysler Shifts Ad Accounts to Omnicom

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
In one of the largest consolidations ever of advertising assignments by a giant marketer, the Chrysler Group said late yesterday that it had decided to use units of the Omnicom Group in New York to handle its worldwide creative and media accounts, with billings estimated at $1.8 billion.
The decision, effective in six months or less, came after a two-month review that pitted Omnicom against True North Communications in Chicago. Both agency companies have for many years divided the assignments to create Chrysler Group corporate and product campaigns as well as buy commercial time and advertising space for those ads. 
 The loss of the work is a devastating blow to True North because those assignments accounted for about $140 million, or 9 percent of total revenue, and as much as 15 percent of total earnings.
"This has been a very tough decision," said Arthur C. Liebler, senior vice president for marketing at the Chrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., the name given to the former Chrysler Corporation, now part of DaimlerChrysler A. G. "But we think we made the right choice."
The products involved are the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Plymouth lines of cars, trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles; the corporate assignments are focused on burnishing the Chrysler image.
The consolidation is the most recent in a skein of such decisions as multinational marketers seek increased efficiency and economy in their advertising. Chrysler Group rivals like General Motors have also been consolidating creative and media tasks.
When the review began, Mr. Liebler emphasized that it stemmed solely from company-wide efforts to save money, not dissatisfaction with the work of either Omnicom or True North. DaimlerChrysler reported last week that its third-quarter earnings fell 78 percent as a result of a loss of $512 million at the Chrysler Group, the first such quarterly loss in nine years.
The trade publication Advertising Age reported that the Chrysler Group hoped that a consolidation of its agency roster would cut agency costs by $86 million, or 25 percent of the total.
"We wouldn't have taken the trip if we hadn't thought there were significant savings," Mr. Liebler said.
For Omnicom, its Chrysler Group assignments accounted for $120 million, or 2 percent, of total revenue. The consolidated account is estimated to total about $170 million to $180 million in revenue, reflecting the cost-cutting proposals Omnicom made to land the business.
The consolidated creative duties will be handled by a new Omnicom unit named PentaMark Worldwide, which in an unusual step will give DaimlerChrysler a seat on its board.
"PentaMark represents a new paradigm in automotive advertising," Mr. Liebler said, adding that with board representation, "we'll be better able to help the agency help us."
Before the consolidation, the Troy, Mich., office of the BBDO Worldwide division of Omnicom created national and regional dealer campaigns for the Dodge brand. The PentaCom unit of Omnicom, also in Troy, handled media buying for Chrysler Group products and Mercedes-Benz automobiles sold in America; PentaCom will now continue with those tasks under PentaMark.
Before the consolidation, the Southfield, Mich., office of the FCB Worldwide division of True North created national and regional dealer campaigns for the Chrysler, Jeep and Plymouth brands as well as Chrysler corporate ads. The dismissal of True North ends a relationship with the Chrysler Group that dated to 1979, when Lee A. Iacocca hired an agency named Kenyon & Eckhardt.
"It's sort of a bittersweet day for us," Mr. Liebler said. But, he added, "this was all about which partner would provide the greatest long-term strategic solutions and resources to lead us into the future."
About 500 people worked on Chrysler Group assignments at FCB Worldwide, with an equal number at BBDO and PentaCom. "We expect much of the top talent at FCB will become part of the PentaMark team," Mr. Liebler said. Some of the rest may be transferred to other True North units and the remainder laid off.
To ease fears by dealers that having all creative assignments at a single agency company would dilute the differences among the Chrysler Group brands, Mr. Liebler said, Omnicom will have the work performed by separate teams of employees for Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and dealer associations. (The Plymouth brand is being discontinued.)
Omnicom had been favored in the consolidation because it has more business relationships with the Chrysler Group than True North. An Omnicom unit named the InterOne Marketing Group in Troy handles customer relationship marketing and another, Merkley Newman Harty in New York, creates American Mercedes-Benz ads for DaimlerChrysler.
A True North unit, Don Coleman Advertising in Southfield, Mich., will continue handling Chrysler Group advertising aimed at black consumers and a joint venture between True North and the CIA Medianetwork, the DaimlerChrysler Media Alliance, will continue handling media services for DaimlerChrysler in all markets except North America and Germany.
The consolidation was announced after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, where Omnicom and True North both trade. Omnicom shares closed down 69 cents, to $87.69, and True North shares closed down 44 cents, to $37.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Russian Oil Company Buys U.S. Gas Station Chain

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Russia's biggest oil producer, Lukoil Holding, purchased a chain of 1,300 gas stations in the United States, most of them in the Northeast, in a move analysts said was aimed more at burnishing its image than bolstering profits.
The purchase will make Lukoil the first Russian company to acquire a publicly traded American one. Lukoil has been expanding its business outside Russia for several years now, with refineries and gas stations throughout eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
 The Russian company will pay $71 million for Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc., all that remains of the once-mighty Getty Oil Company. The price, about $55,000 a gas station, is negligible for the Russian company, which has had a surge in profits on decade-high crude oil prices. Lukoil's profit will top $3.5 billion this year, more than triple last year's, according to United Financial Group, an investment bank in Moscow.
Even so, analysts questioned the economic reasons for the acquisition, saying the company most likely needed a safe place to put its extra cash. While it has come a long way from the economic free-for-all of the early 1990's, the Russian market is still a risky place to invest, and businesses prefer to spread assets out over other markets.
"There are no obvious synergies between the two companies," said Dmitry Avdeev, oil analyst with United Financial Group. "Lukoil has excess cash flows that they need to use somehow."
This is not the first time Lukoil has tried to do business in the American retail market. In 1997, it agreed to make a multimillion-dollar investment to build a gas station chain at Food Lion stores. But according to Lukoil's American partner, Nexus Fuels, the money never came through, said OPIS Energy Group.
Lukoil, which produces far more oil than it can refine, said it might eventually supply the stations with its own product, though it will first buy from the wholesale market. The stations themselves will need investment if the Russian producer decides it wants to make them profitable.
"These aren't the nicest gas stations," said Chris Stavros, senior oil analyst with PaineWebber in New York. "You have to ask yourself if Lukoil just wants to milk the real estate for what its worth or put in some long-term investments."
The Getty stations were sold to the Power Test Corporation in 1984 when Texaco agreed to acquire the Getty Oil Company for $10.1 billion.
In November 1990, a federal jury in Hauppauge, N.Y., found a top Getty official, along with the Getty Terminals Corporation, a Jericho, N.Y. subsidiary of the Getty Petroleum Company, and two independent gasoline distributors guilty of conspiracy and of failing to pay more than $1 million in federal gasoline excise taxes in 1985.
Although the case was not considered mob-related, it came at a time when Long Island had become a hotbed of sorts for mafia-run tax evasion schemes. Gasoline bootlegging, from the late 1970's into the 1980's, had flourished in Long Island because of the region's numerous gasoline terminals, stations and car use.
Lukoil is Russia's largest oil company, with production expected to top 70 million tons of crude. It has gas stations, refineries and marketing companies in the Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria, and countries of the former Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Corzine Pressed Over Homeless In Campaign

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Nov. 3

 BODY:
Jon S. Corzine said today he was unaware that residents of homeless shelters and rehabilitation clinics in Philadelphia were being bused into New Jersey to work on behalf of his campaign for the Senate. But he defended the idea of offering recovering addicts and others $75 a day to put up signs and knock on doors as "an honest day's pay for an honest day's work."
Mr. Corzine put in a typically rigorous day of campaigning, greeting commuters in Edison in the early morning and elderly and disabled voters in Camden in the afternoon. But at nearly every stop he was dogged by questions from reporters about the effort, part of the Democratic Party's get-out-the-vote operation, which officials say will cost a record $3 million on Tuesday alone. 
 Much of that is going for so-called street money, payments of $50 or $75 to thousands of political foot soldiers. They are being pushed to boost Democratic turnout to record numbers, particularly among the party's base of black and Hispanic voters in Newark, Camden, Elizabeth, Trenton and other cities.
Those cadres of workers, many of whom have been working on a per diem basis for either the Corzine campaign or the state Democratic Party since as early as August, include several dozen residents of at least two homeless shelters in North Philadelphia.
Responding to a news report about the hiring, Mr. Corzine's Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, said today that he was "personally shocked" by "Mr. Corzine's willingness to hire recovering drug addicts from Pennsylvania" for the Democratic vote-pulling operation.
"It appears that he's run out of people in New Jersey whose support he can buy," Mr. Franks said. "Why can't he find people in New Jersey?"
Mr. Corzine suggested at one point today that the tight New Jersey labor market might have been the reason for the unusual cross-border hiring program. "I think that when you have a 3.9 percent unemployment rate, and we're looking to try to have people canvass in some of the neighborhoods, this is one of those places that I guess some folks might think that we ought to turn," he said.
Later in the day, he said he was still awaiting a briefing from his staff, but expressed some concern of his own. "I would've preferred it if people were in New Jersey," Mr. Corzine said in poverty-stricken Camden, where one in nine adults is jobless. "Just because we ought to be offering employment -- if we're going to offer employment -- to folks that are in New Jersey, other things being equal."
But Mr. Corzine said he found nothing wrong with using as campaign workers people who are recovering drug or alcohol addicts. "I think the issue is, they're 'ex,' and they're people who are trying to recover, trying to build dignity, and putting up signs and distributing literature. An honest day's pay for an honest day's work, I think, is a good thing."
Mr. Corzine began his day campaigning at the Metropark railroad station in Edison alongside Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, whom he hopes to succeed and was joined by Maryanne Connelly, who is seeking the Congressional seat now occupied by Mr. Franks.
At the next stop, in Woodbridge Township, the Democratic candidates were joined by Mayor James E. McGreevey, the presumptive Democratic nominee for governor in 2001, who complimented Terry Durek, a committeewoman whose home served as the backdrop of the event, on her soda bread, though she had not backed any today. Whereupon Mr. Lautenberg, who has shown a fondness for jokes at Mr. Corzine's expense, said: "Jon Corzine's bringing the bread."
Mr. Franks, who also campaigned in South Jersey, today won the endorsement of the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association, which says it has 35,000 members. In addition, the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has endorsed Mr. Franks, began running a commercial tonight that attacks Mr. Corzine for "supporting a big-government prescription drug plan."
The Franks campaign also said that its own Election Day efforts would include ensuring against voter fraud, noting that nearly 65,000 dead people remain on the voter registration lists. "We are going to provide to our challengers, in all 21 counties, the list of dead voters to make sure that Jon Corzine has not paid his way into the afterlife," said Charlie Smith, Mr. Franks's campaign manager.
In what could provide a lift to Mr. Franks -- or not -- Gov. George W. Bush, who trails well behind Vice President Al Gore in the New Jersey polls, will campaign with Mr. Franks on Saturday evening at a rally at Drew University in Madison, N.J.

HEADLINE: The Rising Cost Of Luring People To New York;
Booming Prices for Housing Make for Creative Job Perks

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Combine a superheated job market with turbo-charged real estate prices -- and the New York metropolitan region has both -- and you get things like dual housing allowances.
Dual housing allowances? John Vislosky, a managing director at the Korn Ferry executive search firm in Manhattan, gives this example: 
 "There was a president-level search for a new clicks-and-mortar e-commerce division," he said. "The executive would have to move here from the West Coast. He wanted his wife relocated to the Midwest, where she was from, and the company to buy a corporate condo for him in New York -- and also pay the round-trip air fare home every weekend. And that's exactly what happened."
Housing has rarely come cheap in the region, but the economic boom has made buying a home in 2000 more expensive than ever. The mutually escalating job and housing markets push up pay, which drives up real estate prices, causing still higher compensation demands.
So, many companies have been forced to devise generous benefits to lure the top candidates to the metropolitan region. Savvy applicants negotiate accordingly.
"It's costing companies more and more to get and keep good talent," said Matthew O. Assael, a director at the Lloyd Staffing recruitment firm in Melville, N.Y. "This may be the toughest time we've ever had."
The price tags are steep. "A relocation can get very expensive, from $30,000 to $100,000-plus-plus," said Mr. Vislosky, at Korn Ferry. "There's more creativity in sweetening the package, getting not only what you need but also for your family."
Few people land such a rich package. But clearly relo, as it is called, has come a long way from merely paying moving van bills. Nowadays, traditional devices like higher pay and cost-of-living adjustments have often evolved to include lump-sum stipends, signing bonuses and stock options.
Exact dollar figures are hard to come by, as companies rarely publicize their housing aid and may vary the deals for different people. But the variety of perks offered is widely discussed.
Benefits once reserved for executives are spreading down the hierarchy as recruiters strive to fill crucial vacancies. "It's not limited only to senior executives but goes to first-line supervisors and lower-level managers," said Toni Wayne, a vice president at Baxter Hyland Immuno, a medical company near Los Angeles, an area competing with New York.
At the Legend Legal Staffing recruitment firm in Manhattan, Nancy Molloy, the president, said: "We've had positions for a general counsel that get stock options. Now associate counsels are getting options, maybe not the 10,000 the general counsel gets, but it might be 1,500."
Despite such lures, recruitment efforts can fail when a job promotion bumps up against a housing demotion.
"We've had people turn positions down because they can't duplicate a certain lifestyle, say from Houston to New York," said Johnny H. Haines, national relocation manager for the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm. The math problem can be less house for more money, plus a longer trip to the office. This is why his firm pays differentials to workers transferred to high-cost areas.
A dangerous moment comes "when an executive and the family go out on the first house-hunting trips and reality starts to set in," said Mr. Vislosky, the recruitment executive.
Jack S. Lusk, a managing director at the recruiting firm Gilbert Tweed Associates in Manhattan, said people starting with a budget in mind invariably suffer sticker shock. "Whatever 'the number' is, it's always going to be more than that," he said. "And no matter what the number, it's going to be hard just to find a place."
A case in point: Nicholas and Ilene A. Haigh, who moved from England. They had certainly heard about the tight housing in New York, where she is from. But both are investment bankers and figured that the profitable sale of their house in London would enable them to buy one in Westchester County in the $1 million range. Their requirements: five bedrooms, one acre, top schools and reasonable commuting time to Wall Street.
"We thought we were golden," Ms. Haigh said. Crossing the Atlantic, however, they confronted platinum real estate prices.
The Haighs came in May. They are still looking.
"The market is so insane; brokers aren't even calling," said Ms. Haigh. "They say they have no inventory, nothing to sell. They said, 'You're going to have a really hard time.' " They were right.
Like many employers, the Haighs' company gave financial aid to ease their transition. The family decided to take a temporary rental, a three-bedroom house in Mamaroneck, in Westchester, and even that was traumatic.
"I looked at maybe 20 rentals," Ms. Haigh said. "They said, 'You're going to have to pay $5,000 a month.' I couldn't believe it. I said, 'You're crazy.' Can you imagine paying $60,000 a year rent?"
Some people panic. "They all know it's going to be bad, but when they come they are actually flabbergasted and may go back and try to renegotiate a different package," said Elizabeth F. Williams, corporate services director at Prudential Relocation of Connecticut.
The frenzied market nearly derailed the move of an Ohio woman, said Jean A. Conklin, an owner of Bannon Associates, a consulting firm in Manhattan. "She lost the house on Long Island that she and her kids were set on when it went for $10,000 over the asking," she said. "She couldn't believe it. She wasn't used to that, and almost didn't take the job."
Many make sacrifices. "A man relocated from the Tampa area to work for a Top-25 company in New Jersey, where he has family, but he told me he's actually losing money," Ms. Conklin said. "He paid four times for his house here what he sold for in Florida."
As tough as things are, New York does not have the nation's costliest market. That dubious honor belongs to Northern California, in San Jose and San Francisco. Experts say New York is next, with Boston, Washington, Los Angeles and Atlanta not far behind.
"It's a real big expensive deal for corporate America to move people to the East Coast and West Coast," said Dennis G. Taylor, a consultant at Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wisc., firm that advises employers. "Both locations have been ultrahigh. Now they've just gone bananas."
New employees are often put up for a several weeks in a hotel or furnished apartment or house. These days, they often overstay while seeking permanent homes.
That perk has spawned a real estate niche for corporate residences. "We have a bank that we originally managed 40 apartments for," said James G. Conigliaro, a manager at DJ Knight & Company in Manhattan. "Now it's increased to over 100."
Employers often provide relocation advisers to guide people on the region's wide range of choices. Coping strategies include modern variations on old standbys: sharing apartments even for singles making six figures, looking at newly gentrifying neighborhoods and commuting farther from the city. And because homes sell so quickly, lookers have to learn to decide in a New York minute when they see an acceptable property. "They have to be ready to act right away," said Mr. Haines of Deloitte & Touche, "because there may be somebody else right behind them."
For a renter, an employer may pay to break the old lease and cover the broker's fee and the deposit for a new place. For an owner, an employer may handle the resale of the old house, paying the projected proceeds up front to help buy a new one. The company may also pay the broker and closing costs and arrange a low- or no-interest loan or even a "golden handcuff" -- a forgivable loan that is canceled if the recruit stays long enough.
Nonprofit groups and educational institutions feel hard-pressed by the limits on what they can pay. For years Columbia University has leased 600 apartments to professors at favorable rents. But now the university is offering forgivable loans of up to $15,000 to help others buy, and is building a 12-story faculty residence at Broadway and 110th Street with 33 apartments and its own elementary school.
"Almost everyone who comes wants it," said Dr. Raymond D. Horton, chairman of Columbia Business School's management division, referring to faculty housing. "And some who don't get it threaten to leave."
Yet when people settle in, the housing quandary does not end. "When there are triggering events -- a marriage, a child, buying a first home -- at that point they're awakened and say, 'Maybe we should look at other areas,' " said Mr. Assael of Lloyd Staffing.
After six months of looking, for instance, Ms. Haigh fantasizes about switching to a branch office in Boston, Chicago or Baltimore, where, she says, "downtown is 18 minutes away and the houses are gorgeous."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: A PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICT;
Struggling Democrats Try to Hold the Line

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: MARS, Pa., Nov. 1

 BODY:
When State Senator Melissa Hart, a Republican Congressional candidate, walked into the florist shop, an elderly worker greeted her with the equivalent of a fraternity password: "They'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hand."
Opposition to gun control is an issue that Ms. Hart, a Pittsburgh lawyer, has managed to dominate in the Fourth Congressional District north and west of Pittsburgh, appearing with Charlton Heston at a National Rifle Association rally last month. This has worked, although her opponent, State Representative Terry Van Horne, gives no hint of favoring any anti-gun measures. 
 Although Mr. Van Horne cobbled together a regional sales tax proposal that The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette labeled as the next best thing to "true tax reform" in endorsing him, Ms. Hart has presented her rival as a do-nothing lawmaker with no record except support for tax increases. She calls him an absentee lawmaker who was "sipping wine and nibbling cheese with President Clinton" when he should have been voting.
An indefatigable street campaigner, Ms. Hart, 38, has run a textbook campaign, with help from the National Republican Congressional Committee and the United States Chamber of Commerce -- whose anti-Van Horne advertisements Ms. Hart says she deplores.
Mr. Van Horne, 54, has struggled with a bitter primary, the scars from a skillfully revived memory of a racist slur he made six years ago, and the hope that somehow labor can pull out straight-ticket voting in the Fourth, where there are far fewer union members today than when steel mills flourished.
The stakes are high. This is one of six Democratic-held districts that Republicans have regarded for months as a firewall against loss of the House. If they can take all six (the others are on Long Island and in New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan and Missouri), then Democrats would need to take 13 districts from the Republicans -- an awesome task -- to get a majority.
The district, Democratic for decades, opened up when Representative Ron Klink, an eight-year veteran, decided to run for the Senate against Rick Santorum, a Republican freshman. That race is also going badly for the Democrats.
Monday night the Democratic faithful gathered in Aliquippa, at the American Italian Society. The beer flowed freely, and so did the partisan insults. Mayor Jim Albert said it made him sick to his stomach whenever a Republican was elected. Eugene (Salt) Smith, the Democratic city chairman, joked, sort of, that poll watchers would take notes if anyone took any longer in the voting booth than it took to punch a solid Democratic ticket.
In a city where the last steel plant is closing along with the hospital that steelworkers built with paycheck deductions, Mr. Van Horne tried to evoke old memories, quoting Hubert H. Humphrey that the test of a public servant was helping those at the dawn and twilight of their lives. "We've always been the party of the people," he shouted.
But thousands of union jobs have gone, and workers who remain are often prosperous enough not to worry about old-time economic loyalties.
In a debate in New Castle today, Mr. Van Horne demanded to know why only the very poor elderly should get help with prescription drugs and said that middle-income elderly people should be covered, too. "Why should they make choices about going to the Giant Eagle and buying groceries or being able to buy their pharmaceuticals?"
Ms. Hart called for government efforts to "help restore the opportunity that this region has lost. A lot of our ancestors came here because this region once offered them a promise of self-determination: You work hard, you will succeed. I believe it is government's job to step in and provide that opportunity once again. That is, have a reasonable tax climate. My opponent supports tax increases. I support tax cuts."
But the differences in views between the candidates hardly seem to matter much. This is a campaign dominated from outside. The day after Mr. Van Horne won his primary, Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, head of the N.R.C.C., recalled that in 1994 Mr. Van Horne used a racial slur in talking about State Representative Dwight Evans, head of the Appropriations Committee." He apologized then, but the new uproar dimmed his fund-raising for this year's race, and while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran advertisements for a time, it has stopped.
Ms. Hart, interviewed for television, said she disliked attack advertisements. But she defended an N.R.C.C. advertisement labeling Mr. Van Horne a deadbeat because his bankrupt grocery had to settle a Small Business Administration loan. She said, "The truth is that my opponent borrowed money that he did not repay." He responds that so did a lot of people in this part of Pennsylvania in the 1980's.

HEADLINE: Large State Utility Wants Market to Set Gas Price

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 3

 BODY:
The state's largest gas utility, Public Service Electric & Gas, has asked state regulators to approve a plan that by 2003 would let the price of gas be set by the free market.
The plan, which was submitted Aug. 11, would let PSE&G adjust its rates from month to month according to the actual market price, rather than billing at a fixed annual rate set by regulators at the State Board of Public Utilities. 
 Under the current system, the state sets the price of gas annually based roughly on the market price. But in setting that price, the state also lets utilities recoup any losses that they may have incurred the previous year when the market price is higher than the price set by the state.
PSE&G, which serves 1.6 million customers in northern and central New Jersey, says it wants to eliminate that system by relying wholly on the market price. It says that would eliminate the wide, one-time fluctuations in gas prices that customers experience at the end of the year, when utilities are legally entitled to recoup any losses from the previous year.
The state's four gas utilities, PSE&G, Elizabethtown Gas, New Jersey Natural Gas, and South Jersey Gas, were granted adjustments of this kind ranging from 16 to 22.5 percent by the utilities board on Oct. 10.
At the same meeting, Elizabethtown received approval for month-to-month prices that are still set by regulators.
The utilities board has not taken a position on the PSE&G plan. But the state ratepayer advocate, Blossom Peretz, opposes it, and says she intends to file an objection with the State Office of Administrative Law, the agency that will schedule hearings on the plan.
Another effect of the regulated price for gas, which regulators acknowledge is deliberately set to ensure that customers pay less than the market rate, is that it artificially suppresses the price of gas, PSE&G contends.
The utility says that scares off potential competitors -- nonutilities, or energy companies that may be based outside New Jersey -- from the local market.
While those companies are not regulated in terms of the price they charge for gas, even regulators acknowledge that companies have little incentive to market themselves in an area where, under the current system, customers are guaranteed a below-market price from their utilities.
Despite the deregulation law, the New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, fewer than 1 percent of consumers have switched gas companies.
PSE&G says its plan would also help to truly open the gas market to competition from so-called third-party providers, which, it says, would in the long run create the kind of market-driven technological innovations, economies of scale and other factors that would help drive down the real cost of gas.
In the short term, PSE&G says, it has no problem letting other companies compete for gas sales, because it makes its profit on separate, regulated transmission fees, which its customers would continue to pay even if they all bought the gas from a third-party supplier.
"We are actually providing our third-party suppliers a better opportunity to sell to our customers," said David Wohlfarth, PSE&G's general manager-gas supply.
"It's for the regulators and the governing bodies to decide whether they want competition or not."
Another component of PSE&G's plan would let the company shift its currently regulated contracts with gas drillers and pipeline and storage companies to an unregulated subsidiary of PSE&G's parent company, Public Service Enterprise Group, that would operate independently in the nation's gradually deregulating natural gas marketplace.
Ms. Peretz, the ratepayer advocate, said she was most concerned about this element of the plan, because the new subsidiary could seek to enter into contracts that would block competitors from the state -- a situation that would allow PSE&G to set the price of gas as it wishes, without fear of competition.
"We don't want to see a new, unregulated monopoly created," Ms. Peretz said.

HEADLINE: 'Perfect' Apple Pushed Growers Into Debt

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: ORONDO, Wash., Nov. 2

 BODY:
Nearly a half-century ago, the farmers in these dun-colored valleys east of the Cascade Mountains set out to create the perfect apple. It would be lipstick red; broad-shouldered; uniform in size, color and crispness; a health food that would look as dazzling as an ornament on a Christmas tree.
In time, they refined the Red Delicious apple into an American icon, fit for a teacher's desk, a child's lunch box, a dieter's dash out the door. The growers produced these apples like widgets coming off a factory line -- far more than they could ever sell. And while many people raved about the apples, other consumers complained that the fruit did not taste like the original Red Delicious. 
 Losses piled up. And now the bill has come due. Last month, Congress approved and President Clinton signed the biggest bailout in the history of the apple industry, after the government reported that apple growers had lost $760 million in the last three years.
But while apple farmers blame their woes on a variety of troubles -- unfair competition with foreign growers, oversupply, low prices paid by wholesalers -- many of them now talk openly about their own role in the collapse of one of the last sectors of American agriculture still dominated by family farms.
In trying to create the perfect apple for major supermarket chains, these farmers say, they may have sacrificed taste to cosmetics. The growers say their story is like a fable with lessons for how the nation produces its fresh food.
"Nobody should feel sorry for us -- we did this to ourselves," said Doyle Fleming, a lifelong apple farmer who has been gradually replacing his Red Delicious trees near this village along the Columbia River with newer varieties. "For almost 50 years, we've been cramming down the consumer's throat a red apple with ever thicker skin, sometimes mushy, sometimes very good if done right, but a product that was bred for color and size and not for taste."
Mr. Fleming's son, Tye, sliced open a big Cameo apple with just a blush of color and an intense, juicy core. It had just come off the tree, and the flavor was something rarely found in a supermarket apple.
"Good apple, huh? Tell you what: It's not red enough to get the highest grade that brings the best price," he said. "But if we go any redder with this apple, it starts to lose something."
Across the river from the Fleming farm, smoke rose from an old Red Delicious orchard that a farmer was burning, after going broke. By some industry estimates, up to 20 percent of American apple farmers will go out of business this year -- even with a just-approved package of federal relief that will pay up to $30,000 each to people who have raised apples for at least two of the last three years, regardless of whether they made money.
"What happened was, a whole growing system evolved around color and shape, because that's what the big buyers wanted," said Steve Fox, the marketing director of a fruit packing and storage company here in the heart of apple country. "So they made the apples redder and redder, and prettier and prettier, and they just about bred themselves out of existence."
The growers say they established color, size and firmness standards in response to the major supermarket chains, who wanted a consistent product that caught the eye of the harried shopper. Many apple farmers have started to grow popular new varieties like Fujis, Galas and Granny Smiths, but most orchards are still producing the old standbys, at huge losses.
To watch the last of this year's plump, rosy-looking apples being picked and packed off to storage on golden afternoons in November, it seems incongruent that this industry could be in such trouble. Apples are heralded as a health food, a source of antioxidants, linked in recent studies with inhibiting the growth of colon cancer and reducing the risk of lung cancer. Apples are also rich in pectin, which has been shown in some studies to lower blood cholesterol.
But while Americans have been eating more fruits and vegetables over the last 10 years, per capita consumption of apples has remained flat.
In creating an apple that packs well, looks terrific, shines to a glossy polish and can live year-round in cold storage, the growers have produced something many of them no longer recognize.
"I was in Israel recently and bit into a Red Delicious apple grown there, and I just about fell on my back," said Paul Thomas, a retired winemaker whose family has been growing Washington apples since the early 1900s. "I thought, 'This is what it used to taste like.' They pick the apple and put it on the grocery shelf the next morning."
More than 2,500 apple varieties are grown in the United States by about 9,000 growers, though 15 varieties account for 90 percent of the crop. This year's harvest, estimated at 10.6 billion pounds, is close to the record yield of 1998.
But in the face of such plenty is calamity. "For sale" signs are ubiquitous in apple country, and bankruptcies are common. The $138 million in government money is bittersweet relief. Unlike other agricultural producers, who are accustomed to getting taxpayer aid not to grow crops or to make up price differences, apple farmers have long been a fiercely independent lot who boast of their freedom from federal subsidies.
This year, the farmers are lining up for checks in time for Christmas, with most of the money going to growers in the three biggest apple-producing states -- Washington, Michigan and New York. Some of the money is for crop loss from hail and other storms that hit farmers hard, particularly in New York.
But the biggest portion will go for direct payments to farmers for what the government classifies as "market loss," which means not selling apples at a profit. Red Delicious growers, for example, are receiving about 30 cents a pound for apples that cost up to 40 cents a pound to produce, though they sell for roughly $1 a pound in stores.
Farmers and the apple trade associations say the bailout will not do a thing to solve the underlying problems of the industry. By encouraging some marginal farmers to hold on, the government may even be prolonging the problems, some growers say.
"Those farmers who say, 'My grandpa was a Red Delicious grower, and my dad was a Red Delicious grower, and I'm going to stay with Red Delicious' -- those guys are going to die," Mr. Fox said.
"I'm going to be right there in line to get my money, but it will not change a thing -- it's a Band-Aid," said Bruce Grim, chairman of the Washington Apple Commission. "Until we change the economics of this industry, we're going to be in trouble."
All this trouble is prompting a kind of soul-searching rarely seen among farmers. "We pride ourselves on independence from government," said Kraig Naasz, president of the United States Apple Commission, the industry's major trade group. "In order to ask for help, you have to admit that things are going worse than you ever imagined."
In the ruins of the nation's apple industry, some farmers see a renaissance by returning to the days before supermarket chains dictated uniform size and color. In Wisconsin, for example, the state's 300 growers have held on by selling directly to consumers everything from antique varieties to new strains of apples. Many growers in New York's Hudson Valley are doing the same thing. These apples may be bicolored or striped or come in odd sizes.
"Most apple farmers in Wisconsin are very close to the consumer," said Anna Maenner of the Wisconsin Apple Growers Association. "People like the odd strains. There's no one-size-fits-all."
And even among Washington farmers, who produce about 60 percent of the nation's fresh apple crop, growers are racing to plant new and old varieties.
"The apple industry is reinventing itself," Mr. Naasz said. "Whether it is effectively reinventing itself or not remains to be seen."
And in the Cameo apple, some growers see nature leading them out of their problems. The apple appeared by chance in a Washington orchard, a hybrid that seems to be a cross between Red Delicious and Golden Delicious. It is freckled with white and red, and has a somewhat thin skin.
Because of its odd size and color, it would not be accepted as the high-grade, industry-approved standard Red Delicious. "But a lot of people say this is just what the old Red Delicious apple used to taste like," Doyle Fleming said.

Acting on Impulse, and Winning a Presidential Role

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
LESS than 14 months ago, William Daniels and his wife, Bonnie Bartlett, sat down for sandwiches at Art's Deli in Studio City with some dissident members of the Screen Actors Guild.
Mr. Daniels, a longtime character actor, had shown up at the behest of his wife. "Bonnie is an actress, and a girlfriend in a dance class asked us both to meet these people to suggest some names for a slate of candidates," he recalled. 
 Mr. Daniels, a successful stage, television and film actor, was appearing in his seventh and final year of the ABC sitcom "Boy Meets World." After nearly two decades of working full time on television, he was looking forward to spending time at his vacation home in Montecito, Calif., near Santa Barbara. "The commercial actors felt strongly that they weren't being represented properly and they wanted the union to be tougher in negotiations," he said. "They went over their problems. They said they wanted our input for the name of somebody who could front their slate as president of the union. Somebody had just dropped out."
"I thought a minute and said, 'Why don't I do it, what about me?' " he recalled. "They just looked at me. It was a rather impulsive thing to do. Actually it was a rather stupid thing to do."
Out of that meeting, the 73-year-old Mr. Daniels, who was never a union activist, began his bid for the Screen Actors Guild presidency and beat the incumbent, Richard Masur, last November in a bare-knuckles contest that presaged a more aggressive bargaining stance by the union. That stance resulted, in part, in a six-month strike by actors who appear in television commercials, a strike that officially ended only in the last few days.
What led Mr. Daniels to propose his own candidacy to lead a union whose presidency once served as the political springboard for Ronald Reagan?
"In some ways I'm not suited for this role," he said, seated at a chilly outdoor table in a courtyard of a hotel where the union's board has been meeting to discuss strategy for a possible industrywide strike of actors next July 1. "I come from nowhere. I have no agenda. I'm not a political person. I have no past experience in the union."
But, Mr. Daniels said, the issues facing actors -- who mostly endure unemployment, rejection and hard times -- stirred him.
"It's just that there were inequities in this contract for the commercial actors that were obvious to anyone who looked at them," he said. "And I said to myself, 'you're ideal for this, Bill.' This job has a connotation of 'you're not going to work in this industry.' Well, I don't care. I have some money. I have a nice home in Montecito. I was ready to go up there anyway."
Beyond these factors, Mr. Daniels had another reason for turning into a union leader. "It's Pollyannaish, I know, but when I said why don't I do it, I felt, well, I've been very fortunate in this business. Maybe it's payback time."
Mr. Daniels's life has been consumed with performing since childhood. He earned his Equity card at 15, when he appeared on Broadway in "Life with Father." Before that, he was in a song-and-dance act with his two sisters. Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Daniels still speaks with a certain fear about his late mother, Irene, who thrust her children into show business. His father, David, was a bricklayer.
"You wouldn't believe my mother -- she put us all in the business as soon as we could walk," Mr. Daniels said. He recalled a moment in 1959, while working as an assistant to Jerome Robbins during the creation of the musical "Gypsy." The musical starred Ethel Merman as Mama Rose, the archetypal horrific stage mother. During the first rehearsal, Ms. Merman, as Mama Rose, walked down the aisle of the theater, shouting to her daughters, "Sing out, Louise, sing out, Baby June." Mr. Daniels said, "I'll tell you, a lump went up in my throat. I almost felt like gagging. That was my mother."
After military service in World War II, Mr. Daniels enrolled at Northwestern in Chicago, where he met and married Ms. Bartlett. (They have two grown sons, and two granddaughters.) By the early 1950's, Mr. Daniels began working as an actor -- and never really stopped.
He was in the original cast of Edward Albee's "Zoo Story," played the lead role of Brick in the national company tour of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," appeared in "Look Back in Anger," and was on Broadway in shows like "A Thousand Clowns," "A Little Night Music," and, most notably, the musical "1776," as John Adams.
On television, he won Emmy Awards two consecutive years for playing Dr. Mark Craig in "St. Elsewhere," and was the voice of KITT, the car, on "Knight Rider." Among other film roles, he played Benjamin Braddock's father in "The Graduate."
Mr. Daniels, quickly finishing off his lunch, said he had to rush to a session of his union's board. "In some ways I'm getting more confidence in myself -- when I first began I didn't even know how to run a meeting," he said. Mr. Daniels added with a laugh that meetings among actors are sometimes a bit unruly and that the union had its own tensions.
"We're actors," he said. "You have an issue, and there are 18 different people who want to speak about it. And they speak beautifully, too. And you sometimes think, 'give that guy a job, he's terrific.' "

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Argentina, A Fiscal Angel That Fell From Grace

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
ONE of Argentina's top money men showed up in New York last week with a confession.
Daniel Marx, the secretary of finance, told worried investors at the Council of the Americas about the erratic performance of financial markets lately. "We acknowledge that there is an Argentine component to this uncertainty," Mr. Marx said flatly. 
 At that moment, he sounded less like a government official and more like the investment banker he had been until December. Many in the audience already knew him, and had come for reassurance that Argentina's problems would not explode into the century's first economic prairie fire.
Their minds were not set at ease. Their foremost worry is the nearly $20 billion in debt that Argentina has to refinance next year. That won't be easy, given the sorry state of investor confidence in the country. Two years after a brutal recession ended, Argentina's economy is still struggling -- growth of just 1 percent is expected this year -- and no one knows when the besieged Argentine government will be able to put together a budget. The dollar-pegged peso is hurting exports and may be too overvalued to sustain. The country's $123.5 billion in federal debt is also a growing headache, and last week, Standard & Poor's put Argentina on a credit watch, with a negative outlook.
On top of all that, a political crisis is roiling Buenos Aires. Carlos Alvarez, the vice president, resigned a few weeks ago over a bribery scandal that is threatening to unravel the ruling alliance that Fernando de la Rua cobbled together when he became president in December.
The turmoil in Argentina has set off rumors that the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund are working on a financial bailout to keep Argentina from defaulting on its loans. Both agencies deny the rumors. The fund already has arranged a $7.4 billion line of credit, of which $2 billion is available for use. But Tom Dawson, the fund's director of external affairs, said there had not been any discussion of additional credit.
As always, Lawrence Summers, the Treasury secretary who was the American official most involved in the 1995 bailout of Mexico, is keeping his cards close to the vest. He declined to comment on the rumors, but he acknowledged that he was watching Argentina carefully.
"Argentina is a country that has a strong record of reform during the 1990's, and that should serve it well," Mr. Summers said after a recent meeting in Montreal.
That record of economic reform is part of what makes Argentina's sudden volatility so hard to ignore. For most of the last decade, Argentina was a symbol for American-style, market-oriented economics. Under the guiding hand of Domingo Cavallo, a former minister of the economy, Argentina transformed itself into an exemplar of a developing nation.
But when things were going well, Argentina went off its fiscal diet. It overspent, racking up serious deficits and borrowing heavily. The current government inherited a seriously weakened economy, and efforts to restore confidence have backfired.
DESPITE Mr. Marx's assurance that everything is under control, many economists fear that Argentina's troubles could prompt a regional disaster, or worse. Argentina represents anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of benchmark emerging-markets indexes like the one put out by J. P. Morgan. If Argentina has trouble refinancing its debt or goes into default, the entire region could be hurt, as happened after the Mexican crisis in 1995 and Brazil's currency devaluation in 1999. American investors and banks have a big stake in Argentina, and a default could leave them holding billions of dollars in bad loans.
Having suffered through those earlier debacles, investors are particularly sensitive to Argentina's woes. "It's the old saying, 'Once burned, twice shy,' except here it's more like five times burned and really shy," said Walter Molano, managing director of BCP Securities, a brokerage firm based in Greenwich, Conn.
Leonardo Leiderman, head of Latin American research at Deutsche Bank, is one of the few economists willing to predict that Argentina will pull through. "Our call is that Argentina will not default on its obligations next year," Mr. Leiderman said. "But it's going to take a strong stomach to get through the weeks ahead."
During his recent visit to New York, Mr. Marx also acknowledged that difficult times could increase the temptation to use economics for political gain, which wary investors would probably rather not have heard.
"We have to turn back to basics," he said, and not give in to political pressures "that might distract us so that we do not act like rational human beings."

Of Innovation and the Uninsured

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHILE 42 million Americans are without health insurance, the plight of those who work for small businesses is among the most vexing.
Many candidates for public office have taken on the issue this year but have offered limited proposals. 
 Vice President Al Gore likes a 25 percent tax credit for small-business owners, to encourage the purchase of benefits, and Gov. George W. Bush has talked vaguely about letting companies cross state lines to buy insurance. Others like the idea of purchasing coalitions, in which many businesses get together to buy insurance as if they were one big employer.
Scores of local organizations have tried to address the matter in a variety of ways and have met with very limited success.
The trouble with most of the programs is that, while they are philosophically sound, they do not address the core problem: the insurance market itself. Even with tax credits and group rates, insurance premiums are too expensive for many companies with fewer than 500 employees; those businesses have watched their rates climb 10.3 percent in 2000, while those with more than 5,000 workers have seen their premiums rise 7.1 percent.
The insurance market suffers from what some economists refer to as "market failure," said Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, an independent research organization in Washington.
"It does not deliver the product that people are willing to buy and pay for," he said.
Most programs designed to insure employees of small businesses have either failed or been able to reach only a smattering of people. Group purchasing alliances, for instance, are often thwarted by lobbying efforts among insurance brokers, who do not appreciate the competition even when they have no affordable products of their own to offer.
While programs that incorporate private and public assistance usually fare better, those, too, can have problems in the details. Consider Small Business Health Insurance, a pilot program started last year for businesses with fewer than 50 employees in areas of New York City. The program offered commercial insurance at a heavily discounted rate -- about $100 a month per person -- but required patients to use certain public hospitals and their doctors, an idea that many business owners found unattractive. Only a handful of businesses signed on, and the program dried up.
In reality, many small businesses operate on the far fringes of the economy. And these wide-ranging operations -- whether ice-cream stands whose employees are paid very low wages, landscaping concerns that hire new immigrants, or home-based businesses with just one or two employees -- generally have few ties to the Chamber of Commerce or lobbying groups.
"The dynamics of small businesses are too fluid" for instituting regular insurance policies, said David Sandman, a program officer at the Commonwealth Fund, a health care research foundation based in New York. "They tend to have an extremely transient work force. And for small businesses that are just making it, health insurance is not always the top priority when the cash register just broke down or they need a new walk-in refrigerator."
Sometimes, however, local solutions are just innovative enough to get these businesses on board. The Muskegon Community Health Project in Michigan wanted to help uninsured workers. It went to the region's five health maintenance organizations to get a group purchasing deal going. Four of them refused, and one offered unaffordable rates. So the group decided that it would become an insurer of sorts itself.
Accepting government money and grants from the private sector (tobacco settlement money will be added soon), the group began offering its Access Health plan, in which it picks up 40 percent of the cost of coverage and the employer and employees pay 30 percent each.
The two local hospitals and the majority of area doctors agreed to the rates offered, about 20 percent above what Medicare pays. The benefits include generic prescription drugs and most medical care, and have a co-payment system that encourages the use of primary care physicians. Since the program's inception last spring, 180 businesses -- 500 people -- have signed up. And more come in every week.
IT isn't perfect. Sole proprietors, who tend to be older and in poorer health, ended up using a lot of services, and Access Health lost much money early on with those patients. Spreading the word to people who have never bought insurance has also been a challenge.
The program is geared toward workers who make $8 to $10 an hour. "These are not people the market makes money on," said Vondie Moore Woodbury, director of the project. "But we have 17,000 people here who are uninsured. Rather than waiting for a solution, we decided we would do it ourselves."

HEADLINE: Uneasy Pieces in an Era of Mergers;
Who's Afraid Now That Big Is No Longer Bad?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
LAWRENCE A. BOSSIDY had sworn that he would raise annual revenue at AlliedSignal to $20 billion by the time he retired as chairman and chief executive last April. His determination had even become a company slogan: "20 in 20," his people would say, lopping off zeros. But as his retirement approached, revenue was still $5 billion short of the goal. So last year, Mr. Bossidy acquired Honeywell Inc., creating a company with Honeywell's name and $24 billion in revenue.
There was another reason for the acquisition. Both companies were big in the manufacture of aircraft components like jet engines, cockpit controls and navigational devices. Combining their product lines promised more market power. But adding to the top line, and the profit that such additional revenue can bring, can be slow going in these competitive times, and mergers are a handy shortcut. 
 Wall Street was pleased. But soon a falling stock price forced the hand of Mr. Bossidy's successor, Michael R. Bonsignore, who had run the old Honeywell. Unable to deliver quickly enough the higher earnings Wall Street was demanding, and lacking Mr. Bossidy's touch in calming investors, Mr. Bonsignore arranged a merger with the United Technologies Corporation, another big player in aerospace.
Almost immediately, General Electric stepped in and said it would buy Honeywell for $43 billion, uniting G.E.'s aerospace operations with Honeywell's. In just 10 months, three Fortune 500 corporations had collapsed into one.
Those eye-opening moves were just one example of an almost weekly series of deals in the United States, Europe and Asia as companies jockey to dominate their industries, not just at home but everywhere in the world.
In the 1980's merger wave, no deal ever topped $30 billion. By today's standard, however, a deal with a $43 billion price tag is just a routine event in a merger wave that has swept up Citibank, Chrysler, Exxon, Mobil, Time Warner and America Online, to name just a few. The total paid for corporate acquisitions in the United States has hovered around $1.6 trillion a year since 1998, six times more than in 1993, when the current surge in merger activity was beginning to gather steam.
Not since the 1890's have mergers so extensively concentrated corporate market power. Back then, a vast new national marketplace -- with the railroad, the telegraph, the gasoline engine and the electric motor as its spine -- encouraged the creation of giant companies. Some grew strong enough to control commerce, suppress competition and manipulate prices.
Now the catalyst is the new global economy, with instant communication and computer technologies as its spine. Yet as the new corporate giants emerge and intrude on people's lives, there is none of the antitrust crusading of Teddy Roosevelt's day, and little of the populist reaction.
"There is a deeply embedded view everywhere in business today that big is better," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and consultant. "Chief executives enjoy the prestige of managing a big company, and the higher pay. The investment bankers are happy to arrange the deals. And stockholders favor consolidation because it tends to drive up stock prices."
Such complacency may not last. The giants that were created a century ago came to grief, and that may happen again if concentration goes too far -- if, for example, a General Electric becomes too successful in selling aerospace components to Boeing and Airbus, locking out a relatively diminished United Technologies. The hope, among policymakers at least, is that a handful of big companies in each industry will compete -- as Boeing and Airbus do now -- and, in their competition, innovate.
"The nature of a market society is to push toward a higher degree of concentration," said Louis Galambos, a business historian at Johns Hopkins University, "and the nature of antitrust is to push back toward a more deconcentrated, competitive environment."
Achieving the right balance assumes that the newly merged companies will function efficiently; many often don't. And it assumes that the new giants will not go under, which might force the government to step in to avert an economic crisis. Such intervention -- if it happens enough -- would dilute the market system now so widely encouraged, Mr. Kaufman said.
No word is invoked more often than "globalization" to justify the latest wave of mergers, although some of the newly formed companies operate mostly within the United States. Deregulation has played a big role, allowing huge deals in airlines and banking, for instance, that were previously prohibited. Achieving economies of scale figures prominently as a motivation, combining customers to increase output while cutting costs, often by eliminating redundant personnel.
Personalities have had their influence, too. Mr. Bossidy drove Allied's acquisition of Honeywell, and Mr. Bonsignore insisted that he succeed Mr. Bossidy as chief executive and chairman of the new company. Finally, rising stock prices have provided much of the financing, allowing companies to pay for acquisitions in greatly appreciated stock.
Whatever the reasons, bigness, so reviled a century ago, is considered just fine today.
"There is an argument that corporate concentration hurts the American economy, but we need big global players that are really good at what they do," Mr. Galambos said, reflecting the prevailing view among policymakers, business people and many economists.
So far, the antitrust laws that came out of the robber-baron era have not gotten in the way. They are enforced, sometimes aggressively so, but the enforcement is selective and flexible. The new giants -- Citigroup, DaimlerChrysler, ExxonMobil and, soon, AOL Time Warner -- are free to dominate their markets, as long as they do not egregiously violate the rules. The chief rule: Do not use market power to manipulate prices or take unfair advantage of competitors. Thus the Justice Department came down hard on Microsoft and Bill Gates for trying to control Internet access, but the government offered no major objection to the merger last year of Exxon and Mobil, and none so far to Honeywell's odyssey.
"We understand that companies have to be of sufficient size and scope to play in the global marketplace," said Joel Klein, until recently the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "This is why you have to study each situation; you cannot go by recipes in a cookbook. Sometimes mergers can lead to greater efficiency, and as long as there is real competition, that is good for consumers."
Will the competition last? No one can know. But over the 1990's, the biggest companies in nearly every industry increased their share of their industry's revenue, according to Census Bureau surveys through 1997, the latest year for which data is available.
"The only way to really make a profit," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, "is to consolidate." Excess capacity, a worldwide phenomenon today, squeezes profitability, and mergers are a popular means of reducing capacity.
 
The Merger Superhighway
Technology and deregulation are pushing the merger process, as illustrated by AT&T's acquisition of cable companies in the hope -- now dashed -- that the cable lines would form a network for local phone and Internet services. While AT&T is backing away from trying to marry cable and the Internet, America Online and Time Warner are pressing ahead, with a goal of having AOL deliver Internet services over Time Warner's cables.
Time Warner bought CNN in 1995, and now AOL will operate CNN's Web site, saving money on personnel, said Michael Kelly, chief financial officer at AOL. Time Warner's magazines will promote AOL to their subscribers, and AOL will help with subscriptions.
"One of the biggest costs in the magazine business is subscription renewal," Mr. Kelly noted. "If you think of the world as renewing online, that is a big saving. And when we have you on AOL, there can be an e-mail or pop-up reminding you to renew."
Automated teller machines, the Internet and ever-faster computers have greatly eased interstate banking, encouraging the rise of fewer and larger banks once regulators permitted it. Mergers, in fact, account for most of the recent growth in lending at the nation's 50 largest banks, according to a study by Kevin J. Stiroh and Jennifer P. Poole at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In effect, big banks acquired borrowers from the banks they bought.
Deregulation opened the gate to a flood of mergers among telephone companies, airlines and railroads, with many of the deals aimed at concentrating market share in a few big companies. Two huge lines dominate rail traffic in the United States, an outcome that the government is starting to reconsider. The biggest airlines have either merged, are trying to do so or are forming alliances. And fewer than five companies now dominate wireless telephone and long-distance phone service.
Cost-sharing also plays a role. Merging Exxon and Mobil, or Chevron and Texaco, or BP and Amoco, spreads the huge expense of exploring for crude oil over a wider base of revenue and income, a tactical advantage that has spurred the rapid consolidation of the petroleum industry.
And in almost every merger in any American industry, the workers themselves offer a helping hand -- unwittingly, perhaps -- by rarely protesting.
That neutralizes what could be a tough barrier. Mergers almost always lead to layoffs as operations are combined to cut costs. Rather than protest, American workers have been conditioned by years of corporate downsizing to accept layoffs.
"Workers' bargaining power has been consistently eroded over the past few decades, and that means there is less countervailing pressure in mergers from the work force," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
The latest surge of mergers coincided with the end of the cold war in 1990, and the blossoming of a global market that American corporations are rushing to serve. Mergers and acquisitions have become the fast way to get there. That is certainly the case at Timken, a steel company in Canton, Ohio, that makes ball bearings. Timken made no acquisitions from 1975 to 1990, but has made 10 since then, said W. R. (Tim) Timken Jr., the chairman and chief executive.
"After the cold war, a lot of bearing-making facilities around the world became available for sale," Mr. Timken said. "They were good facilities with good equipment and good workers; there was no reason to duplicate them by building new plants. We bought one in Poland, one in Romania and one in China, and once we brought them up to Timken quality, we could sell the output anywhere in the world."
Timken's revenue has risen to $2.7 billion a year, from $1.7 billion in 1990, with 20 percent of that growth -- $200 million -- coming from acquired companies rather than rising production at existing facilities. The 1990 purchase of a New Hampshire maker of miniature high-precision bearings for jet engines put Timken into aerospace sales for the first time.
"We could have built a plant," Mr. Timken said, "but this was a major expansion into super-precision bearings, and we would have had to develop new skills for that."
Mr. Timken's father or grandfather, both of whom ran the company, might have done just that, but nowadays overcapacity makes acquisition the preferred choice. "Why should we build even more if we can buy what exists?" Mr. Timken said.
Mergers have become the principal weapon against excess capacity in industries as wide-ranging as food processing, bookstores and office supplies -- even accounting firms. But no companies have been more successful in this than those that make linerboard and corrugated boxes.
Nearly all of the merchandise sold in America reaches consumers in these containers, yet production capacity outstrips demand. Companies overbuilt in the 1980's and early 1990's, anticipating exports to Asia that have not materialized. And prices fell, until box makers merged and shut down plants.
Starting in 1998, Jefferson Smurfit acquired Stone Container, the biggest linerboard producer, and then St. Laurent Paperboard. Weyerhaeuser, meanwhile, acquired McMillan-Blodel, and International Paper bought Union Camp. Smurfit-Stone, Weyerhaeuser and International Paper now account for more than 35 percent of linerboard and corrugated box production, and all three have shut down older plants.
"When you are a big-enough company, you can afford to shut down and write off what have become small pieces of yourself," said Timothy McKenna, director of investor relations at Smurfit-Stone.
Linerboard has risen in price to $475 a ton, from $340 in 1998. That is still below the peak of $525 in 1995, but the mergers and the shutdown of excess capacity have stabilized prices.
"There is no question that shareholders put a lot of pressure on managers to merge," Mr. McKenna said.
 
The Two Sides of Pricing
Stabilized pricing? Is that what the mergers in the linerboard and container industry have achieved? Or is there now enough concentration of corporate power to push up prices -- in effect, fix them -- by controlling output? The second idea would violate antitrust law, but the first is clearly the view of the industry's executives, and so far, at least, of the antitrust authorities.
"If the price were 10 today," said Douglas Melamed, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, "and you believed that ordinary competitive forces would drive the price to 8 tomorrow and the parties proposed a merger that would maintain the price at 10, that would not be so good."
But the linerboard mergers have managed only to sustain prices at a lower level. Listen to Mr. Melamed's predecessor, Joel Klein, on this point: "If you and I own a paper company together and we see that the more we put out the more we drive down prices, and we shut down a plant to curtail production and sustain prices, there is nothing wrong with that."
These are subtle distinctions. But antitrust policy shifted in the early 1980's, and ever since each merger proposal has been examined on its merits.
Thus, Boeing's acquisition of McDonnell-Douglas in 1997 reduced the number of aircraft manufacturers to two from three, but the competition between the survivors, Boeing and Airbus, is considered strong enough to prevent either from exercising too much market power.
On the other hand, when Staples and Office Depot tried to merge, the Federal Trade Commission intervened. Although other companies sold the same office supplies, Staples and Office Depot were the only ones competing for customers who wanted one-stop shopping at discount prices.
Until the shift in the early 1980's, antitrust policy was more rigid. The authorities assumed that the various companies in a market were more or less equal. Attention was paid to the number of participants and their market shares. Merger proposals that changed those numbers raised objections. But the number of mergers was relatively low from World War II until the 1960's, when the conglomerate appeared. ITT and Gulf & Western grew into huge corporations by acquiring companies in many different industries, the theory being that good managers could run any operation successfully.
By the 1980's, German and Japanese companies were outperforming their American counterparts, and the leveraged buyout became a popular way to reorganize companies or break them up to increase efficiency. Looking back, Mr. Galambos, the Johns Hopkins historian, sees in that turmoil the beginnings of the corporate concentration that is flowering today -- recreating in different form, and with antitrust to discipline the process, what happened a century ago.
Then, monopolies emerged to meet the mass needs of a new national marketplace; now come oligopolies, or a small number of big companies that will dominate their markets and compete against one another, Mr. Galambos said.
"We are moving toward global oligopoly, meaning that between four and six corporations will be the major players in each industry," he said. "Their competition will encourage innovation, and then you will have a tail of small firms that do the niche work."
 
Will Bigger Be Better?
What all this leaves out is whether the mergers of today will function as planned. The last 30 years are strewn with failures: the 70's conglomerates often failed to produce promised profits, and the 80's buyouts often reduced efficiency or saddled companies with more debt than they could repay. And merging distinct corporations sometimes takes longer than expected, or fails to produce the results that Wall Street wants.
Then, too, a giant corporation might not be as nimble as a smaller one. "The merger makers always argue the opposite; if you are not big you die," said William G. Shepherd, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. "But Sprint is doing fine after failing to merge with MCI WorldCom. We have been learning that small is often more nimble, innovative and quick than big."(On Friday, however, Sprint said its long-distance profits would be lower than expected.)
One concern is that the new giants will use their dominant power to push up prices. That has not happened yet, although Mr. Kaufman, the Wall Street economist, argues that the airlines and the auto industry are moving in this direction. Book prices are also moving up, as are milk prices set by some supermarket chains where mergers have increased concentration. "The control over pricing develops subtly," he said.
Most troubling of all, in Mr. Kaufman's view, is the proliferation of companies that, through mergers, have become too big to be allowed to fail. Their bankruptcy would produce an economic crisis.
"As you get more and more concentration, in finance or business," he said, "you move away from an economic democracy to a more social one, in which the government intervenes in more and more cases -- the very thing no one wants."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Nursing Homes, Stung By Politics

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
IT'S difficult to believe that an $85 billion industry servicing the fastest-growing age group of the American population could be sick, but sick is what the nursing home industry is. Over the last couple of years, a number of major companies in the sector, including Vencor, the Sun Healthcare Group and Genesis Health Ventures, have filed for bankruptcy.
The stock market has not exactly been kind to those that are still solvent, either. Today, the combined market capitalization of the ones still standing is around $2.3 billion. Until recently, that was a day's worth of movement in many a dot-com stock. 
 The federal government receives some of the blame. But so does the strong economy.
A. R. Rice, a health care services analyst at Merrill Lynch, talked last week about what is ailing nursing homes, and whether the companies have a future. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
 
Q. How is Washington responsible for what has happened to the nursing home industry?
 
A. It began in 1997, when the Balanced Budget Act passed. That act changed the Medicare reimbursement structure for nursing homes, and ratcheted down payments. Before then, nursing home payments were one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget. But the Balanced Budget Act called for an absolute cut in payments rather than a mere slowing in the rate of growth.
The drop in payments was so dramatic that the financial structures of many of these companies were not flexible enough to adjust. By last summer, 12 percent of the 1.7 million nursing home beds were operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
 
Q. Were there side effects to these cuts?
 
A. Even though the over-85-year-old population is the fastest-growing cohort in the country, the nursing home bed count has been pretty stagnant for the last decade.
 
Q. Is Washington responding to the problem?

A. Well, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 gave nursing homes about $1 billion back. And on the table right now is a Medicare relief package of about $2 billion targeted at this sector over five years.
Last year's money stemmed the bleeding a little bit, but not enough to cause a big turnaround. If the $2 billion were approved, it would help stabilize things.
 
Q. Last week, Congressional investigators said they found widespread violations of federal health and safety standards at nursing homes in a number of states, including New York. How is the economy responsible for what they found?
 
A. Nursing homes have become a difficult place to work for nurses and other health care workers. There are not only reimbursement pressures, but also additional regulatory scrutiny. In a strong economy, nurses and others employed at nursing homes have a lot of choice about where they can work.
Regulatory scrutiny mandates nurse staffing levels. But nursing homes need to make the facility and the environment more attractive for people to want to work there.
In a slow-growth economy, nursing homes do well, because labor is the biggest cost. In many families, nurses are second wage earners. If the primary wage earner is less confident about keeping his or her job, the second wage earner may stay on the job.
 The other issue hanging over the industry is the situation in Florida. The state has made it easier for plaintiffs' attorneys to bring suits against nursing homes.
The upshot of this has been that the number of claims has skyrocketed. Right now the entire industry is losing money in Florida, and there is an exodus out of the state. There is hope the legislature will address the problem next year.
 
Q. Will the election make any difference?
 
A. Both presidential candidates have come out for giving more money back to the Medicare system, and both endorse packages bigger than the one pending in Congress.
 
Q. So are the stocks of companies that are still solvent poised for a rebound?
 
A. The industry is bottoming out, but won't get as great a run-up as hospital stocks have had.
 
Q. Which of these stocks do you like?
 
A. Manor Care, which at its peak in March 1998 was trading at around $47 and is now under $16, is our top pick.
They are the highest-quality name with the best balance sheet. Forty-five percent of their revenues come from retail or the private-pay side of the business. The fact they are least dependent on federal outlays is key.
Beverly Enterprises is the other company that has positioned itself to survive. They have a very broad portfolio; in the last year they have strengthened their management team and are talking about looking at restructuring options. That stock is now trading at less than $5 a share. It peaked at $17.50 in November 1997.

HEADLINE: The Political Era That's Over

BYLINE: By Alan Ehrenhalt; Alan Ehrenhalt is the executive editor of Governing magazine and author of "The Lost City."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Seasons come and go, in politics as in life, without always doing us the courtesy of announcing themselves. We know now that an era ended and another one began in 1932, when Franklin Roosevelt swept Herbert Hoover out of office, just as, in a much more dimly remembered time, Abraham Lincoln's election marked a political as well as a societal turning point. But it couldn't have been quite so obvious at the moment the events were taking place.
And sometimes, in the absence of war or economic calamity, the turning of political seasons takes place so quietly that hardly anyone manages to notice at all. 
 In the last third of the 20th century, it seems fair to argue, there was a period in presidential politics that deserves to be called a Republican Era. That is to say, Republican candidates started with a natural advantage. Their ideas sounded like common sense to most of the electorate; Democrats struggled painfully to find appealing arguments, and had to choose their words with excruciating precision to avoid painting themselves into an inappropriate ideological corner.
The mathematics of the Electoral College spun out multiple scenarios for Republican victory and generated plausible Democratic majorities only in the unlikeliest combinations of circumstance. It was a Republican time. It's over now. Everything is reversed: It is the Republicans who can't quite figure out what to say, and are dependent almost entirely on the good fortune of having an opponent who inflates his resume. It is the Democrats who can draw up long lists of big states in which they know they should be competitive; unlike the elections of 1972, or 1980, or 1988, this one is theirs to lose. The fact that they may lose it doesn't alter that reality.
What was the Republican era all about, anyway? And why did it come to an end? Here's one theory:
Between the late 1960's and the early 1990's, the dominant fact of our political life was a cultural backlash -- a reaction against the larger events in America (and all the Western democracies) that Francis Fukuyama has appropriately called the "Great Disruption." The reaction was a protest against rising rates of crime, illegitimate birth and drug addiction and a defense of religion, patriotism, authority and conventional family life. Its roots stretched back as far as the early days of the Vietnam War and the urban riots of the mid-1960's, and it endured long enough to generate the Christian activism and anti-abortion fervor of the early 1990's.
Its fundamental political tenet was a consensus of middle-class taxpayers that the federal government was using their money to support fundamental and unwelcome challenges to their habits of life. For a quarter-century or so, Republican presidential candidates and strategists instinctively understood this consensus and were rarely at a loss for words in expressing it. Ronald Reagan ran for president at the midpoint of this era -- not, as is sometimes claimed, at the beginning. His supporters commonly mistook high noon for dawn.
It might be argued that these decades were not a period of true Republican hegemony because, through all the years of cultural reaction, Republicans never won control of Congress. But this is a mistake. Congressional majorities do not turn nearly as much on popular sentiment as they do on the supply of skillful candidates eager for careers in federal office. Democrats generated by far the better pool of careerist talent, and so they maintained control of Congress all through the 1970's and 1980's. But it is presidential elections that reflect broader societal concerns, and the simple fact is that between 1968 and 1988, Republicans won five out of six, all but one by comfortable margins.
This political era did not end in a single event or a single campaign, but I remember when I first wondered if it was ending. It was the day in 1992 when Bill Clinton, fresh from his coronation as the Democratic nominee, spoke at a rally for gay rights in Oregon. This was a gesture that could not have taken place four years earlier -- or, for that matter, in any previous campaign in American history. It was a small symbol of the cultural reversal that was to take place in American politics in the 1990's.
In elections since then, including the present one, it has not been the challengers to traditional values who have sounded awkward and defensive in presidential debate -- it has been the challengers to diversity, pluralism and a more permissive social ethic. We are now in a political era driven by our ongoing recovery from the Great Disruption -- and even more fundamentally, by our adjustment to its consequences. It is George W. Bush who must be careful what he utters on abortion and other lifestyle issues, lest he say the illiberal, unpopular thing.
Traditionalist reaction remains an ingredient in national elections, too conspicuous to dismiss. But in the past decade, the balance has shifted away from it, and away from the candidates whose natural instinct is to express it. To say this is neither to endorse what has happened nor to complain about it, but merely to recognize fact as fact.
One great event would seem to stand in the way of these arguments -- the midterm elections of 1994. Republicans seized control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in a campaign whose results were widely advertised as the revenge of the "angry white male" against social change. The newly chosen Republican congressional leaders portrayed themselves as custodians of the future.
Now, six years later, it seems more appropriate to think about the results of 1994 as something entirely different: the final rear-guard offensive of an era coming to an end. There is no proof of this, but there is a powerful piece of evidence: the fact that the Contract With America ultimately came to nothing and the Republicans who promoted it found their popular support eroded within a matter of months. The political events of the later 1990's, up to and including the impeachment of President Clinton, are not really consistent with the idea that the 1994 election represented a glimpse into the future. What those events suggest is that 1994 was the last political offensive in a war that was already essentially lost.
If the time of cultural reaction and Republican advantage has ended, what has replaced it? Not a time of impregnable Democratic strength, certainly. A Republican candidate can be elected president, as we may soon find out. But if that happens, it will happen much in the way that Jimmy Carter won election as a Democrat in 1976 -- against the grain of the issues, facing a stumbling opponent, and barely overcoming an inhospitable electoral map.
Sometime in the next decade or so, the underlying rules will change again. The politics of the Great Disruption -- and of the current recovery from that disruption -- will both have played themselves out. Another set of issues will drive national elections. Perhaps they will be economic issues emerging from the revolution in information technology that the past few years have brought. It would be surprising if a revolution as powerful as this one did not ultimately generate a political system of its own.
But there's no way to predict just what the next era will be like. The odds are we won't even notice when it starts to happen.

For These 2-Year-Olds, the Future Is Now

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
NO one I know confesses to hiring one of those $300-an-hour consultants on how to get your child into the nursery school for which he is best suited. Rather, people are applying to as many as 10 schools. They are asking friends about how their child can best present himself. They are whispering that School X or School Y is already full or only has spaces left for siblings of former students so hurry, hurry, hurry.
We are in the middle of the annual Manhattan ritual of applying to private nursery schools. Each fall it seems increasingly frenzied, with the twist this season being the greater use of those consultants to guide parents through the maze of applications. 
 "You do get this high anxiety," said Cynthia Bing, the head of the school advisory service at the Parents League of New York, a nonprofit organization of parents and independent schools that offers education information.
"It is happening for a variety of reasons," Mrs. Bing said. "The economy is good. People are applying to more schools.
"Then, we are seeing -- and no one has hard figures -- more families having that third child and multiple births. Some spots are reserved for siblings. And if people are applying to 10 or 12 programs, you don't have to be a genius to figure out what that does to the math."
Mrs. Bing, however, wants parents to relax and rest assured that few preschoolers fail to make a good match.
What is jarring to my Midwestern soul is how much like the college application process it seems, for these little darlings not yet ready for kindergarten.
The constant telephone calls just to get applications; the applications; the school tours and parent interviews; the interviews for your child.
Some parents say they swing back and forth between the attitude that it's just nursery school and the feeling that they have to start now to get everything in place for their child's life: schools, friends, jobs.
Most of us are in the middle. We play the game and are grateful for the good schools out there, but we know that there are many steps in the struggle to make a good life for our children.
"It's not about getting them into the right school so they can go to the right college," said Jody Emmet, an Upper East Side mother whose 2-year-old son will probably get a spot at the school his older sister attended. "It just becomes so difficult, because you want what's best for your kid and you cannot just walk down the street and find it."
Saying that it is the principle that bothers her, not the actual outlay of cash, she added, "One of the things that is overwhelming is the amount of money involved."
The process varies considerably from school to school, but many application fees alone are at least $25, with some as much as $40. Tuition can be over $10,000 a year.
One hears that as early as right after Labor Day some of the hot schools stopped sending out applications. Or that if your 2- or 3-year-old has an off day at the interview, he or she could fall to the bottom of an A list.
"At one school they gave her a pincushion and had her put pins in the cushion," said the mother of a girl who just turned 2. "I'd never given her a pin at home. I just sat there thinking, 'If she bleeds, the whole interview is down the tube.' Versus, 'I feel like we're all on trial.' "
"I feel so frenzied and out of control," said the woman, a lawyer who moved to the Upper West Side from Chelsea to be closer to good schools.
The other morning I put two applications for my 2-year-old in the express mail after I was told not to bother trying to get a tour at a school on my list that theoretically accepts applications until Dec. 15.
"I hate it," a man at the Mailbox store said when I told him I was sending off nursery school applications. He said he had recently gone through the same thing. "I think it's all who you know. Why isn't there a school in the district that is good and free?"
Bonnie, a friend who is a stay-at-home mother of two boys, said: "When I step back I think, 'What's the harm if he stays home another year?' Well, he'll be a year behind everyone else, the people in the building, friends, friends of friends.
"I know that not everyone has the luxury of being in this frenzy, but if we scrimp and save we can send our kids to schools with a low student-teacher ratio, where the equipment is good and everyone's face is well scrubbed," she said.
I have no doubt that demographics and a robust economy help create the atmosphere of urgency and competition. But it also comes from the resentment and fear of parents who feel increasingly out of control as they compete for what is deemed the best.
The culture of perfection is particularly pervasive in New York, with people seeking the perfect career, the perfect apartment, the perfect school for their children.
"New Yorkers want the best; that's why we're here," said Anne, an Upper West Side mother of two who went through the process of school applications for her preschool son and kindergartner daughter. "You go to these school tours and smell the fear. No one can just relax."

HEADLINE: Uneasy Pieces in an Era of Mergers;
The Chaos At the Core Of Prosperity

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
THIS is not what a victory party is supposed to look like.
The American economy is enjoying its longest expansion on record, and an unusually large share of the gains has gone to corporate profits. It has been years since people questioned whether the United States was falling behind Europe or Japan. Instead, other countries are scrapping regulations to try to make their economies and corporations more like America's. Those United States companies are selling the world not just diet sodas, chicken sandwiches and blue jeans, but also movie tickets, Internet access and word-processing software. 
 Yet one could hardly describe the last few months in corporate America as a celebration. One after another, pillars of the vaunted American economy have been shaken.
AT&T, once the world's largest company, is splitting itself into four pieces, reversing its multibillion-dollar strategy of the last three years. The chief executives of Coca-Cola, Gillette, Procter & Gamble and Xerox -- all prototypes of the global corporation -- have resigned unexpectedly or been fired in the last year. J. P. Morgan, the nation's most prestigious commercial bank only 10 years ago, decided that it could no longer survive on its own.
No organization seems safe. Dot-com businesses are filing for bankruptcy, and Wal-Mart has yet to figure out how to build a good Web site. Medium-size companies are putting themselves up for sale, saying they cannot compete with global behemoths, while the behemoths are suffering from currency fluctuations. Stalwarts of both the new economy and the old, from Intel to Home Depot, have watched their stocks drop as much as 50 percent in a day because of mildly bad news.
"This is the best economy I've ever seen," said Charles Pradilla, 60, chief investment strategist for SG Cowen Securities, "and here we have some of these icons in deep trouble."
All of this offers perhaps the best evidence yet that corporate America has entered a new stage of instability, one in which seemingly ascendant companies can quickly lose their way. Many causes of this instability -- like deregulation, globalization and changes in technology and on Wall Street -- may not be new, but they are coming together in particularly explosive ways. A result, analysts say, is a reminder that the very companies that have pushed for such tectonic shifts must also often pay a price for them.
"People are dealing with more variables at one time than they ever did in the past, and a lot of the changes are of a fundamental nature," said William Esrey, chief executive of Sprint and the recently elected chairman of the Business Council, a group of more than 100 top chief executives. "The pace of change is clearly at an unprecedented level."
 
Against the Economic Grain
The turmoil of recent months, however, seems inconsistent with what life should resemble in the world's richest nation a decade after it last went through a recession or had a serious strategic rival on the world stage.
"It's a wonderfully counterintuitive situation," said Adrian J. Slywotzky, a management consultant who writes often about large companies.
An unprecedented bull market has left investors accustomed to 15 or 20 percent annual returns -- and willing to punish harshly any companies that show signs of falling short of earnings targets. Those targets, meanwhile, have become harder to reach as economic growth has begun to slow.
Nowadays, companies also have to compete with all sorts of new rivals, as the Clinton administration has continued a two-decade American push toward deregulation and freer trade. Investment houses suddenly face threats from banks, and onetime phone monopolies are doing battle with telecommunications companies based on other continents. Perhaps even more important are the technological shifts that have forced companies to make enormous bets that can turn sour within years, or even months.
This notion of rapid economic change has been popular for at least five years, roughly since Netscape Communications went public amid great acclaim and the Internet became recognized as a mass medium. Management books soon appeared with titles like "Blur" and "Blown to Bits." For even longer, economists have recognized that globalization and technological change can exact a heavy price on workers, in the form of layoffs or depressed wages.
But there is more than anecdotal evidence that the shifts are taking a new toll on American companies. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is on pace to change by an average of more than 1 percent a day this year, which would be the first time it did so since 1987, the year of the crash. Change the yardstick to the number of days in which the index moves by at least 3 percent, and this is the most volatile year since 1946, according to Leuthold Weeden Research in Minneapolis.
Those gyrations are one reason for the record number of chief-executive departures -- voluntary, supposedly voluntary or otherwise. Even throughout the 1990's, when corporate governance reforms and the Internet were said to be endangering executives, annual turnover in the corner offices of America's 200 biggest companies hovered at about 10 percent. In the first 10 months of this year, it has already reached 19 percent, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners.
In October alone, 129 chief executives -- at companies of all sizes -- left their jobs, more than twice as many as in the same month a year ago, according to Challenger Gray & Christmas, a job placement firm in Chicago.
Mr. Esrey said members of the Business Council now discuss whether they should wait to invite new chief executives to join the group, in case their tenure is brief. "That concept never even came up in the past," he said.
The big question now, analysts say, is whether this instability is a harbinger of yet more turmoil when the economy truly does slow down or moves into recession. In one outlook, expectations for profit and stock growth will wane, causing share prices to become more stable and giving executives greater room for error.
On the other hand, the battle for profits is almost certain to intensify during a slowdown. Prices will become even more difficult to raise than they are now, and American consumers -- the world's most reliable revenue generators for a decade -- will cut back their purchases. As companies struggle, and investors demand action, the mergers, spinoffs and resignations may become all the more common.
"We really are in new and uncharted territory," said David Hale, chief global economist for Zurich Financial Services. "The general profit slowdown has really just begun in the last few months. And the consequences of that we don't understand."
 
A Cannibalistic Vision
"Creative destruction" has become the most fashionable phrase for describing the change. Coined by Joseph A. Schumpeter, an early 20th-century economist, it suggests that capitalist economies grow by creating new businesses that then destroy the old ones. It is a cannibalistic vision that seems perfectly tailored for the recent turbulence.
But the theory behind the phrase also offers insight into the turmoil of the last few months. Dr. Schumpeter, an Austrian who spent much of his career at Harvard arguing against many conclusions of Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, asserted that profit comes only from innovation. When all companies are making the same goods the same way, he said, none can make a profit, because they eventually cut prices to the level of their costs.
Then along comes an entrepreneur -- a word also popularized by Dr. Schumpeter -- with a new product or process. That person's company can cut prices, lift sales and still earn a healthy amount -- until rivals figure out how to mimic the innovation. Earnings then decline until another wave of creative destruction sweeps aside the old.
In real life, though, there were many ways to earn profits without a recent innovation. Some companies -- selling, say, electricity, financial services or telecommunications -- had exclusive access to a market because of trade barriers or internal regulations. Other companies prospered for years from a single innovation that competitors struggled to copy or surpass.
In recent years, however, a phalanx of political and economic forces have come together to turn creative destruction into a reality for a much wider range of industries. "The theoretical competitive model has been around forever," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Alex. Brown. "Only in the past few years has it become relevant to how markets are actually operating."
 
Of AT&T, and Beyond
 If Dr. Schumpeter were alive today, his students would almost certainly be hearing a lot about AT&T.
In 1996, the Clinton administration and a Republican-led Congress agreed on a new law intended to open vast swaths of the nation's communications network to competition. AT&T would again be allowed to sell local phone service, while the regional Bell companies it shed under court order in 1984 could offer long-distance plans.
That part of the story has been a familiar one over the last decade. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act last year freed banks and investment firms to tread on one another's turf. Utility deregulation has permitted stodgy monopolies to reshape themselves. Trade agreements have enabled companies to move factories to Mexico and to sell more goods in Europe and Asia.
In virtually every case, businesses have pushed for the dismantling of regulation and trade barriers, and many Republicans and Democrats in Washington have reached a consensus in support of most of the measures. Businesses' vigorous support has contributed enormously to the notion that globalization helps companies -- particularly big, lean American ones -- at the expense of workers. Critics of the policies point out that economic data supports that notion, at least over the short term. Largely lost in the debate, however, is the instability that deregulation causes at the very companies that are its champions.
Without deregulation, J. P. Morgan, PaineWebber and First Boston might all still exist as free-standing firms. Old-line energy companies would not be looking enviously at the market capitalizations of Enron and AES, two companies that did not exist in 1980. AT&T almost certainly would not be ripping itself apart for the second time in 16 years.
"As regulation fades away, you have a lot more opportunities, but you also have a much more intensely competitive environment," said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, and the co-author of "The Commanding Heights," a book about markets triumphing over government. AT&T, for example, found itself competing not only with Sprint and WorldCom but also with the regional Bells, an entirely new set of upstarts and foreign carriers like Vodafone.
Even when an act of deregulation took place decades ago, some effects are being felt only now. President Jimmy Carter took the government out of the business of designing airline schedules in 1978, but only in the last few years has lasting low-fare competition seemingly arrived in the Northeast, in the form of Southwest Airlines. This suggests that the broader turmoil across the economy is unlikely to abate soon.
In most industries, it isn't simply that the players are changing; the game is, too. The explosion of computing power in recent years has allowed companies to greatly shorten the time needed to develop a new product or to copy a competitor's innovation. In other words, they have moved much closer to Dr. Schumpeter's theoretical vision.
Consider the personal computer industry itself. Dell Computer recently introduced a menu on its Web site to let customers to design their own computers. The customers would choose how much memory and how large a monitor they wanted, then provide a credit-card number. It was a far less cumbersome process than Dell's rivals put their customers through, said Mr. Slywotzky, the consultant -- and within months, those rivals had mimicked virtually every aspect of the menu. Now many manufacturers have similar sites.
"It's a shocker when you look at it," said Mr. Slywotzky, a vice president at Mercer Management Consulting, but "that's a microcosm of what's going on in industry."
Clothing, perfume and furniture designers -- even toymakers -- all copy successful rival products much faster than they once did. "Time lines which used to be measured in 5- to 10-year periods are now down to 2 years," said C. K. Prahalad, a professor at the University of Michigan's business school who is on leave to work as chairman of Praja, an Internet software company.
Perhaps more significant, executives say they do not even know what products they will be selling in a few years. As a result, many are taking enormous gambles on unproven technology, hoping that they will reap similar-sized profits down the road.
For C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chief executive, that meant buying cable and high-speed Internet access companies at a total cost of $100 billion. He thought that many consumers would eventually log on to the Internet through the fat cables that were connected to their televisions and could carry huge amounts of data. In the three years since his shopping spree began, however, financial markets have begun to wonder whether wireless technology will beat cable to the punch. Within months, investors had changed their minds about the strategy's wisdom, and Mr. Armstrong decided last month that he had no choice but to abandon the grand plan. A week later, fickle investors prompted Worldcom to reverse course, too.
"When technology is changing so fast," Mr. Yergin said, "it's possible to make brilliant decisions, but it's also possible to make brilliant mistakes."
 
Prices Under Siege
The pricing pressure that has become a part of nearly every large industry has complicated the task. For AT&T, the squeeze came in long distance, where competition was driving down the price of a phone call more quickly than management had expected, Mr. Armstrong said. So even as the company tried to strike out in a bold new direction, its core business was withering.
This is a common story. Gillette tried to lift profit margins in its Duracell division by introducing an expensive long-lasting battery, and the new product was a hit. But the company's revenue suffered because its competitors were able to grab sales by cutting prices in the lower end of the market. Last month, Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor and a member of Gillette's board, forced the resignation of its chief executive.
The causes of the pricing squeeze may vary by industry, but at the heart of each is an accelerated race to find profits. Packaged-goods companies, like Procter & Gamble, have suffered as consolidating retailers have introduced many private-label brands.
In the past, those less-expensive products gained market share only during recessions, said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Reach Marketing, a consulting firm in Westport, Conn. Now, even after 10 years of an economic expansion, the most popular brand of vitamins is Wal-Mart's OneSource, Mr. Flickinger said, and the most popular dog food is its Ol'Roy line (named for Sam Walton's hunting dog).
AT&T can blame its troubles on deregulation and new technology. Car companies are suffering from a global glut of their products. A vast array of businesses must fend off more imports, and the price of those imports has fallen steadily in recent years, according to the government.
Those are the reasons, economists say, that Dr. Schumpeter has become so in vogue. "The only way to be very profitable is to innovate," Dr. Yardeni said.
Of course, innovation requires talented people to come up with new ideas and then turn the ideas into profits or cost savings. But executives at dozens of companies say their biggest problem is a shortage of good employees. They can blame themselves for part of the problem: throughout this expansion, layoffs have continued to be a core part of many strategies, leaving companies with lower costs but fewer experienced people. AT&T famously fired 30,000 workers in 1996, landing Robert Allen, then its chief executive, on the cover of Newsweek, alongside the headline "Corporate Killers."
The tight labor market has also played a role, giving many people new alternatives. And the bull market has permitted some senior managers to retire early. "There's been a general weakening of management in American business," Mr. Flickinger said.
If these trends -- layoffs, price pressures, technological advances and deregulation -- have been percolating for some time, it is Wall Street that has caused them to boil over, analysts say.
Driven by the strong performance of American business, and by what people now consider a speculative boom, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index more than tripled between the start of 1995 and the spring of this year. That is an annual growth rate of about 25 percent, well above the growth pace of corporate profits. Given that stock prices are a bet on future earnings, the imbalance may not continue for long, said Mr. Esrey at Sprint.
"It's irrational," he said. "We have not reinvented the laws of finance." On Friday, Sprint itself said that its 2001 profits could be 21 percent less than Wall Street's expectations.
But investors have become accustomed to fat returns, and they continue to look for stocks that will provide them. That is not easy, because the market has given many companies high share prices based on the assumption that they will take advantage of technology to earn huge profits. When a company announces that it will fall short of a goal, investors head for the exits. "It's like you're a tightrope walker," said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "One slip, and you're in the net."
Even a partial list of companies that have found that net in recent weeks is impressive: Apple Computer, Eastman Kodak, Home Depot, Intel, Nortel -- and AT&T. With the rise of day trading and, more significantly, the pressure on mutual fund managers to post better returns than their peers, a stock often falls harder and faster than in the past, sometimes pulling down the rest of its sector, too.
All the while, the $100 billion venture capital industry is scouring small companies, looking for the next winner. In the past, almost all entrepreneurs had to go begging for financing. Now, Dr. Yardeni noted, the money goes looking for them.
"The V.C.'s find the latest innovations, and they come to market," he said. "And then the V.C.'s find the wannabe challengers."
The picture is keenly reminiscent of Dr. Schumpeter's theory: companies that do not innovate will wither. For people wary of the dry language of economics, Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, suggests a Bob Dylan lyric to describe the current reality: "He not busy being born is busy dying."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Gloom Over Ad Shares, but Why?

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
THEIR earnings this year have been good -- great, in fact, according to many people who study the industry. Consolidation has increased their global reach, simultaneously reducing their vulnerability to problems in any particular market. And on Wall Street, there is enormous optimism about their earnings and growth.
So why are investors so bearish about advertising companies and their stocks? 
 The torrent of Olympics-related ads is past, election campaign commercials are about to end and dot-com advertising is a shadow of its former self, explained Lauren Rich Fine, a Merrill Lynch analyst. Then there is the possibility of a cooling economy. "People are concerned that this has been a peak year in advertising, and that this is as good as it gets," she said.
And so, despite stellar results for the first three quarters of this year, advertising shares have performed rather poorly.
That is especially true for the big three, which were created over the last several years through a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions: the WPP Group, based in London, whose J. Walter Thomson, Ogilvy & Mather and newly acquired Young & Rubicam units make it the world's new No. 1 advertising and marketing company in revenue and billings; the Omnicom Group, based in New York and now second, with agencies like BBDO Worldwide, DDB Worldwide and TBWA Worldwide; and the Interpublic Group of Companies, also in New York, whose agencies include Draft Worldwide, the McCann-Erickson World Group and the Lowe Group.
Within the last month or so, before their favorable third-quarter earnings reports and the Dow's rebound, they languished at or near their 12-month lows. Despite solid prospects, their shares are still trading far below their peaks of about a year ago.
Ms. Fine concedes that it may be difficult for those agencies to replicate the sharp revenue increases -- 16 percent at Omnicom and WPP, 15 percent at Interpublic, even before the impact of acquisitions -- that they enjoyed last year.
"But so what?" Ms. Fine declared. Despite the likelihood that, as corporate profitability cools, the current rate of expansion in ad sales will slow, she is predicting double-digit growth in revenue for the big agencies in 2001. And her view is shared by other analysts, who are concentrating on the revenue figures because of the possibility of an economic slowdown.
But investors also remain wary of the agencies, says Alexia S. Quadrani, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, because they confuse what they do with what media companies do. "These are not just ad companies, but marketing services companies, too," she said. "And they are at least a couple of steps removed from the weakness now seen in broadcast companies."
They are global and diversified, she said, with less than half their revenues derived from ad sales. And their manner of compensation has mostly changed. Once, commissions -- or pay based on a percentage of billings, usually 15 percent -- predominated. Now many clients pay fees to agencies for actual work done or to compensate them on the basis of performance, rewarding them for increasing sales or stimulating interest in a product.
James D. Dougherty, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said a very small percentage of these companies' revenues come from buying advertising in the United States, "even though people seem intuitively to think otherwise." Less than 10 percent of their revenue comes from commissions on advertising sales, he said.
Because Interpublic, for example, has grown so large and diversified, said Sean F. Orr, the company's chief financial officer, "half of our business consists of things like direct marketing, sales promotions, public relations, event marketing and market research -- businesses that are not media-related.
Susan Watson, Interpublic's senior vice president for investor relations, said fee-based compensation for creating advertisements resulted in the company's being "paid the same thing," whether an ad "is seen in one magazine or 50, or on one television station or on more."
In some ways, however, a downturn in advertising spending can catch the agencies unaware. Internet advertising is not turning out to be as reliable a source of growth as some agencies had hoped. For instance, Zentropy Partners, an interactive consulting business that Interpublic had hoped would compete with publicly traded firms like Razorfish, has now become part of another Interpublic agency rather than remaining autonomous. Plans to take Zentropy public were foiled late last month by market resistance to new, Internet-related initial public offerings, and by the slowdown in dot-com advertising.
Ms. Fine said Zentropy would do better as an integrated part of a larger agency than as a separate business.
But not all large agencies are doing as well as the big three. True North Communications, based in Chicago and ninth in global revenue, has snared new business in the last year from marketers like Taco Bell and Kraft. But its growth, at just under 12 percent for the third quarter, has been less than that of its larger competitors.
And its biggest client, the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler, is considering consolidating all the work handled by True North and Omnicom at one of those agency companies; a decision is expected soon. Revenue from the Chrysler Group is about $140 million, or 9 percent of the True North total. Even if True North emerges as the winner of the review, it will likely be earning less profit from handling the Chrysler assignment, because the primary reason for the consolidation is to save the company money. As a result, Mr. Dougherty, for one, will not recommend True North's stock to Prudential's customers.
BUT even the DaimlerChrysler cloud has its silver lining, according to Ms. Quadrani of Bear, Stearns. She contends that the impact of losing the account has already been absorbed by True North's stock, which fell significantly when the review was announced.
Besides, if DaimlerChrysler left, it would eliminate potential conflicts if True North combined with any other agency company, like Interpublic, that had big automotive clients.
"It would make True North a very attractive takeover candidate," she said, and that much more attractive to investors.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
A Quiet Sign of Better Days Ahead

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THERE were no headlines last week announcing it, so most stock-market bulls are unaware of the good news. But a market timing model with a good long-term record has flashed the all-clear signal to re-enter the market.
The model is based on a statistic reported each week in the Value Line Investment Survey. It is the median projection from Value Line's analysts of how much the 1,700 stocks they monitor will appreciate over the next three to five years. After being cautious about the stock market for some time, the model based on this statistic is now forecasting healthy gains. 
 Most investors are probably unaware of the statistic, or of many others that Value Line publishes. Value Line is much better known for its stock ranking system, which over 35 years has outperformed the market by a large margin.
As best as I can determine, two people developed this market-timing model in the late 1980's, independent of Value Line and of each other: Daniel A. Seiver, an economics professor at Miami University of Ohio and editor of the PAD System Report, an investment newsletter, and Peter Bernstein, founding editor of The Journal of Portfolio Management. Each concluded that this measure of Value Line analysts' optimism could be valuable in timing the markets. Also deserving credit are William Reichenstein and Steven Rich, finance professors at Baylor University who conducted a study on a variant of the model in the early 1990's.
This model is helpful for two major reasons. First, Value Line's analysts are willing to make much longer-term forecasts than others -- projecting stocks' returns over three to five years rather than just the next several quarters. Second, they have proved themselves relatively immune to Wall Street hysteria. As the stock market rises and bullish sentiment heats up, they usually resist the tendency to raise their long-term earnings forecasts accordingly.
To be sure, Value Line's analysts are like their colleagues in at least one respect: they tend to be too optimistic. So both Mr. Seiver and Mr. Bernstein determined the Value Line median needed to be chopped by 50 to 60 percentage points to say where the market would be in four years.
In Mr. Seiver's codification, an all-clear signal occurs only when the Value Line's indicator approaches 100 percent, which, after adjustment, translates into an annualized return of about 11 percent over four years.
The median projection finally approached 100 percent in late October, as the market pulled back and as analysts' price targets remained largely unchanged. As recently as the summer of 1999, that figure had been as low as 55 percent.
I concede that some skeptics may dismiss this model, arguing that it largely missed the bull market of the late 1990's. Four years ago, the indicator stood at 50 percent, implying, after adjustment, that the market today would be no higher than it was in late 1996. Why pay attention to this model now after it was so wrong?
Because it was not wrong. The average American stock has produced only mediocre returns in the last four years, the picture painted by the popular market averages notwithstanding. Indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, which weights stocks according to total market value, are dominated by a few stocks that happen to have done extraordinarily well, at least until recently.
But over the last four years, the Value Line Geometric Composite index, which gives equal weight to each of the 1,700 widely held stocks that Value Line monitors, has gained just 2.7 percent a year. That is not only well below the market's historical return of about 11 percent annually, but is also below that of simple money market funds. For investors who weren't lucky enough to be holding stocks like Cisco Systems or General Electric, the Value Line indicator has accurately reflected their experience.
So it is truly good news that this indicator is now signaling a buy.

Going to Work to Sell Business Casual

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
ONE evening in September, employees at Scient, an Internet business consulting firm in Manhattan, gathered for a party. They sipped green-apple martinis delivered to their desks and snacked on hors d'oeuvres served on fancy platters. A D.J. spun records. People danced and mingled. An hour or so later, they watched a fashion show.
But this was no ordinary company morale booster. It was the kickoff event for Banana Republic@yourservice, a marketing effort in which the retailer creates makeshift stores within companies to spread the word about its business casual clothing. The first to take part were New York offices of Scient, HBO and Credit Suisse First Boston. 
 Banana Republic, a unit of Gap Inc., is among the many clothing chains that view workers -- in their workplace -- as an important new market. Prompted by the trend toward casual dress on the job as well as the weak sales growth in many of their own stores, the retailers, like modern-day Willy Lomans, have decided to pitch their products on the road. But they are knocking on doors at the office, not at home.
Retailing executives do not expect an immediate windfall from such an effort. But they see it as a smart way to help define fashion trends and prompt repeat buying in an affluent part of the market at little cost.
"There is a lot of confusion in the workplace as business casual becomes more common in different types of work environments," said Christina Gabriel, director of Banana Republic@yourservice. "Plus, people don't always have the time to go out shopping, and to spend 10 minutes within their own workplace with someone who is completely skilled makes it really easy and painless."
But, she added, the objective is also to build loyalty with existing customers and to "register Banana Republic as a destination for business casual."
The on-site boutique at Scient was open all day and offered employees a 20 percent discount, complimentary tailoring, appointments with fashion consultants, free shipping and a two-week extension of the 20 percent discount for online purchases. At Credit Suisse First Boston, a similar effort lasted three days.
"It was great," said Yan Perepletchikov, a technician at Scient. Mr. Perepletchikov, 26, bought a shirt and two pairs of pants. "I usually shop five or six times a year, but this made it easier because everything was right there. I didn't have to waste time in stores."
Many corporations are embracing the trend toward less traditional work attire. The Society for Human Resource Management, a research concern in Alexandria, Va., found in a recent survey that 87 percent of office workers now had the freedom of "casual day" every day.
That said, many employees are confused as to whether "casual" means a less formal shirt and tie or bluejeans and a T-shirt. For that reason alone, retail analysts said, the in-office store is a good idea.
"If Banana Republic can provide the answer appropriately and confidently, especially on the male side, then they're making a friend for life," said Richard Jaffe, an analyst who follows the retailing industry at PaineWebber.
Corporate customers are being courted with elaborate perks from retailers like Brooks Brothers, J. Crew, Eddie Bauer and Ralph Lauren and department stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. Employees at various corporations receive discounts of 20 percent to 30 percent on their purchases, with the option to order online or at the store. Sometimes, the discounts even extend to the employees' family members. The chains also sponsor promotional nights in their stores just for corporate customers.
"Retail clothing companies are flexing to meet the ever-changing demands of society," said Angela Georgallis, a spokeswoman at the Society of Human Resource Management, adding that the apparel companies view workplace customers as very influential. "Why not partner up with huge, national companies to get their products and name out there, while making tons of money in the process? They're trying to strike winning deals between themselves and their customers -- enticing customers while growing their customer base."
Gap at Work, a program of the Gap chain, now has relationships with more than 50 companies including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Arthur Andersen, America Online and American Express. Employees receive a 20 percent discount on work clothes; they can download discount vouchers from their workplace computers for use in Gap stores, or they can shop online.
J. Crew has introduced an "In-between Weekends" catalog of sportswear and casual work clothes. The Corporate Alliance Program at Saks, which began last year, is aimed at corporate employees who may have thought that the store sold only much more formal attire. Corporate shoppers in New York and Boston receive discounts of 15 percent to 20 percent at Saks stores.
BESIDES their stated desire to relieve dress-code confusion, of course, the retailers have another motive -- selling more clothes. That is especially true this year, as apparel sales growth has slowed considerably.
The Credit Suisse First Boston total retail same-store sales index, a barometer of industry trends, increased 5.1 percent over the last 12 months, compared with 6.9 percent in the previous 12 months. It rose 4.4 percent for the third quarter, compared with 7 percent in the period a year earlier.
"It's been a choppy year for apparel and retailers relative to the last three years, and for some companies more so than others," said Barbara Miller, a specialty retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "Yet I'm not convinced they're doing it because growth is slowing elsewhere, but in a way to expand their franchise in a nontraditional way at a time when people are dressing in a nontraditional way and need a little guidance. It's an effort to capture customers at a time when customers are trying to figure out exactly what they should be wearing."
Other said the push into workplace clothing partly reflects retailers' anxiety about their fourth quarter, their most important sales period of the year. Last Wednesday, the Gap reported a 2 percent drop in October sales and warned that third-quarter sales would not meet Wall Street estimates. Other big retailers also reported disappointing October sales last week.
There is anecdotal evidence that the workplace clothing effort is producing sales gains.
In the Banana Republic program, Ms. Gabriel said, 625 employees of HBO, Credit Suisse First Boston and Scient had bought 2,360 items during the on-site promotions.
The promotions are aimed at workers who earn in the high five or six figures annually, raising the question of why they are even offered discounts.
"Price is an easy and effective way of getting potential customers' attention," said Richard Baum, a retailing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, who did not buy anything during the promotion. "The cost of getting a new customer, with advertising and catalog expenses, is more expensive than the 20 to 30 percent discount. It's a very effective way to do target marketing. You can go right into a C.S.F.B. and advertise to 1,000 employees."

Will Nasdaq's Fall Haunt the Democrats?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
MAYBE it's time to replace the famed campaign slogan "It's the economy, stupid" with "It's the Nasdaq, numskulls."
The amazingly close presidential race has puzzled investors accustomed to believing that as long as the nation's economy is strong, the incumbent party will be returned to power. Al Gore himself, locked in a down-to-the-wire battle, can only wonder why this year may be different. "We've had such prosperity for so long and Greenspan gets more credit for it and technology gets more credit for it," explained Tom Gallagher, a political economist in Washington for International Strategy and Investment. 
 Declining stock prices are also working against Mr. Gore. While economic news remains relatively rosy -- unemployment is low, and so are mortgage rates -- share prices have gone sour.
Although the broad market averages are basically flat this year, the Nasdaq composite, where individual investors have placed many of their bets, has been hammered. It is down 33 percent from its March high.
Individual stocks are faring badly, too, according to Salomon Smith Barney. As of Oct. 31, Nasdaq stocks were down 47.8 percent, on average, from their 52-week highs. Stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index were off 24.4 percent, on average.
Although the Nasdaq numbers have gotten a bit better in recent weeks, they are ugly when viewed historically. Today's average decline exceeds the 44.5 percent of November 1987, immediately after the market crash. The current decline is also much larger than the 42.2 percent drop seen in October 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
If Mr. Gore triumphs on Tuesday, the market should continue to move sideways. A Gore administration would probably continue attacking tobacco companies and would squeeze profits at health maintenance organizations and drug companies. Indeed, Mr. Gallagher said few industries or companies were likely to benefit from a Gore presidency. His short list included environmental cleanup companies and those developing alternative fuels.
If George W. Bush is elected, investors can expect more. The cloud over drug and tobacco stocks would lift. A Bush victory would also help Microsoft, Mr. Gallagher said, as a government-ordered breakup of the company would be less likely.
Christine A. Callies, chief United States investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said airlines, whose stocks have fallen as oil prices have risen, could benefit from a Bush presidency. While Mr. Bush might consider modernizing the Federal Aviation Administration and relieving the staffing crunch in air traffic control that has caused an enraging increase in flight delays, Mr. Gore would probably not, she said.
Another favored area in a Bush administration, Ms. Callies said, would be stocks of electric utilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which sets price ceilings for utilities, is dominated by Democrats. Under Republicans, price caps could be raised, increasing profitability for power companies.
The only investors who might not celebrate a Bush victory would be the nattering nabobs of negativism in the bond market. Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York, expects bond prices to fall -- and interest rates rise -- if Mr. Bush wins.
"His proposal will give more of a quick stimulus to the consumer in the form of tax cuts," she said. "The bond market will be concerned that this will keep the Fed more inclined to leave interest rates higher than lower."
But the bond market would also be uneasy with a Gore victory. What it really wants is a continued stalemate between the White House and Capitol Hill. "When fiscal policy is a battle," Ms. Wright said, "the bond market is relieved."

Splash of Cold Water for Bond Market

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
IN March, Stephen J. Zaslaw invested $3,000 in a high-yield municipal bond fund. Mr. Zaslaw, 55, a software engineer who lives in Cream Ridge, N.J., near Trenton, expected some volatility. After all, high-yield -- a k a junk -- bonds pay higher yields for a reason. In the case of high-yield munis, they represent loans to finance municipalities or municipal projects that have low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all.
Still, a bond fund is a bond fund and not, say, an Internet stock fund. At least, that is what Mr. Zaslaw and most investors assume. But when Mr. Zaslaw checked his portfolio on Friday, Oct. 13, and found that his $3,000 had largely evaporated, he was left bewildered. 
 "What was three thousand and something was now less than $1,000," he recalled last week. "It scared the heck out of me."
Unfortunately for Mr. Zaslaw, this was no glitch by his brokerage firm. It was an October surprise that has left the mutual fund industry wondering about the reliability of municipal bond pricing and about what role, if any, high-yield muni bond funds should play in an investor's portfolio. Some in the business, however, say the episode raises more questions about one firm than about this investment category.
Mr. Zaslaw's investment manager was Heartland Advisors, a Milwaukee company with $2.3 billion under management. On Oct. 13, the firm announced that its Heartland High-Yield Municipal Bond fund had fallen more than 70 percent that day, after a change in the method used to assign values to its bonds. The collapse left it as the year's worst-performing mutual fund in any category, according to Morningstar Inc. -- trailing even the worst of the Internet funds. A second fund, Heartland Short Duration High-Yield Municipal, fell 44 percent that day. At the end of the day, the two funds' total assets amounted to $58 million, down from $120 million.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating, Heartland said, and shareholders have filed two suits against Heartland and one of the fund's managers, Thomas J. Conlin, who departed the firm for what were described as personal reasons a few weeks before the revaluation. In a statement, Mr. Conlin said, "My resignation from Heartland was neither a cause nor effect of the funds' declines."
An executive at a prominent bond investment management firm, Pimco Advisors, said the Heartland matter reinforced doubts about whether the risks of high-yield municipal funds were worth the potential rewards. "I just don't believe that a fund comprised strictly of high-yield munis makes sense for most investors," said Mark McCray, who manages $2.1 billion, including all six of Pimco's municipal bond funds.
Pimco, a unit of Germany's Allianz, does not offer a high-yield muni fund. "I believe it simply isn't worth the incremental risk for the extra percent or two of yield," Mr. McCray said. "Sure, it would be much easier to advertise and market a nice juicy yield, but I don't believe our municipal investors would be well served."
A top official at the Vanguard Group, the nation's second-largest manager of bond funds, disagreed. "I think that's hogwash, to say that a high-yield muni fund has no place in a portfolio," said Ian MacKinnon, chief of Vanguard's bond operation. Mr. MacKinnon called the Heartland revaluation "appalling" but said it should not sully high-yield muni bond funds as a category.
In fact, Vanguard's high-yield muni fund bears little resemblance to Heartland's. The Vanguard High-Yield Tax Exempt fund is not even considered a high-yield fund by Lipper Inc., the fund tracker The fund itself has only 10 percent of its $3 billion in assets invested in unrated debt.
By contrast, Heartland High-Yield Municipal, as of midyear, was nearly 97 percent invested in unrated debt. Such bonds, traded infrequently, are the most difficult to value. "A more normal allocation to nonrated debt would be 50 percent," said Christopher J. Kelsch, a Morningstar analyst. "They were way out there in terms of risk."
Most larger firms estimate the value of such bonds by using pricing services and their own analysts. It is part art and part science.
Until October, Heartland relied largely on a pricing service. Both Mr. MacKinnon of Vanguard and a Merrill Lynch executive questioned whether Heartland could effectively check its pricing service's work. "Obviously, they didn't have people out there in the field doing what we do," said Hugh T. Hurley III, a vice president in Merrill Lynch's bond department. "It was negligence, either by accident or on purpose."
Doug Lucas, a Heartland spokesman, said the firm is best known for stock funds. "It is important to keep in mind that we have more than 98 percent of the assets of this firm in the equity side," he said. Bond funds, he said, are "relatively new assets."
In 1997 and 1998, the Heartland High-Yield Municipal fund was a top performer, but now investors wonder if the fund's past net asset values were a mirage. "People who bought these funds feel like they've had their pockets picked," said Samuel H. Rudman of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, a New York firm representing the plaintiffs in one of the suits.
William J. Nasgovitz, Heartland's president and founder, said the risks were clearly described in prospectuses. He placed much of the blame for the two funds' troubles on the markets, saying that buyers for illiquid high-yield munis like those in the Heartland funds had grown scarce. "We changed the pricing to match the reality of the marketplace during the week of Oct. 9," he said, citing the Owens Corning bankruptcy filing and a general falloff in high-yield trading.
HEARTLAND itself has revised its method of valuing these bonds to reflect, Mr. Nasgovitz said, "credit quality concerns, lack of market makers, lack of bids" and trading in similar bonds.
Mr. McCray of Pimco said investors might want to be cautious about any high-yield muni bond fund. "As the economy slows, lesser credits will suffer," he said. "Investors in high-yield munis may find that the incremental 1 percent or 2 percent of yield doesn't pay for the risks."
Mr. Zaslaw had expected the $3,000 investment to pay a regular income without substantial risk. "Certainly I expected the principal to be preserved," he said.
So would just about any other investor who bought a bond fund. Now such conservative investors might want to think twice.
"Investors should rightly consider their investments in high-yield municipal bond funds as risk capital," Mr. McCray said. That does not mean one should expect to end up with a fund that drops 70 percent in a day. Unless it's Friday the 13th.

Palestinians Fight, but Iraq and Iran May Be the Winners

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS Israelis and Palestinians battle for the same small piece of land, Iraq and Iran are using the conflict to portray themselves as the true champions of the Palestinian cause, and hence as the leaders of the entire region.
Iraq, in particular, has already benefited so much that it looks as if the Palestinians, believing that they're liberating Palestine, may be liberating Saddam Hussein instead. 
 The current crisis has accelerated the erosion of international sanctions against Iraq, allowing Mr. Hussein to argue that doing business with him is, by implication, striking a blow against America, which is excoriated regionally as the protector of Israel.
Since Saddam International Airport in Baghdad opened in August, more than 40 planes have landed from abroad, carrying aid as well as businessmen and government officials. Jordan announced last month that it would no longer let Lloyd's of London agents inspect shipments bound for Iraq arriving at the Jordanian port of Aqaba. Syria and Iraq plan to reopen their cross-border oil pipeline this month, in defiance of sanctions, and Turkey has recently become the first NATO country to upgrade relations with Baghdad to ambassadorial level. Even Iraq's Kurds have established a relationship of coexistence with the regime, denying Iraqi opposition leaders access to Kurdish territory.
The end of Iraq's isolation is especially worrisome, given that even before the outbreak of violence more than a month ago, Mr. Hussein had made a series of startlingly belligerent speeches, as he did before the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Last August, for example, he criticized "those rulers and kings who have sold out their souls" by allowing what he called the occupying foreigner to rule over them. He has called on the Arab masses to overthrow their rulers and told his people never to trust outsiders. At the recent emergency Arab summit in Cairo (the first such meeting Iraq had been invited to in a decade), Iraqi officials criticized their Arab brothers for not waging holy war against Israel. Iraq also mobilized several divisions on its western border, offering to step in if Syria needed military help. (The United States, aided by a number of Arab states, including Syria, ordered him to pull them back. He did.)
"We're seeing the old Saddam," said Judith Yaphe, a senior research professor at National Defense University. "He's trying to prove to his own population and to the Arab street that he's the only Arab standing up to the West. He's trying to send a message that, 'I'm in charge. I can do whatever I want. Watch me.' "
No one yet knows what, exactly, to watch for. Mr. Hussein "will use the pressure that he hopes the street could bring to demolish sanctions and to remind his neighbors that they will have to deal with him again as a legitimate Arab leader," Ms. Yaphe said, adding that even the next American president will have to wait for "what his next move will be in testing the resolve of the new administration."
Iran's role in the Palestinian-Israeli crisis is more complicated, because the Islamic Republic is trying to do two things at once.
ON the one hand, its reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, has worked for three years to position Iran as a responsible regional power and a reliable economic partner, forging alliances with key Arab and European governments. Last week Mr. Khatami was in Japan, the first Iranian leader to visit since the 1979 revolution, promoting his campaign for a "dialogue among civilizations" and granting Japanese firms negotiating rights for the development of Azadegan, the world's biggest undeveloped oil field.
On the other hand, one of the pillars of the Islamic Republic's foreign policy (and domestic legitimacy) has always been enmity toward Israel and support for the Palestinians. Iran continues to provide the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah with weapons and money. It also gives money and possibly weapons to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Half a dozen of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the remnants of a far larger force deployed years ago, still train "Islamic warriors" near Baalbek in Lebanon.
Should the Palestinians and Israel make a comprehensive peace, however, the Iranian people may begin to question the point of their country's remaining a militant theocracy. For that reason, the current crisis hurts Iran's democratic reform movement and strengthens the hand of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader (who wields more power than the elected president) and the conservative clerics behind him.
Mr. Khamenei has called Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, "a traitor and an idiot" for making concessions to Israel. And in a sermon to more than 100,000 military volunteers two weeks ago, he said the only solution to the Middle East crisis was to destroy "the Zionist regime."
THE crowd responded with chants of "Ready, leader, we are ready," and some current and former military commanders said the volunteers were ready to fight and die to liberate Palestine.
It is unlikely their government will give them the chance. Iran cannot afford another war. Indeed, it cannot do anything terribly provocative and still continue to repair its international reputation. But if the violence between Israelis and Palestinians continues, Iran may find it more difficult to maintain its balance between re-entering the community of nations and calling for the destruction of one of its members.
Even Ayatollah Khamenei seems to recognize this. Instead of pledging arms shipments, troops or massive aid in his sermon, he called for Palestinians to stage a referendum to decide what kind of government they want.
Ultimately, the greatest fear of leaders in the region and Washington policymakers is that the two battle-tested powers of the Persian Gulf might forge an alliance against Israel, however temporary. But Iran and Iraq have never even signed a peace treaty ending their eight-year border war. Each still holds some of the other's prisoners, and Iraq allows an armed Iranian opposition group to operate from its territory, while Iran gives refuge to an Iraqi Shiite opposition group.
Instead, Iran and Iraq will probably continue to use this moment for their separate purposes. One thing neither is likely to do is offer much more support to the Palestinians.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
Pushing Beyond the Physical Limits for Benefits That Outlast the Pain

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Toni Baum, a 39-year-old mother of two, runs her first marathon in 10 years today. She has been training even as sciatic pain burns down both legs, upping her dosage of the painkiller Celebrex to keep going. She loves that sense of well-being she feels, the smug righteousness as she hobbles back into the driveway after a long run.
Her psychiatrist, Dr. Antonia Baum, a 39-year-old in private practice and on the clinical faculty of the George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, wonders briefly if there is something masochistic in Toni's pleasure. She sees obsessive-compulsion in Toni's training regime. But then, because of their oneness, she backs off. 
 "There is a tendency to overpathologize this," she said last week after a seven-mile tapering run. "I don't think I'm doing any lasting physical damage, and psychologically I think there is something healthy about not succumbing to pain, to standing up to it. People just don't push themselves hard enough, long enough."
Despite the approximately 30,000 people who will be pushing themselves hard enough and long enough to finish today's New York City Marathon (Baum is running one in Virginia), the conventional wisdom is that most Americans prefer quick athletic fixes or long hours on the couch watching others. Since I won't be running any marathons today (I prefer my sustained voluntary pain from a bicycle seat), I have time to consider some of the paradoxes and complications of all this.
The country is growing fatter and less fit, even while it takes more steroids so it can train harder and/or look better. With the same yearning for a larger and more rigorous context that has brought many to new spirituality and orthodox religions, men and women have found ways to test and stretch themselves in long-distance running, swimming, biking, and in boxing and other martial arts. Meanwhile, the most celebrated athletes are the ones who follow the slam-dunk/home-run/knockout-punch yellow-brick road.
"Since the 70's, it's become unnatural for elite athletes to push themselves without a constant and terrific narcissistic boost to make the pain worthwhile," said Michael Miletec, a Detroit-area psychiatrist and psychoanalyst whose patients include pro athletes. "Maybe it's our lottery mentality, too many comforts, too much excitement, earn a million and feel great by 30. That ethos is entrenched in the culture in and out of sports. Can you imagine Keyshawn Johnson rowing?"
Think of what the Tampa Bay widemouth receiver is missing.
"Rowing is having sex with the earth," said Louis Mackall, one of five middle-aged men who pulled 100 miles from South Street Seaport to the tip of Long Island last June to, well, just do it. "The longer the better, to a point, and no need to rush. To row, say, eight miles out to a point of land is to stretch my body and lay it down over that whole length of water, just as my eye does in anticipation. Among other things this helps me recover from living too much in a box."
One attempt to escape the box is eloquently described in the forthcoming "Long Distance: A Year of Living Strenuously." The writer Bill McKibben dedicates himself to becoming a credible cross-country ski racer and learns, among other lessons, that "skiing up a hill, right at this particular moment, doesn't fit our culture quite as well as skiing down it."
The quick-fix ethos has even taken hold in boxing, traditionally a pit of arduous, even sacrificial, training. A strong economy, too many accredited championships and fewer fights for more money have meant fewer hours of roadwork, jumping rope, calisthenics and sophisticated weight-training, according to Dr. Ronald L. Kamm of Oakhurst, N.J., an internationally known sports psychiatrist and vice president of the board of Fighters' Initiative for Support and Training (FIST), a nonprofit aid group headed by the former heavyweight Gerry Cooney.
"The pros and top amateurs are in poorer shape than they used to be, except for the women," Kamm said. "But these recreational boxers, men and women, are very dedicated, and may be the fittest of all."
The first great athletes of America, the Indian runners, were marvels of endurance and dedication. When the Pueblos rose up against the Spanish in 1680, teams of runners delivered the messages that successfully bound the tribes. Some famous early marathon runners were Indian, and the first American to win the Olympic 10,000-meter championship was Billy Mills, a Sioux.
The third world runners who dominate modern marathons come from similar cultures of hardship where deprivation and suffering are givens, and a 26-mile-385-yard run for prize and endorsement money sounds like a good deal. Perhaps because of the leading runners' often touching back stories, we tend to overlook the commercialization of the marathon itself; television sponsors and sneaker pushers have become as entrenched here as in the National Basketball Association.
The real marathon competition is often between the so-called serious runners and the self-described penguins, many of them women, who start merely to finish. The faster runners who have trained hard to lower a personal best are frequently contemptuous of the sloggers who get in their way en route to their own slower life-enhancing experiences.
More jock than penguin, Toni Baum, the psychiatrist, will be wearing her 1990 Newport Marathon T-shirt today in the Montgomery County, Va., parks department race. She says she will be happy to break four hours after 10 years off to bear and raise her daughters. But she yearns for more.
"I've always thought there is something admirable about pushing beyond your physical limits," said Baum, who played varsity field hockey at Brown. "And if you don't do it, don't at least try, you'll be missing something very important in life."
Miletec, a former weight lifter, is specific about what's missing.
"You'll lose discipline, the dealing with frustrations, the working through mundane hard tasks, that enhances self-esteem," he said. "You need to know you don't have to run for cover when things get tough because you've handled tough, hard things before, that you have a sense of your own destiny, that you can't be beaten."

HEADLINE: The World;
The Strange World of North Korea

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REPORTERS accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on her recent trip to North Korea had no chance to see the rusted steelworks, the flooded mines or factories at a standstill. Nor were they able to see the small livestock markets that have sprung up in some parts of the country, testimony, apparently of farmers' abandoning their collectives and taking matters into their own hands as a matter of sheer survival.
But they were able to see that a major hospital had no lights except in the foyer and to hear about operations without anesthesia. 
 They learned of the motto "Children are king," and indeed, Dr. Albright saw -- and danced along with -- 5-and 6-year-olds who literally sang the praises of the North Korean leader, Kim Jung Il. Some 15 miles out of the capital, however, children labor on a road-building project, breaking stones by hand, a sight that recently reduced some toughened Western aid workers to tears.
Even on a hasty two-day trip, it was clear there are only a few paradoxes in North Korea. The country is overwhelmingly poor, and its people are indoctrinated with a mixture of homegrown ideology focused on self-reliance and Communist beliefs from the 1920's and 30's.
In contrast to the United States' engagement with the Soviet Union and China, the Clinton administration has made clear that its objectives with North Korea do not include a makeover of the totalitarian regime into a democratic government with a market economy. The major goal is simply to coax Mr. Kim to get rid of his missiles and reduce the threat of war.
Mr. Kim's goals seem equally limited. His country desperately needs help, and if North Korea takes the necessary steps to get off the State Department's list of countries that support terrorism -- which essentially revolves around what to do with three members of a terrorist group, the Japanese Red Army, who are wanted by Japan -- the regime will qualify for support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
But even given the modesty of each side's aspirations, if engagement continues, North Korea's people will inevitably come into more contact with the outside world. And that raises questions about how a nation as closed as North Korea will react.
Certainly, contacts with the West will come as a shock. But for the moment, the North Korean regime most fears contact between its people and South Koreans, who enjoy a vastly more prosperous life and who in large numbers feel great emotional bonds to their Northern brethren. In the days before Dr. Albright arrived, North Korean officials forbade American officials who drove over the demilitarized zone from South Korea to bring their South Korean drivers with them. All signs in English and emblems of South Korea affixed to the American officials' cars had to be covered.
But there is not the slightest hint that reunification along the model of East and West Germany is possible anytime soon. East Germany was far more porous than North Korea, where Mr. Kim has achieved an Orwellian thoroughness in keeping his people insulated -- all televisions and radios, which broadcast only government material, must be registered. What passes for broadcast news, largely the latest doings of the "Dear Leader," is delivered in a harsh martial voice, and often over street loudspeakers, making it hard to ignore.
Because self-sufficiency has been elevated by the state as the ultimate virtue and contrasts with modern prosperity have been shut out, there is little likelihood of immediate demand for the political and social change that brought revolution in the former Soviet Union.
Any kind of change is likely to come slowly. A few small ruptures in the seal around North Korea's people illustrate how glacial the pace of change may be.
FIVE years ago, the State Department's desk officer for North Korea, Ken Quinones, accompanied by three other officials, landed in the country for an extremely delicate job: overseeing the removal of fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor that contained enough plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs. The mission was to start the process of closing down the reactor under the terms agreed to between North Korea and the United States in 1994.
The Americans, who were bunked at the top secret facility, were made to feel just what they were, Mr. Quinones said: enemies on enemy territory.
They fought to get the tiniest freedom of movement. Only after agonizing negotiation did they win the right to go for a morning and evening walk to a tree, a quarter-mile outside the gate. (It helped that the tree happened to commemorate the founding leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, the current leader's father.)
"Everything was gradual and incremental, with profuse explanations every step of the way," said Mr. Quinones, who is now the head of Northeast Asia projects for Mercy Corps, a nongovernmental organization specializing in medical help for poor countries, including North Korea.
One of the most interesting examples of interaction between North Koreans and outsiders is a joint effort between the government and the Nautilus Institute, a group based in Berkeley, Calif.
Two years ago, on a farm west of Pyongyang, Nautilus installed windmills to generate energy for household lighting, a village water pump and a refrigerator in the village kindergarten. To Peter Hayes, the director of Nautilus, the project illustrates how stereotypes can, over time, be broken down.
At first, he said, it was hard for the villagers to believe that the American technicians would return after the installation of the windmills, turbines and other equipment -- all of it imported, together with tools for assembling. When the Americans lived up to their promise and did return, some trust was established. Even so, Mr. Hayes said, it was hard to get villagers to allow the Americans to inspect their homes to see that the light bulbs initially installed were still working. But this suspicion broke down too.
Mr. Hayes says he was not surprised when one of the North Koreans on the project told him, "My mother thinks that all Americans are wolves, and we are the prey." But one North Korean showed great gratitude that his family was rescued from the darkness -- due to lack of oil and other energy sources -- that now blankets most of North Korea at night. The most rewarding words Mr. Hayes said he heard were from the man who said: "Thank you, please come back and build more."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ECONOMY;
From Social Security to Environment, the Candidates' Positions

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

 BODY:
Voters have many questions about issues,and Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have many answers. Here aresummaries of the Bush and Gore positions onpolicy issues that have recieved considerable attention in the presidential campaign, with a comparison to show how the candidates differand agree, and assesments of their position fromexperts and political analysts-some partisan, some not.
"Prosperity itself is on the ballot," Mr. Gore has been telling voters in the campaign's final weeks. And while both candidates flatter themselves by suggesting that they have the right prescription for an economy as large, complex and ever-changing as this country's, there are stark differences in their approaches. 
 The main battleground has been fiscal policy. Assuming that the federal budget surplus materializes as projected over the next 10 years -- by no means a given -- the next president will have an opportunity to apportion trillions of dollars, something none of his recent predecessors has enjoyed.
Mr. Bush would use much of the surplus for a $1.3 trillion, across-the-board tax cut, much of which would go to upper income households, and the creation of personal investment accounts within Social Security.
Mr. Gore's emphasis would be on eliminating the $3.4 trillion national debt and increasing spending on education, health and the environment.
Mr. Bush's approach embraces the conservative orthodoxy that reducing tax rates creates incentives for economic growth that benefit everyone. And it is rooted in the ideological belief that people are better equipped to make economic decisions than are governments.
Mr. Gore emphasizes that eliminating the government's borrowing puts downward pressure on interest rates -- the equivalent of a tax cut for most people -- and frees capital for use in more productive ways, for example building a factory or founding the next Microsoft.
Although each campaign has sought to label the other's proposals as reckless budget-busters, both approaches, in general, are well within the mainstream of economic thought.
In terms of bang for the buck, debt reduction trumps tax cuts in the view of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, especially when the Fed is trying to keep the economy from overheating. But as Mr. Bush points out, tax money that flows into Washington is often spent before it can be used for debt reduction.
The expansion has now been under way for 116 months, 10 months longer than any previous business cycle. There is no indication that the good times will end soon; still, with each passing month the chances increase that the next president will have to deal with a downturn.
Mr. Gore has said that in a recession his instinct would be to keep the budget balanced and trust the Fed. Mr. Bush's aides say a weakening economy would only bolster the case for a big tax cut.
 Richard W. Stevenson
 
CHECKLIST
 
Would give a tax cut to everyone who pays income tax
Bush -- Yes
Gore -- No
 
Would pay off the $3.4 trillion national debt by 2012
Bush -- No
Gore -- Yes
 
Supports repeal of federal inheritance tax
Bush -- Yes
Gore -- No
 
Has pledged not to interfere with the Federal Reserve
Bush -- Yes
Gore -- Yes
 
TWO ASSESSMENTS
 
"There are two big issues: keeping the expansion going, and the neglect of social investment over the last decade and more. Bush's big tax cut puts the economy in a much more vulnerable position on the first point, and pretty much precludes us from getting back to a more balanced set of investments. We have this huge and vibrant private sector, yet fundamental human needs are not being met. We have the most inefficient health system in the world. For all the talk of the information age, we're investing insufficiently in education. Head Start, there's a program everyone loves, and it's still not fully funded."
 
Jeff Faux, president, Economic Policy Institute
 
"The contrast is one of philosophy. Bush would give individual citizens more power over their money. Gore would empower the collective community through government. The contrast is between Bush and returning the money to taxpayers and Gore's ambitious new spending agenda. The question is whether politicians will spend the money before either candidate gets a chance to do what they want with it. That's the $64,000 question: whether these surpluses will materialize. Everything else is commentary."

Who Needs The Next Four Years?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
THE moment should strike sometime around midday on Wednesday. It will dawn on someone -- perhaps the president-elect himself -- that despite all that rosy campaign-trail optimism about how this is America's moment of glory, the next four years could get really, really nasty.
While America remains strong and prosperous, there's a palpable nervousness that a lot of problems are ready to become uncorked. The next war in the Middle East may have already started. The same goes for the next economic slowdown at home. Who knows what use India or Pakistan will make of their nuclear toys? Or whether North Korea is really ready to auction off its missiles? Southeast Asia's giant, Indonesia, appears to be fracturing, and scientists are pretty worried that Al Gore wasn't crazy to think that global warming is already under way. And those are just the specters everybody already knows about. 
 Maybe, just maybe, America is on the kind of roll that both presidential candidates have taken for granted. Maybe its military competitors are so far behind, its global businesses so far ahead, its friends in Europe and Asia so secure that, no matter who gives the victory speech on Tuesday night, his biggest challenge will be to manage good times.
But maybe not.
"Times have been so good for so long that you have to think the next four years are going to be comparatively ugly," one of President Clinton's top advisers said recently. "Just look at all the bullets we ducked" -- a near-nuclear exchange in South Asia, near blowups in Korea and the Taiwan Strait, financial near-disasters. Even the optimist-in-chief, Bill Clinton, has remarked to his staff about the huge gulf between what the candidates have been talking about (prescription drugs, tax cuts, secure retirement) and the kind of issues consuming him in his last days in office (terror attacks, a Middle East blowup, Balkan hatreds).
So what could make Tuesday's victor wish, in a few months or a few years, that the other guy had won?
Start with the perennial problem-in-waiting: an economy that's been running on eight cylinders for longer than any in history. It could begin running on, say, just four. Or, as one of President Clinton's former top economic officials puts it: "Not a recession. Just something that, after all this prosperity, feels like a recession."
The signs are already there. The stock market's fall to Earth has made free-spending consumers feel a little less wealthy. Out here on the frontier of the new economy, a lot of E-entrepreneurs are suddenly sending resumes to old-line companies that compensate their employees with a regular salary, not stock options. Detroit is sitting on car inventories so big that eight of the country's 55 auto plants are taking a weeklong holiday.
NONE of that spells doom; it may just be a much-needed pause. Still, those surpluses Mr. Gore and George W. Bush argued about all year could dissolve overnight if Congress comes under pressure to spur the economy.
And that's just the start. Once the American economy slows, international investors are likely to think about putting their money elsewhere. That money is financing a record trade deficit that few care about as long as jobs are plentiful.
What if unemployment rises? (Where else can it go?) That benign trade deficit will look like it's stealing jobs. Just ask the other George Bush, who was ushered out of the Oval Office partly because of a national perception that such economic issues bored him.
Then there is a long list of less familiar frights. Mr. Clinton's former national security adviser, Anthony Lake, has just published a guidebook to future calamities -- "Six Nightmares" (Little, Brown & Co.) -- in which he describes wandering through Washington's MCI Center, just blocks from the White House, to see how vulnerable the indoor stadium might be to biological attack. Big surprise: no one challenged him.
Similarly, the Pentagon quietly ran an experiment a few years ago to see how much damage some medium-skilled hackers could inflict on the country's infrastructure. Plenty, it found.
While there has been lots of talk in the campaign of keeping America strong, perhaps the most complex set of new threats involve the weakness, rather than strength, of other countries. That was the lesson of the Soviet breakup, the Mexican and Asian economic crises, the fracturing of Yugoslavia.
It may be the lesson of the Middle East, where the economic disparity between Israel and the Palestinians only fuels the ethnic and territorial tensions. The Arab states have failed to build strong democracies, legal institutions and economies, the combination usually associated with stability and security. Along with its peace brokering, the Clinton administration has made some modest efforts to close the economic gap, figuring that once young Arabs have an economic stake in peace and stability, they are less likely to lob rocks or worse. It's a nice theory, but so far it hasn't taken hold.
Weakness and fear are clearly at the heart of the India-Pakistan dispute; why else would two nations battling so much poverty, corruption and population growth divert their scarce cash into building nuclear weapons? The Bomb, indeed, has become the poor nation's equalizer, the way to make the world deal with them.
"Half the foreign and defense policy establishment fears, legitimately, that the Big Terrible Thing is coming, whether in India-Pakistan, or in Asia or in lower Manhattan," Peggy Noonan, the Ronald Reagan loyalist who is supporting Mr. Bush, wrote last week. Yet the Bush campaign has said lots about national defense, and far less about preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Gore talks about preventive diplomacy but can be equally vague. Indonesia has been fracturing since the ouster of its strongman, President Suharto, more than two years ago, threatening a crackup of the world's fourth most populous nation. Yet when asked in a recent interview how he would approach Indonesia's problems, the vice president allowed that maybe it was near time to assemble some experts on the subject.
WHO can blame these guys? Promising to strengthen America is one thing, but it's a rare politician who dares to run on a platform of using America's money or military to prop up weak nations.
It's no way to get elected president. It probably never will be. Whether it's a way to secure America's place in the world is a different question -- one the next president can start thinking about on Wednesday.

I Feel Pretty

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I feel stunning
And entrancing,
Feel like running and dancing for joy . . . 
 O.K., enough gloating. Behave, Albert. Just look in the mirror now and put on your serious I only-care-about-the-issues face.
If I rub in a tad more of this mahogany-colored industrial mousse, the Spot will disappear under my Reagan pompadour.
Whew! Now that W. has slipped on a mud pie at the finish line, I can admit I was scared, just like all the other Democrats. Things were stickier than a barrel of goo-goo clusters.
It would be awful to blow it just because no one can stand the sight of me. Or to win the Electoral College but not the popular vote. Ouch!
How could I lose to a guy who promises to fix Social Security without knowing it's a federal program? He probably thought it was a dating service.
But my inner teleprompter tells me I've got a much better shot now. Goody-goody for the goody-goody!
Only 48 more hours and I am Martin Sheen. I can upgrade to Air Force One. Only 76 days, 8 hours and 15 minutes and I will never, ever have to lay eyes on that megalomaniac Bill Clinton again! Ding dong!
I know I haven't been the best candidate. But you try running with Clinton Past while Clinton Present is hanging on for dear life, trying to polish Clinton Future. It's like climbing Mount Rainier with ankle weights and sandbags on your back.
I couldn't believe how everyone in my camp was doubting me, from the president (even though we tried to confine him to Black Entertainment Television and keep him off CNN) to my overpaid Washington hacks to all those Democrats who wanted me to brag on our economy and campaign with Bill, because people like him.
It seemed as if the only people who still believed in me were Tipper, Karenna and my pal Marty Peretz. Which was fortunate, since they were the only three I ever talked to.
Even Tipper was getting fed up with me kissing and hugging her a hundred times a day. She actually pushed me away at one point when I was going in for a big one. That hurt.
But no matter how dark things got, I reckoned that in the end, Boy Scout would trump Frat Boy, especially if somebody could find something better to pin on him than the Case of the Purloined Debate Prep Video.
For some reason, voters never get excited about me. That's why I had to hook up with Clinton in the first place. But now people have no other choice -- unless they want President Adam Sandler.
No way will Americans go for toga state dinners and a leader who might steal the White House Christmas wreath as a hazing prank. Once the Maine Democrats ratted out Bush on that embarrassing little incident up in Kennebunkport (it was great that the news broke on conservative Fox!) everyone realized that W. had even less controlling legal authority than I did. Buddhists vs. Budweisers.
That's what W. gets for hanging out at the family estate, chugging beers with Australian tennis players, while I worked like a dog campaigning for my first Congressional seat, so I could spend 12 hours a day grinding away on the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
W. should never have run against me in the first place. The only rationale for his campaign was avenging his father's loss. And revenge is not a healthy reason to seek the highest office in the land. A president must not be filled with bile. A president must bring everyone together.
Where's my Palm Pilot? I need to do a couple e-mails to kick off the Gore era starting Tuesday night.
Note to self: Clinton said I would be "the next best thing" to having him for another four years. He can Next Best this: The new site for our radioactive dump is on the Arkansas River, next to the Clinton Library.
Note to Congressional liaison: Whenever we announce highway money for New York, give Chuck Schumer 48 hours' notice so he can get full credit (and Senator Hillary can get lost).
Note to Karenna: Anything those Maine Democrats in the wacky hats want from us -- yea-a-a-ah! -- give it to them.

HEADLINE: WINE UNDER $20;
A Mere $2.88 per Chapter

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
In a city where tidal charts could reflect sommeliers' arrivals and departures, Joseph DeLissio's career as the River Cafe's wine director rests on the same bedrock as the Brooklyn Bridge overhead. For 22 years, his wine program has illuminated the restaurant's American cuisine as brightly as Lower Manhattan lights that sparkle across the East River.
 Whether stocking the cellar or working the floor, he has influenced the tastes and judgments of thousands. His own were partly shaped by Italian grandparents who, digging into the New World, built a wine cellar, stored their wine in wooden milk crates and reused corks. 
 Reared in Brooklyn and a longtime Staten Island resident, Mr. DeLissio, who knows the value of a buck, conveys in "The River Cafe Wine Primer" (Little Brown, $25.95) his tugboat-like ease in steering novices. Nine chapters, each the equivalent of a $2.88 glass of wine, brim with sensible information that can save budget-conscious holiday shoppers cash at a moment of economic ebbing.
 "Ordering wine in a restaurant should be easy, not intimidating," he writes. "Selecting wine in a local wine shop should be enjoyable, not anxiety provoking."
 Since wine is organic, buying is always somewhat risky. Mr. DeLissio's list of "good value wineries" -- I agree with them -- offsets risk. For example, in California: Beringer Founder's Estate line, Domaine Carneros sparkling wines, Estancia, Fetzer, Franciscan, Louis Martini and Ravenswood; in Washington, Chateau Ste. Michelle, Columbia Crest, Hogue Cellars; in Oregon, Oak Knoll and Sokol Blosser.
 From Spain: Torres, Conde de Valdemar and Marques de Murrieta; Italy, Alois Lageder, Chiarlo; Germany, Robert Weil; Chile, Los Vascos and Santa Rita; France, Burgundies of Joseph Drouhin, Rhones of Jaboulet and such Bordeaux chateaus as d'Angludet and Meyney.
 His restaurant tips are smart: Sniff empty glasses before wine is poured, because they might impart off odors. And refuse a wine if "the server has not informed you of a vintage or producer change." HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
After weeks of sloshing higher and lower, the stock market, like the rest of the country, may settle down to watch the finish of the presidential race this week.
Traders will not only be looking for the winner of the White House, but also for the new balance of power between the incoming administration and the legislative branch. "What the market likes is gridlock in Washington," said Tim Woolston, portfolio manager at Boston Advisors, part of the Advest Group. 
"It likes nothing better than to have a divided White House and Congress," he said. "It means that very little in terms of significant legislation is likely to get through."
 As a backdrop, both the Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes managed to move higher last week. With most corporate earnings out of the way, and seasonal selling for tax purposes also mostly over, Mr. Woolston said the market might be forming a bottom.
 The Producer Price Index, the most significant piece of economic information due this week, is likely to soothe, showing prices nearly flat for October.
 The Nasdaq composite index rallied 5.3 percent last week, to 3,451.58. The Dow Jones industrials rose 2.1 percent, to 10,817.95. JOAN M. O'NEILL

HEADLINE: Far More Single Mothers Are Taking Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
For the first time in more than a decade, single mothers are more likely than married mothers to be employed, new government statistics show.
The figures also show a large increase in the proportion of single mothers who are working, with explosive growth in work by low-skilled women with children born out of wedlock. 
 Even more remarkable, economists say, is the increase in work among single mothers who have never been married. In 1993, 44 percent of them were employed. The figure shot up to 65 percent last year.
The new numbers, from the Labor Department and the Census Bureau, have caught the attention of liberals and conservatives alike.
Wendell E. Primus, a liberal Democrat who resigned from the government in protest over President Clinton's decision to sign the 1996 welfare law, said: "The growth in the proportion of never-married mothers who are working is phenomenal. I find it astonishing."
Ronald T. Haskins, a conservative Republican who works for the House Ways and Means Committee, said: "Never-married mothers are the ones who have the least education and have historically worked the least. They were also the most likely to be on welfare and to stay on welfare for long periods. So the fact that the proportion of never-married mothers who work exploded after 1993 is extremely important."
Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research center here, said, "The increases in work among single mothers, their magnitude and the speed at which they occurred are truly remarkable."
Economists gave several reasons for the increase in work among single mothers:
*The strong economy has created millions of jobs and improved the quality of low-wage jobs.
*Welfare recipients are now required to work under federal and state welfare laws, and states have sharply increased spending on child care.
*The federal government and the states have adopted policies to "make work pay," in a phrase used by proponents of such policies. As a result, many single mothers find they are financially better off if they take jobs outside the home.
*Work has become more attractive because of increases in the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit, which can add several thousand dollars a year to the income of a low-wage worker with children.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, the Connecticut Republican who is chairwoman of a House subcommittee responsible for welfare policy, said the strong economy alone could not explain all the increase in work by single mothers.
Although 17 million jobs were created from 1981 to 1989, Mrs. Johnson said, "that did not help women in poverty." The proportion of single mothers with jobs did not rise.
The new statistics on working mothers were extracted from government data by Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution here. The trend is clear.
The proportion of married mothers with jobs grew slowly and steadily from 1986 to 1997 and leveled off at 68 percent in the next two years.
By contrast, the proportion of single mothers with jobs showed hardly any change from 1986 to 1993, remaining around 58 percent. But then it began a sharp rise, as states revamped their welfare programs to emphasize work.
Last year the proportion of single mothers with jobs reached 71.5 percent, exceeding the 68 percent for married mothers. The figure for single mothers also exceeded that for married mothers in the late 1970's and early 80's, but in those years, married women were less likely to work outside the home.
"No previous decline in the overall jobless rate has ever produced such a large increase in employment of never-married mothers," Mr. Burtless said. "President Clinton, Congress and state legislatures have provided more generous benefits to indigent working mothers with dependent children. But they have made it more difficult for nonworking mothers to collect public assistance."
Census Bureau figures on the employment of welfare recipients show a similar trend. In 1995, as in 1979, about 40 percent of welfare recipients worked at some time during the year. This proportion leaped to 58 percent by 1999.
The number of families on welfare has dropped by more than half since 1994, to 2.4 million from a peak of 5.1 million. Welfare officials often say that the first people to leave the rolls are those with the most skills. Officials assumed that people who remained on the rolls would have more difficulty finding jobs.
But David Card, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, said, "The employment rate has increased even after the best-trained, best-prepared people have left the welfare rolls."
Economists have detected an increase in wages among never-married single mothers, even as the supply of such low-wage workers has increased.
"Prior to 1996, wages in low-wage jobs were not keeping pace with inflation," said Mr. Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute. "But then, as the unemployment rate moved toward a 30-year low, the real wages of low-paid workers began to rise for the first time in a couple of decades. That creates incentives to join the labor force and to try to cash in on those wage gains."
Still, said Mr. Primus, the former Clinton administration official, the poorest fifth of the nation's female-headed families had less disposable income, on the average, in 1999 than in 1995. Higher pay was often offset by the loss of income from welfare, food stamps and other government programs, Mr. Primus said.
"Many families have had spectacular increases in earnings," Mr. Primus said, "but those gains do not always show up on the bottom line."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: FOREIGN POLICY;
From Social Security to Environment, the Candidates' Positions

BYLINE: By David E. Sanger

 BODY:
Voters have many questions about issues,and Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have many answers. Here aresummaries of the Bush and Gore positions onpolicy issues that have recieved considerable attention in the presidential campaign, with a comparison to show how the candidates differand agree, and assesments of their position fromexperts and political analysts-some partisan, some not.
Foreign policy has not figured prominently in the campaign, even though outside this country's borders -- in the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, the tense border between India and Pakistan -- Washington finds itself dealing with questions of life, death and potential war. 
 Mr. Bush has little foreign policy experience: At 54, he has left the United States (apart from trips to Mexico) three times in his adult life. Mr. Gore, in contrast, has broad experience in foreign affairs, but he has some vulnerabilities. Talk of Asia brings up memories of campaign contributions in 1996 from a Taiwan-connected Buddhist temple; talk of Russia reminds voters of Mr. Gore's secret deal to stop Russian arms exports to Iran, a deal the Russians appear to be violating.
But there are big differences. Mr. Gore is an interventionist, and over the years has repeatedly pressed for more vigorous United States involvement in hot spots around the world, including Bosnia and Kosovo. Mr. Bush denies he is an isolationist, but says United States troops should not be used for nation-building abroad. He would start by bringing home the 11,400 troops in the Balkans, once this country's NATO allies had agreed. That statement caused an uproar in Europe.
Not surprisingly, both men insist they are free traders. But Mr. Gore's use of that title is dubious: he has often jumped to help his protectionist labor constituency, and was known in the White House as the most unforgiving of Japanese protectionist trade practices. Mr. Bush seems cut from more traditional free-trade cloth, but to appeal to voters in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, he talks about enforcing American antidumping laws, which many read as a backhanded way of saying he would protect workers in those states from intense foreign competition.
Both men have steered clear of specifics in the toughest new territory in American foreign affairs: How to deal with the forces of economic globalization and resentments engendered by America's economic, military and cultural might around the world. They say they would act with humility. They do not say how. David E. Sanger

TWO ASSESSMENTS
 
"The United States is the only power that can handle a showdown in the gulf, mount the kind of force that is needed to protect Saudi Arabia and deter a crisis in the Taiwan Straits. And extended peacekeeping detracts from our readiness for these kinds of global missions."
 
Condoleezza Rice, foreign policy adviser to Mr. Bush
 
"We must work with our NATO allies, who provide the majority of the peacekeepers, to ensure that those countries which have struggled so hard to free themselves of the bonds of tyranny have our help, our partnership, in becoming thriving democratic states."
 
Leon Fuerth, foreign policy adviser to Mr. Gore.

Chart: "Competing Estimates"
There are differing views over how much of the surplus will actually materialize. A look at three 10-year estimates of the budget surplus outside Social Security and the underlying assumptions.
 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
This estimate, the one used by the two campaigns, assumes that discretionary spending will rise each year at the rate of inflation. And it assumes that the economy will grow at an average of 2.7 percent for most of the next 10 years.

LEHMAN BROTHERS
This projection assumes that the economy will expand by around 4 percent a year, higher than the conservative C.B.O. figures, but closer to what most economists now consider the nation's capacity for non-inflationary growth.
$2.52 TRILLION

HEADLINE: Tens of Thousands In Manila Demand Leader Step Down

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MANILA, the Philippines, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of Filipinos crowded streets and highway overpasses in Manila today demanding that President Joseph Estrada resign over allegations he received huge payoffs from illegal gambling.
"Mr. President, you are the cause of our hardships, you are the problem," said former President Corazon Aquino. "History may treat you more favorably if you resign." 
 Pressure on Mr. Estrada to step down has grown rapidly as prominent lawmakers have deserted his party in recent days. More than 50 of them have said they will support an impeachment motion in the House of Representatives, virtually assuring enough votes to send it to the Senate for a trial.
The resignations submitted on Friday included the leaders of both houses of Congress: the Senate president, Franklin Drilon, and the House speaker, Manuel Villar.
Today's rally, organized by Manila's influential archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, was held at a shrine commemorating the peaceful "people's power" revolt that ousted the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Participants crowded three highway overpasses overlooking the shrine and threw confetti from nearby buildings.
While the color yellow symbolized the 1986 revolt, many at the rally wore white, representing their call for corruption-free government.
"He is mismanaging the economy and the government is ridden with scandal," said Sister Rufisanti, a nun who said she also took part in the "people's power" revolt. "He should resign."
The crisis surrounding Mr. Estrada began early in October when a provincial governor, Luis Singson, testified that the president had asked him to coordinate the collection of payoffs from an illegal numbers game called jueteng.
Mr. Estrada has denied taking any illegal gambling money but has provided little evidence. On his weekly television program today, he suggested he would stay on to face impeachment.

HEADLINE: Teacher Caliber Is Lowest in Cities, New York Study Finds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The caliber of public-school teachers in large urban areas in New York State is much worse than in the state's small cities and suburban and rural areas, according to a new study that examines 30 years' worth of state teaching data.
Teachers in New York City and the state's four other major urban areas -- Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers -- are more likely to lack certification, to have failed their certification exams or to have attended less-competitive colleges, according to the study, which was conducted for the State Education Department by researchers at the State University of New York at Albany. 
 The study, whose results will be released Wednesday in Albany, also found that teachers who begin their careers in New York City are far more likely to leave the public schools than are teachers whose first job is in another region of New York.
All those trends, the study concluded, have a disproportionate effect on poor students and on black and Latino children, although it did not say why that was so. In New York City particularly, poor or black and Latino students are far more likely than white or middle-class students to have low-quality, inexperienced teachers.
"The lowest-quality teachers are the ones teaching the children who come from environments with the greatest educational needs," said Hamilton Lankford, an associate professor of economics at the university and an author of the study. "I find that very troubling."
James Wyckoff, an associate professor of public administration at the university and the other author, said the pattern was found even among newly hired teachers, not just among veterans who are more likely because of union work rules to be able to choose their school assignments.
The study was conducted for the Educational Finance Research Consortium, a group of researchers from colleges and universities across the state. The findings will be discussed Wednesday at a policy conference in Albany that is co-sponsored by the State Board of Regents.
Dr. Wyckoff said the study was the first to examine information for every teacher and administrator employed in a state public school from 1969 through 1999. That database, which includes statistics on 600,000 teachers, is maintained by the State Education Department.
Some findings appear to confirm widely held beliefs about public school teachers -- that teachers in New York City earn less than those in suburbs, for example, and that schools in poor neighborhoods have more inexperienced teachers. But other findings run counter to the conventional wisdom.
For example, while it has long been known that the salary for starting teachers in New York City -- roughly $30,000 -- is about 25 percent less than for those in the surrounding suburbs, the study found that that is not the case in the state's other major metropolitan areas. There, salaries paid to urban teachers are equal to or exceed those paid to teachers in nearby suburbs.
The study found that two of every five teachers who began their careers in New York City in 1991 had left the city school system within six years. Nearly all of them also stopped teaching in any public school in the state. Only 3 percent moved to suburban schools in New York.
It is not clear how many of those teachers quit the profession and how many continue to teach in another state or in a private school in New York, the researchers said. But the fact that, on average, nearly one in three teachers across the state left the New York public school system within six years indicates that a fair number probably quit teaching for other fields, they said.
Dr. Wyckoff and Dr. Lankford said that they did not know the reasons behind some of their findings, but that they were continuing to research the explanations.
The state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, said the question of why so many teachers are leaving was at the top of the list of concerns being addressed by the Board of Regents.
"It's difficult and costly to find teachers,' Mr. Mills said. "So when we find them we can't let them get away." Among the measures that the Regents have approved in an effort to retain teachers are more thorough career-development programs.
Mr. Mills said that the Education Department commissioned the study because "we need the people who make decisions about these matters, in the Legislature and elsewhere, to know that these conclusions are based on good research."
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the New York City teachers' union, said that higher salaries were the best way to attract and keep more qualified teachers.
Additional incentives are needed to attract teachers to low-performing schools, Ms. Weingarten said. "If you let a school system starve and don't pay attention to the human resources -- namely, teacher salaries and other human infrastructure -- then what you see in this report will happen," she said. "You'll get bad consequences for kids and worse consequences for the poorest children."
Anthony P. Coles, deputy mayor for planning, education and cultural affairs, disagreed, saying salaries did not directly affect teacher quality. "If you look at the private and parochial schools in the city, they offer salaries that are significantly less, yet they don't have the same problems," he said.
"They do an effective job of teaching students and provide a better work environment for teachers," in large part because they lack the "inefficiency, bureaucracy, and red tape" of the city's public schools, Mr. Coles said.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Lazio Differ on School Aid, Social Security and Tax Cuts

 BODY:

Education
With New Yorkers citing education as a major concern, Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton have both embraced the issue as a top priority in the Senate race.
But Mrs. Clinton's education proposals are similar to those of the powerful teacher unions that support her, while Mr. Lazio is more focused on wooing the suburban residents whose votes he needs. He has joined other Republicans in stressing the importance of local control over education spending and policy. 
 Mr. Lazio has called for $98 billion in new federal spending on education over the next decade, compared with the roughly $125 billion in education spending that Mrs. Clinton has proposed. Both have proposed competency tests for teachers and alternative certification programs to ease the state's severe teacher shortage.
But Mrs. Clinton has proposed testing prospective teachers on their subject of expertise as a condition of letting them teach -- a plan the unions have endorsed.Mr. Lazio's plan would give districts the option of testing teachers every five years.
Mr. Lazio's most costly proposal would provide $60 billion -- the bulk of his $98 billion education package -- in grants to the states to cover the cost of special education programs over 10 years. Federal law requires such programs, but pays only about 12 percent of their cost. Aware that the issue resonates with suburban voters, Mrs. Clinton has a similar proposal, although hers would provide $20 billion over 10 years.
Mr. Lazio also wants to invest $10 billion on a "Hometown Choice" grant program that would let local schools and parents decide how to spend the federal dollars. On vouchers, Mrs. Clinton has sided with the teachers' unions in vehemently opposing vouchers, saying they would strip the public schools of precious resources. Mr. Lazio has quietly endorsed vouchers, a position that appeals to more conservative voters. In Congress, he voted several times for experimental voucher programs. But in the Senate race, where he has been careful to paint himself as a moderate, he has referred to vouchers as "opportunity scholarships." Under his plan, the federal government would provide $5 billion to families who have children in failing schools that could be put toward tuition at a private school.
 
Abortion
Mrs. Clinton supports abortion rights, including government financing of abortions, and backs the approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486. But she has said she could support a ban on a form of late-term abortion that its critics call "partial birth," as long as the provision includes an exemption to allow the procedure if a mother's health or life needs protection. She has also said that she would not vote for a Supreme Court nominee opposed to abortion rights.
Mr. Lazio generally supports abortion rights, but he opposes government financing of abortions. He also supports government approval of RU-486, but he is against allowing the government to pay for it. He also supports a ban on the so-called partial-birth abortions. Mr. Lazio has said he would not reject Supreme Court nominees opposed to abortion rights, but has also said he would consider their abortion views in deciding whether to confirm them.
 
Campaign Finance
Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton support legislation in Washington that would overhaul the campaign finance system by banning so-called soft money, the largely unregulated contributions to political committees. Mr. Lazio voted for the legislation in the House, breaking with many leaders of his party.
 
Gun Control
Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton both support the Brady Law, which imposes a waiting period on prospective gun purchases and bans many types of assault weapons. Mrs. Clinton supports licensing new guns and registering new gun owners. Mr. Lazio opposes those measures, arguing that the nation should first enforce existing gun laws before considering national registration.
 
Social Security
Mrs. Clinton says that her plan would set aside part of the national budget surplus to preserve Social Security in its current form. Her campaign says that the tax-cut proposal offered by Mr. Lazio would squander the surplus in the same way she says the Republican presidential candidate's plan would, and, in the process, undermine Social Security. But Mr. Lazio counters that his tax-cut plan would cost less than the one proposed by George W. Bush, and that there is enough of a budget surplus to ensure the stability of Social Security.
 
Prescription Drugs and Medicare
Mrs. Clinton has also proposed putting more money into Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly and the disabled, to offer prescription drug coverage to all beneficiaries. Her plan would cost $253 billion over 10 years and would offer drug benefits under the existing Medicare program. The benefit would be available to the elderly for an additional monthly premium that would start at $25 a month in 2002 and nearly double over the next decade. Mr. Lazio also proposes to provide prescription drug coverage for the elderly, but to do so in a way that is strikingly different from the approach supported by Mrs. Clinton. His plan would set aside about $40 billion over five years to help individuals buy prescription drug coverage from private insurers. It would apply only to elderly people who are eligible for Medicare but who lack their own private prescription drug coverage. Mr. Lazio wants to use private insurers and health maintenance organizations to deliver prescription drug benefits to the elderly. But the government would still pay most of the costs and would have the authority to approve or disapprove drug plans offered by insurers.
 
Health Care
Mrs. Clinton's health care policy is very similar to the proposals that the Clinton administration has been championing in Washington since the failure in 1994 of her proposal to provide health insurance for every American. Mrs. Clinton, generally speaking, wants to expand existing government programs and, in the process, provide more generous benefits than Mr. Lazio would. But his advisers say she is simply trying to achieve her 1994 goals in an incremental fashion.
In general, Mr. Lazio favors providing more access to health care coverage through the private sector, primarily by helping people cover the costs of prescription drugs and health insurance with some government subsidies and tax breaks. Another chief difference between the two candidates centers on what is called a patients' bill of rights to protect those who belong to health maintenance organizations. Mrs. Clinton's proposal would, among other things, give people the right to sue if an insurer denies coverage for a medical procedure.
Mr. Lazio opposes that approach, saying that it would lead to needless litigation and force up the price of health insurance. His plan would offer an alternative appeals process if insurers deny coverage, providing people with the right to sue only after all internal and external appeals had been exhausted.
 
New York City Sports Stadium
In her debate with Mr. Lazio on Oct. 8, Mrs. Clinton said she was opposed to using taxpayer money to build a domed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, a favorite project of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who wants to use the stadium to lure the New York Jets and the 2012 Olympics to New York City. But later, Mrs. Clinton said she would keep "an open mind," adding that no stadium should be built without major public transportation improvements, including completion of the Second Avenue subway and bringing the Long Island Rail Road to the East Side.
Mr. Lazio supports using taxpayer money to build the stadium, although he has said that private money should be used as well. Mr. Lazio has also praised the stadium plan as an opportunity to expand the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
 
Missile Defense
Mrs. Clinton supports financing research for a missile defense system, but stops short of endorsing its deployment. Mr. Lazio, who voted against a bill last year that called on President Clinton to deploy the missile shield as soon as possible, now supports deployment of the missile shield.
 
Middle East
Mrs. Clinton has shifted away from the position she took two years ago, before entering the race, supporting an independent Palestinian state. She now says she does not support a unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinians and would support a Palestinian state only as part of a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Mr. Lazio has voted consistently in favor of maintaining sanctions against Israel's enemies and in favor of foreign aid to Israel. He said recently that he would remain personally opposed to an independent Palestinian state, even if both sides agreed to its creation, because he believes such a state would be unsustainable.
 
Worldview
Mrs. Clinton sees the United States as an active international player, using its role as the sole superpower to right wrongs and exert moral authority. While saying she would not support intervention abroad without strong justification, she offers an expansive definition of the national interest that includes struggles against environmental degradation, poverty and disease.
Mr. Lazio says he supports global engagement, but to a more limited degree that squares more ideologically with the views of Mr. Bush. But unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Lazio said he does not support the withdrawal of American forces from Bosnia and Kosovo.
 
Tax Cuts
The candidates have both proposed cutting taxes, but their approaches could hardly be more different. Mr. Lazio has proposed several significant changes to the tax code, most notably making Social Security tax payments deductible for those in the two lowest tax brackets (which cover married couples who have taxable income of up to $106,000 a year). He backs eliminating both the estate tax and the so-called marriage penalty, and has proposed a cut in the capital gains tax. Mrs. Clinton's tax-cut proposals tend to be narrower. She favors tax credits for businesses that create jobs and for families with disabled relatives and children in college or in day care. She favors changing, rather than eliminating, the marriage penalty and estate taxes, to benefit lower-income people.
When it comes to retirement plans, Mrs. Clinton backs a scaled-down version of Vice President Al Gore's proposed retirement savings accounts. Mr. Lazio favors an even less expensive plan, simply increasing the cap on contributions into Individual Retirement Accounts.
 
Upstate Economy
In upstate New York, it's still the economy. While economic conditions north of Westchester are no longer in free fall, as they were a couple of years ago, upstate cities have not prospered the way New York City and its suburbs have.
Mrs. Clinton has made a major campaign issue out of upstate's lagging fortunes, and has accused Mr. Lazio of being an "ostrich" who refuses to acknowledge that the region has serious problems. She has proposed a variety of programs to help upstate, including tax credits for businesses, training programs for workers, and measures to improve tourism, transportation and technology.
Like his ally, Governor Pataki, Mr. Lazio has focused on upstate's improving job growth, and has criticized Mrs. Clinton for portraying the region as "a vast economic wasteland." He has stressed a general tax cut as a way to return money to residents' pockets, which he says will prompt investment and job creation.
 
Housing
The short supply and high price of housing is a major problem across the New York metropolitan region. As chairman of the House subcommittee on housing, Mr. Lazio claims housing measures, including a revamping of public housing and more funds for the elderly, disabled, homeless and others, as his main legislative achievement.
Mrs. Clinton and her allies accuse him of reducing subsidized housing for the poor, taking credit for the ideas of others and standing by while the Republican-controlled Congress slashed housing funds. Her proposals include tax credits to promote construction, new public housing and more rental aid vouchers for the poor.

HEADLINE: Yugoslavia Now Wrestles With Forming A Government

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 4

 BODY:
More than a month after elections that led to the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav Parliament today confirmed a new federal government dominated by the coalition that backed the new president, Vojislav Kostunica.
The new government will move quickly, its leaders promise, to restore diplomatic relations with the United States and other major NATO countries and to bring Yugoslavia back into international organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the Council of Europe. 
 The confirmation was another important step in the consolidation of power by Mr. Kostunica and his supporters after the 13-year rule of Mr. Milosevic. But the more powerful Serbian government remains transitional, with elections for a new Serbian Parliament due on Dec. 23.
The new federal Parliament was elected on Sept. 24, the same day as Mr. Kostunica. But Mr. Kostunica could not take office until a popular uprising forced Mr. Milosevic to resign on Oct. 6.
And negotiating the shape of the new government was onerous, largely because the Western-supported president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, boycotted the September elections in protest against Mr. Milosevic. Montenegro is Serbia's sole partner in the Yugoslav federation.
Although fewer than 30 percent of Montenegrins voted, the boycott by Mr. Djukanovic left all of Montenegro's seats to allies of Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, insisted he would have to form a federal government from the parties elected to the Parliament. By constitutional tradition, he would have to have a Montenegrin prime minister from the largest Montenegrin party in the Parliament -- the Socialist People's Party, which had backed Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Djukanovic was offered some posts in the new government anyway, but declined. In private, however, he has told Mr. Kostunica that they can work together to discuss a new relationship between Serbia and Montenegro.
The prime minister-designate, Zoran Zizic, in a speech to the Parliament today, said the government would move quickly to restore relations with the rest of Europe and press for the "firm implementation of Security Council Resolution 1244, which guarantees the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," including Kosovo.
His new foreign minister, Goran Svilanovic, a Kostunica supporter and leader of the Civic Alliance, traveled on Thursday to the United Nations, where Yugoslavia was readmitted as a full member. Mr. Svilanovic, 37 years old and born in Kosovo, is a shrewd, liberal-minded politician who was Mr. Kostunica's own choice for foreign minister.
Mr. Svilanovic is one of the nine new ministers from the Kostunica coalition, still known -- now somewhat incongruously -- as the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. Montenegrin parties have seven ministries, including finance and defense. The old government, by contrast, had 30 ministers.
The most crucial position is held by Miroljub Labus, an economist who is deputy prime minister and in charge of international financial relations. Mr. Labus is chairman of a group of opposition economists and policy experts known as G-17 Plus, which was instrumental in drawing up the government's program.
After a decade of mismanagement, price controls, a state-supported mafia and crony privatization, Yugoslavia needs help to restructure its economy without creating excessive popular anger at the new authorities.
The new interior minister is Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis, the third-largest city in Serbia. Mr. Zivkovic promised that the police would serve citizens, work openly "and not be a shadowy force."
As important as the federal government is, the more powerful Serbian government has presented further complications. In September, there were no elections for Serbian posts, so the new powers in the land forced through the resignation of the existing Serbian government of Milosevic supporters.
Mr. Kostunica's allies, led by Zoran Djindjic, the Democratic Party leader, cobbled together a temporary government with some of Mr. Milosevic's less loyal Socialists until early Serbian parliamentary elections are held. The workings of the temporary government have been stalled over opposition demands for the firing of Rade Markovic, the head of the Serbian secret police.

HEADLINE: Searching for the Relevant;
For Many, Races Reflect the Worst of Political Times

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
For nearly two years, residents of New York and New Jersey have been exposed to United States Senate campaigns that will not be remembered for their crystallizing moments of political distinction. No William Jennings Bryan speech, no Lincoln-Douglas debate, no photograph of Adlai Stevenson, his feet up to reveal well-worn soles and therefore a piece of his soul.
The New York race, between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio (and before him, Rudolph W. Giuliani), will be recalled as the most expensive Senate race ever, one more often defined by personalities than by positions. 
 The New Jersey campaign pits a career politician, Representative Bob Franks, against a former Wall Street executive, Jon S. Corzine, who has brought distinction to that race by spending more of his own money, an estimated $60 million, than any other Senate candidate in history.
In two days, both races will end. And not a moment too soon, according to a survey, decidedly impressionistic rather than scientific in design, of more than 50 people, from Rochester to Riverhead in New York, and in several communities throughout New Jersey.
Many of those questioned said they felt more than just weariness about the two protracted campaigns, something deeper, more disturbing.
At times, they said, the races seemed to reflect the worst in electoral politics.
They spoke of profligate spending that reinforced the sense that elections are bought, not won; of squabbles over tangential issues that were unimportant to them; of often subjective news coverage; and of continual mudslinging in the guise of slick advertising.
Many clung to memories of, and hopes for, a purer kind of politics, one that has not existed for a long time, if ever. It is the sentiment in the movie Mr. Franks says is his favorite, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." On screen, an idealist beats back corrupt powers to win an election, but that Frank Capra film also suggests that corruption and dishonesty are the political norm. It was released in 1939.
Kathleen McNeile, a social studies teacher at Rye High School in New York, said she had been using this year's campaigns to teach her students about the political process. They debated the issues and saw "Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man,' " a Broadway play about electoral politics. Through it all, she said, she has decided that she is "an optimist, but not an idealist."
"I realize the issues for many candidates are not nearly as important as simply trying to get elected," Ms. McNeile said, "doing whatever it takes to get elected."
It was a familiar sentiment, but nonetheless profound. Few people said they had experienced any epiphanies about the issues of the day, including economic development and health care. None said they had arrived at a greater appreciation for those striving to win public office.
Instead, these people from New York and New Jersey, where voter turnout has hovered around 50 percent in recent presidential election years, spoke of trying to wade through muck to find data that would help them choose between what several described as the lesser of two evils.
"Don't get me started," said Warren A. Brandenstein, a retired sales executive, as he waited for a haircut at Image Haircutters in Riverhead. "The whole system stinks. This battling back and forth, what this guy did, what that guy did, you don't know what to believe."
In New York, most people said they did not care about the debate over campaign financing, which seemed to preoccupy the Clinton and Lazio campaigns for weeks on end.
Many said they did not care that Mrs. Clinton accepted and later returned $50,000 in contributions from members of an American Muslim organization that Mr. Lazio tried to portray as tacitly supportive of terrorist acts. And they shrugged off the news that the Lazio campaign had previously solicited contributions from the same Muslim group.
"They are bringing up a lot of things that are just not relevant to the office," said Michael P. Reichel, the superintendent of the Town of Riverhead Sewer Department, as he paused near a roiling treatment tank.
"There is too much about the character of the person," he said, "the character of the family. I just don't think it's appropriate. All the negative stuff doesn't help when you're trying to make up your mind."
In New Jersey, where the Senate campaign has been under way for more than a year, most people said the most familiar issue seemed to be Mr. Corzine's willingness to spend a chunk of his personal fortune in pursuit of elective office.
That level of spending has made his voice and image so ubiquitous on television that Patricia Hollingsworth, 32, a lawyer from Millburn, has developed a Pavlovian response. "As soon as I see them I flip the channel," she said.
Several New Jersey voters said the matter was overblown, given that the spending of one's own wealth on political office has a history that dates to well before Nelson Rockefeller and John F. Kennedy. A few repeated Mr. Corzine's argument that it is preferable to have an elected official free from the favoritism that can come from accepting campaign contributions from corporations and special-interest groups.
"He didn't take it from me or anyone else," said Alex Garden, 68, who works part time in his wife's clothing store in Summit. "He can spend it any way he wants. This is a democratic country."
But what Mr. Garden saw as a reflection of democracy was the same detail that Michael Savage saw as evidence that "we have a great democracy but it's been screwed up."
"It's sickening," Mr. Savage, 42, a sales manager from New Providence, said of the Corzine campaign's spending. "The guy is just buying himself a seat in the Senate." Mr. Savage said that while he was leaning toward voting for Mr. Franks, the financial underdog, "I'll just be glad when this whole waste of money is over."
For all the criticism of the candidates and their campaigns, several people pointed to the news media as equally responsible for what was wrong with the political process. They railed against what they called slanted coverage and the preponderance of talk shows in which journalists, political scientists and so-called focus groups begin deconstructing televised debates before the candidates have even left the stage.
"I wish somebody would sit down and really analyze what the candidates are saying," said James C. Andrews, a retired civil engineer, as he stood on Main Street in the historic whaling village of Sag Harbor on Long Island's South Fork. "But instead of getting into the facts, they are getting into who made a mistake. It's the politics of who looks better and who is the nicest."
What results, he concluded, is a distortion of the campaigns "by a national media that are a bunch of empty heads and pretty faces."
Rob Harper, a banker spending a day off in City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan, agreed. One of his complaints was the news media's reliance on polls that often seem both contradictory and intended to sway a voter's thinking before Election Day.
"This poll's numbers show Lazio ahead, the next day another shows Hillary ahead," he said. "You're left wondering which one is right, and do I even have to vote?"
A few of the people interviewed said disillusionment, as well as the sense of being disconnected from those matters that are the focus of campaigns, had led them to decide against participating. In other words, they will not vote on Tuesday.
"I'm just not excited about anyone," said Susan Lockwood, 57, a touch of apology in her voice. She said she had always voted in the past, often supporting Republican candidates for president.
But after decades of leading what she described as a solid middle-class life, Ms. Lockwood is divorced, and was on her way up Passaic Avenue in Passaic, N.J., to clean other people's houses.
"Me, I'm just scraping by," she said, turning away, "and the politicians really don't care."
Such apathy was also found among more affluent people in Summit, the comfortable suburb where Mr. Corzine lives and where Mr. Franks grew up. Brad Mell, 34, a bond trader walking along Springfield Avenue, Summit's well-tended commercial spine, had only a vague idea what the presidential and Senate candidates were for or against.
Politics, he said, is a childish game of promise-making and name-calling, an annoying burble that only clogs up prime-time television each fall. "Who wants to hear all that bashing?" he said.
It is not that Colleen O'Halloran and her boyfriend, Nicholas McCarthy, want to hear the bashing, or anything else unrelated to the issues in New York's Senate campaign. Ms. O'Halloran said she thought that Mr. Lazio "has acted like a child." Mr. McCarthy said that if the only open Senate seat were in Michigan, Mrs. Clinton "would have gone to Michigan."
Ms. Halloran and Mr. McCarthy, two 21-year-old college students from Brooklyn, paused from their lunches in City Hall Park to say they saw the elections as a process in which candidates would say anything, no matter how vicious or pandering, for the sole purpose of getting elected. They suggested that while that was unpleasant and not particularly edifying, it remained important to them.
When asked whether they planned to vote on Tuesday, the cynicism of the moment melted away as both vigorously nodded their heads yes.

Financial services companies have reasserted their importance to New York City's real estate market and the economy with a vengeance as the dot-com companies have retreated from the stage in recent months.
Uptown and downtown, investment banks, commercial banks and insurance companies are building new office towers and gobbling up space with the same kind of abandon that characterized the technology companies at the beginning of the year. Financial services now account for almost 40 percent of the 400 million square feet of office space in Manhattan, four times more than any other industry, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate brokerage firm. 
 The Goldman Sachs Group, for one, is finishing up negotiations for a total of 1 million square feet of space in two downtown buildings that will bring its combined holdings to an estimated 4.4 million square feet, the equivalent of one 110-story tower at the World Trade Center. Over time, Goldman may shed some old space, but it has also started work on a 2 million-square-foot hotel and conference center in Jersey City that will include the tallest skyscraper in New Jersey at its opening, set for 2004. Three years ago, the investment bank had 1.5 million square feet of space and less than half the 11,000 employees it has today.
"Financial services is still driving the bus in this city," said Richard Clark, president of Brookfield Financial Properties, whose 10 million square feet of office space in Manhattan is filled with companies like Merrill Lynch. "Everybody's doing well, but Goldman is amazing."
Technology companies seemed to have eclipsed the financial industry in the first half of the year, when the dot-coms chased after space in every quarter of the city, driving rents up and accounting for a quarter of all the leasing deals in Manhattan. But those companies never accounted for more than 5 percent of the city's employment and income, while Wall Street generated 20 percent of the city's income. As the technology industry slowed in the third quarter, financial services surged.
"High tech was a blip," said Janice Stanton, managing director of investment research at Cushman & Wakefield. "Financial services is just huge in New York. Banking and finance have accounted for a third of all the leases year to date. And if you include all the rumored deals, it jumps to 50 percent."
Ms. Stanton said that financial services accounted for 31 percent of the office space in Manhattan, and that if insurance companies were added to the mix, the number would jump to 37 percent. Law firms make up the next largest concentration, 10 percent of the total.
While Goldman Sachs will soon have 4.4 million square feet of space in Manhattan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has 4.5 million and Merrill Lynch has more than 3.4 million, according to RealtyIQ, a real estate data company.
More than 170,000 people in New York City work for Wall Street companies, according to the State Department of Labor, up 30 percent since the recession of the early 1990's. Financial services jobs make up 5 percent of the city's private employment, but almost 18 percent of the wages with an average salary of more than $200,000.
An additional 180,000 people work at commercial banks and insurance companies, although the number of jobs in both sectors has declined every year since 1987, in part because of mergers and consolidations.
But the relative dominance of the financial industry could also create a problem if the economy slows down and jobs and tax revenues decline, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said two years ago. He said it was critical that the city cultivate other industries so that the local economy was not as dependent on the fortunes of Wall Street.
"There has been an overreliance on the financial sector," Mr. McCall said recently. "If there's a downturn, it'll have a big impact. But I've seen more diversity. The new-media and Internet companies have really taken root here, and that's good. At the same time, you've got to expect a shakeout among the technology companies."
To be sure, there is still life among many high-technology and dot-com companies. Some are still growing, and their emergence downtown has helped diversify the traditionally finance-bound character of the area, noted Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York.
The fast-growing networking giant Cisco Systems is exploring a deal for the proposed 1 million-square-foot tower over the Port Authority Bus Terminal at the southwest corner of Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, according to real estate brokers.
But it is the financial sector that is exerting its muscle in Midtown and downtown.
Morgan Stanley is building a 1 million-square-foot skyscraper on Seventh Avenue at 50th Street, its third tower in the Times Square area. Having already outgrown its 1.2 million-square-foot headquarters under construction at Madison Avenue and 47th Street, Bear Stearns Companies has decided to keep a large block of space in its current home at 245 Park Avenue.
Demolition has begun for a new 1.1 million-square-foot headquarters for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at Madison Avenue and 42nd Street. Two blocks west, Deutsche Bank is in talks with Douglas Durst, the developer, about a 1.5 million-square-foot headquarters at the northwest corner of 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas.
Brown Brothers Harriman is negotiating with state and city officials about moving to new quarters at Battery Park City, and Lehman Brothers is looking for 500,000 square feet downtown.
Chase Manhattan Bank, which is acquiring the J. P. Morgan investment bank, recently rented 556,000 square feet at 1166 Avenue of the Americas, one of the largest leasing deals of the year. The two companies combined have 12.5 million square feet of office space in Manhattan and 2 million square feet in Brooklyn. Chase, however, recently signed a deal to move out of 55 Water Street downtown and into 1.1 million square feet in Jersey City.
Stretching beyond its headquarters on Madison Avenue, Credit Suisse First Boston recently took 264,708 square feet at 315 Park Avenue South.
"High-tech tenants are not out of the market," said Ms. Stanton of Cushman & Wakefield. "But they're no longer dominating."

Hampton Decides to Seek Better Offers as Free Agent

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: AMELIA ISLAND, Fla., Nov. 4

 BODY:
Mike Hampton's relationship with the Mets grew tenuous today when the pitcher's agent notified the club that Hampton had chosen to become a free agent.
After giving the Mets a chance to sign Hampton with no competition from other teams, Mark Rodgers, his agent, said they made the decision because "we were informed that the Mets had no current intention of improving on the offer the club made to Mike in February." 
 Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said he was neither surprised nor discouraged by the development. "I'd still like to see if we can work out a deal to have him fit here," said Phillips, who is here for the general managers' annual meetings. "It's just a matter of determining where the deal should go. I had to let the market tell me what the appropriate range is."
The two sides have not disclosed details of the proposal the Mets made in February, but a wide gap, philosophically and economically, apparently separated them. The free-agent market is expected to enable Hampton to sign for about $15 million a year, the amount Kevin Brown gained from Los Angeles two years ago.
Asked if he was prepared to meet the market, wherever it went, Phillips said: "It's not a decision to be made in a vacuum. It depends on all of the other considerations we have. It's all part of the combined plan."
That plan begins with Alex Rodriguez, the free-agent shortstop whom the Mets covet and who is expected to command $20 million or more a year on a very long-term contract. The Mets cannot ignore free-agent pitchers like Hampton and Mike Mussina because Rick Reed and Bobby J. Jones are also free agents.
Nevertheless, Rodgers said he was prepared to continue to listen seriously to what Phillips said. "If he is serious about it, Mike Hampton and I will never close the door on the New York Mets," Rodgers said in a telephone interview.
Speaking of free agency, Rodgers, in a statement he released earlier in the day, said, "It simply closes one window of opportunity, i.e., the opportunity the Mets possessed to negotiate exclusively with Mike outside the four walls of the free-agent market."
Any interest the Mets have, the agent added, "will be balanced now against the interests of other clubs."
Rodgers said he would begin talking to other clubs "in earnest" on Sunday when he arrived here. The agent can speak to other clubs about Hampton, but he cannot negotiate with any team but the Mets until Nov. 11, after the 15-day filing period ends.
Hampton said in a statement: "I have filed for free agency because I am curious about the possibilities that may be available for me around the major leagues. I did not file for free agency because I am angry with the Mets."
He added that he enjoyed playing in New York. Hampton said he intended to keep an open mind, which included the possibility of remaining with the Mets. The Mets, however, may find a more economically feasible solution in trying to sign Denny Neagle as a free agent.
When Neagle first joined the Yankees in July, he talked of signing with them, and they echoed the interest. However, his performance for the Yankees deteriorated after his first two starts and the team's interest waned. Their late-season offer to Neagle nevertheless remains on the table.
The Mets apparently are considering Neagle because he will not cost nearly as much as Hampton to sign.
"Denny wants to play with a winner, and obviously the Mets are that," Barry Meister, Neagle's agent, said. "Denny's had a tremendous amount of success in the National League and he wouldn't be averse to playing in New York. Also, since the early 80's, I've had a lot of pitchers play for Bobby Valentine. I'm a big Bobby Valentine fan. I think he's terrific with a pitching staff, and he can be an inspirational guy. Personality-wise, I think he and Denny would be a great fit."

HEADLINE: Remote Yemen May Be Key to Terrorist's Past and Future

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: WADI DOAN, Yemen, Nov. 2

 BODY:
By legend, this remote valley nestled between the Arabian Sea and the black, crumpled mountains that form a shield against the vast deserts of Arabia is the land of the Queen of Sheba and the place fabled for the gold and frankincense and myrrh that the Wise Men carried to the manger where Jesus was born.
Even today, nearly 3,000 years after a civilization first flourished here, ancient mudbrick skyscrapers, amber-eyed men with short-tailed turbans and elusive, fast-walking women clothed head-to-toe in black shrouds and tall, conical straw hats lend the landscape a pervasive air of mystery. 
 It was into this world, ancient and in essential ways unchanging, that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped two weeks ago. What drew them was not a way of life that has fascinated generations of Arabists, anthropologists and explorers. Rather, they were investigating the links between this fastness of low-lying mountains and Osama bin Laden, the self-proclaimed leader of an Islamic "holy war" against the United States, who is considered a prime suspect in organizing or at least inspiring the bombing of the destroyer Cole on Oct. 12, which killed 17 American sailors.
The two men who spent four months staking out American warships entering Aden harbor -- thought to be the same two who loaded a skiff with high explosives and blew a gaping hole in one of the world's most sophisticated warships -- spoke with Arabic accents that identified them as natives of Hadhramaut, this province in eastern Yemen that is home to bin Laden's ancestral village, Al-Rubat.
It was from that hilltop village that Muhammad bin Laden, Osama's father, migrated in the 1950's to Saudi Arabia, where he formed close ties with the ruling Saud dynasty and accumulated a billion-dollar fortune building roads and palaces and trading real estate.
Though the 43-year-old Osama bin Laden, the 17th of more than 50 children born to his father, never lived in Wadi Doan and now makes his headquarters in the isolated mountain caves and desert hideouts of Afghanistan, he absorbed his fundamentalist views on Islam from the strict Wahhabi form of Muslim beliefs that is prevalent in this region. And it is here, in Wadi Doan, that some of the clues to his character -- as well as to the bombing of the Cole -- may lie.
F.B.I. officials have said they have only suppositional evidence linking Mr. bin Laden to the Cole attack, but the agency believes from investigations into at least a half-dozen major terrorist strikes on American targets in the past decade that Wadi Doan and similarly remote places in Yemen's hinterland have served as strongholds for a variety of Islamic terrorist groups with links to Mr. bin Laden.
One way and another, the F.B.I. has established links between these Yemeni redoubts and several of the worst Islamic terrorist attacks on American targets, including the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa that killed 242 people and wounded about 5,000 in August 1998 and the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993 that killed 6 people and injured 1,000. Altogether, more than a dozen major attacks on American targets in the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere over the past decade -- including an attack on an Aden hotel in 1992 that was aimed at American soldiers, but missed them, killing two Yemenis -- have been linked to groups with ties to Mr. bin Laden.
Now, the F.B.I.'s investigation into the Cole bombing has led them back to Wadi Doan. Beyond the accents of the two men suspected in the attack, the F.B.I. also believes that Mr. bin Laden, under pressure from the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, who have been subjected to United Nations trade sanctions for harboring him, gave a number of hints shortly before the Cole attack that he was renewing links to his family's ancestral home, possibly as a prelude to seeking a new sanctuary in Yemen.
For one thing, the 6-foot-3-inch Mr. bin Laden, in a videotape secretly delivered to a television station in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar and broadcast from there throughout the Middle East on Sept. 22, wore traditional Hadhrami dress, with a curved dagger at his belt, as he delivered a fresh tirade against the United States and new threats to attack American targets in the Arabian peninsula.
For another, Al-Quds, a London-based Arab-language newspaper with a history of solid reporting on Mr. bin Laden's activities, reported recently that, following strict Islamic tradition, Mr. bin Laden had held a lavish wedding feast in the Afghan city of Kandahar and married, as his fourth wife, a 17-year-old girl from a prominent Hadhramaut family.
Mr. bin Laden's ancestral village, Al-Rubat, lies about 1,350 miles from the deserts and mountains of eastern and southern Afghanistan where he now hides, after quitting his previous base in Sudan under growing F.B.I. pressure in the early 1990's. But the remote Wadi Doan is redolent of many things that appear to have fed into Mr. bin Laden's character and his battle against America -- including a profound Islamic faith that has evolved little in a millennium, a deeply frugal lifestyle, and a passion for secrecy and conspiracy in the face of all things alien or unfamiliar.
Though Mr. bin Laden grew up in the Saudi Arabian city of Jiddah, about 700 miles away across the Arabian peninsula beyond the arid, burning reach of low shale mountains and deserts known as the Empty Quarter, and though he has traveled far even from there, those who know him say he remains every bit a Hadhrami -- as the people of this remote region of eastern Yemen are known: among other things intensely clannish, and just as intensely conservative in their adherence to strict forms of Islam.
"He is a very good man, a very honest man, a very devout man," said Jafr Ahmed, a man in his 70's with cracked spectacles who sat on a stoop in the hilltop fastness of Al Hajrayn, smoking a hookah pipe fashioned from an old oil can and a length of rubber hose. Mr. Ahmed, who worked as a jackhammer operator for the bin Laden company in Saudi Arabia for 35 years, added, "Father and son both, they were kind, they were true to Islam."
Those around here who knew his father say the key to Osama bin Laden's character -- his shrewdness and singularity of purpose, his deeply conservative religious and political views, his profound distaste for non-Islamic influences that have penetrated some of the most remote corners of old Arabia, even the cunning tradecraft he has used in his meticulously planned attacks -- lies in the unrelenting traditions of the Hadhrami.
One of the investigative breaks that brought the F.B.I. to Hadhramaut within days of the Cole bombing was the discovery that one of the presumed bombers, who called himself Abdullah Ahmed Khaled al-Musawah and wore the thick, bushy beard favored among the devout in Islam, carried a driver's license and other documents identifying him as a Hadhramaut native.
The other man, slight and goateed, rarely spoke to those who met him in the steep, cloistering alleyways above Aden harbor, before the two men disappeared for the last time at dawn on the day of bombing. But neighbors said that the second man also spoke with a thick Hadhrami accent, in his case spiced with the linguistic influences of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
As Hadhramis, the suspected bombers came from a world that could scarcely be more different from the one inhabited by the Americans who sent the Cole into Aden for the 25th in a series of refueling stops that began in 1999, disregarding years of C.I.A. and State Department warnings that Yemen offered a haven for Islamic terrorists. Those American officers and diplomats came from a world of stunning technical sophistication and global reach barely imaginable amid the unchanging rhythms and beliefs of life in Hadhramaut.
In these broad valleys, where the rivers dried up in times immemorial, becoming shallow streams only during the August rains, the distant world has not been wholly shut out. For one thing, the poverty that set in centuries ago -- when the collapse of the Roman Empire caused a decline in the frankincense trade and newer civilizations turned increasingly to other, cheaper fragrances available closer at hand -- has made wanderers of the Hadhrami people.
With little to sustain them here, and the maritime traditions born of living on the Arabian Sea, Hadhramis began dispersing to places as distant as Java, the Malaccas and the great port cities of India. During the first big Middle Eastern oil boom in the 1950's, the migration shifted to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
It was this migration that carried Osama bin Laden's father, Muhammad, and several brothers to Saudi Arabia, where they parlayed their Hadhrami frugality and shrewdness into a vast fortune that left Osama bin Laden, after his father died when he was still in his teens, with a personal wealth Saudi acquaintances of the bin Ladens have estimated at $300 million, perhaps even more.
On their travels, Hadhramis took with them special skills, especially in construction techniques developed over the millennia in building the distinctive mud skyscrapers in which most Hadhramis live. When they returned, as many did once they had made enough money to sustain their families, they brought back vestiges of foreign influence.
In recent years, for example, virtually every home in their mud skyscrapers has satellite television that has made Hadhramis enthusiastic watchers of Egyptian movies and Lebanese game shows, and of other light entertainment originating still farther afield, in Europe and the United States.
But the basic Hadhrami qualities -- Islamic devoutness, grinding thrift and, above all, an abiding wariness of foreigners and anything alien to Islam -- have endured. So, too, has an even narrower exclusiveness toward Arabs and Muslims from much closer at hand, a trait sociologists have said is particularly marked in Wadi Doan, the stoney valley that runs down toward the Arabian sea from a point south of the Empty Quarter.
For most Hadhramis, this means never discussing with a stranger anything of political or religious importance, and certainly nothing to do with the bombing of the Cole. "I have no right to ask you anything, and you have no right to ask me -- this way, we both can be happy," said Jamal Ahmed, a 40-year-old seller of stationery, backing away from a visitor to his shop in Al Hajrayn to engage in a self-conscious dusting of his array of pencils, notebooks and erasers.
It was this culture that the bin Ladens carried with them on their travels -- and that made Hadhramaut, for Osama bin Laden, an ideal base when he began in the early 1990's, from his headquarters in Afghanistan, to develop the terrorist diaspora he has used in his self-proclaimed "holy war" against the United States and the ruling dynasties in the Persian Gulf that are its allies.
As Yemen's government discovered after it united the country in a bitter civil war in 1994, the writ of any law but the Koran's, and the local landlords' and tribal leaders', does not run deep.
In the distinctive citadels they have built on the rocky hills that flank the valley, Hadhramis tolerate the groups of intrepid tourists, mostly from France and Germany, who wander the narrow streets. As long as questions relate to matters of tradition and lifestyle, of the skills used in the bee-keeping, goat-herding and subsistence farming that provide much of what little there is in local employment -- and as long as no outsider, particularly a Western man, tries to speak to the shrouded women who scurry past along narrow alleyways -- Hadhramis are friendly, if not exactly exuberant in their attitude toward outsiders.
But once the talk shifts to topics even vaguely related to politics, much more anything as potentially explosive as the use of Hadhramaut as an Islamic terrorist bastion, shutters go up quickly. Ali Omar Bahareish, a trader selling honeycombs opposite the mosque in the hilltop citadel of Al Hajrayn, about 20 miles north of the bin Laden family's native village at Al-Rubat, chatted easily for an hour about his 35 years as a construction worker in Saudi Arabia, some of it working for the bin Laden family company that now has projects throughout the Middle East.
Like many Yemenis, and even most of the people approached in the ancient citadels that crowd every hilltop in Wadi Doan, Mr. Bahareish said he was sorry for the sailors who died aboard the Cole, and sorry, too, for the people of Hadhramaut, since the bombing would further discourage the tourism that also adds to what little local economy there is. But he had scarcely had a chance to say even that before a Yemeni government "minder" assigned to accompany this reporter and a crew from ABC television's "Prime Time" program leapt to his feet from the alcove where he had been dozing and ordered the honey-seller to shut up.
"Don't talk about that, nothing, not a word, nothing about bin Laden," said the minder, in an angry whisper, glowering through his dark glasses, before moving from the alcove to a position a half-dozen paces away where he could monitor the conversation even more carefully.

HEADLINE: Crowds Shower President With the Star Treatment

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
President Clinton acted as a stand-in yesterday as he stumped across the Bronx, Harlem and Brooklyn urging New York Democrats to turn out en masse for his vice president and his wife. But at times, this retiring politician whose name will appear on no ballot on Election Day sure seemed like the main attraction.
Before he made his well-practiced pitch, Mr. Clinton had to quiet the crowd, which surged forward for a glimpse of him at rally after rally and roared whenever he tried to open his mouth. 
 "You're the man, Bill!" one giddy onlooker shouted, teetering atop a chair for a peek at the president at the Marina Del Ray, a restaurant in the Bronx packed with 1,000 Democrats.
"Thank you, Bill! Thank you, Bill!" came another thunderous chant.
Later, in Harlem, Mr. Clinton was the featured speaker at a get-out-the-vote rally in African Square Plaza that drew more than 5,000 excited onlookers.
"We want Bill! We want Bill!" the crowd was shouting when his motorcade pulled up -- and continued shouting long after he took the stage.
Mr. Clinton may well be a detested figure in some parts of the country. And he may well turn off swing voters and energize the Republican base, as the Gore campaign has calculated. But none of that was on display yesterday as Mr. Clinton stuck to solidly Democratic turf -- "I'm preaching to the saved," he noted at one point -- while trying to boost the fortunes of Al Gore's presidential campaign and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate bid.
"Why are New Yorkers so fanatically loyal to President Clinton?" Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and likely mayoral candidate, asked in introducing the president. "The answer is simple: For the first time in my lifetime, there has been someone in the White House who has felt comfortable with people like us."
Others seemed to agree. The focus was supposed to be on Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton, both of whom are locked in tight races, but the Democrats who turned out yesterday could not help repeatedly invoking the name of Mr. Clinton.
"You can't help but love the guy," said Tecala T. Hall, a social worker and Democratic activist. "He gets down with the people. Gore isn't quite there yet, but I want him in the White House. He'll get there."
Fred Judd, a union advocate from Brooklyn and a fervent backer of Mrs. Clinton, said her connection to the president is one of her pluses. "Hillary's going to be good for New York because of all the insider connections she has from the president," Mr. Judd said. "She'll have a pipeline between Washington and New York. She'll get things done."
Mrs. Clinton did not campaign with the president yesterday, but she too was clearly concentrating on her get-out-of-the vote effort in the suburbs and the boroughs. Joined by Representative Nita Lowey, Mrs. Clinton addressed an abortion rights rally at Manhattanville College in Purchase, knocked on doors of homes in New Rochelle and, earlier in the day, strolled through a retail district in Scarsdale.
With President Clinton working to get traditional Democratic voters excited about Tuesday's election, Mrs. Clinton set her sights on women who might otherwise not support her. She talked mostly about abortion rights and the importance of future appointees to the Supreme Court, but she also stressed her opposition to school vouchers and her support for gun safety measures.
Mrs. Clinton got a rousing response from the largely partisan audience at Manhattanville, but she also seemed to make some headway among the handful of Republicans and independents she met throughout the day, including in Scarsdale.
Christine Conklin, 35, a Republican from Eastchester, said she would vote for Mrs. Clinton, in large part because she likes the idea of a woman representing New York. Leslie Hansen-Sturm, 56, a real estate agent and independent, said she had recently decided to vote for Mrs. Clinton as well.
"She's got backbone, whether you like it or not," said Ms. Hansen-Sturm, who was among several dozen people who greeted Mrs. Clinton outside the Coffee Tree shop near the train station in Scarsdale. "I think she will really do something for us."
In Rochdale Village in Queens last night, about 400 residents turned out at a Democratic rally as Mrs. Clinton beseeched members of the predominantly black audience to vote. "My race is tight," Mrs. Clinton told them. "It is volatile. I never know what they are going to do next. "
The president, too, remarked on his own about the surprises Mrs. Clinton has experienced along her 16-month campaign journey, which he said he knew from the start would be a slugfest.
"She has been subject to a campaign that has been amazing to me, and I've been through a lot," Mr. Clinton remarked. "But hey, you know, that's part of the deal. She's met every test. She's worked her heart out for 16 months."
Mr. Clinton clearly relishes all the embraces in these waning days of his presidency, but he also clearly agrees with another line from Mr. Ferrer, who cheered Bronx Democrats by saying, "The legacy of the Clinton-Gore administration hangs in the balance over the next four days."
Mr. Clinton said yesterday that he had never seen a presidential election as close as this one. As he does to audiences everywhere, Mr. Clinton touted the current economic prosperity and argued that Republican policies would squander the surplus and endanger all that his administration has struggled to build.
"If you want to keep the prosperity going, you've got one choice," he said in the Bronx, surprising no one with his answer. "Al Gore. Joe Lieberman. And Hillary."

 FROM THIRD WORLD TO FIRST
 The Singapore Story: 1965-2000.
 By Lee Kuan Yew.
 Illustrated. 729 pp. New York:
 HarperCollins Publishers. $35. 
 Lee Kuan Yew has been one of the most intriguing and exasperating leaders of the post-World War II era. It is not just that he was among the most brilliant and frank, or that he shaped an entire country to his own fancy. Nor is it simply that the nation he forged, Singapore, started off as a poor colony of Britain and ended up substantially wealthier per capita, becoming a model variously studied by Chinese Communists and Western capitalists. No, what is most tantalizing is that Lee, who ruled Singapore from 1959 until he retired, sort of, in 1990, is a Western-educated philosopher-king with a reputation for challenging the accepted wisdom of the West. Pro-Western democrats are a dime a dozen, but Lee Kuan Yew is the most eloquent autocrat in the world today.
Perhaps that is not entirely fair, for Lee's party managed to win overwhelming electoral victories in Singapore. But Lee won his margin of victory in part by stifling critics, either impoverishing them through court judgments or imprisoning them without trial. Lee has a first-rate mind, speaks in the proper English he polished at Cambridge University and defends repressive policies with a thoughtfulness and vigor that make Western democrats squirm. "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Americans have become as dogmatic and evangelical as the Communists were," Lee complains in his new book, in a typical salvo. "They want to promote democracy and human rights everywhere, except where it would hurt themselves as in the oil-rich Arabian peninsula."
The second volume of Lee's memoirs, "From Third World to First" begins roughly from Singapore's independence in 1965. Lee was already Singapore's leader, but he faced enormous challenges at the outset, and foreign correspondents were gloomy about whether the tiny island state could survive. At the opening of Singapore's first Parliament in December 1965, he had to accept an escort from Malaysian troops, who regarded themselves as the real rulers. Lee fumed but did not dare refuse, and a theme throughout the book is his efforts to assert Singapore's identity as a mostly Chinese speck in a sea of Malaysians and Indonesians.
Another crucial challenge was the economy, which was dependent on British military bases that would soon be closed. Lee's basic strategy was to plead with foreign companies to establish sweatshops in Singapore. At a time when many developing countries vilified economic imperialists, Singapore recruited any imperialist with a buck. In the process, Lee -- who had started his career as a lawyer for the labor unions -- emasculated the unions, for fear that they would discourage investment. Lee recalls as a "turning point in Singapore's industrial history" the moment when a powerful union federation challenged him in 1967. Lee cracked down: the authorities arrested 15 union leaders, deregistered the unions and announced that the striking workers had fired themselves. In effect, Lee broke the independent labor movement and won a long labor peace that was a component of Singapore's long boom.
Other leaders have reshaped nations -- Kemal Ataturk in Turkey, Lenin in Russia, Deng Xiaoping in China -- but no one left a deeper imprint on his people than Lee. He even changed the languages people spoke. Schools switched to teach mainly in English, and Lee badgered the majority Chinese population to give up their native languages (like Cantonese or Hokkien) even in their homes and to speak Mandarin instead.
Lee was involved not just in every government decision but fostered a "nanny state" that urged college graduates to have more children, banned bubblegum, punished people who did not flush toilets and, in earlier years, forcibly gave haircuts to young men with long hair. He created the least corrupt state in Asia, one whose public schools rank as perhaps the best in the world and whose pension system is regarded by many scholars as a model.
There was, however, another side to Lee that many in the West find harder to stomach. He is unapologetic, for example, about the repressive measures he took against Communist sympathizers, who initially had seemed a threat to the government. "Could we have defeated them if we had allowed them habeas corpus and abjured the powers of detention without trial?" Lee asks. "I doubt it." Lee justifies locking up Chia Thye Poh, a mild-mannered leftist, for 20 years: "He continued to deny his Communist links, playing on the human rights sentiments of the Western media. His detention, in spite of Western media pressure, served to discourage other Communist cadres from reactivating their cause under cover of exercising their democratic rights. They were formidable opponents. We had to be as resolute and unyielding in this contest of wills."
Really? To many of us who visited and admired Singapore, it was a puzzle how it could simultaneously be so modern economically and so medieval politically. Most of us felt that Lee Kuan Yew's reputation would be higher in the world today if he had tolerated more pesky criticism, received slightly smaller majorities in elections and not tried so ruthlessly to smash opponents with all the sledgehammers that the state possessed.
Lee's greatest achievement was nurturing an educated middle class with a stake in the system, a distinct identity as Singaporeans, and enough wisdom to distrust Communists or demagogues. In this memoir, he recounts how he did this -- creating incentives for private home ownership, for example -- but the upshot was that he fostered an electorate that always seemed to have much more common sense than he gave it credit for. Lee himself seemed to come around to this view over time. As he and Singapore mellowed and became steadily more tolerant, open and democratic, Lee increasingly realized that he could trust Singaporeans to make decisions on their own, and he is one of the few Confucian emperors ever to step down voluntarily.
Lee mentions, in passing, some of his battles with the Western press over his authoritarian policies. (The best known incident involved the caning of an American teenager found guilty of vandalism.) It would have been more interesting for an American audience if he had argued his case more aggressively and confronted the counterarguments more directly. One can disagree with him, but intolerance and authoritarianism have never had so articulate or stimulating a spokesman. These are rich memoirs, the legacy of an extraordinary man, and in many ways, this book is like Lee himself: smart, thoughtful, blunt and provocative.

 W. E. B. DU BOIS
 The Fight for Equality and
 the American Century, 1919-1963.
 By David Levering Lewis.
 Illustrated. 715 pp. New York:
 Henry Holt & Company. $35. 
 William Edward Burghardt Du Bois died on Aug. 27, 1963, at the age of 95 -- in time for the news to be announced at the March on Washington by Roy Wilkins, secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the organization Du Bois helped found in 1909. There was irony in his dying on the eve of this great gathering, the high-water mark of the civil rights struggle of the 1950's and 60's. America's pre-eminent black intellectual, who gave the muscle of ideas to the struggle against segregation in the earlier part of the 20th century, had died in remote political exile in Ghana. For, as David Levering Lewis wrote in the first volume of his Du Bois biography, which won the Pulitzer Prize and the Francis Parkman and Bancroft Prizes in 1994, W. E. B. Du Bois had long ago concluded that the promised land of racial equality "was a cruel, receding mirage for people of color. And so he had chosen to live out his last days in West Africa."
In this second volume of his distinguished biography, Lewis picks up Du Bois's life in 1919. The First World War had ended; black soldiers coming home expected recognition by their country. Du Bois had urged young African-Americans to fight in a patriotic editorial that appeared in The Crisis: A Record of the Darker Races, the official organ of the N.A.A.C.P. But he warned elsewhere that "Negroes will come back feeling like men and not disposed to accept the treatment to which they have been subjected" under segregation.
Nothing had changed on the home front, however. Racial strife had grown even deadlier. The previous year there had been 78 lynchings of African-Americans. A wave of bloody race riots crackled like a chain of firecrackers in Northern cities, mainly victimizing blacks who had fled Southern poverty to take war industry jobs.
As editor of The Crisis, Du Bois placed himself in the thick of the never-ending race war. By the time he was 51 his services to his people had already been monumental. In 1903, he published his classic work, "The Souls of Black Folk," a collection of eloquent, well-reasoned essays on race relations. Blending economics and sociology with vision and prophecy, he ranged over the injustices of caste that scarred the black experience in America. "The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line," he declared with breathtaking prescience. Plumbing the souls of black folk, he diagnosed a painful paradox branded on the collective psyche of his people: "One ever feels his two-ness -- an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body."
After the publication of "Souls" he went on to organize the Niagara Conference, a 1905 conclave of prominent African-Americans, which issued a declaration of rights and spun off a new organization dedicated to obtaining them, the precursor of the N.A.A.C.P. The Niagara Movement represented a challenge to the dominance of Booker T. Washington, the Tuskegee Institute sage, who disseminated a philosophy of economic advancement linked to second-class citizenship. As editor of The Crisis, Du Bois was the voice of the N.A.A.C.P., emitting a stream of articles, editorials, jeremiads, short stories and satires. He made the magazine a vital clearinghouse of the latest economic and sociological data on the race, as well as a fount of investigative reports of crimes against blacks to which local authorities were indifferent.
Du Bois's life was an extraordinarily active one -- mentally, socially, politically and sexually. Du Bois had a hectic career as (in the author's words) a "priapic adulterer," and Lewis gives it full disclosure even if the material "inescapably smacks of the report of a private eye." (It does not.) Most of the trim, dapper and vigorous leader's numerous romantic conquests were women of talent and intellect whom he mentored and pleasured, while his wife, Nina, faded into neurasthenia and nonentity, and his daughter, Yolande, lived a life that seems to have been one long cry for the attention of an absent father.
Rather than a political leader (much less a demagogue like his foe, the black nationalist Marcus Garvey), Du Bois was a scholar activist, a brilliant general of words who marshaled battalions of ideas and facts with his prolific pen. The "scribe of his race," Lewis calls him, with a characteristic aptness of phrase. He wrote not for money or scholarly or literary glory but for the advancement of black people. All art was propaganda, he believed. (After promoting the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's, he decided it had sunk into decadence and repudiated its leading writers.)
Given his own bootstraps rise to intellectual eminence, it was only natural that he would conceive the idea of an educated elite -- the Talented Tenth he called it -- whose mission it was to lift up less fortunate blacks. During the 1920's Du Bois devoted much of his zeal to gaining equal treatment for this best and brightest group. He moved in the elite circles, the world of foundations and wealthy white liberals, the black bourgeoisie and the educational establishment in the historic black colleges. And so, among other battles, he crusaded to liberate the black colleges from their traditionally white presidents.
Yet he was beginning to see that opening doors for the Talented Tenth, necessary as it was, did little for working class and poor blacks. Midway through the decade, Du Bois visited the Soviet Union. "If race was the problem of the 20th century," Lewis writes, "after this first encounter with the Soviet Union he also began to regard class as a dilemma of comparable magnitude." Du Bois gave himself a cram course in Marxism and proclaimed himself a Bolshevik, but his conversion had many personal codicils attached.
For one, having observed the racism of white workers in the Deep South, Du Bois believed that, as Lewis puts it, "the exploitation of black workers by white workers was preordained, inscribed, as it were, on the DNA of the white American proletariat." And so, even as a socialist, he believed that "race trumped class in North America." By the 1930's, Du Bois had given up hope that either major party would help black people (although he became a supporter of the New Deal and considered Franklin Delano Roosevelt a president who was trying to elevate the poor). He also clashed with Walter White, secretary of the N.A.A.C.P., in a conflict of temperaments and philosophies. Du Bois had swung far to the left of the N.A.A.C.P.; he believed that The Crisis spoke "as the N.A.A.C.P., not for it." He was, Lewis writes, a "visionary," while White was merely a "C.E.O. with a policy," determined to rein in The Crisis and erect a bureaucratic foundation that could carry on lobbying campaigns in Congress and legal ones in the courts challenging segregation.
Du Bois's disaffection and growing conviction that only radical economic remedies would cure the congenital poverty of the black masses led him to write, in the January 1934 issue of The Crisis, an essay titled "Segregation," which heretically argued that the best hope of African-Americans was not integration but voluntary segregation -- forming their own cooperative commonwealth, a self-sufficient socialist economy until that time when the curse of racism was lifted and they could enter the American system as autonomous partners.
The essay was anathema to the integrationist N.A.A.C.P. and he was ejected. He returned to Atlanta University as professor of sociology and devoted himself to the firebrand scholarship that produced his 1935 historical masterpiece, "Black Reconstruction in America." In one of his brilliantly compressed essays, Lewis summarizes the state of American historiography at that time, dominated by the Southern version of Reconstruction, which taught that decent whites were oppressed by blacks and white scalawags in the state legislatures and their Northern friends in Congress. He sums up: "The American narrative had become a monstrous binary distortion, an exercise in cultural sadism that would defy remedy so long as the part played by black people in history continued to be written as separate, unequal and irrelevant."
Du Bois's exercise in black history boldly restored blacks to the story of Reconstruction; "Black Reconstruction" generated a paradigm shift in academia, blasting the entrenched view and clearing the way for a more accurate history that brought people of color into the narrative. Although criticized for its navely premature application of Marxist theory to the preindustrial South, Du Bois's book swept away cobwebs of myth. It is also a lyric chant of liberation, as in this purplish but impassioned passage about the joy of the emancipated slaves: "All that was Beauty, all that was Love, all that was Truth, stood on the top of these mad mornings and sang with the stars. A great human sob shrieked in the wind, and tossed its tears upon the sea -- free, free, free."
With "The Souls of Black Folk," "Reconstruction," his editorship of The Crisis, his educational reforms at Atlanta, Du Bois's achievements were indelibly engraved in the annals of his race. But as he became more radical, his stature was chipped away by pygmies -- first the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations, which refused to finance his proposed Encyclopedia of the Negro, not because of its lack of merit but because its boards considered Du Bois not "objective" and too controversial.
After the outbreak of the cold war and the rise of the national security state, he stalked off into strident opposition, backing Henry Wallace's ill-fated third-party candidacy against President Harry Truman. The N.A.A.C.P., which had given him a sinecure after he was pushed out of Atlanta University at the age of 75, was pro-Truman and beset by wildly inaccurate charges that it harbored Communists. The upshot was that it turned its back once again on Du Bois. Then a peace group of which he was chairman was ordered by the Justice Department to register as the agent of a foreign government. This order was thrown out of court for lack of evidence, but not before W. E. B. Du Bois had been fingerprinted, handcuffed and released on bail. He commented that although he could stand a good deal, at the age of 82 "this experience was rather more than I felt like bearing."
He was taken up and feted by the Soviet Union and Communist China, and invited by President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana to edit an Encyclopedia Africana. So he lived out his days in West Africa politely averting his eyes to the rampant corruption of his hosts because he wanted this black socialist state to succeed. W. E. B. Du Bois had considered himself an exile all his life in America, driven by the tension between being a black and being an American; without this conflict, he said, he probably would have been "an unquestioning worshiper at the shrine of the established social order into which I was born." As it turned out, the intensity of his inner struggle galvanized his genius and threw off sparks of insight and prophecy.
But character flaws of intellectual arrogance and vanity, mingled with despair over the persistence of racism, sometimes made him form dubious alliances -- not only with the Soviets and Chinese but before World War II with the Japanese, on the theory that their imperialism was more humane than the European variety.
All that in no way invalidates a life splendidly devoted to fighting the lie of racism. His books and ideas still speak to us over the years. He foresaw many of the issues of our day -- equal access to education, black nationalism, black power, black is beautiful, black history. If he were still around he would be thundering about five million black men caught in the justice system and educational deprivation in crumbling schools.
Lewis has given us Du Bois's life in all its multiple facets and ideological complexities. The historical background he sketches in provides informative context; his prose is vigorous, colorful. One must add that, in leading us down so many byways of Du Bois's career, his narrative occasionally sags under the weight of facts and events, or doubles back to cover parallel developments. Nevertheless, as biography and as history, Lewis's second volume clears the high bar he set with his first one.

HEADLINE: The Two-Bucks-a-Minute Democracy

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for the magazine. He is the author, most recently, of "The New New Thing."

 BODY:
Earlier this year, a truly weird and possibly inspired company founded by a pair of Stanford political scientists, Norman Nie and Doug Rivers, finished spending tens of millions of dollars to install Web television sets in 40,000 American homes. The company, called Knowledge Networks, was trying to address the single greatest problem in polling -- getting a random sample of Americans to answer questions -- by paying a random sample of Americans for their time. In the summer of 1999, Rivers sent out 40,000 letters, most of them containing $10 bills. The money was the teaser for the big offer: spend 10 minutes each week answering his questions over the Internet, and Rivers would give you a free Web TV, free Internet access and a raft of prizes doled out in various contests and raffles. If you were uneasy with new gadgets, Rivers promised to give you not only the TV and the Internet access but also to send an engineer to install the stuff. An astonishing 56 percent of the people they set out to contact took the offer -- compared with the roughly 15 percent now willing to answer questions from a stranger over the telephone.
One of those people was Marion Frost. When she received the letter from Rivers, she had just turned 80, which meant she was gold to any pollster looking to build a random sample of Americans. Along with Americans who earn more than $150,000 a year, Americans who have less than an eighth-grade education and Americans who don't speak English, Americans over 75 tend to elude pollsters. Frost has lived in the same quaint cottage for 46 years, nestled in a middle-class Silicon Valley neighborhood doing its best to avoid being overrun by property developers. The only hint of frailty about her was the cast on her left wrist, which she had broken, absurdly, on her way back from the D.M.V., where she had gone to obtain a handicapped parking sticker. The only sign that she found it odd for a complete stranger to show up at her house to watch her watch television was that she had invited a friend over to join us. The three of us -- me, Frost and her friend, Yvette Reyes -- settled down to a spread of pizza, cookies and coffee in a living room that doubled as a shrine to bygone values. The furniture would be familiar to anyone who had grandparents in the 1960's; the television was one of those giant oak cabinets with chrome dials that they stopped making back in the 1970's. "My husband died 18 years ago," Frost said, "and we bought the TV at least 15 years before that." The single anomaly in the place was the black Web TV box on top of the television cabinet. With its infrared ports, flashing lights and miniature keyboard, the thing was as incongruous as a Martian. 
 It was the night of the second Bush-Gore debate, and CBS was using Knowledge Networks -- and by extension Marion Frost -- to conduct two kinds of polls. One, which Dan Rather was calling "a snap poll," would measure who won the debate. The other, which Dan Rather would never mention, since CBS was still testing it, would seek to understand why he won. Twenty minutes before the debate, the red light on top of Frost's black box began to flash, its way of saying that it was waiting for her to switch on her TV and answer a few questions from Knowledge Networks.
Among the many things I was curious to know was why Rivers had been so successful at luring Americans into being the rats in his massive laboratory experiment. I assumed that in all cases he had appealed to the rats' insatiable lust for money and freebies. I was wrong.
"How did these people talk you into taking their surveys?" I asked Frost.
"They just called me out of the blue," she said. She sat toward the edge of her chair, her arm in a dark blue sling. All around her were photographs of children. She had reared three of her own, adopted another and taken in seven foster children.
"But you got their letter with the $10 in it?"
"They never sent me a letter with $10 in it," she said. "I got a letter from Doug Rivers but no $10." Yvette chuckled softly on the sofa beside me. "You come cheap, Marion," she said.
I motioned to her $249 Web TV. The box enabled Knowledge Networks to send polls and surveys to her over the Internet, which then could be displayed on her TV screen. Once each week, the red light flashed to tell Frost that questions awaited her answers whenever she had 10 minutes to spare. Tonight's poll was an exception in that it required Frost's presence at an appointed time. "So," I said, "what do you use that for?"
A hint of discomfort flashed across her impossibly sweet face. "The truth is, I haven't figured out how to use it."
"Then how do you take the surveys?"
"Oh," she said, "I do all the surveys. When the light comes on, I call Robert, and he comes over and turns it on and feeds in the information." Robert is Frost's 45-year-old son.
"When I get the cast off, I think I'll learn how to use it," Frost added, trying and failing to raise her broken arm.
"But you still answer the surveys?" I said.
"Oh, yes," she said, brightening. "Mostly all the questions are about products. Juice. One I remember was the different kinds of juice. They wanted to know what was my opinion of cranberry juice. Would I mix it in with other juices. I don't know. I figure they want to dilute the cranberry juice with other juices. I told them my opinion."
No $10 bill, no interest in the Web TV or the free Internet access or the raffles and contests. No sense whatsoever that she was being paid to answer questions.
"I don't understand," I said. "Why did you agree to be in this survey?"
She was at a loss for an answer, which was O.K., since Yvette wasn't. "Because," she said, with a tone that put an end to further questions, "she's a good person."
On that note, we settled back and waited for Knowledge Networks to begin measuring Marion Frost's opinions.
Ever since the Internet went boom, people have been trying to figure out how to use it to open a window on the American mind. One curious subplot of this year's presidential campaign has been huge, inexplicable swings in the polls. There are a number of possible reasons for these -- inept pollsters, fickle voters -- but the most persuasive is the growing reluctance of Americans to take calls from pollsters. In the past decade, the response rate to telephone polls has fallen from as high as 40 percent to 15 percent. If the 15 percent of our population still willing to be polite to people who interrupt their dinners were representative, this trend would not be a problem for pollsters. But they aren't, so it is.
Onto this scene, the Internet seems to have arrived just in time. It gives new hope to people who believe that human behavior can be studied and explained scientifically. Internet polling enjoys several obvious advantages over old-fashioned survey techniques: it's potentially more scientific than chasing down people in shopping malls, it's less blatantly intrusive than phoning people at dinner and it carries video to those polled so that ads, movie trailers and product designs can be tested directly. But maybe as important as all these combined is the ease with which an Internet pollster can create a new kind of dialogue with the people he polls. In what Doug Rivers calls "a virtual conversation," the pollster with easy, steady access to a cross-section of the population can unspool a detailed story about the population's tastes and habits.
But the Internet has one huge disadvantage for pollsters: not quite half the U. S. population uses it. In the summer of 1998, Rivers and his Stanford colleague, Nie, both of whom had made distinguished careers studying polling techniques, discovered that they shared an outrage at the sham polls of the "general population" conducted on the Internet. They got to talking about ways that the Internet might be used to poll properly, short of waiting the years it would take for the technology to trickle down. They decided to go out and identify a random sample of Americans and persuade them to go online, for free.
Of course, it costs a fortune to dole out tens of thousands of Web TV's. So Rivers, who wound up running the business, was forced to neglect his original interest in political polling and acquire an interest in market research. Corporate America spends $5 billion a year for market surveys. Companies pay roughly $2 for every minute that randomly selected Americans spend answering questions of people who pester them at dinner time. The reason you are worth $120 an hour while you scratch yourself and talk on the phone to a pollster is that pretty much anyone with anything to mass-market -- packaged goods, media come-ons, financial products -- longs for detailed portraits of the consumer. A network of tens of thousands of Web TV's randomly distributed across the population would represent not just a statistical improvement. It would create a new genre of portraiture.
Typically, the relationship between the American Observer and the American Observed has been a one-night stand. A pollster calls and insists on pawing you a bit, and then you never hear from him again. Knowledge Networks was after something more. Its Web TV's would follow the same people, easily and cheaply, and measure not just their responses to surveys but also their behavior on the Internet. And it would be able to divine patterns in that behavior that companies could then exploit. As Knowledge Networks expanded, it would become possible to poll random samples of tiny populations -- people who drank expensive tequila, say, or voted for Pat Buchanan. "Try finding a random sample of Jews by phone," Rivers says. "Jews are 2 percent of the population. Do you know how many randomly generated phone numbers you need to call to find 400 Jews?"
Interestingly, all parties to this new and seemingly intrusive relationship shared a financial interest in it becoming ever more intrusive. There might be people like Marion Frost who don't think of their time as money, but they are a rare breed. By enriching the information he mined from the brains of his random sample, Rivers raised the value of those who spent time answering his questions. The more their time was worth, the more goodies they got, and the more goodies they got, the more willing they would be to answer questions.
It took Rivers just three days to raise the first $6 million he needed from Silicon Valley venture capitalists. The only question they had was why Rivers was sending $10 to people before they agreed to his deal. "The V.C.'s said things like, 'If you sent that to me, I'd just keep the money and not do the surveys,"' Rivers says. "I had to tell them that most people weren't like venture capitalists." Once Rivers had proved to his backers that his system worked in a few hundred homes, he went back and asked for another $36 million so he could install many, many more Web TV's. The V.C.'s promptly handed that over too.
By the spring of this year, 100,000 Americans were spending 10 minutes each week answering Rivers's questions, often e-mailing him with extra ideas and comments and news about their lives. ("Mr. Rivers," wrote one, "Terrence cannot answer the questions this week because he is in jail.") By the end of the summer, the system was running at full capacity. So Rivers has gone back once again to the venture capitalists for as much as $60 million more to install another 60,000 black boxes. By the end of next year, 250,000 Americans will be engaged in Knowledge Networks' virtual conversation -- the fastest, biggest and quite possibly most accurate tracking poll ever conducted. Each person will remain in the sample for three years, at which point they are considered too overexposed to polls to be accurately polled.
Even by Silicon Valley standards, this is a fairly sensational financial story. Among other things, it tells you a great deal about what might be called the public opinion of public opinion. Between 1876, when the last new polling technology, the telephone, was invented, and the 1960's, when the phone was sufficiently widespread to allow for random sampling, it occurred to no one to go out and install 100,000 telephones in American homes. The telephone didn't become a polling device until it had spread on its own into every nook and cranny of American life. But the world is no longer willing to wait for a more accurate self-portrait. Offered even the slightest chance to, as Rivers puts it, "get inside people's minds and find out what's there," investors have proved willing to pay whatever it cost.
The ever-evolving relationship between American consumers and producers inevitably spills over into American politics, which is why a Stanford political scientist has wound up, at least for the moment, testing cranberry juice cocktails for a living. A better view of the public opinion of juice soon becomes a better view of the public opinion of issues and ads and phrases and candidates. Once investors had poured in tens of millions of dollars to create an elaborate mechanism designed to obtain a "360-degree picture of the mind of the American consumer," Rivers knew it wouldn't be long before some enterprising political consultant used it to enter the mind of the American voter. "But the thing we've found," he says, "is that the political people are slower on the uptake than the businesspeople. In part, it's because they don't have the same money to spend. But it's also that the sort of people who become pollsters to presidential campaigns don't like to hear the answers to honest polls. They're believers in a cause."
He is able to say this with detached amusement rather than despair because he assumes that the political people will come around -- and how could they not? Politics is a competitive market. Better polls give politicians who follow them an edge. Those who don't will wind up being put out of business by those who do.
People who bother to imagine how the Internet might change democracy usually assume it will take power away from politicians and give it to the people. It's easy to see how the Internet might lead inexorably to the same extreme form of democracy that has evolved in California, where the big issues often are put directly to the people for a vote. Sooner or later, it will be possible to vote online. And sooner or later, it will be possible to collect signatures online. Together, these changes might well lead to a boomlet in direct democracy, at least in states like California where citizens can call votes on an issue simply by gathering enough signatures on its behalf. At which point someone asks, Why can't we do the same thing in Washington? One constitutional amendment later and -- poof -- we're all voting directly to decide important national questions rather than voting for politicians and leaving the decisions up to them.
This line of futurology has history on its side. Every step taken by American democracy has been in an egalitarian direction. The direct elections of U.S. senators, the extension of the vote to blacks, women and adolescents, the adoption of initiative and referendum in the vast majority of states, the rise of public opinion polling -- all of this pushes democracy in the same direction. It forces politicians to be more informed of, and responsive to, majority opinion. It nudges American democracy ever so slightly away from its original elitist conception and moves it toward something else.
The Knowledge Networks poll offers a glimpse of what that something else might be, a world in which politicians become so well informed about public opinion that there is no need for direct democracy.
It was with something like this in mind that George Gallup began his campaign in the 1930's to make political polling scientifically respectable. Gallup thought that democracy worked better the better-informed politicians were of majority opinion. Rivers does not exactly share this view. He created Knowledge Networks because he believed that inaccurate polls are a danger to democracy and an insult to good social science -- but that is a long way from Gallup's original utopian vision. Rivers says he believes that Internet polling is inevitable, so that it might as well be done honestly. But he also believes that his faster and cheaper opinion-gathering machine will provide politicians with a more detailed snapshot of public opinion, and thus give rise to an even more constipated politics. The more perfectly informed politicians are about public opinion, the more they are chained to it. "The problem right now isn't that politicians in Washington are out of touch," Rivers says. "The problem is that they're too closely in touch. And this will make the problem worse." In short, you may believe that politicians could not be more automated than they are now. Just wait.
But it isn't just the politicians who are changed by the technology. The more perfectly watched that voters are, the less they have to pay attention to politics. After all, there's no point in anyone but a revolutionary participating in a system of majority rule when the will of the majority is always, and automatically, known.
Of course, it takes a while for an entire culture to get used to the idea that there is no point in participating in democracy unless you are paid to do so. It takes even longer for it to figure out that its participation is worth two bucks a minute. For old ideas to die, the people who hold them must die first. And Marion Frost wasn't quite ready for that. Fifteen minutes before the second presidential debate began, her doorbell rang. It was a young man from Knowledge Networks, who had driven an hour to switch on her Web TV. (Frost's son was traveling, and I couldn't figure it out.) The screen, previously given over to Dan Rather's face, went blue. Onto it came a message: "Please try to have fun while being as serious about this test as possible."
It went on to ask several long, pro-forma questions, which Frost insisted on reading aloud before turning her attention to the alien keyboard. Yvette sighed. "This is going to be a long night, Marion." This was my cue to take her son's place at the keyboard. When we had finished with their questions, the picture came back on the screen, with a long measuring rod at the bottom of it. The rod had a plus sign on one end and a minus sign on the other. Frost was meant to signal what she thought of whatever Bush and Gore said, as they said it, by moving a tiny rectangle back and forth between the two. Instead, she told me what she thought, and I moved the rectangle for her. Her stream of opinions would flow into a river through Knowledge Networks' computers and into CBS studios in New York.
The debate started. I waited for Marion Frost's first command. "I like that Jim Lehrer," she said.
Lehrer had asked Bush a question about foreign policy, and Bush talked for as long as he could on the subject, then did his best to think up some more words to fill the time. Frost said nothing. The little rectangle didn't budge.
"I don't know about Bush," she finally said, "but I'm glad Jim Lehrer's going to be there." Al Gore then went off on his usual relentless quest for a gold star, and Frost listened to all of what he said intently, but again failed to respond. She seemed to want to think about what he said, but the new technology didn't want thought. It wanted quick.
"I don't know," she finally said, as Bush took over. "I'm confused. I think they're both right on some areas." She was growing ever so slightly distressed at her inability to give the black box what it wanted. Finally, Bush said something that caused Frost to say: "I like that. Go ahead and make it positive." But it was as much out of a concern for the little rectangle than actual deep feeling. In any case, her reflex was too slow to hit its mark; by the time I'd moved the rectangle, Gore had again butted in. This didn't seem to bother Frost. She was too busy trying to make sense out of the arguments Bush had made about the I.M.F. "That's the International Monetary Fund," she said -- for my benefit, I think.
Yvette sighed and headed for the kitchen. "I get to take a break," she said. "You two can't move."
Frost looked at me with concern and asked, "Would you like a cookie?" The debate heated up again. Gore began to attack Bush's record on health care. Frost became irritated. "I believe he has a good heart,' what kind of statement is that?" she said. Hearts were something she knew about. The implications for the rectangle were unclear.
"Should I make it negative?"
"A little," she said.
On this went for an hour and a half, much like the debate itself, defying any possibility of the reflection or deliberation that Frost was intent on supplying. The joy of watching her with her Web TV was her insistence on layering old and dying habits of mind onto the new, supercharged process. Her opinions were being monitored as closely as political opinions have ever been monitored, and yet she didn't really allow the monitoring to interfere with her idea of how to watch a political debate. She avoided making snap judgments just as she had somehow avoided getting paid for offering them. She watched without much interest Dan Rather announce that Bush had won the snap poll -- 52 percent to 48 percent. She just did what she did because she entertained some notion of her social obligations above and beyond her economic interests. Either that, or she simply could not believe that a citizen is meant to be paid for her services.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Traveling to Cuba Is as Tricky as Ever

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
AMERICANS who hoped that visiting Cuba as tourists might become less complicated saw those hopes evaporate last weekend when President Clinton signed a bill that, among other things, codifies the existing restrictions on United States tourists. The bill also prevents the president or his successors from changing the prohibitions without the approval of Congress.
But for all the Congressional huffing and puffing over passage of the bill, tour operators say things are not likely to change much, if at all. Naturalized American citizens born in Cuba will still be allowed to travel there, as apparently will Americans who go as part of humanitarian, educational or athletic groups. Just about the only people likely to be affected by the legislation are Americans not born in Cuba who want to travel there on their own rather than in groups. And Americans who might otherwise have gone to Cuba illegally may decide not to, rather than test the United States government's resolve to enforce the newly codified law. 
 The main target of the law is not tourism but agriculture. And although aimed primarily at Cuba, it also affects Iran, Libya, North Korea and Sudan. While it allows all five countries to buy American food and medicine, only Cuba will be barred from paying for them with United States government credits or loans from private United States banks.
That prohibition and the codification of the travel restrictions were added at the urging of Cuban-American members of Congress from Florida. And with that state widely regarded as pivotal in the presidential election, few members of Congress from either party wanted to risk alienating the sizeable Cuban-American voting bloc by opposing the restrictions.
Still, that may not be the end of the matter. Officials of both parties have vowed to try to remove the travel ban in the next session of Congress. And a recent poll of 1,975 Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade County, conducted by researchers at Florida International University in Miami, found that while 62.4 percent of respondents still favored retaining the economic embargo, 52.8 percent wanted unrestricted travel to Cuba.
Moreover, American hotel companies, airlines and the many cruise lines registered abroad but headquartered in the United States are eager to compete with the Canadian and European companies that already operate or own hotels and nightclubs in Cuba. Also, tour operators think that Cuba will be a big attraction for American tourists.
"New ports are always exciting to people who like to cruise," said Tom Hicks, owner of Kruger Travel, a tour operator in Little rock, Ark. "I have a feeling many of our customers would like to take a cruise to Cuba. I'd like to see it myself."
Tammy Selee, marketing director of Harmon Tours in Boise, Idaho, also thinks that lifting restrictions would create an initial flurry of interest. "But they may find that it'll look more like a third world nation than that romantic isle we're used to seeing in old movies."
Other tour operators have similar reservations. Barbara Osman, president of 4 Seasons Tours and Travel in Wilmington, Del., said, "Before I'd send a group there I'd have to go myself to sample the food and see if the accommodations and infrastructure would live up to their expectations."
Despite the formalizing of the ban, few travel officials expect the number of American visitors to Cuba to decline. In fact, the law calls for creation of a new travel category that will allow Americans to visit to sell food and other agricultural products.
Cuba's Tourism Ministry said some 165,000 Americans visited the island last year. That included about 100,000 naturalized Americans born in Cuba and still considered Cuban citizens by the Castro government. Many of the others also traveled there legally, usually as part of humanitarian, religious, athletic, educational or cultural delegations. Those who entered illegally from Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas were able to circumvent United States law with the help of Cuban immigration authorities, who did not stamp their passports lest they be penalized upon their return.
"I know several people in Idaho who flew to Cancun and then to Cuba," said Ms. Selee of Harmon Tours in Boise.
Cuba Cruise Corporation said its 550-passenger Funchal will begin twice-weekly cruises between Nassau and Havana on Nov. 18; on Dec. 24 it will be joined by the 350-passenger Arion. (Both will be renamed La Habana for these cruises.)
Sam Blyth, president of Cuba Cruise, said Americans are eligible to go on either ship because both will feature educational programs and because while in Cuba the Americans will be guests of the Centre for Education and Training, a nonprofit Canadian organization specializing in high school courses. Under such an arrangement, he said, they do not risk running afoul of the Treasury Department, which does not actually prohibit Americans from visiting the island but prevents them from spending any money if they go.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 11-05-00: Salient Facts: Antismoking Campaigns;
Blowing Smoke

BYLINE: By Hope Reeves

 BODY:

BUTTING OUT
Under the auspices of the World Health Organization, representatives of 150 countries got together in Geneva last month for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Aiming toward an international antismoking treaty by 2003, the conference represents an unprecedented effort to limit the use of a drug that kills four million people a year. But it's going to be an uphill battle.
 
LOOK WHO'S SMOKING
All around the world, cigarettes remain extremely popular. Globally, according to the W.H.O., 47 percent of men and 12 percent of women are smokers, a gender disparity that is a result of social taboos and financial inequality. The leader, by far, is China, with 300 to 340 million smokers. And not only do a lot of Chinese smoke; they smoke a lot too -- an average of 1,791 cigarettes a year. In the United States, 27.6 percent of men and 22.1 percent of women smoke, consuming an average of 2,146 cigarettes a year. In Haiti, down near the bottom of the list, only 10.7 percent of men and 8.6 percent of women smoke, and on average each Haitian consumes a scant 172 cigarettes a year. 

THE CRUSADE IN THE AMERICAS
As sneering Europeans -- and anyone who has ever had to stand in freezing rain just to suck down some nicotine -- know, America has some of the strictest antismoking laws in the world. Including a new generation of ads that portray smokers as hapless dupes of industry propaganda, the effort seems to be working: since the mid-1960's, the habit has been waning. But most other countries aren't exactly racing to catch up. The number of countries that set strict limits on tobacco advertising, for example, has fallen to 18, down from 27 a decade ago. "In some places halfhearted attempts are being made," says Mohammad Akhter, executive director of the American Public Health Association, "but most markets are absolutely open to tobacco."
 
THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE
Antismoking efforts on the Continent range from extreme to extremely lax. The Scandinavian countries have banned tobacco advertisements and heaped so many taxes on the product that in Norway a pack of cigarettes costs $7.28. In England, nonsmoking offices are becoming commonplace. Spain offers vague warnings like "Smoking can harm health." But in most former Eastern bloc countries, where smoking was one of the few indulgences readily available under Communist rule, there are almost no obstacles to lighting up anywhere.
 
SMOKE RISING IN THE EAST
Singapore was one of the first countries to pass laws restricting public smoking, and they remain some of the world's toughest. Thailand bans all cigarette ads and requires that at least one-third of packaging space be given over to such desperate entreaties as "For your beloved children and grandchildren, please give up smoking." But in Japan, where the tobacco industry is largely state-run, the vast numbers of smokers face no sterner warning than this pleasant request: "Be careful not to smoke too much as it might injure your health." And in Indonesia, tobacco companies have sponsored mosques, churches, schools, health and family planning clinics, bridges, medical seminars and cultural events.
 
AFRICA'S SMOKING SAFARI
In Africa, the tobacco industry is almost completely unregulated. For instance, in Zimbabwe, which is a major tobacco grower and exporter (local brands sell for 33 cents a pack), the sale of tobacco to children is not allowed -- without parental consent, that is. But in general smoking is less popular in Africa than in Asia, and those who do smoke consume far fewer cigarettes per year (just 90 in Ethiopia). South Africa, another of the world's leading manufacturers, has just raised excise taxes on cigarettes and banned smoking in public places, but at present, 42 percent of men smoke.
 
AMERICA'S EXPORT ECONOMY
In America, tobacco companies have long since given up claiming that their product promotes health. But around the world, that practice still wheezes on -- especially in developing nations, where 70 percent of cigarette-related deaths are expected to occur. A 1996 survey by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine asked respondents to categorize smoking's effect on health; 61 percent said it caused little harm. In some third-world nations, recent ads aimed at women offer smoking as a tool for equality. In Brazil, a new series of ads by Philip Morris ostensibly designed to warn smokers about health hazards uses the words "Isso e legal," which means "This is the law," but also "This is cool." And Joe Camel, the cartoon pitchman who was pulled from U.S. ads back in 1997, is still alive and well beyond our nation's borders. Camel sales increased by 50 percent after Joe was introduced in Argentina in 1996; in Romania, Joe Camel's winning smile is now emblazoned on everything from stoplights to trolley cars.

HEADLINE: Outnumbered 11 to 1, The Dollar Ends Up on Top;
Frankfurt: Don't take any wooden euros; the real ones are cheap enough

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; EDMUND L. ANDREWS is chief of the Frankfurt bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Frankfurt is home to the European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for all 11 countries that have adopted the euro. And in a fit of euro boosterism, the city and its biggest companies have erected dozens of gigantic wooden coins along the streets and plazas, each of them painted with different artistic visions of the euro's significance.
Visitors can find euros covered in flowers, stars and even images of gourmet chocolates. But they will not find an image of the euro's most obvious impact: Americans snapping up European bargains made possible by the euro's extraordinary drop in value against the dollar. 
 Frankfurt, Germany's financial center, has always been more of a business destination than a a tourist magnet. But its giant airport and its central location make it a major hub for people traveling into and across Europe. And those who do pass through may be struck by how reasonable prices have become.
Since the euro made its debut nearly two years ago, the dollar has climbed over 30 percent against the German mark. One of the most striking bargains here these days is wine. A perfectly acceptable German riesling from the Rhine or Mosel Valleys costs less than $3 a bottle when bought by the case. Excellent reds from France, Spain and Italy also look cheap by American standards.
At Jacques' Wein Depot, a fast-growing chain of stores where customers are able to sample dozens of wines before they buy, a particularly trendy Bordeaux like the 1997 Chateau de Rochemorin costs about $12.55, at 2.20 marks to the dollar. The real bargains are from less celebrated regions, like the Roussillon villages in the south of France. Some of the best wines from such areas can be bought in Frankfurt for about $5.48 a bottle. Jacques' has 13 stores in Frankfurt and about 130 throughout Germany.
Another good deal in Frankfurt is opera and ballet. The Frankfurt Opera stages world-class productions, and the best seats in the house for Verdi's "Traviata" cost about $62; at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, top seats are $150 to $180. A show at Frankfurt's highly renowned avant-garde Theater am Turm (Das TAT) costs a mere $6.40; performances are in the Bockenheimer Depot, a converted station. For tickets to the opera or Theater am Turm, call (49-69) 13 40 400 and press 1 at the end of the recorded message; fax (49-69) 13 40 444.
Frankfurt's most convenient restaurant area is the Fressgasse, a pedestrian street just a few blocks from the stock exchange and the big banks. At Lauda, a highly popular Italian restaurant, at 50 Grosse Bockenheimer Strasse, (49-69) 21 99 6363, fax (49-69) 99 63 62, a dinner for two with a good bottle of house wine will cost about $77. A sumptuous five-course "surprise menu," which changes daily, costs about $43 a person, plus wine.
Most of the city's big hotels cater to executives. The 378-room Arabella Sheraton Grand, Konrad-Adenauer-Strasse 7, (49-69) 29 810, fax (49 69) 29 81 810, www.sheraton .com, one of the best of its class, offers the full complement of restaurants, lounges, fitness center and conference rooms. Standard doubles are about $237 weeknights; the weekend rate is $137.
For travelers who have a bit of daring, the Nizza Hotel, Elbestrasse 10, (49-69) 2425 38, fax (49-69) 2425 3830, is intriguing. This small hotel in a slightly scruffy area near the train station has long catered to the actors, dancers and opera singers who come here to perform. The rooms are spacious and clean, and hotel guests can take drinks up to a rooftop garden that looks out over much of the city. Some of the rooms share a bathroom, but this is partly offset by the fact that the shared bathrooms are huge and decorated with wall-size murals. The price is sweet, too: as little as $87 for a double.

HEADLINE: What's This About Cultural Pollution?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
WHILE Hollywood executives were professing before a Senate committee not long ago to be shocked, shocked, that somehow R-rated slasher movies like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" were being test-marketed to 9-year-olds, the news arrived from London that Tracy Emin, the popular British artist, had unveiled "I've Got It All."
Ms. Emin has made herself internationally known in art circles in recent years in shows like "Sensation" and, most famously, with pithy confessional installations entailing soiled underpants, cigarette butts, empty vodka bottles and used condoms. Her latest work, at London's Saatchi Gallery, includes a big photograph of herself splay-legged, giving birth to a wad of cash -- the currencies, you might note, hailing from the countries where she has had exhibitions. 
 We'll take a pass on that particular bait to note that among the so-called Young British Artists, Ms. Emin is said to be a favorite with teenagers. This is a new art demographic and the same one, more or less, coveted by films like "I Know What You Did Last Summer," wherein a serial-killing maniac wields a gigantic ice hook.
Vice President Al Gore has used the phrase "cultural pollution" in the presidential debates, and on the eve of the presidential election on Tuesday the culture question raised during the campaign hangs in the air: Is civilization really going down the tube?
No. And let's stop repeating this nonsense before we actually come to believe it. Popular culture is getting more and more juvenile, and the serious arts, or what used to be the serious arts, often emulate popular culture, depressingly. But we can be disappointed in our arts without being made coarser as a society. There's a difference. Why as a nation do we periodically presume that society is coarsened by culture? That's the real question. Why does history keep repeating itself like this?
The 1990's were a decade of change, not a particularly great decade for the arts but a period of change. We ought to look clearly at what is new and what is not. Here is a modest, partial attempt.
The change has been partly technological: the Internet, cable television and VCR's changing the way we see, making culture's intake more private, our encounter with offensive art seemingly more invasive and our reaction more alienated. Meanwhile, we have become more prosperous. And movies, like much of the rest of commercial culture and too much high art, are exploring new depths of silliness and crudity, the junk piling higher than ever because we have more money than ever to spend on making and consuming it.
But at the moment we live in blissful, some might even say sanitized, contradiction to the perception that culture has coarsened American life. Affluence multiplies everything now. There are more Jane Austen movies. More art museums. More people going to them.
There may actually be less sex in movies than there has been in 20 years, and it could be argued that the violence, while more graphic, is less real, more comic-bookish. Hit movies have become, if anything, less forthright and more squeamish when it comes to genuine political or social conflict.
We also may expect more of culture than we used to, or at least we want more from it than it can provide. Peace and prosperity, long desired, turn out to be dandy only up to a point. Culture, a vague catchall, makes a ready target for what else we think is missing in life. It is a convenient punching bag for what rising stock prices and crime-free streets do not in the end provide. In the luxury of our booming economy, we have plenty of extra leisure time in which to complain about what culture is failing to do.
The demise of popular culture is anecdotally linked to the deluge of mayhem flicks, gay-bashing jokes in blockbusters like "Scary Movie," onscreen flatulence gags and gross-out humor in bombs like "Ready to Rumble," mass-murder video games like "Doom," bondage dot-com sites, "Survivor" and trash-talking television cartoons like "South Park." These pop phenomena have combined with what used to be the boutique category of fine art to include big, noirish paintings of female corpses and dung-adorned collages of the Virgin Mary.
The only surprise of the Senate hearings in September wasn't that Columbia Tristar tried to sell an advertisement on Nickelodeon, the children's network, for "The Fifth Element," a movie involving gun battles and a talk-show host performing cunnilingus on a guest singer. The surprise was that the senators seemed to expect the public to believe that it would really be possible to sequester children from ads for movies like that.
Just walk through tourist-friendly Times Square these days. The huge Disney-affiliated ABC billboard flashes steamy video clips from daytime soaps in front of the teenagers who cluster below MTV's studio windows and line up at the World Wrestling Federation store for Chyna to sign copies of her spread in Playboy. Nobody reasonably expects to keep dry standing in the midst of a deluge.
We are more cynical these days. Bad art and craven art marketers breed disaffected consumers, in a downward spiral. In art galleries and at great public establishments like the newly hip-hop Brooklyn Museum and the Armani-sponsored Guggenheim, commercial fashion and pseudotransgressive button-pushing in emulation of Hollywood trigger our stony indifference. We roll our eyes. No one wants to seem like a rube -- a defensive response, which in the end is self-anesthetizing. Our reaction to pandering and provocation in museums has become something akin to compassion fatigue, to our numbed reaction to seeing too much violence on the network news.
And indifference is willed blindness, which can mute deserved outrage. Arts critics know that one of the purposes of modern art has been to make us uneasy, the arts, unlike battlefields or brokerage houses, being wonderfully benign sites on which to thrash out our different values.
When sensationalism, a cheap effect, substitutes for truly disturbing art seriously presented, we should be deeply bothered. But arts critics, aware of art's punching-bag role, can often be too close to the arts or too defensive of them, and maybe a little too worried about peer pressure, to express disappointment whenever it is felt, in part fearing another "Bosley 'Bonnie'-Brook," as a 1967 headline in Variety put it. Bosley Crowther, the New York Times film critic then, having failed to see the point of "Bonnie and Clyde," wrote that it was just "another indulgence of a restless and reckless taste, and an embarrassing addition to an excess of violence on the screen." Other people recognized the film to be a sign of generational shift, a seismic change attuned to the youth culture in the middle of the Vietnam War. By the end of that year, Mr. Crowther decided to retire.
Generational shift can be especially hard to perceive from the caboose end, which increasingly locates the baby boomers. During the 1960's and 70's, America reflected young boomers' preoccupation with sex and social freedom. In the 80's it was a maturing generation's desire for money and security. Now it's a middle-aged group's inevitable alarm about uncontrollable global change. Baby boomers ceding control to succeeding generations risk confusing lost authority with perceptions of social entropy. Cries of civilization's breakdown have historically been a stand-in for displaced anxieties about other things.
ANXIETY about technological change, for instance. During the 1920's, the proliferation of movie theaters -- which you could call a technological phenomenon like the spread of personal computers, cable television stations and video machines in the 1990's -- provoked a spasm of sociological reports, Senate hearings, speeches from the pulpit and media speculation about the collapse of American cultural standards and the resulting corruption of America's children.
Scientists stuck electrodes to teenagers to try to measure the psychic effects of watching sex and violence in movies, failing to ask whether similar reactions might have been caused by, say, reading dime novels or Walter Scott adventures. Parents feared they couldn't control the new medium by which their children, whose movie intake averaged around two a week, were learning about the world from unscrupulous movie moguls via Rudolph Val entino. Chicago, whose Tribune editorialized several times against the corrupting effects of Valentino, even enacted film censorship laws, pointlessly. A Hollywood executive noted that the city of Al Capone had become the "nicest, cleanest, most orderly, crimeless city in the world today."
Each generation has repeated this self-delusional process, usually around election time. In the 50's the scourge was comic books, ruining children's mental health. By the 60's it was television, now in nearly every home. Then at one exquisite moment in 1972, when porn theaters had not yet been made obsolete by the video revolution, the two most popular films in the country were "The Godfather" and "Deep Throat," to widespread consternation. The term "porno chic" was coined to describe the lines of celebrities, dating couples and suburbanites at places like the grubby World Theater on 49th Street in Manhattan, where "Deep Throat" earned millions of dollars in its first few weeks.
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," which you could call the godfather of "I Know What You Did Last Summer," came out two years later. And by the 1980's pop sociologists were warning that boomboxes blasting Run-DMC over the din of rumbling subway cars portended the final ignominious breakdown of civil society, which was around the same time that Slayer's album "Reign in Blood" reached the charts with a song serenading Josef Mengele.
Then boomboxes declined, fashionably displaced by the technological revolution of the CD Walkman. Problem solved.
Now it's intrusive cell phones and road rage as social analogues of such evil cultural phenomena as women-hating rap lyrics and foul speech on "reality-based" television shows. Altogether they signal our dissolution -- for real this time, the doomsayers insist, never mind the news about plummeting rates of crime, teen pregnancy and divorce. Coarsening culture begets uncivil action, so the knee-jerk argument always goes, which was the underlying point of the Senate hearings last month and in the 1920's. Even so, for good reason senators in the recent hearings stopped short of claiming that violent art causes violent behavior, because by now everyone knows that the facts don't reliably support the rhetoric.
One man's civility is invariably another's hell, of course. Dan Quayle, running for re-election, railed against "Murphy Brown" for its lack of "family values" but said nothing about the body count in Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall." In the 1950's, road rage wasn't yet a documented risk on Los Angeles's comparatively unclogged freeways, but blacks had to sit at the back of public buses in the South. And before then, people didn't talk dirty in mixed company, but they would spit on the sidewalk and, if they were polite, into spittoons -- which were everywhere, like the ashtray until it, too, was banished in most public places by a society that one could argue is more, not less, compliant, conformist and docile than it has ever been. When was the last time you saw a "No Spitting" sign in a New York subway station? Was it the last time you sat in a subway car plastered with obscene graffiti?
We may be too polite. American disenchantment with negativism of any kind in campaigns this political season, the polls tell us, has caused people to balk at candidates who simply don't seem personable enough, policies aside.
On the culture front, laudably forthright depictions of difficult social issues have diminished, in cautious commercial aversion to causing public offense. I wonder, for example: although Hollywood might still give an R rating to "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" (1982) if the movie were to be made today, would the producers be as explicit about teenage abortion?
Here's an odd thought. History, as the sociologist Norbert Elias famously detailed, shows that explicit sex and violence -- talking to little children about sex, exalting people who kill -- have been the norms of Western civilization, Victorianism and its legacy being the exception. One wonders whether we are currently wrestling with what is our natural condition, to which popular culture is rudely returning.
What's not old but unprecedented is how on the technical side we receive images, a factor that may partly affect the impression of moral downward mobility. Films in the 60's and 70's could be incredibly violent ("A Clockwork Orange," after some editing, and "The Wild Bunch" both got R ratings and provoked outcries about society's terminal moral decline), but people sat together in movie houses to watch them, bracketing the experience from the rest of life.
People still go to movies and concerts in droves. But now they often pop videos into VCR's, flip channels on the remote and log on to the Net, at home, alone. Adults and children. The cultural experience has become more private and isolated, a civilizing challenge, because, except for reading, culture's civilizing power has always had something to do with the fact that people generally gathered together for it.
Visual art remains a partial exception, too, in the sense that most people can't afford to experience it in the privacy of their homes -- but these days it manages to be alienating in its own special ways.
As an art critic, I struggle to parse the difference between a used condom and an old urinal. An 83-year-old urinal. Think about that. Marcel Duchamp acquired his porcelain provocation in 1917 from a plumbing equipment manufacturer on lower Fifth Avenue, signed it R. Mutt and submitted the now infamous "Fountain" to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition in New York, from which it was acrimoniously excluded. As he had no doubt expected, the society found the urinal beyond the pale.
"You mean to say if a man sent in horse manure glued to a canvas we would have to accept it?" asked the artist George Bellow, incredulous.
"I'm afraid we would," replied Walter Arensberg, Duchamp's patron and champion, who had shopped with him for "Fountain."
How's that for prognostication?
But there is a difference between that urinal and condoms, contextually speaking. "Fountain," in no sense autobiographical, arrived against the backdrop of the tradition of painting and sculpture, its incendiary effect having to do with its challenge to material precedent. It existed, like paintings and sculptures, still separated from the rest of the world within the confines of art, posing a question to art about whether to let the rest of the world in. "Fountain" was a urinal, but it was also something else in that situation, an artistic proposition.
The same pertained, more or less, when Warhol painted soup cans. But by now -- the lines between high and low having been virtually erased, the question about letting the world in having long ago been answered affirmatively -- a condom is a condom is a condom. Its value has only to do with the shock level of its confessional message, making it akin to the rapper Eminem's lyrics, and equally ephemeral. When art aspires to the general condition of pop culture (which we ought to lament as a compromise of civilized ambition rather than a sign of society's ruin), then that art, like most pop culture, can expect to have the shelf life of an average rap song.
There's good news. The past suggests that culture tends to be self-correcting in the long run, and counterintuitive in its influence. Robert Sklar, whose classic book, "Movie-Made America," details the 1920's panic about film's corrupting effect, the other day mentioned his daughter to me: "She was a film editor working on gory movies, and she didn't think twice about them until she became a mother, and now she can't bring herself to get near anything violent."
I asked him what movies she grew up watching. "If I recall," he said, " 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was one of her favorites."

HEADLINE: Where Is Russia's New Music? Iowa, That's Where

BYLINE: By RICHARD TARUSKIN

DATELINE: IOWA CITY

 BODY:
RUSSIANS of a certain age are apt to regard the state of Iowa with slightly mordant nostalgia. Nikita S. Khrushchev passed through during his 1959 official visit to America. He took home some Iowa corn, ordered his collective farmers to grow it, produced a historic crop failure and . . . well, you know the rest.
But that was not the reason 14 Russian composers and musicologists gathered recently for a long weekend at the University of Iowa here. Khrushchev's corn mania was nurtured at Iowa State, which has a famous agricultural college. The Iowa City institution (best known, perhaps, for its Writers' Workshop) has long been distinguished in contemporary-music circles. In 1966, with Rockefeller Foundation money, it set up a Center for New Music, one of the earliest campus performance outlets of its kind. 
 Now led by David Gompper, an energetic 46-year-old composer, conductor and pianist with an admirably ecumenical world view, the center has undertaken a series of display events to acquaint its audience with the work of composers from foreign countries. In 1998 the favored nation was Greece; in 1999, Austria. The Russian Contemporary Music Festival, with three full-length concerts and a slew of meaty conference sessions, was by far the biggest. Though underbudgeted and virtually unpublicized (hence sadly underattended), it was a fascinating and important event.
Information on what has been happening musically in post-Soviet Russia has been hard to come by. In the late Soviet period, when listening to contemporary music carried a mild cachet of dissidence, it had a popular following at home and an appeal to journalists abroad that the Western avant-garde could never command. As long as the Big Troika of Moscow modernists -- Alfred Schnittke, Sofia Gubaidulina and Edison Denisov (along with the fellow-traveling Estonian, Arvo Part) -- could be seen as living dangerously, their exploits were widely reported and their every premiere was news. When they began living (or, in the case of Denisov, sojourning) abroad, their proximity further magnified them and virtually hid their contemporaries from view.
Since the Soviet collapse, there has not been an official propaganda machine to bring Russian music to the world's attention, and deteriorating economic conditions have vastly inhibited publication and recording. Unsurprisingly, then, Iowa's Russian festival was a showcase of unknowns. Here is the roster of 16 composers, aged 29 to 70, whose music was performed at the concerts: Vladislav Agafonnikov, Yuri Butsko, Irina Dubkova, Andrei Golovin, Faradzh Karayev, Leonid Karev, Mikhail Kollontay, Nikolai Korndorf, Roman Ledenyov, Vladimir Nikolayev, Olga Rayeva, Dmitri Ryabtsev, Albina Stefanou, Vladimir Tarnopolski, Aleksandr Vustin, Sergei Zagny. How many names did you know? This onlooker, thought to be a specialist in Russian music, knew six. If you knew more, kindly keep it to yourself.
Their work covered a stylistic and ideological range at least as broad as any Western country's, showing that beneath the enforced unanimity of Soviet public life, a rich and varied culture always seethed. Svetlana Savenko, the senior musicologist present, noted with a twinkle that "as in a good supermarket, you can find virtually anything you wish" in Russian music today.
Nor did anybody abruptly change styles on Dec. 25, 1991, the day Mikhail S. Gorbachev called it quits. Ms. Savenko, her twinkle now a bit mischievous, reported that foreign visitors had sometimes expressed surprise at this. But if you laughed at the Fidel Castro surrogate in Woody Allen's "Bananas," who on the day after the revolution announced that his little republic's official language would henceforth be Swedish, you know better. All the collapse of totalitarianism did was level the playing field. A hundred flowers now bloom undisturbed, and also unassisted. It's not better for everyone.
Elena Dubinets, a Russian-trained musicologist now living in Seattle and the festival's co-organizer, emphasized in her opening remarks that the event was "unprecedented in plan and scope." The words had a faint ring of irony; for with plurality come factions, rivalries and mutual antagonisms. One had a strong sense that the Iowa participants could never have been induced to inhabit the same room, let alone share a rostrum, at home.
At first glance, one saw the same factions as everywhere, though in the slightly fossilized variants you might expect to find where a status quo had long been embalmed in amber. There was the senior academic faction that in the West would of course comprise serialists but that here consisted of impressionists, folklorists and neo-classicists: what you would have found in an American music department in the 1950's. There were elite modernists, mostly former pupils and grandpupils of Denisov, whose attitudes somewhat resemble those of the European avant-garde of the 1960's (say, Berio or Ligeti).
They describe themselves as today's Russian avant-garde, but they are in no sense rebels: they have inherited their seniors' commitment to old-fashioned academic training and despise composers who lack "technique." To find rebels one had to look to a third group, not necessarily younger than the others, who take what might hereabout seem a somewhat faded inspiration from Dada and Cage but also go in for the kind of border-crossings (serious-pop, high-low, art-commerce) associated in the West, if a little jadedly by now, with postmodernism.
Each group has its own niche festival at home. The seniors get played at the Moscow Autumn, which tourists attend and where big-name artists and ensembles perform. The modernists hold forth at the Moscow Forum, which functions as a branch of the International Society for Contemporary Music and maintains contacts with elite modernists abroad. Its performing ensembles, highly professional and specialized, are the ones most comparable to the new-music groups on American campuses. And the rebels have their Alternativa festival, where just about anything goes except Autumn and Forum fare, and where the main performing groups have names like Ad Hoc and 4:33 (after Cage's immortal bout of nothing). Mixed grills like the one savored in Iowa are served, as yet, only in Iowa.
But if you looked a bit below the surface, especially if you did so with some knowledge of Russian music and its checkered history, much more interesting configurations turned up. There were many at the festival who did not want to be looked at this way, especially the Alternativa crowd for whom nationalities were just another border to be crossed. Mr. Zagny, for example, who at 40 still enjoys (in every sense) the reputation of an enfant terrible, was especially vehement in asserting his right to be considered as a human being, not a Russian. Dmitri Ukhov, the Alternativa organizer, sneeringly consigned the "national question" to the museum, his face suggesting that he had a less dignified destination in mind.
No wonder. Nobody likes to be categorized, especially when the category in question is as fraught with stereotypes as that of "Russian composer." Nor was anybody forgetting that displays of national character had been promoted, and at times insisted on, by the Soviet state. Attitudes toward it opened up a yawning generation gap.
Professor Ledenyov, of the Moscow Conservatory, the oldest composer present, serenely maintained the old Soviet line, asserting that "there exists a Russian school of composers" characterized by "a conglomerate of certain features peculiar to this national culture and its folk music." He even claimed that Moscow and St. Petersburg schools could still be defined just the way they had been in the 19th century (St. Petersburg being "theatrical" and Moscow having "profound psychologism").
The piece he presented to demonstrate his relationship to the living national traditions he described, "Metamorphoses" for viola and chamber orchestra, was attractively lyrical and moody, and did incline more toward the psychological than to the showy. But it was based on a theme by Bach ("Erbarme dich," from the "St. Matthew Passion") and made side references to Schumann, Chopin, Mozart, "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and bossa nova. Go figure.
The headiest moment at the festival came when Marina Frolova-Walker, a musicologist less than half Professor Ledenyov's age, trained at his conservatory but now teaching at Cambridge University in England, got up to inveigh against everything he had said. She denied that there ever was any such thing as Russian music, only music from Russia, and hinted that to maintain a nationalistic view of culture was to espouse a reactionary view of society. There were overtones here not only of Russia's eternal identity crisis but also of the mutual suspicions that have always colored relations, in the 20th century, between Russians at home and Russians abroad.
Yet even advocates of the avant-garde occasionally cited nationality as a determinant of style. Ms. Dubinets distinguished Russian minimalism from its Western counterpart. "Minimalism can be oriented not only to commercial accessibility," she said. "It can be very lyrical, sensitive, suffering and compassionate. It can touch the soul and disturb the subconscious." Ms. Frolova-Walker would no doubt call this a salad of cliches. (And not only she: the Russian artist Serge Soudeikine once exclaimed that his mission in life was "to show the world that the Russian can also be gay.") But if a cliche, however disprovable, is accepted by artists and embodied in their art, then it has indeed become a stylistic determinant. And the art it determines is in no way necessarily condemned to banality.
A CASE in point is Mr. Korndorf's "Hymn II," one of the few works presented at the festival that is available on CD (from Sony Classical, with the BBC Orchestra directed by Aleksandr Lazarev). This gleaming piece is recognizably minimalist in its radically reduced material, but the composer said that he had modeled it on the solemn doxologies of the Russian Orthodox Church. And its liturgical character derives not only from actual liturgical sources but also, and at least as much, from the familiar Russian glory-music of the concert and opera stages. (Imagine Gorecki arranged by Rimsky-Korsakov, or a diatonic "Poem of Ecstasy.") One can believe that such a synthesis would have occurred only to a Russian composer without buying into the biology-is-destiny mystique of nationalism.
Resonances of more ancient Orthodox music could be found in other festival offerings, providing an avenue, for those desiring it, toward a genuinely national modernism or modern nationalism. In its pious archaism it proclaims its freedom from the constraints of a more recent past, and it crosscuts generations, uniting Mr. Butsko, one of the oldest composers represented at the festival, and Mr. Karev, one of the youngest. Much of their music (and not only theirs) is based on an imaginative extension of a scale peculiar to medieval Russian chant, credited to Mr. Butsko.
The scale contains both B natural in its low tessitura and B flat in its higher one. The extension incorporates all the notes of the chromatic scale into an evolving tonal structure that picks up flats as it ascends and sharps as it descends. The piquant, very original harmonic idiom that emerges from it can be sampled on CD's in Schnittke's Fourth Symphony, a work inspired by Mr. Butsko's "Polyphonic Concerto" for organ, piano, harpsichord and celesta, from which Mr. Karev, a Russian organist (rare breed!) who lives and works in Paris, performed some excerpts with Mr. Ryabtsev joining in at the piano. It is one of the exasperating vagaries of fame that Schnittke is usually given credit for inventing the mode.
Another area in which today's Russian avant-garde works in high consciousness of national traditions, perhaps unexpectedly, is that of electro-acoustical music. As Mr. Ukhov was at pains to point out, the genre has a longer history in Russia than almost anywhere else. It was 80 years ago that Lev Sergeyevich Termen (known in the West as Leon Theremin) invented the dual-antennaed sound-emitter that bears his name, the only musical instrument one plays without touching.
Composers who heard the theremin in the 1920's were often struck by its possibilities. The sounds it produced "between the fixed pitches and tone colors" of conventional concert music revealed to Ernst Toch "a true new vista that Theremin lays open to the composer of music, still incalculable in its consquences." But that promise long went unfulfilled. Theremin himself, scientifically gifted but musically unimaginative, thought of his instrument as a sort of modernized violin or cello, on which he played salon gems like Saint-Saens's "Swan." His protegee Clara Rockmore mastered Bloch's "Schelomo." By the 1930's, John Cage could write in disgust that "thereministes act as censors, giving the public those sounds they think the public will like; we are shielded from new sound experiences."
It was exciting, then, when Mr. Ukhov produced a tape of Vladimir Nikolayev's "19 Piques" for theremin and string quartet, performed by Lydia Kavina, the inventor's grandniece, at "ALT-2K," this year's Alternativa festival. A thing of feral glissandos and haunting microtones, it finally kept the broken promise of long ago and made the dowdy old theremin (long since consigned to sci-fi soundtracks and rock backups in the West) seem again an instrument of real -- indeed, inspiring -- possibilities.
But the biggest impression of all (and on all) came from Vladimir Tarnopolski, a world-class talent by any standard. Now 45, Mr. Tarnopolski is an emblematic figure, having been appointed to the Moscow Conservatory's composition faculty in 1992, the first post-Soviet year. Widely acknowledged at home (along with Aleksandr Knaifel of St. Petersburg) as the standard-bearer for Russia's elite modernists, he was given pride of place at the festival. Two of his major works were presented. An opera, "When Time Overflows Its Banks," was shown on videotape in a performance given last year in German at the Munich Biennale, which commissioned it. "Cassandra," a 20-minute composition for a large chamber ensemble (or small orchestra) of 19 players, was put over brilliantly by a valiant band of students and faculty members from the University's School of Music under Mr. Gompper's expert baton.
BOTH were scorching, moving experiences. In "Cassandra," the titular tone of dire prophecy is conveyed by a mounting sonic wave that comes up against cacophonous obstacles in the form of stridently repeated chords and clusters. The work would have had a powerful effect under any circumstances, but knowing that it was written in the spring and summer of 1991, during the time of foreboding that led up to the aborted August putsch, lent it the kind of special poignancy that Shostakovich's works often possess when they are apprehended in their historical context. (It is recorded, along with three other Tarnopolski scores, on a Belgian CD, Megadisc MDC 7838, which is hard to find in America but may be ordered online through amazon.co.uk, the British Amazon Web site.)
The opera has a similarly obsessive and intensifying shape. Its three scenes are parallel constructions. The first, an abstraction from Chekhov's "Three Sisters" in which the characters typically converse without hearing one another, is followed by a second, in which people today (played by the same singers) are shown discoursing incomprehensibly about art, and a third, in which the same characters reappear once again as people of the future, each confined to a plastic tube, enunciating isolated phonemes accompanied by primal sonic soup from the orchestra. The composer's purpose, as he reported it, was to lay bare "the existential problems of man," namely "the impossibility of communication and of mutual understanding, loneliness and absence of a sense of life," which "are not solved but are redoubled in the course of the development of civilization."
The Sartrean or Beckettish message may strike the Western ear as dated, but the music and the dramaturgy were fresh, gripping and so virtuosically executed as to disarm sophisticated cavil. Besides, there was, as it turned out, a charming disconnect between the art and the artist. When discussion following Ms. Frolova-Walker's paper turned vehement and time ran out, it was Mr. Tarnopolski who suggested that an extra round table be scheduled for the sake of better communication and mutual understanding. When it was pointed out to him that he seemed, after all, to believe in what his opera denied, he answered, ingenuously, "Well, I'm an optimist."
Why, then, such a pessimistic opera? Could it be because the composer had grown up in, and learned to resist, a society that demanded that all art be optimistic to the point of mendacity? Big questions are looming, and my space is up. But the most fortifying thought one took away from the Iowa festival was that in the former land of the Soviets there can now be questions without answers.

Marooned On an Island, Out on a Limb

BYLINE: By MARGY ROCHLIN; Margy Rochlin, who is based in Los Angeles, writes frequently about movies and television.

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif.

 BODY:
EARLY last month, Tom Hanks could be found in a Four Seasons Hotel banquet hall in Beverly Hills, seated between his wife, Rita Wilson, and Holly Hunter. On his plate, there wasn't much left of his mesclun greens and goat cheese salad. But judging from how much he was laughing, Mr. Hanks was enjoying more than just his meal.
He was there to present Ms. Hunter, an old friend, with a special career achievement award at Premiere magazine's "Women in Hollywood" luncheon, an annual event known for its high giddiness factor. So while Mr. Hanks heaped praise on Ms. Hunter, he also laced his podium time with teasing ad-libs and did a clipped, weirdly high-pitched imitation of Ms. Hunter's husband, the Polish cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. 
 Mr. Hanks even zinged his host, James B. Meigs, the editor in chief of Premiere. In introducing him, Mr. Meigs described Mr. Hanks's new film, "Cast Away," as a daring departure for someone of Mr. Hanks's stature: a stranded-on-a-desert-island tale in which, Mr. Meigs said, "a major portion of the movie has no musical score, no voiceover, no co-stars and -- oh, yeah -- no food." After bounding onstage, Mr. Hanks turned to Mr. Meigs, fixed him with a look and said accusingly: "Thanks. You really made the movie sound great."
The explosive laughter that greeted Mr. Hanks's feigned umbrage had much to do with his patented brand of genial sarcasm. But this film-industry crowd might have also taken his joke as a display of defensiveness and felt sympathetic toward a Hollywood brand of touchiness that can accompany the wait to see if a very personal project will be accepted by the masses.
Two days later, the 44-year-old Mr. Hanks would watch an almost final version of "Cast Away" in a nearly deserted screening room on the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City. Even though he had invited his own focus group -- Ms. Wilson, his baseball-capped eldest son, 22-year-old Colin Hanks, and his agent Richard Lovett, the president of Creative Artists Agency -- he was still in limbo. When their feedback did not allay his concern, he sought reaction from one of the few other people present in the room -- a reporter divided between taking in the unfolding 2-hour-19-minute movie and searching for meaning in the Hanks family's every flinch and chuckle.
"You liked it, right? Does it work?" Mr. Hanks asked a few days later. "Is the theme of the movie big enough to fill up the screen? Is it interesting enough? I can't tell."
It was an honest declaration of uncertainty from Mr. Hanks, who describes himself as closer to and more involved in "Cast Away" than any project in his 20-year career. How close?
"Mind-numbingly so," said Mr. Hanks, who is credited as an executive producer.
That's because "Cast Away," directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by William Broyles Jr., is based on an idea Mr. Hanks got more than six years ago. After reading that Federal Express flies jumbo jets across the Pacific Ocean every day, Mr. Hanks recalled, he thought to himself, "I wonder what happens when one of those goes down?" From there, he came up with the concept to make a movie of pure behavior and action -- playing a character who would spend the bulk of his time onscreen doing rather than talking. "Chuck of the Jungle," as Mr. Hanks long called it, would be the story of a FedEx systems analyst named Chuck Nolan who as the sole survivor of a plane wreck would be marooned for four years on an uninhabited lump of white sand and palm trees in a remote part of the South Pacific.
When he began telling people about his idea, everyone from potential screenwriters to his friends responded positively to the theme of a life-or-death struggle for food, water and shelter. But there was a different reaction to Chuck's crushing loneliness -- the central emotional theme of Mr. Hanks's scenario. Suddenly, Mr. Hanks said, he was fielding all-too-eager suggestions on how to embellish his spare drama by helping the protagonist find somebody to trade quips with.
"It would be like, 'Well, what if he had a monkey?' " recalled Mr. Hanks.
" 'No,' " Mr. Hanks would reply. " 'He's not going to have a monkey.'
" 'Are pirates going to land on the island?'
" 'No, no pirates.'
" 'He's got to get off the island somehow. Let's say Elle Macpherson comes ashore on a Sports Illustrated calendar shoot!' "
Finally, Mr. Hanks hooked up with Mr. Broyles, the screenwriter of "Apollo 13," the space docudrama that features Mr. Hanks as the astronaut Jim Lovell. Mr. Hanks and Mr. Broyles spent untold hours collaborating on a treatment so that Mr. Broyles could come up with a first draft. Still, later on, pre-production would seem like the easy part. Because barely two months after finishing "The Green Mile," in January 1999, he was in Moscow and the Fiji Islands, still carrying his prison-guard flab and jowls, shooting the pre-crash Chuck Nolan scenes. After that, "Cast Away" took its much-reported unconventional trajectory: Mr. Zemeckis went off to make "What Lies Beneath" with Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Mr. Hanks put away his razor, dropped 55 pounds, became a regular at his local tanning booth and waved good-bye to his barber.
"Ridiculously bush-like" is Mr. Hanks's description of what became of his erupting brown curls. "I looked like one of those guys from Foghat." A year later, Mr. Hanks and the "Cast Away" crew reconvened in the South Pacific, where the only conversations Mr. Hanks's character had were held with the open sky.
The closest thing Chuck gets to a Man Friday is a Wilson volleyball that washes ashore. Out of sheer desperation Chuck calls it by name and treats it like a beloved confidante. (Perhaps a loving nod to his wife.) What Mr. Zemeckis remembered about the filming of these scenes was that the craziness of this plot device wasn't lost on anybody.
"You know what he said to me after we played back the take of when he first meets the volleyball and starts talking to him?" Mr. Zemeckis said. "He said, 'Well, Bob. I didn't know the movie was turning into "Apocalypse Now." And we just laughed. It was like: 'Oh, my God. We just stepped over the line.' "
Yet Mr. Hanks and Mr. Zemeckis, who first worked together on the blockbuster "Forrest Gump," appear energized by such conceptual leaps of faith. In Mr. Hanks's case, perhaps this is because in the past he has had success with what is just unorthodox enough. He made the jump to movies, after all, from "Bosom Buddies," a television sitcom in which he appeared in drag every week. And in 1984, in "Splash," his leading-man debut in film had him wooing a mermaid.
When a handful of middle-of-the-road comedies failed after that, he bounced back in 1988 with "Big," in which he played a 12-year-old trapped inside a grown-up's body, lending poignance to what could have been just a gimmick. What converted him from just another charming funnyman into a mega-star with real acting credentials was a pair of Oscar-winning turns: his lawyer with AIDS suing for wrongful job termination in "Philadelphia" (1993) and the wisdom-spouting man-boy of "Forrest Gump."
Since then, Mr. Hanks has had an almost solid string of box office hits.
That fact and his perpetual air of affable confidence make it hard to imagine that Mr. Hanks was ever a novice -- unless you're a fan of grade-C slasher films and caught Mr. Hanks in first movie role, in "He Knows You're Alone" (1981). The part is so insignificant that his character, a handsome jogger, doesn't even merit a bloody end; after his onscreen girlfriend is murdered, he just never reappears. Still, to Mr. Hanks, just being cast felt like "magic," although a less pleasant sensation followed, on Day 1 of shooting.
"I threw up," said Mr. Hanks. But his fears were soon quelled by the ho-hum reality of a film set. "The camera wasn't as big as I thought it would be, just a small, little box. I thought, 'This is it? This is being in a movie?' Then, I just stumbled around and did what I was told."
Taking direction, after all, was nothing new to Mr. Hanks. Born in Concord, Calif., he was voted best actor in his senior year at Skyline High School in Oakland and graduated to theater productions at Chabot Junior College in Hayward and a stint at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland. In his formative years, though, he was not much for following instructions, if only because there was rarely anyone issuing them.
It was 1961 when Mr. Hanks's parents divorced. Mr. Hanks's mother, Janet, kept the youngest child, James. Mr. Hanks's father, Amos, a chef, assumed responsibility for 5-year-old Tom, as well as his older siblings, Sandra and Lawrence. Shuttling his brood around Northern California, the elder Mr. Hanks found work in a variety of steak joints and what his famous son now categorizes as "union dinner houses." Each post required the same long hours, though, and his school-age children were left alone to run their own apartment-sized kingdom.
"It was an extremely fertile time; our interests truly guided us," Mr. Hanks said of a particularly idyllic two-and-a-half-year stretch in Alameda, where he vividly recalls eating every meal in front of the television set and going to bed when his father got home, at 11:30 p.m. "With all that freedom, my inspirations came almost completely through the popular culture. I knew what time it was by what was on TV. It'd be, like, after 'Leave It to Beaver,' it's going to be 'The Woody Woodpecker Show.' We never ran into trouble. We never broke laws. Just furniture. And all we did was laugh."
But it didn't last. Sporadically, his sister or brother moved back in with his mother. Twice, his father remarried, both times to women who brought their own packs of offspring and standards for discipline. These are the times Mr. Hanks resists reflecting upon, maybe because as an adult he feels it is unproductive to carry on about the turbulence and upheaval of one's youth. But those who know him say he has forgotten nothing.
"Once you get to know Tom, you see he has a dark side," said Sally Field, who was Mr. Hanks's love interest in "Punchline" and, later, his mother in "Forrest Gump." "Whether that goes back to his childhood, I don't know. But I certainly think it does. And it weighs on him. He's not a laugh-a-minute kind of guy. I mean, he can be; he's funny and quick. But he's also very intense. And it's one of the reasons he's so interesting to watch."
But try using that as a selling point when it's 1982, "Bosom Buddies" ends abruptly after 37 episodes and you're unemployed in the San Fernando Valley, the father of two infants, Colin and Elizabeth, and you're half of a crumbling marriage to the actress Samantha Lewes.
"It was tough," said Mr. Hanks, whose bread-winning abilities dwindled to unemployment checks and short-term television jobs, the most embarrassing being "Mazes and Monsters," a television movie featuring a 26-year-old Mr. Hanks as a college student who goes psycho after becoming involved in a role-playing game. "I was right back at square one. It was, 'O.K. I'm an actor, but nobody wants me.' I should have been prepared to deal with it, but I wasn't.
"The reality of it was I'd spent two years of working every moment of every day and, all of a sudden, Boom! it was gone. That's when I looked around town and thought: 'Oh, I see. The streets are littered with corpses of guys like me.' "
Not much later, Mr. Hanks landed "Splash." After divorcing, he married Ms. Wilson, his co-star in "Volunteers," an otherwise unremarkable 1985 Peace Corps comedy. At the time, Mr. Hanks was not too choosy about work. "I'd just put my head down and make every movie that came my way," he said. "I didn't know any better. Finally, you realize -- or at least I realized -- you don't have to make movies all the time. And if you're going to, they should be about something." Yeah, yeah, yeah. And John Travolta thought he was using his clout well to don a nose plug and make a cinematic statement in "Battlefield Earth." But coming from Mr. Hanks, the sentiment seemed richly adult and practical.
What he meant, he said, is that he would like to do big, well-thought-out projects that don't require too much time away from home. He has just finished co-producing (with Steven Spielberg) and directing an episode of "Band of Brothers," a 10-hour miniseries about World War II for HBO. So what next? he was asked. A return to the theater?
"Not now," he said, brushing off the idea. "I'm in my child-rearing years." He and Ms. Wilson have two sons, Chester, 10, and Truman, 4. "I was gone so much in my older kids' lives. I don't want to do it to my younger kids."
It was midafternoon when Mr. Hanks was waxing philosophical and he was sitting in a suite at Shutters on the Beach, a hotel in Santa Monica, waiting for a waiter to bring him a room-service lunch of spaghettini. There was something decidedly boyish about the way the cuffs and collar of his wrinkled white Ivy League shirt were unbuttoned and flapping. But when Mr. Hanks spoke, it was with a man's perspective.
"If life is a bell curve, that means the amount of wild successes you have will be equal to your wild failures," he said. "The odds are against my ever making as celebrated a disaster as 'Bonfire of the Vanities.' Or making another movie that'll do better than 'Forrest Gump.' I'll probably never do a movie as effective as 'Saving Private Ryan,' either. But it doesn't mean I'm not going to try. And it's totally freeing."

HEADLINE: HOLIDAY FILMS;
In the Coen Brothers' Off-Kilter World, The Only Certainty Is Uncertainty

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
NOTHING comes with a guarantee," says a character in the Coen brothers' very first film. "I don't care if you're pope of Rome, president of the United States, man of the year, something can always go wrong."
That observation could well be taken as one of the signature themes of that 1984 film, "Blood Simple," and every Coen brothers movie since, from "Raising Arizona" (1987) through "Barton Fink" (1991) and "The Hudsucker Proxy" (1994) and now, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" (which opens Dec. 22). In the off-kilter world of the Coens, the perfect crime inevitably goes awry; the peaceful, humdrum life falls prey to chaos; the carefully plotted scheme unravels. This uncertainty principle is not only the engine that generates comedy and suspense in the brothers' films; it's also the cornerstone of their quirky vision of a world resistant to human will. Indeed, the brothers are artists who manage to combine the knockabout anarchy of Mack Sennett's comedies with the visual incongruities of Magritte, making the ordinary seem surreal and the surreal seem oddly banal, while limning a screwball cosmos in which expectations are routinely subverted and existential banana peels bedevil murderers and mailroom clerks alike. 
 In "Raising Arizona," an ex-con marries a pretty cop and determines to go straight, only to find himself stealing a baby to complete their all-American life. In "Fargo" (1996), a none-too-bright car salesman tries to stage the kidnapping of his wife in order to get his father-in-law to fork over some money but quickly loses control of his criminal hirelings, who begin leaving a trail of dead bodies behind them. And in "The Big Lebowski" (1998), thugs burst into the wrong man's house, ruin his favorite rug and drag him willy-nilly into a messy adventure involving a conniving tycoon, his equally conniving daughter and a group of pancake-eating nihilists armed with a man-threatening marmot.
Equally antic and improbable events animate "O Brother," which recounts the story of one Ulysses Everett McGill, a good-looking Southerner played by George Clooney, who has been sentenced to hard labor on a chain gang for practicing law without a license. Everett wants to escape and return home to his wife, Penny (Holly Hunter), before she can divorce him and marry one of her suitors, so he stages a breakout along with his two comrades in chains, Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (John Turturro, in his fourth role for the Coens). For the three cons, evading the law turns out to be the least of their problems as they run afoul of a series of menacing strangers, including a malicious one-eyed Bible salesman, a trio of seductive women and a lynch mob.
Everett is another of the Coens' common-man heroes, along with Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), the perpetually put-upon car salesman in "Fargo"; Dude, the slovenly, middle-aged hippie played by Jeff Bridges in "Lebowski"; and Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), the gee-whiz rube who invents the hula hoop in "Hudsucker." They're all slightly larcenous versions of Capra's little men -- "losers or lunkheads," as Joel Coen once put it -- who are willing to bend the law in pursuit of their version of the American dream; they're outlaws or naifs pitted against the fat-cat exemplars of the status quo (who are nearly always represented in the Coens' movies by fat men in expensive suits).
The brothers -- who write their screenplays together, with Joel, 45, directing and Ethan, 43, producing -- invite us to laugh at Everett's vanity and pretensions. An avid user of Dapper Dan hair pomade, he's constantly preening and posing, and like Hi (Nicolas Cage) in "Raising Arizona," he's got a highfalutin way of speaking, using big words where little ones would do. Still, the Coens have an abiding affection for their bumbling heroes, goading us to identify with their foibles and frustrations. Everett is no exception: we're made to see that beneath his swagger and scheming, he's really a romantic at heart, whose one goal is to win back the heart of his wife and their seven daughters.
While the Coens have frequently been described as cynics, satirists and chilly post-modern auteurs and their work has been compared with that of Stanley Kubrick, another director obsessed with the notion that "if something can go wrong, it will," their vision is considerably more humane. Beneath the edgy humor and showy set pieces in the Coens' work (the tommy-gun shootout to the strains of "Danny Boy" in "Miller's Crossing"; the vertiginous tracking shot down a bathroom drain in "Barton Fink"), there's plenty of old-fashioned sentiment to be found -- a quality masked by the brothers' refusal to attach easily explicated endings or easily deciphered morals to their films.
The conclusion of "Raising Arizona" -- in which the hero fantasizes about a Christmas-card-perfect future shared with a bevy of loving children and grandchildren -- can be read either as an ironic comment on the laughable gap between his dreams and means, or as the faintly sugared expression of a heartfelt dream of domestic bliss. Similarly, the end of "Fargo" -- in which its heroine, a very pregnant cop who has just solved a grisly crime, settles into bed with her doting husband -- can be read either as a tongue-in-cheek depiction of corny, naive goodness or as a touching portrait of a pair of decent folk, buffeted but unscathed by the calamity and vice around them.
In "O Brother," Everett's two chain-gang pals, Delmar and Pete, also radiate an offbeat sweetness. They're the latest additions to a collection of grotesques as vivid as any created by Flannery O'Connor or Carson McCullers -- a gallery that includes such memorable weirdos as Walter, the Vietnam-obsessed veteran (John Goodman, another Coen regular) in "Lebowski," and the screwy, stressed out gun-for-hire played by Steve Buscemi in "Fargo." The two cons in "O Brother," however, turn out to be harmless nuts, hillbillies with hidden hearts of gold. Delmar's dream is to one day buy back his family's farm; Pete's is to open a restaurant and work as the maitre d', a job that would enable him to wear a bow tie every day.
Though the parallels are often clumsy and gratuitous, it's clear that "O Brother" is loosely based on the "Odyssey" in much the same way that "The Big Lebowski" was loosely based on Raymond Chandler's novels. In both cases, the Coen brothers have simply used the original as a framework for a picaresque series of adventures -- the first set in Mississippi of the 1930's, the second in a 1990's Los Angeles nostalgic for the 60's. As a result, these movies tend to feel like slapdash shaggy dog tales, especially when compared with such economical masterworks as "Fargo" and "Blood Simple." Structurally, they're little more than a series of allusion-filled episodes, lobbed at the hero as obstacles to his goal, and they lack the fierce, oddball storytelling of the Coens' best work.
Fluent in the post-modernist vocabulary of recycling, the Coens are also adept, like Billy Wilder, at reinventing classic genres. Their tightly constructed murder mystery, "Blood Simple," drew on Grade B horror movies and the hard-boiled work of James M. Cain, as well as the moody cinematography of the films of Hitchcock and Orson Welles. And "The Hudsucker Proxy," their big-budget fable of corporate greed, uneasily combined tropes from the movies of Capra and Sturges. Sly visual allusions to "The Wizard of Oz" pop up in such disparate works as "Hudsucker" and "O Brother," while slapstick techniques lifted from the Keystone Kops and Chuck Jones cartoons help fuel the manic comedy of "Raising Arizona."
It would be a mistake, however, to suggest that the Coens have simply been young magpies, bent on sending up earlier artists. Their borrowings, after all, are used in the service of a voice that is unmistakably the Coens' own. It's a voice that owes equal debts to comic books, supermarket tabloids and old movies, a voice built around dichotomies and juxtapositions, moving back and forth between comedy and violence, cynicism and sentiment to build narrative tension and create a sense of displacement.
THERE'S something heightened and larger than life about the world the Coens' characters inhabit. The landscape Everett and his pals traverse in "Brother" is ostensibly Depression-era Mississippi, but it's a fable-like version of the South, where Faulknerian yokels rub shoulders with American folk icons like the gangster Baby Face Nelson.
By setting so many of their dozen movies in bygone decades, the Coens are able to achieve a measure of distance from their subject matter, creating a stylized look and sound that reflects their playful vision. In the less successful movies, the stylization feels arbitrary and self-conscious and fails to mesh with the story. The glossy, magisterial New York depicted in "Hudsucker" with operatic sets and tricky special-effects shots has more to do with production values than with the plot about a small-town hick who rises to become head of a corporation. And in "Miller's Crossing" (1990), a willfully somber look, indebted to "The Godfather" and 1930's gangster pictures, does little to illuminate a needlessly complicated yarn that lifts moods and motifs from the work of Dashiell Hammett to no emotional purpose.
In their best work, however, the Coens conjure up mythologized places that feel vaguely recognizable and alarmingly peculiar at the same time: a noirish, gothicized Texas in "Blood Simple," a Kafkaesque Los Angeles in "Barton Fink," and in "Fargo" a whited-out Minnesota, presided over by the legendary figure of Paul Bunyan. In these movies, the audience is lured into dream scapes where the colors are a little brighter or a little darker than usual, where stark landscapes and wide-angled shots remind us that we're not in Kansas anymore. More often than not, our sense of disorientation is amplified by memorably bizarre images: a human leg sticking up from a woodchipper in "Fargo," a man being buried alive in "Blood Simple," a neatly wrapped box (possibly containing a woman's head) materializing in a hotel room in "Barton Fink."
In many of the brothers' movies, meticulously rendered dream sequences are used to help define who the central characters are. In "Lebowski," the pothead hero imagines himself as the star of a trippy Busby Berkeley musical, playing the part of a bowling ball, surrounded by Carmen Mirandaesque women dressed as bowling pins. And in "Raising Arizona," the hero imagines himself pursued by "the lone biker of the apocalypse," a biker from hell who likes to lob grenades at unsuspecting people and rabbits. If these fantasies reveal a lot about the mindset of the Coens' heroes, then the surreal happenings in "Barton Fink" -- in which a would-be screenwriter suffering from writer's block finds himself implicated in the murder of a beautiful woman -- could well be read as a kind of metaphor for a psychological journey taking place within the hero's own mind.
The journeys undertaken by the Coens' characters -- both the emotional and the literal ones -- don't follow the usual trajectories from innocence to wisdom, shame to redemption, ignorance to self-knowledge. Not surprisingly, they're more ambiguous than that, and even Everett's road trip -- toward home and hearth, as the "Odyssey" model dictates -- takes some unexpected turns and detours, as he wends his way through the Mississippi countryside. For the Coen brothers, the long strange journeys of their heroes not only give them a showcase for their love of character and incident, but also provide them with the perfect vehicle for laying out their dyspeptic yet affectionate vision of America as a place where everything is possible and anything can happen -- and usually does.

In Windsor and Bloomfield, an Office Park Grows

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
IN the mid-1980's, when bulldozers first moved onto land in Windsor that was to become part of the Griffin Center office park, the park's 600 acres were largely tobacco fields, stands of hardwood and a few dirt roads. Today, Griffin Center is nearing 2 million square feet of office space, including one of its most ambitious projects ever, a 165,000-square-foot building for a high-technology tenant, JDS Uniphase.
"The JDS project is demonstrating our ability to build to a tenant's need," said Martha Collier, vice president of Griffin Land and Nurseries, the office park's developer. "It's a very complex job on a very tight schedule." 
 Griffin Land and Nurseries, a landscape nursery and real estate development business, is also working with Windsor, a town of 27,000 about six miles north of Hartford, on a proposal for a 6,500-seat outdoor amphitheater at Griffin Center that would be home to summer concerts by the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. Most events would take place after regular business hours or on weekends, so the center's vast parking lots would be available for concertgoers.
Frederick M. Danziger, the president of Griffin Land and Nurseries, said that the mostly single-story office buildings at the center house insurance, software and engineering companies, law firms and some light manufacturing companies. Mr. Danziger said that he had long envisioned some retail use at the northern end of the property and that now that traffic through the center was becoming quite heavy, there has been some interest from grocery chains.
"It's been going very well for a long time now, but it really seems to be picking up steam lately," he said.
R. Leon Churchill Jr., Windsor's town manager, said that the office park had been "a major benefit to the town, both in the taxes they pay and the prestige it brings having that kind of Class A office space."
Mario D. Zavarella, the town planner, said that from the start Griffin had worked closely with the town and had routinely accommodated town requests regarding development. "The transportation impact is what we were most concerned about, for people to get back and forth to their jobs, and to bring freight in and out of there, but it's been very well planned and laid out, and the infrastructure seems to be holding up well," Mr. Zavarella said.
He said that Griffin Center had used a variety of building styles and the naturally rolling landscape to make sure that the office park did not end up looking like a line of brick boxes.
About 130 acres of Griffin Center spills over into the neighboring town of Bloomfield, whose economic development director, Shyama Jaipershad, also praised the quality of construction.
Robert F. Carroll, a board member of the Windsor Chamber of Commerce, said that Griffin Center had many features that made it a good place to work, among them a restaurant, walking paths, duck ponds and exercise areas. And, Mr. Carroll said, it also benefits businesses outside the park.
"It creates a lot of new traffic for the smaller businesses in town, and the potential for some new business," he said. "As a C.P.A., I've got new customers from a number of those offices who would never have shown up here unless they were new in town. People only change C.P.A.'s because the old one made a mistake, or they moved."
Griffin Land & Nurseries started doing business in north central Connecticut as a subsidiary of the Culbro Corporation, a real estate and tobacco company, and has since become an independent publicly traded company. Mr. Danziger, who was a lawyer for the project when it was just beginning, said it would have been hard to envision it becoming as large as it is.
He said the property had a number of advantages. It is within a few miles of Interstate 91, the major north-south artery in Connecticut. Bradley International Airport is only about five miles away, and a rail line that is still active runs out of Hartford and terminates at Griffin Center. In addition, the sandy soil and flat land of the Connecticut River valley make it ideal for development, because it is well drained and there are no geographic obstacles.
He said his preference was to develop buildings for leasing rather than selling land in the park. "We do, and we will, sell the land, but we'd much rather develop ourselves," he said. About a third of the land that has been developed so far has been sold, Ms. Collier said.
THERE has been low turnover in the Griffin buildings -- Ms. Collier said she expected it would involve perhaps 40,000 square feet next year.
So far, on the Windsor portion of the center, the company has constructed 10 buildings, totaling about 1 million square feet, most of it for offices; 15 buildings for research and development and light industrial use, also totaling about 1 million square feet, have been built on the Bloomfield side, the largest a 400,000-square-foot warehouse now used by Home Depot.
One new 40,000-square-foot office building is going up in Bloomfield; Griffin has a permit for an additional 50,000 square feet there, leaving room for perhaps 25,000 square feet more before that portion of the park is filled.
"The new building was supposed to be for a single tenant, but now they only want half of it," Ms. Collier said. "We haven't even begun marketing the rest of the space, and we've already had two proposals come in for it." She declined to identify the potential tenant, whose lease has not yet been signed, or to discuss leasing rates.
On the Windsor side, the largest project under way is the construction of 165,000 square feet for JDS Uniphase, which designs and manufactures fiber-optic telecommunications components. JDS already occupies three buildings in Griffin Center, and has been growing rapidly. It has an option for up to 300,000 square feet of additional space in two adjacent buildings on a 16-acre parcel.
Kevin C. Cubberly, Griffin's vice president for construction, said the new building would have special features such as floors that will not hold a static charge, high-efficiency filtration and humidity control in the ventilation system, and windows that will not let in infrared and ultraviolet rays, which could damage equipment. He said that part of the building would be ready for occupancy in February, the rest by June.
Griffin officials and the town are working jointly on the proposal for the amphitheater, which would be built near some of the original offices on the site, overlooking a large pond. The town would put up $300,000 to cover construction costs, and the amphitheater would be operated by a private nonprofit foundation created especially to run it. The Town Council may vote on the appropriation as early as December.
"Based on the support I've heard for it around town, I would say it has a pretty good chance," Mayor Mary B. Hogan said. "About 25,000 people drive into town on a daily basis for work, and a good portion of them come right into that area. We want to develop things that would convince people to stay after they get out of work."
The town has a long tradition of activity on its green in the town center, but only up to 1,000 people can be accommodated there. Mayor Hogan said the hope is that the amphitheater would play host to community theater, a local ballet troupe, bands, opera, and a summer concert series by the Hartford Symphony Orchestra.
Charles H. Owens, executive director of the Hartford Symphony, said he was looking forward to the possibility of performing in the amphitheater. For the last five years the orchestra has had an outdoor summer concert series in Simsbury, Mr. Owens said, and the series would be moved to Windsor.
"Windsor has a remarkably diverse population," he said, "both living and working there, and Griffin Center a built-in corporate base, which we would hope will generate some support."
Griffin officials said that based on lease inquiries they have received, the office park would likely grow to about 2.5 million square feet over the next three or four years, and that the park would reach capacity when it hit 3 million square feet a few years later.
Mr. Danziger said he hoped that JDS would help Griffin become a magnet for high technology. "We'd like to have Griffin be the first place that comes to mind when someone is thinking about this kind of development," he said.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/New Haven;
Capitalizing on an Urbane Atmosphere

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
JOSIAH B. VENTER does not remember exactly what year it was, but he will never forget the moment. Strolling past Sprague Memorial Hall at Yale University one day, Mr. Venter heard a whirl of jazz notes drifting from the auditorium. He poked his head into the doorway only to discover Duke Ellington himself leading a music seminar for some Yale grad students. Mr. Venter stole upstairs to the balcony, took a seat and treated himself to an unexpected afternoon with a jazz giant.
Mr. Ellington has long since passed on, but Mr. Venter, 55, still tells that story to illustrate why he feels so passionate about life in New Haven. An investment manager for Ingalls & Snyder in Manhattan, Mr. Venter endures a two-and-a-half hour commute so he can stay in New Haven, the city he adopted back in the 70's. "I find it to be a very diversified and interesting community, particularly intellectually," said Mr. Venter, who lives near Edgerton Park, north of downtown in the fashionable East Rock corridor. 
 And he has learned to incorporate his commuting time into his workday by doing all his work-related reading between stops. "I've probably come up with some of my best investment ideas on the train," he said. "No phone calls, no interruptions."
New Haven is the next best thing to New York for many people who cannot afford Manhattan prices but favor an urbane atmosphere. As the home of four institutions of higher education -- Yale being the most prominent in the city center -- New Haven offers some of the finest museums, theater performances and overall selection of cultural opportunities in Connecticut.
But over the last decade, community leaders have struggled mightily to convince outsiders that New Haven is a worthwhile investment. An old industrial center that is still struggling to remake itself, New Haven is a poor city on average, as evidenced by the abandoned and neglected houses that scar some neighborhoods. The city's real estate market, which hit the skids in the late 80's, has only recently recovered from a serious glut of properties.
"New Haven had some serious price depreciation due to overbuilding of condos and overspeculation in multifamily housing," said Gregory Scott, president of the Beazley Company Realtors and of the Greater New Haven Association of Realtors. "But now, all of the condo market has been absorbed, with no new development coming on. And multifamily housing has come back in favor as owner-occupied housing, which has helped to stabilize neighborhoods."
The combination of local revitalization initiatives and a strong economy has revived interest in New Haven in the last couple of years. Yale, after years of maintaining a lofty detachment from city concerns, has assumed a greater responsibility for shoring up the neighborhoods that surround its campus. A Yale homebuyers' program offers incentives to faculty members and other employees to purchase homes in designated areas of the city. More important still is Yale's new willingness to link its biotech researchers with commercial interests, thereby stimulating $800 million in private investment in New Haven in the past 18 months.
"Right now, there's a conscious awareness of the competitive advantages in our economy," said Mayor John DeStefano Jr., who is serving his fourth term in office. "They flow out of Yale, and particularly the school of medicine at Yale, which is a powerful engine for biomedical start-ups."
REAL estate prices are beginning to reflect this newfound confidence, particularly in the East Rock corridor, neighborhoods convenient to Yale and the downtown area. Demand for rentals is also rising in the downtown area. Last year, a city-commissioned study of the downtown housing market reported occupancy rates of at least 95 percent at most rental properties in or near downtown. Monthly rents range from about $400 for studios to more than $1,800 a month for three- or four-bedroom apartments.
Lyn Caliendo was pleasantly surprised to discover this year just how far the market had come after her neighbor's three-bedroom town house on Orange Street in the East Rock corridor sold for $250,000. That price was $100,000 more than Ms. Caliendo paid less than three years ago for a similar town house in the same complex.
Ms. Caliendo reluctantly moved to New Haven from Oceanside, N.Y., in 1989. But after her divorce in 1997, she chose to stay in New Haven rather than move closer to New York City, where she works as a development director for the New York Junior Tennis League. New Haven's relatively manageable size has made it easy for her to get to know people, she said. And many of the people she has met through her volunteer work for Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the Anti-Defamation League and Meals on Wheels are now familiar faces at the fine Italian groceries, delicatessens and restaurants she frequents on Orange Street.
Orange Street's Old World flair is also characteristic of Wooster Square, an historic park surrounded by flowering cherry trees and stately brick homes built by the industrialists who made New Haven a manufacturing center for hardware, rifles and carriages throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Once predominantly Italian-American, the neighborhood is still home to a number of Italian restaurants, including two renowned pizza shops, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana and Sally's Apizza, which maintain a friendly rivalry for best pizza status in a city that claims to have introduced pizza to the United States.
New Haven's most exclusive neighborhoods include the St. Ronan Street-Prospect Hill area in East Rock, and Westville, home of United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Prices have risen considerably in these areas in the last couple of years, and inventory is extremely low. Only four properties were considered active listings in the East Rock corridor in mid-October, according to Julia Gelbart, a sales associate with the H. Pearce Company.
"On what is considered the best block on Livingston Street -- the block facing East Rock Park -- three houses sold last summer in the $700,000 range," she said.
The St. Ronan-Prospect Hill area is given added prominence by the presence of Albertus Magnus College and Yale Divinity School. Houses tend to be large and architecturally distinct. Neighbors often congregate at Edgerton Park, a 22-acre gardenlike retreat that features walking trails, stables for the city's mounted police and summertime performances of Shakespeare.
Broad lawns and a mix of ranches, multifamilies and elegant older homes give Westville a more suburban feel. Westville is the preferred neighborhood for many Yale-New Haven Hospital physicians, said Louise Tatro, a sales associate with the Beazley Company. Sales prices in Westville this year have ranged from $89,900 to $369,000, though larger properties generally sell in the $400,000 to $500,000 range, Ms. Tatro said.
The Beaver Hills neighborhood, adjacent to the campus of Southern Connecticut State University, is growing in popularity. Developed in the early 20th century, Beaver Hills homes are generally priced from $180,000 to $300,000, though smaller houses can be had for under $100,000. "There are some fine homes here that just need work," Ms. Gelbart said.
The city's 48 public schools face the usual challenges associated with high-poverty populations. But new accountability and remediation measures within the schools are beginning to help overall scores on the state's standardized tests, according to Dr. Eleanor Osborne, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction.
In 1999, the New Haven school district was the first in the state to implement mandatory summer school for third-graders not reading at grade level. Students who fail to improve by summer's end must repeat third grade. Last summer, "after five weeks of intensive instruction, 85 percent of our kids in summer school demonstrated enough improvement to move on to the next grade," Dr. Osborne said. The policy was extended to fifth graders this year.
A Saturday academy is open to all students who need extra help on their reading, writing and math skills. A homework hotline provides after-school help by phone.
The district has 15 magnet schools, six of which are interdistrict schools attracting some 800 students from surrounding suburbs. Admission can be quite competitive at some of the most popular magnets, which include an aquaculture school, arts-infused high school and elementary school, and a career-focused high school.
AVERAGE SAT scores last year were 416 for verbal, and 399 for math; state averages were 508 for verbal and 509 for math. Eighty-one percent of the 724 graduating seniors in eight high schools planned to go on to college.
Among the many private schools in Greater New Haven is Hopkins, in the Westville area. Hopkins is a co-ed day school serving about 640 students in grades 7 to 12. Tuition is $17,200.
Shopping in New Haven is somewhat limited, as the city's downtown retail center has struggled to compete with regional malls and discount stores. Just last month, the 113-year-old Yale Co-op closed its doors in the ailing Chapel Square Mall. Mayor DeStefano has thrown his administration's support behind a controversial plan by New England Development of Newton, Mass., and the Fusco Corporation of New Haven to build a $500 million, 1.2 million-square-foot mall at Long Wharf on New Haven Harbor. That project has been stalled by lawsuits filed by Westfield America, which owns three malls in the New Haven area.
New Haven's cultural and entertainment options are plentiful and varied, ranging from the Pilot Pen women's tennis tournament to the Long Wharf Theater to the legendary rock club, Toad's Place.
The annual International Festival of Arts and Ideas is a showcase for the city, having grown into a 17-day summer extravaganza that this year attracted 165,000 people, more than half of whom were from outside of New Haven and its suburbs, according to festival officials. The Metropolitan Opera's outdoor performance of "Madama Butterfly" on the historic New Haven Green was this year's high point. But the largest audience-grabber was a performance by Kool and the Gang -- an estimated 33,000 people swarmed the green for that show.
Paul Collard, the festival's director, credits the festival with helping to improve the local real estate market by raising the city's profile. It wasn't a difficult task, he observed, given that New Haven had an arts infrastructure already in place. "I had to make New Haven work," he added. "When I arrived in 1997, I was quoted in the papers saying, 'It should be as easy as turning on a light.' And it has been."

THE KING KILLERS: Founded in 1638 by the Rev. John Davenport and 500 fellow Puritans, New Haven began as a religious refuge. But in the 1660's, the colony also served as a political refuge for two English judges wanted by King Charles II. In 1649, the king's father, King Charles I, had been dethroned, convicted of treason by the High Court of Justice and beheaded. Among the 59 men who signed the king's death warrant were Col. Edward Whalley and his son-in-law, William Goffe. The two regicide judges fled to Boston after Charles II took the throne but eventually moved into Davenport's home in New Haven. When officers for the king came looking for the regicides in 1661, the men were hidden in a cave atop West Rock in New Haven. They stayed in hiding, moving from one place to another, for the next three years, returning to the cave for a second stay in 1664. They were never caught. Their hideout, now known as Judges' Cave, can be visited at West Rock Ridge State Park, off Wintergreen Avenue.

HEADLINE: Few Lobsters, and Now, Fewer Lobstermen

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
BOB SPONG, 60, has been a lobsterman on Long Island Sound all his life. But last March, when he thought the lobster population might never recover, he decided to get what he calls "the first real job" he has ever held. So now he drives a forklift at the Home Depot store in Commack, N.Y. on the lobster shift -- what else? -- from 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.
"The idea was then I could still go fishing during the day," Mr. Spong said. He kept his 1,000 lobster traps in the water through the spring. But instead of hauling in 900 lobsters a day, as he and other lobstermen had when the sound was flush, he rarely brought in more than 40 a day, barely enough to pay for the trip. 
 "I worried about it for months, but I finally made the decision to take the traps out," Mr. Spong said. "There just wasn't enough signs to stay in." He still goes out on his 42-foot boat about once a week to fish for blackfish, but he doesn't expect to make much money from that. He does it just to be out on the water.
Today, of the 20 lobstermen who used to fish out of Northport, N.Y., Mr. Spong's home port, only five or six are still fishing for lobster regularly, and many of them have also taken part-time jobs to help make ends meet. Some 7,000 lobster traps sit in neat piles at the foot of the old town dump in Huntington, N.Y., where town officials have allowed lobstermen to store their unused gear. Mr. Spong checks on his traps every now and then and said that the number of fishermen bringing in their equipment grows each week.
Further west in the Sound, in Glen Cove, N.Y. to the south and Greenwich to the north, there are virtually no lobsters left and consequently no fishermen either. The situation steadily improves heading eastward, so that at the easternmost tip of the North Fork of Long Island, fishermen are reporting that things appear almost normal, state officials said.
Lobstermen and state officials said the good news is that lobsters do not appear to be dying off, as they had been a year ago, but the bad news is that there are many fewer lobsters being caught and virtually no signs of lobsters in the western Sound.
Officials in New York and Connecticut do not have statistics showing how hard the lobster industry was hit last year or how the industry is faring now. But officials said that informal surveys of lobsterman suggest that the lobster haul in the central part of the Sound is still off by more than 50 percent and down by about 30 percent as far east as Mattituck, N.Y.
"It's a stark difference from the way it had been prior to the die-off when there were record-high harvests," said Gordon C. Colvin, the director of marine resources for the New York State Department of Economic Conservation.
According to the latest figures available from the National Marine Fisheries Service, 1998 was the peak year in Connecticut, with 3.7 million pounds caught, worth $12.1 million. Preliminary figures from Connecticut officials show that in 1999, the haul dropped to 2.5 million pounds, worth about $9.2 million.
In New York, the industry hit a peak in 1996, with 9.4 million pounds caught, worth nearly $33 million, and stayed strong through 1998, with 8.5 million pounds worth $29.8 million.
"The only thing that's encouraging is that we have not heard that they're dying in the central sound this fall, and most lobsters seem to be healthy," Mr. Colvin said. "But it's difficult to forecast what might happen, especially in the western sound where there are no young lobsters at all."
Lobstermen and officials agreed that given the current circumstances, it will take at least four to five years -- the time it takes for young lobsters to grow to one-pound size, the minimum for legal harvesting -- for the lobster industry in Long Island Sound to recover.
But if what happened to the scallop industry in Peconic Bay on Long Island is any indication, the lobstermen have little to look forward to. The scallops there were decimated in 1985 when a sudden bloom of algae known as brown tide starved and killed them. The industry has yet to recover fully. Scallops rebounded briefly in 1994, but another bloom of brown tide hit the following year. And despite years of surveys and research, officials have been unable to determine what causes brown tide to appear or how to control it.
It's unclear how many fewer lobster fishermen there are actually fishing this year. The number of licenses issued is down by 20 percent in New York, from 746 in 1999 to only 587 this year, and down by 8 percent in Connecticut, from 419 in 1999 to 386 this year. But officials in both states suspect that many fishermen have kept their licenses but are not actively fishing.
"The people who have stayed seem to be fishing less gear," said Eric M. Smith, the assistant director of marine fisheries for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. "The number of lobster pots out there has been down." Officials estimated there were more than 500,000 lobster traps in the sound last year, but will not know how many there are this year until fisherman submit their tallies at the end of the year.
Lobstermen are very close-mouthed about how much they make. But when Mr. Spong and his friends reminisce about the days of good lobstering, they talk about bringing in between 900 and 1,500 pounds in one day, which means roughly $3,000 to $5,000 in revenue. In the years of plentiful harvests, the summer high season would often run more than two months.
"It was a tough but nice way to earn a living," said Larry Eberhardt, a good friend of Mr. Spong's who now also works at Home Depot. He said the months of April and May would be busy, followed by a slow June when lobsters shed their shells, and then followed again by another busy two to three months.
Marcel Cormier, one of the few fishermen still tending lobster traps out of Northport, estimated that his lobstering income this year will drop by 90 percent. He said that there have been days when he has checked 400 of his 1,000 traps, only to come back with 30 lobsters. The only way for a lobsterman to survive this year, he said, is "to have a wife with a good job."
Faced with last year's catastrophic die-off, in the western sound, last summer the federal government approved $3.6 million in direct aid to lobstermen in New York and another $3.6 million for Connecticut, but the money has yet to be distributed. Mr. Spong estimated that each lobsterman's share would be only $2,000 to $3,000. "Why take it?" he said. "It's not enough to make a difference, and besides we never took help from anybody before."
Officials from both states also are preparing to divide up $6.6 million in federal research dollars to study causes of the lobster deaths. A research team at the University of Connecticut found last November that a parasite had killed the lobsters but has been awaiting further financing for research to determine what might have weakened the lobsters' immune systems enough to make them susceptible to the parasite. The parasite in question is a paramoeba, a tiny, one-celled protozoa that targets the lobster's nervous system and destroys nerve tissue.
Many lobstermen have a different view. Blaming the die-off on last year's pesticide spraying to kill mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, about 1,100 lobsterman from Long Island Sound have filed a lawsuit against five pesticide manufacturers, seeking $125 million in damages. But scientific researchers have been skeptical of the pesticide theory, noting that while the lobster die-off peaked last fall, it began last summer, long before pesticide spraying began.
Other possible causes include last year's unusually warm water temperatures, which were generated by tropical storms that moved through the area and brought in large amounts of warm freshwater, and lobster overcrowding, which might have contributed to the epidemic.
The State University of New York at Stony Brook recently received $1 million in state money to create a pathology laboratory so lobsters will no longer have to be shipped to Connecticut, Virginia and Arizona for autopsies.
Jack Mattice, the director of New York Sea Grant, which will coordinate the research with Connecticut Sea Grant and other agencies from both states, said that because it's likely that there were multiple causes for the die-off, the federally funded research would try to cover all the possibilities. The research money also will be used to study causes for shell disease, which has struck mainly in the waters off of Montauk and Fishers Island, N.Y.. Shell disease does not kill lobsters, but leaves their shells eroded and pitted and thus unappealing for the lobster market.
But for fishermen like Mr. Spong, the fruits of the research will come too late.
"The lobsters won't be back in my lifetime," Mr. Spong said with resignation.
Mr. Spong and his friend, Mr. Eberhardt, often scour the ads in fishing magazines looking for a boat with a license for offshore lobster fishing. But those bigger, more powerful boats run between $400,000 and $500,000, significantly more than the $50,000 to $150,000 that a fisherman in the Sound spends on his boat.
"We dream," said Mr. Spong. "But we don't know if we have what it takes at this stage of the game. Off-shore fishing is a young man's game, because you're far out there and you've got to fight the sea."

HEADLINE: Factory Is Reborn in a Once Busy Valley

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS

 BODY:
IN 1983, when the Seth Thomas clock factory closed for good in the Naugatuck Valley town of Thomaston, the workers from the plant carried a bier bearing an elegant mantel clock through the streets in a mock funeral. Then they burned it -- a measure of their contempt for a company that was no longer owned by the family that gave Thomaston its name, but had been bought by a multinational conglomerate and then shut down.
The 1980's marked the de-industrialization of the Naugatuck River Valley, which had been one of the "most industrialized places on Earth", according to the Connecticut historian Jeremy Brecher. Factories were built throughout the 19th century all along the river, which provided water power and a convenient way to dispose of wastes. The valley had been the worldwide center of the brass industry, with factories like Plume & Atwood turning out brass parts for Seth Thomas timepieces. But in the last quarter of the 20th century the factories closed down, leaving thousands of workers jobless, the Naugatuck River polluted and the land on which the factories sat contaminated by toxic chemicals. 
 But now factories in the valley are being revived.
In May, an old factory started up brass production again after the hard work of many people.
In 1993, churches, unions and community groups in the Naugatuck Valley organized the Naugatuck Valley Project. The primary goal, said Mr. Brecher, was to use the techniques of community organizing to save jobs and create new ones. Working with local, state and federal government officials, the project helped create the Naugatuck Valley Brownfields Pilot in 1996. Its goal is to clean up the estimated 100 brownfields sites -- abandoned factory properties with known or suspected contaminants such as mercury, solvents, or petroleum products in the soil, or asbestos or lead-based paint on buildings -- in the valley and make them productive manufacturing or commercial sites again. The pilot serves the towns of Ansonia, Beacon Falls, Derby, Naugatuck, Oxford, Seymour, Shelton, Thomaston, Waterbury and Watertown.
The pilot has received more than $350,000 from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to do assessments on 16 sites. The agency just awarded the Pilot another $350,000 to create a revolving loan fund to actually begin cleaning up the sites.
No one keeps precise records of the number of shuttered factories in Connecticut that have reopened for manufacturing or commerce, either through a brownfields remediation program or otherwise. But Arthur Bogen, technical consultant to the Naugatuck Valley Brownfields Pilot, said there are at least 30. Some examples are the old American Thread complex in Windham, which has reopened as Windham Mills, housing several light industries; Carpenter Steel mill in Bridgeport, which now builds high-speed ferries, and the Susan Bates mill in Chester, which produced knitting needles and now has been subdivided into several manufacturing concerns.
A few months ago in Thomaston, a dozen employees at American Unibrass began producing welded brass tubing at the old Plume & Atwood factory, built in 1852. The tubing is then made into plumbing fixtures, furniture and decorative railings.
The old Plume & Atwood factory occupies more than 200,000 square feet; about a quarter of it is currently cleaned up and operational. On a recent afternoon, two visitors were able to walk through the plant and converse in normal tones, except when industrial vacuums began forcing pressurized air through the tubing to clean out any leftover brass particles; then it sounded like an airport runway. The floors were clean; the air was clean; the machinery was clean. There was no dust or oily smell.
Jay Horowitz, the owner of American Unibrass, had been leasing space in the Plume & Atwood building and recently bought it from a previous owner who had used some state funding to begin the clean-up. Mr. Horowitz said even though he got no financial incentives from Thomaston to locate there, he did it for sentimental reasons -- to bring brass production back to its roots. The raw materials are made at a plant he owns in Buffalo. He also owns a second company at another site in Thomaston, that produces smaller diameter metal tubing, mostly for musical instruments.
Mr. Horowitz said he is working with the State Department of Economic and Community Development and the Department of Environment Protection to clean up the Plume & Atwood site. It's a phased clean-up.
"I signed off on a remedial action plan," he said. "I'm personally liable for the clean-up. I wouldn't want myself or my employees breathing in dust or chemicals or anything else hazardous from legal, health or productivity points of view. It's a closed-loop system, nothing is discharged into the river. The Naugatuck has fish in it and we plan to keep it that way."
The Naugatuck Valley Project worked to get an environmental evaluation of the site and found it to be less contaminated than was earlier feared. There are no toxic materials in much of the plant, or in the soil beneath those sections. The oils and sludge under one part of the building will be encapsulated and left in place as part of the clean-up.
However, between one of the buildings and the river is a so-called hot spot where nothing will grow. The soil there is going to be further tested. Mr. Horowitz is considering donating this parcel to the town as a park if it can be cleaned up.
Rick Rice, a local insurance salesman and the chairman of the Thomaston Brownfields Committee of the Naugatuck Valley Project said the group is interested in that site.
"We would like to find a way to take that property, clean it up and turn it into a green space along the river," Mr. Rice said.
Now that factories no longer spew pollution directly into the river, and Torrington built a sophisticated sewage treatment plant upriver, the Naugatuck at Thomaston is clean enough to be used for recreation, Mr. Rice said. Mr. Rice said a canoe launch might be nice at that spot. But to make that happen the hot spot would have to be restored to a "clean" standard, which is more stringent than the industrial standard that the rest of the property must meet to be used for manufacturing.
Mr. Rice calls his committee "just a bunch of citizens who wanted to get the community involved and let them know what the risks were at the Plume & Atwood site and how it could be fixed and what would be the effects on the community -- whether water-borne, air-borne, gas or noxious fumes."
The Brownfields Pilot provided $65,000 to the Thomaston Brownfields Committee to have the Plume & Atwood site evaluated. Mr. Rice said once the final survey is complete, if Mr. Horowitz agrees with the final remediation plan, then Mr. Horowitz and the E.P.A. will sign a "covenant not to sue" which will enable him to get bank loans to clean up more of the site.
Mr. Bogen said brownfields remediation is a complicated issue.
"It takes a lot of players to make it happen," he said. "It takes motivated municipalities; it takes the pilot to provide management skills and a way to solve the problems; it takes the state and the federal government to provide money for assessments."
Mary Benedict, a retired social worker from Thomaston, agrees. She became a charter member of the Naugatuck Valley Project in 1983.
"We were the first to focus on brownfields," she said. "Our committee began focusing on Plume & Atwood in 1994. It's a slow process."
The historian Jeremy Brecher said the de-industrialization of the Valley "is part of a huge phenomenon called globalization. That process has left abandoned industrial properties in the hearts of cities. Brownfields development is not a mass solution to globalization. It's more an indication of a positive direction."

HEADLINE: After a 40-Year Layoff, a Return to the Pool

BYLINE: By DONNA CORNACHIO

 BODY:
CHARLES J. URSTADT has lived his life according to the "sink or swim" maxim -- but in his case, he's always swum.
In high school, he won the New York City High School Championships three years in a row. At Dartmouth College, where he was captain of the swim team, he was All-American for two years. 
 Then, for more than 40 years, Mr. Urstadt, a Bronxville resident, concentrated on making a name for himself in another kind of fast lane. He became known as a can-do person in the field of housing and urban renewal. As chairman of the Battery Park City Authority, he turned 100 acres of landfill into six million square feet of commercial, residential and recreational space. He was also state commissioner of housing and community renewal.
Now at 72, he has returned to competitive swimming. In August, he became world Masters champion swimmer for the 50-meter breaststroke in the 70 to 75 age group.
"Water is an element I feel comfortable in," he said simply.
During all the years he had focused on business and government, Mr. Urstadt had remained active.
"I played paddle tennis and squash, ran and swam on my own," he said. "Once you get into the habit of exercising, you miss it, you really do."
On Thanksgiving in 1998, soon after Mr. Urstadt's 70th birthday, his son-in-law, Willing Biddle, an active swimmer himself, suggested he consider Masters swimming. And Mr. Urstadt's dormant competitive swimmer's instinct was revived.
The United States Masters Swimming is an organization of 37,000 swimmers who swim competitively within their age groups. At the time, Mr. Urstadt realized he would be among the youngest in his age group. In February 1999, he entered his first race at the Westport Y.M.C.A. He quickly became aware of how much things had changed in 40 years.
"I had to get up on a platform to start," he recalled. "The last time I had raced, I had started from the side of the pool. I must have hesitated, because the starter said, 'Can I help you up, sir?' "
With his grandchildren cheering, "Go, Gramps, go!" Mr. Urstadt plunged into the water and won the 50-yard breast stroke in 39 seconds. The next race he entered he won again, and the one after that, each time shaving a second or two off his previous time.
Of the 22 Masters races he has entered since returning to competitive swimming, Mr. Urstadt has won 21. He became the National Breast Stroke Champion and All-American in both the 1999 and 2000 United States Masters Swimming competitions. In August, he won the 2000 World Masters Championship title in Munich for the 50-meter breast stroke, beating out 28 swimmers in his age group. "With 20 yards to go, I really poured it on," Mr. Urstadt said.
And how did it feel to win?
"While I'm swimming," he said, "I'm thinking about hitting the water right, about making the turns, about coordinating my arms and legs together. When I win a race, it's not so much a thrill as a sense of satisfaction."
That attitude makes Mr. Urstadt a pleasure to train, said Nick Cavataro, the swimming coach at Iona College in New Rochelle. (Mr. Urstadt also swims daily at Arrowwood Conference Center in Rye Brook.) "Charlie's got great breast stroke technique and terrific legs," Mr. Cavataro said. "More than that, he has great motivation and takes direction and works it into his stroke."
Mr. Urstadt acknowledges that his competitor's instinct has served him equally well in business as in the lap lanes.
He is chairman and chief executive officer of Urstadt Biddle Properties in Greenwich, a real estate investment trust, which owns and manages strip malls in Fairfield, Westchester and Putnam Counties. Much of the day-to-day operation of the company is delegated to Mr. Biddle, who is the chief operating officer. Though he's not considering retiring, Mr. Urstadt says he's now enjoying being able to coast.
"It's like swimming: you have to know when to sprint and when not to sprint," he said. "You learn how to conserve so you can concentrate on what's in front of you."

HEADLINE: Bronx Is in the Name. Drums Are Their Game. P.S. They're French

BYLINE: By LESLIE KANDELL

 BODY:
THE following concert program is rated PG-13: it contains 17 brawny guys with bare arms, pummeling oil drums in violent rhythms, with pickaxes. Although there is no profanity (unless it's in French) one cannot ignore the yelling, or the smashing oilcans. Onsite earplugs are available to the audience at no charge.
Here, here, what's all this? A variant palliative for aggression? A dream evening for the hearing-challenged? Intrepid listeners will have a chance to find out next Sunday when Les Tambours du Bronx, an unusual drumming group from France, muscles into Stony Brook on its first North American tour. 
 To the extent that the culture of hip-hop is about rebellion, this event is a species of hip-hop -- that is, the antithesis of the classical music concert form. If there is an expected appropriate attire, the drummers of Les Tambours don't wear it. As to performing on valuable heirloom instruments: they don't play standard instruments at all, and regularly destroy what they do play on. Quiet, a concert hall norm, is a joke. Even the Bronx reference is a joke.
The men, who no longer have to hold day jobs -- if they ever had them -- come from the outskirts of Nevers, an industrial town in central France known for repairing trains, and also as the resting place of Bernadette of Lourdes, whose body is preserved under a glass bubble, reportedly as fresh as ever. Before Les Tambours was founded in 1987, its members were friends who met to drink at a place in Nevers called the Broadway Bar. Some were students, some had jobs, some were unemployed, but none were musicians. Their little jest, as their evenings at the Broadway Bar ended, was that they were going back home to the Bronx.
According to the group's leader, Ludovic Le Mapihan (known as Map), they got their shot at performing during the city's annual festival of movie shorts.
"We wanted to make a small performance, but we were not sure what," said Map. (The telephone conversation is translated from an ad hoc mixture of French and English, representing a genuine dual effort.) "We had no money, but because Nevers is a city for train repairs, 55-gallon barrels were easy to find free."
They performed 20 minutes at the festival, got all fired up and decided to go to any nearby festival, invited or not. "We played in the street," said Map. "Presenters liked us and we began to be invited."
True to its perverse form, the all-male group, now aged 25 to 42, named its first commercial recording "Silence." It's anything but, though the label name, Naive, is more like it. The rhythms are clean, repetitive in the marching band sense, and seductive but acceptable, probably, to even to the most mannered listener. "Bombast and unity" said one reviewer. Not bad.
Nothing about their performance is gentrified. Some numbers have added clapping or whistling, while in others, oil barrel clangor is augmented by groans, howls and snorts. The recording's final number, "Etouffez la Ventoline" (a title chosen for rhythm rather than meaning) has unintelligible words that might be broadcast over a railroad station loudspeaker.
Comparing Les Tambours to Japan's Kodo Drummers, Map acknowledged the similar visceral effect, and then said: "Our rhythm is very basic. It goes directly to your body. Our instruments are different in the way we play. We smash very loud. When we finish the show, the instrument is destroyed. You can use both sides of the drum, so, two shows maximum."
The destruction factor is handled through copious supplies: "A big truck follows us, with 400 barrels from France and 4,000 sticks," he said. "We break the sticks. You cannot find the barrels outside of France -- not even in Italy or Germany. They're very thin. With thicker metal, you can hurt yourself." After trying different materials for their pickaxe mallets, they settled on beechwood, because it proved strong enough to survive a concert or two.
Since the drummers can't practice separately, they get together in what Map described as a hangar in the countryside. "We are not musicians," he said. "We play and move our arms a special way. We look for new members in the way we would look for a friend, not a drummer."
In Les Tambours' European performances, there is some interaction with the audience, which Map was not sure was happening on this tour. "We try to talk to the audience," he said, "but our English is not so good. We explain and ask what they think. We know they won't sleep."
Les Tambours du Bronx, Staller Center for the Arts, University at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, Nov. 12, 7 p.m.. 516-632-2787.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/High Technology;
A 500,000-Sq.-Ft. Lease Brings Qwest to Yonkers

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
QWEST COMMUNICATIONS, a supplier of high-capacity telecommunications services, recently agreed to lease a vacant 500,000-square-foot distribution center here and plans to cram it with more than $100 million of computers and other equipment to play host to World Wide Web sites.
The deal encouraged officials of this onetime industrial city, who have been seeking ways to participate in the new economy in the wake of the departure of much of the manufacturing activity that once defined the city. 
 "This is the biggest real estate transaction in Westchester in many years," said John D. Spencer, the mayor of Yonkers. "And it happened without any tax abatements or incentives. They will pay full-rate taxes."
Mr. Spencer said he hoped the presence of the high-technology company would be an inducement for other Web-based businesses to locate nearby. "This is a signal from the corporate world that this is a good location to do business," he said.
Yonkers was once home to the Otis elevator division of United Technologies and numerous carpet mills that have since closed. Like many postindustrial cities in the Midwest, among them Cleveland and Detroit, the city has rediscovered its waterfront and is promoting residential development along the banks of the Hudson River and a $12.5 million waterfront park.
Phil Amicone, the deputy mayor, said construction is to begin on two towers in the waterfront area, costing $150 million to $200 million, before the end of the year. He said they would include about 300 residential units plus retail and office space. In addition, an old trolley barn in the waterfront area is to be converted to residences, and city officials are talking about speedy ferry service from the town dock to the Wall Street area.
Qwest officials emphasized the building's location, half a mile from the region's optical fiber backbone, which is along the right of way of the New York State Thruway.
They also noted that it was ready for the necessary remodeling, an important factor in a business that is developing so rapidly that the time it would take to build a new facility could cost a company an important slice of market share.
Qwest is acquiring and equipping Web hosting facilities, which it calls "cybercenters," as fast as it can. "We are in 11 sites now and we expect to do three more by the end of the year," said John V. McGuire, the company's vice president for real estate. "And we will do 10 more over the next 18 months."
Michael Harnum, the company's director of marketing, said the scramble for market share is being driven by big numbers. "Projections are that Web hosting will be an $11 billion business by 2002," he said. "A company with a 30 percent share is talking about a $3 billion-$4 billion slice of business."
He said the business is expected to grow that rapidly because many new entrants to the Internet economy are not equipped or not inclined to get into the hardware and telecommunications end of the business. "If someone has an idea for an online business, they can either execute the idea or try to become a telephone company," he said. "Most do not want to be telephone companies, and that has become a key shift in the market."
Although the building, at 555 Tuckahoe Road, was used most recently as a distribution site for Saks Fifth Avenue, it was originally built for Western Electric, the equipment manufacturing arm of the old AT&T Corporation. As a result it comes with its own electrical substation and space to install backup generators.
BECAUSE businesses operating over the Web need to be available continuously -- 24/7/365 in the industry argot -- companies in the Web hosting business are most attentive to the importance of a power supply and suspicious of the ability of a deregulated industry to supply it reliably.
"Power grids in the United States are old, patched and at capacity," Mr. McGuire said. "It is good that there is power at the site and we will expand that. This is a very big deal for us."
Although the owner of the building, Alfred Weissman, had initially hoped to develop it as a site for retail stores, Yonkers officials objected because of potential traffic congestion along Tuckahoe Road, and Mr. Weissman would have required a zoning change to do a retail development. "This area is not zoned for retail, so we said to Al, 'Find a better use for the property,' " Mr. Spencer said.
Telecommunications and Web hosting buildings basically house many machines and very few people, so the Qwest tenancy should add only a few cars to the local traffic.
Area brokers said that as a telecommunications center, the building could command annual rents well in excess of a distribution center, although perhaps not as high as retail.
"I have heard of rents in the range of $25 a square foot for these telecom centers, compared to about $10 a square foot for distribution," said Dean J. Shapiro, executive director of the Westchester-Connecticut office of Insignia/ESG, the brokerage and services company.
Mr. McGuire said one of the attractions of the Yonkers location was its proximity to Manhattan, but with much lower operating costs. Average office rents in Manhattan have soared above $55 a square foot, according to a report by Williams Real Estate, a brokerage and services company active in the Manhattan market.
Qwest recently leased space at 32 Avenue of the Americas, a former AT&T long distance headquarters that Rudin Management purchased last year and is converting into a center for multiple telecommunications companies. Mr. Harnum explained that the Manhattan site was intended for switching of calls while the Yonkers building was to be devoted to Web hosting.
Although both involve telecommunications, the company considers them different lines of business, he said.
Alan Weissman, vice president of Alfred Weissman Real Estate, which is named for his father, said Qwest has signed a 25-year lease on the building. He said the company came "out of the blue" early last summer and had agreed to a lease by July.
QWEST, he said, had some demanding requirements for the building, mainly related to preventing any danger of water damage to its delicate equipment. Among them were a new roof devoid of stacks and other penetrations, and the removal of boilers and pipes on the interior.
Qwest expects to begin operations in the building early next year.
Mr. Weissman said the length of the lease indicated Qwest's commitment to the area and said his company has had inquiries from other Internet-related operations that wanted to be near the $17-billion-a-year telecommunications giant.
Mr. Shapiro said the deal may help the city to remake its image, which has remained blue collar as the rest of Westchester has become the home of corporate headquarters and professional firms. "Yonkers has operated outside the norm for Westchester, but this could help redefine itself as high tech," he said.
City officials say they are working hard to make it a friendly place for technology companies, including cutting through the sometimes sluggish process of getting approvals.
"Qwest had a single request, and that was that it get a building permit quickly," said Mr. Amicone, the deputy mayor. "We did everything by the book, but we got it done in six days."
He said the city is prepared to extend similar treatment to other businesses.

HEADLINE: Retreating to Artists' Towns

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
IN Brownsville, Vt., Dick Bullard was just leaving to go home, locking up the old farmhouse he has been using for his real estate office ever since he quit the Boston banking business 24 years ago. Visitors driving down the main road had been attracted by the sign announcing the Bullard Real Estate Company, a blue and white placard with the simple word "Duck" hanging right under it.
Did the extra sign mean that Mr. Bullard, 82, was also a hunting guide? "No," he replied, with that North Country glint in his eye. "It means you should duck before you walk into the sign." 
 Like Mr. Bullard's sign, Brownsville offers a quirky welcome. It's a mixture of the down home -- there's the famous (at least as far as neighboring Windsor) baked bean suppers held at the Grange hall, not to mention the dances at the town hall -- and the artistic. Brownsville is one of the smaller villages that surround Cornish, only a few minutes across the New Hampshire border, a scenic environment that has drawn artists since Maxfield Parrish and Augustus Saint-Gaudens settled here before the turn of the century.
This is a part of New England that's off the predictable charm-and-skiing track, the track that leads to Stowe and to Woodstock, which isn't exactly a skiing village but, ever since the Rockefellers discovered it, is certainly high on charm -- and real estate prices.
To find appealing second homes in all price ranges -- but with an eye to a bargain -- the autumn and winter vacation househunter might head to the towns in Vermont, New Hampshire and Connecticut that artists have long been attracted to. The scenery can't be topped, and, in some cases at least, there are still bargains to be found. And while prices here are climbing, according to George Ballantyne, who oversees the Northeast for Sotheby's International Realty, they have a long way to go before they reach the levels found on such celebrity-strewn islands as Nantucket and Mount Desert in Maine.
In Weathersfield, Vt., for instance, a small shingled 1910 hunting lodge at the end of a long dirt road just went under contract for close to its $198,000 asking price -- and 82 acres along with it.
An hour to the southeast in Peterborough, N.H., a village full of shops with names like The Friend of a Gardener, there are a handful of 18th and 19th century houses for sale for under $100,000. Not far away, another house, considerably higher ($539,000), comes with walls in the master bedroom that were stenciled by Moses Eaton, an itinerant artist who applied his craft to New England homes in the early part of the 19th century.
And the bustling village streets are, increasingly, what the house-hunting city-dweller is seeking. More and more often, local real estate agents say, buyers looking for weekend retreats are deciding they want to live in plain sight: on Main Street or along a village green.
Real estate brokers say that in the past, city people -- be they from Manhattan or Mamaroneck -- usually wanted a weekend house that was totally isolated, on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere, full of blessed relief from the incessant traffic noise and jostling of metropolitan thoroughfares.
Four years ago, Heather Peterson, president of The Petersons Real Estate, told a reporter that she had a hard time selling a village house to a New Yorker. "Some don't mind buying a stately Colonial on a village green," she said, "but only if every house on the green is a stately Colonial." In Vermont and New Hampshire, she said then, "We have rich people and poor people and a lot of times, especially in town, they live right next to each other."
But a few weeks ago, she told a reporter returning to Peterborough that things had changed -- and brokers in several parts of New England agreed. While the majority of those seeking vacation homes still seek the uber-rural, there is a growing faction that likes "walking to the post office, to shops, to the general store," she said.
Besides the charm of village living, there may be other, more pragmatic, reasons for the trend.
"Twenty years ago, we were all in our 20's and 30's, and we wanted the rural adventure," said Joseph L. Carini, of Wheeler & Taylor Real Estate in the Berkshires town of Great Barrington, Mass. "Now we're in our 50's, and we want to be closer to shops and galleries -- and hospitals."
FOR house prospectors interested in the arts, of course, nothing is artsier than the Berkshires and the Hamptons, where Eric Fischl, David Salle and Julian Schnabel still own homes and where old timers still remember Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. But, especially in the Hamptons, there is not a lot of room left for struggling sculptors or painters. There are currently two Main Street Colonial-era houses in East Hampton for sale: one for $4 million and one for $2.9 million. An attractive bungalow south of the Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton just went for $775,000, with three people bidding.
In the Berkshires, realtors are offering the former Norman Rockwell Museum, a hipped roof, two-chimney, 14-room mansion in the center of Stockbridge for $875,000. (The new Rockwell museum opened at another site in Stockbridge in 1993.)
In nearby Lenox, within walking distance of Tanglewood, is a sprawling Victorian farmhouse with six bedrooms and three and a half baths as well as a duck pond, small stable and a two-bedroom guest cottage. The price? A cool $1.15 million; not quite East Hampton, but still needing some substantial sales of one's artwork.
So what about some bargains, not only for struggling artists, but for others seeking weekend retreats?
There are still remnants of old artists' colonies in the little towns like Brownsville (population 900) that are clustered around Cornish, N.H., which is just across the state line and home to the Saint-Gaudens Museum (and J. D. Salinger.) "We're not like Woodstock," said Mr. Bullard, the realtor, "where everything's a million dollars."
"The town used to be full of dairy farms, but now it's all horse farms," he said. "The dairy business is a lousy business. You can't make money milking cows."
You can't make money raising horses, either, he added. "It's just a way of spending the money your grandfather made. It's just a fun thing for the crowd coming up here now."
Mr. Bullard got into his Jeep Cherokee and took off for a couple of places for sale on Bible Hill Road, the most expensive street in town. (And incidentally, where he lives himself.) The road is distinguished by one of the town's two covered bridges.
Bible Hill is dotted with horse farms, as well as several new houses and a few extensively made-over 19th century barns and Cape Cods. One property now on the market is one of the latter: a kitchen wing was added several years ago. The house, which sits up off the road and overlooks the grand sweep of the Mount Ascutney, comes with 7.83 acres, asking $350,000, reduced from $399,000. Another 20 acres is available across the road -- an absolute must or you will risk looking at a sea of houses in a few years -- for a total of $475,000.
The problem is that this immaculate house is almost too immaculate; it has been renovated to an inch of its life; every surface, including its blue-painted wide-board floors, gleams. A big barn comes with it. So does a fieldstone terrace out back.
A one-minute walk away is another house, a ranch, nestled down on the mountain side of Bible Hill Road, set farther back from the street. While the almond-colored house probably would not win any architectural awards, the five-acre setting is breathtaking and the price, $285,000, is hard to beat.
Back along a dirt road in the neighboring town of Weathersfield, a hunter's dream house, an entrancing shingled lodge with leaded glass windows on 82 acres, has just gone to contract; the asking price was $198,000 (reduced from $209,000). There is only one drawback: the houses around where you turn into the driveway look a trifle messy -- not as pristine as one could wish for. But there is a gunite swimming pool, even if it does look like something found at an Army base. And look at that icehouse, the real estate agent said: "Isn't that a corker? The workmanship is better than in most homes."
About a half-hour's drive west, Chester, Vt., looks like Vermont's answer to Sag Harbor, N.Y., with its long Main Street lined with galleries and shops and a big white inn with black shutters. This place is awash with artists.
Zena Robinson, a watercolor and collage artist, is a member of two art guilds and estimates there are at least 100 artists around here. "There's a lot of artists here," she said. "I think there is an attitude of you can do anything you want as long as you don't make me do it too." More and more New Yorkers are coming here, she said. "They used to just come to ski, but now it's more year-round outdoor sports like hiking. We've got a short gardening season, but we love to garden."
Philip Atwood of Valley Real Estate said business is booming in Chester. He has made 37 sales so far this year, his best year yet. For urban refugees with a bed-and-breakfast dream: a brick Colonial on 45 acres about two miles out of town is for sale for $499,500 with 5 bedrooms, 10 working fireplaces and a beehive oven. It backs up on the Williams River, good trout fishing "if you know how to fish them," he said.
ANOTHER house, right on Main Street, is an elaborate 1899 Victorian with three porches and two balconies. Within the last two weeks, it went into contract: the asking price was $287,000. Still available is a log cabin on 12 acres, for $125,000.
In Peterborough, N.H. -- about a four-hour drive from New York, a three-hour drive from Boston and a 45-minute drive from Chester -- what had been a dismal railroad depot has become a thriving retail neighborhood. On Columbus Day weekend last month, there was an arts festival, and all the galleries were open, manned by the artists. Michaela Ali-Oglu said Peterborough and the surrounding towns had, within the last five years, become a mecca for artists. When she rented her gallery, its previous occupant had been a television repair shop. "I took a big risk," she said. Property values have grown in this charming town -- which has one of the best antique and used bookstores in New England -- but in spite of that, prices still seem dirt cheap to a city type.
While Peterborough has a fresh-scrubbed feel of a country town of the first rank, home buyers can currently find at least two houses for $50,000 within a 10 minute drive from the center of town. One is a white Cape on two acres, on a scenic road in Francestown, N.H. Taxes are $1,972. One drawback: there's only a wood stove for heat. The other is a big village Colonial that needs everything -- but has frontage on the Contoocook River. That one has a propane stove for heat as well as one bathroom and a shed on a little over half an acre.
At the top end -- and there are lots of fancy houses here -- is a twin chimney 1820 Federal in nearby Hancock, N.H. On seven acres off a gravel road, surrounded by hundreds of acres of the Monadnock Region's protected "supersanctuary." And if that is not tempting enough, there are the (reputed) Moses Eaton stencils -- all for $539,000. (Eaton's own house is for sale too -- but no stencils.)
Then there is the seven-bedroom shingled villa designed by Cummings & Sears, prominent Boston architects before the turn of the century, set on two acres of a Dublin, N.H., hilltop for $345,000. Past owners were part of what was a thriving arts colony there, and the property is right across from the old town commons, which is protected by town ordinance and will always remain open land.
Ms. Peterson and her fellow real estate brokers in Peterborough have lots of cheaper properties too, from an old mill to an unusual group of brick row houses that look as if they could be found in Bath, England. One of these townhouses, completely restored, just sold for $130,000, with three bedrooms and real elegance.
Down in Old Lyme, Conn., a town bordered by both the Connecticut River and the Long Island Sound, there are artists still sprinkled around an area that had been home to the group known as the Old Lyme School -- American Impressionist painters, who included Childe Hassam and Guy Wiggins. Old Lyme has one of New England's most magnificent churches, the Congregational Church, which was itself painted frequently by the town's better known residents, as well as a strikingly beautiful Main Street.
OLD LYME, neighboring Lyme and Essex were hit hard in the real estate recession of the early 1990's and really recovered only in the last couple of years. Prices are now much as they were in the heyday of the late 1980's, said Jeanne Rutigliano of the Strong Agency in Old Lyme -- much higher than the property in remoter Vermont and New Hampshire, but still, some might argue, with more room to rise: Old Lyme is an even two hours from Times Square, and there is an Amtrak stop at Old Saybrook, the next town to the west.
There are not many loss leaders in Old Lyme, Lyme or Essex. An architect, Jonathan Isleib, is parting with his own house, an eclectic mix of hipped roofs, glass and bluestone, which is being sold on 17.6 acres for $2.8 million, with views of the river and Essex Harbor.
At the other extreme, there is a converted red barn, built in 1910, near the Hadlyme four corners, with its herb and antiques shop and a totally authentic general store with great sandwiches. The good news is the price: $259,000. It is close to a tiny ferry that crosses the river here.
For houses around here with charm, Ms. Rutigliano said, "It's impossible to fill the demand." Brokers are seeing more "52- to 55-year-olds: not quite ready to give up their big house in Greenwich, but looking for a weekend house now that they can retire to later," she said.
"More are demanding a main floor bedroom or the potential to make one," Ms. Rutigliano said. And more are eschewing fixer-uppers for perfection -- even if they have to pay more. "They don't want the $350,000 fixer-upper," the agent said. "They'd rather someone else put the extra $200,000 in before they buy it."
In Old Lyme and in the rest of New England, the real estate market for the best vacation homes has not been hotter in a long time. In Vermont and New Hampshire, which lagged behind the old-moneyed summer resort islands -- Deer Island and Mount Desert in Maine and Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts -- things are still going up, said Mr. Ballantyne of Sotheby's. But in the islands, he said, things have started to cool; prices are not declining, but mellowing out, similar to what is happening to New York City.
On the islands, the creme de la creme -- McKim, Mead & White villas and the like -- are still setting records, Mr. Ballantyne said. But for the rest, "the market is still strong but not setting records."
"The frenzy is gone," he continued. "It makes sense: the properties that went up the first, went up the fastest, are the ones that are starting to slow."
And up in Vermont, where Mr. Bullard holds court, business is very good, better than it has been in years. He just keeps selling the houses to young families. And selling them again. And again.
"Because the young people tend to get sick of things," he said. "They buy a house that costs a couple hundred thousand dollars; they buy it so their kids can learn to ski. But the kids don't like to ski. Or they get sick of it and move to South Carolina, to Florida or to Aspen, and somebody else buys it."
"It kind of keeps the ball in the air," the real estate agent said, grinning broadly.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Smashing Drum Display From France

BYLINE: By LESLIE KANDELL

 BODY:
THE following concert program is rated PG-13: it contains 17 brawny guys with bare arms, pummeling oil drums in violent rhythms, with pickaxes. Although there is no profanity (unless it's in French) one cannot ignore the yelling, or the smashing oilcans. Earplugs are available to the audience at no charge.
Here, here, what's all this? A variant palliative for aggression? A dream evening for the hearing-challenged? Intrepid listeners will have a chance to find out Nov. 15 when Les Tambours du Bronx, an unusual drumming group from France, muscles into New Jersey on its first North American tour. 
 To the extent that the culture of hip-hop is about rebellion, this event is a species of hip-hop -- that is, the antithesis of the classical music concert form. If there is an expected appropriate attire, the drummers of Les Tambours don't wear it. As to performing on valuable heirloom instruments: they don't play standard instruments at all, and regularly destroy what they do play on. Quiet, a concert hall norm, is a joke. Even the Bronx reference is a joke.
The men, who no longer have to hold day jobs -- if they ever had them -- come from the outskirts of Nevers, an industrial town in central France known for repairing trains, and also as the resting place of Bernadette of Lourdes, whose body is preserved under a glass bubble, reportedly as fresh as ever. Before Les Tambours was founded in 1987, its members were friends who met to drink at a place in Nevers called the Broadway Bar. Some were students, some had jobs, some were unemployed, but none were musicians. Their little jest, as their evenings at the Broadway Bar ended, was that they were going back home to the Bronx.
According to the group's leader, Ludovic Le Mapihan (known as Map), they got their shot at performing during the city's annual festival of movie shorts.
"We wanted to make a small performance, but we were not sure what," said Map. (The telephone conversation is translated from an ad hoc mixture of French and English, representing a genuine dual effort.) "We had no money, but because Nevers is a city for train repairs, 55-gallon barrels were easy to find free, in gardens."
They performed 20 minutes at the festival, got all fired up, and decided to go to any nearby festival, invited or not. "We played in the street," said Map. "Presenters liked us and we began to be invited."
True to its perverse form, the all-male group, now aged 25 to 42, named its first commercial recording "Silence." It's anything but, though the label name, Naive, is more like it. The rhythms are clean, repetitive in the marching band sense, and seductive but acceptable, probably, to even to the most mannered listener. "Bombast and unity" said one reviewer. Not bad.
Nothing about their performance is gentrified. Some numbers have added clapping or whistling, while in others, oil barrel clangor is augmented by groans, howls and snorts. The recording's final number, "Etouffez la Ventoline" (a title chosen for rhythm rather than meaning) has unintelligible words that might be broadcast over a railroad station loudspeaker.
Comparing Les Tambours with Japan's Kodo Drummers, Map acknowledged the similar visceral effect, and then said: "Our rhythm is very basic. It goes directly to your body. Our instruments are different in the way we play. We smash very loud. When we finish the show, the instrument is destroyed. You can use both sides of the drum, so, two shows maximum."
The destruction factor is handled through copious supplies: "A big truck follows us, with 400 barrels from France, and 4,000 sticks," he said.
After trying different materials for their pickax mallets, they settled on beechwood, because it proved strong enough to survive a concert or two.
Since the drummers can't practice separately, they get together in what Map described as a hangar in the countryside. "We are not musicians," he said. "We play and move our arms a special way. We look for new members in the way we would look for a friend, not a drummer."
In Les Tambours European performances, there is some interaction with the audience, which Map was not sure was happening on this tour. "We try to talk to the audience," he said, "but our English is not so good. We explain and ask what they think. We know they won't sleep."

HEADLINE: For The Sake Of Argument

BYLINE: By Jacob Weisberg; Jacob Weisberg is chief political correspondent for Slate. He has written for the magazine about Bill Clinton, Robert Rubin and others.

 BODY:
On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago he assisted in creating. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who hopes to inherit his seat in the Senate, began the ceremony in the East Room. Bill Clinton, whose departure from office will conclude eight years of strife with Moynihan, presented the award. On most of the 15 recipients, the president bestowed kisses and bear-hugs. But as Moynihan bowed his head to receive his medal, Clinton simply clasped his hand and whispered something in his ear.
If Moynihan looked a bit abstracted as Clinton fitted the ribbon around his neck, it might have been because the room was, for him, full of ghosts: the four presidents he served (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford) and the four he mostly fought from the Senate (Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton). Half the other honorees were people the 73-year-old senator has been enmeshed with at one point or another in his career: Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and for many years his nemesis on welfare policy; John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Moynihan's predecessors as ambassador to India, his colleague on the Harvard faculty and his neighbor in Cambridge; George McGovern, who led the Democrats in the era when Moynihan felt compelled to break with them; and the widow of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who was one of Moynihan's closest friends in the Senate. Another honoree, the Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn, approached Moynihan before the ceremony to apologize for his attack on Moynihan's 1965 report -- once infamous and now widely praised -- on the black family. At the reception afterward, Moynihan seemed to return to the present as he sipped a glass of white wine and regaled the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, and a White House speechwriter, Jeff Shesol, with the story of how the Presidential Medal came to be. John F. Kennedy, who wanted to create a system of civil honors akin to those bestowed in Britain, referred the project to his labor secretary, Arthur Goldberg. After Goldberg went to the Supreme Court, the task fell to Moynihan, who tried to pre-empt opposition to the award by pretending it had always existed. But only after Kennedy was assassinated did his idea come to fruition. Lyndon Johnson awarded the first medal posthumously to the late president along with the other recipients Kennedy had chosen (with less evident political purpose than the Clintons) -- among them, E.B. White, Edward Steichen and Edmund Wilson. At the ceremony, Jacqueline Kennedy sat behind a screen in the White House State Dining Room and wept. 
 You often see eyes glaze over when Moynihan starts in on one of these responsible-for-the-creation riffs, especially if the listeners have heard the story a few times before. In a capital seemingly ever consumed with the latest dust-up, where historical memory tends to be measured in days rather than decades, Moynihan's elaborations of neglected historical corridors, lost moments and failed schemes tend to be seen as exercises in irrelevance and self-regard. It isn't so much that no one in Washington takes Moynihan seriously, though his dysfunctional relationship with Clinton did consign him in recent years to a state of near irrelevancy in the Senate. It is rather that it is not easy to settle on how to take Moynihan seriously. He was, and remains, a complex and often contradictory figure.
In Moynihan, I think, the strains of courage, egotism, insight and petulance have always been blended together. After 24 years in the Senate, he leaves behind a record that is long on concepts and short on concrete results. Yet the Senate will be a poorer place without him. In the end, the verdict on Pat Moynihan may be that he was a frustrating conundrum: our political era's most magnificent failure.
A couple of weeks before the Medal of Freedom ceremony, I visited Moynihan in his private office in the Capitol. Others who are senior enough to have been bestowed one of these coveted hideaways off the Senate floor use them as private meeting rooms or as places to catch a nap. Moynihan turned his into a writer's studio, a place to escape his staff and hammer out drafts on the 70's-vintage Smith Corona typewriter that sits on a desk in the center of the room. (An identical model graces Moynihan's office in an old one-room schoolhouse in Pindars Corners, N.Y., the upstate hamlet where he and his wife, Elizabeth, have long had a farm.) The room is filled with books and pictures, any of which will prompt a story. The most poignant is a small black-and-white photograph of Robert Kennedy that looks over Moynihan's desk.
The senator himself makes an impression more professorial than official. His dress is anglophile and mildly eccentric: this afternoon, a beige suit and striped tie worn with red socks and leather-soled suede shoes. And when Moynihan, in a self-described mellow mood, begins what turns into a three-hour ramble, it is in the mannered dialect that everyone who has ever worked for him can imitate: a singsong of "ah-ah-ahs" punctuated by staccato pops of commentary, with seemingly random accelerations, decelerations and abnormal stresses added for effect. Asked about health care, Moynihan begins by asking, "In . . . what dec-ade . . . of this century was the ran-dom patient . . . with the ran-dom ailment . . . encountering the random doctor betteroffforcare?" (His answer: "Ah, the, ah, fifth decade. . . . Penicillin . . . was probably when they stopped hurt-ing people.") After Moynihan suggests I turn off my tape recorder and breaks out a bottle of sherry, his lazily brilliant banter grows even more compelling. At one point, for example, a call to the hideaway from his wife, an expert in the gardens of Mogul India and also his chief political adviser, prompted an elaboration of her recent discoveries about the original design of the Taj Mahal.
Despite his seemingly endless erudition, Moynihan is not a pedant. He is someone with a keen awareness of the past's presence. I remember watching Moynihan's performance during the debate on the Persian Gulf war, one of those rare recent occasions when senators actually showed up and took their seats. Most gave ghostwritten comments retailing arguments familiar to anyone who'd been following the debate. Moynihan gave an original, discursive lecture on the history of the British Mandate in Iraq and international law, the point of which was that Kuwait was a nasty country not worth defending. His conclusion that America shouldn't go to war may look like a mistake in retrospect. But Moynihan put the issue in a perspective that was otherwise lacking that day. In the world's greatest deliberative body, he was one of just a few who could fairly be described as deliberating.
Whoever succeeds him is bound to seem a minor figure by comparison. Neither Rick Lazio nor Hillary Clinton will ever approach Moynihan in intellect, style or wit. It's also a safe assumption that either one of them will view the job of senator far more narrowly than Moynihan did. They will try to leave their imprint on legislation, deliver federal dollars back to New York, service their constituents and get re-elected. They will spend their spare moments not writing, thinking and debating, but fund-raising and "listening." In other words, they will try to be effective in ways that most senators now are, but that Moynihan never was.
In a parochial way, New Yorkers will probably be better off. Moynihan has spent 24 years pointing out the imbalance of finances that afflicts New York in an annual report he calls "the fisc." A Senator Clinton or a Senator Lazio would spend less time trying to understand this problem and more time laying claim to a few more defense contracts. That's how Charles Schumer views the job, as did the man he replaced, Alfonse D'Amato. As Moynihan's friend John Chafee once joked: "You write Moynihan about a passport and you get a history of the passport office. You write D'Amato about a passport and you get the passport." With Lazio or Clinton, you'll get the passport.
But the Senate will surely be worse off, having lost its greatest character, its sole intellectual, its chief gadfly and its finest literary stylist. And it will also have lost something more. Though he is far from a type, Moynihan is the last of the breed that the framers of the Constitution envisioned residing in the upper chamber. Their notion of a bicameral legislative branch was that the lower house would be fully representative, while the upper house would be only indirectly so, providing a check on momentary enthusiasms and majoritarian passions. In contrast to the House, the Senate was to be more about policy than politics, focused on national rather than local concerns and geared to slowing things down through careful deliberation rather than making things happen. Visiting Washington in the 1830's, Alexis de Tocqueville found the intended distinction borne out in practice. "When one enters the House of Representatives at Washington," he wrote, "one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. One can often look in vain for a single famous man. . . . A couple of paces away is the entrance to the Senate, whose narrow precincts contain a large proportion of the famous men of America. They are eloquent advocates, wise magistrates and noted statesmen. Every word uttered in this assembly would add luster to the greatest parliamentary debates in Europe."
Moynihan is perhaps the only contemporary senator recognizable in this description. His departure will solidify a change decades in the making: the debasement of the Senate into a glorified version of the more vulgar, impatient and partisan House.
Younger people who began following Moynihan only in the 1990's sometimes find it hard to understand why an older generation regards him so highly. In the last decade, Moynihan has not been an essential figure in American politics. Rather, his role has often seemed that of a character actor with a stock gag. He wanders onstage to make brilliant remarks, the real point of which seem to be to point out the feebleness of those who fail to appreciate his genius. During the Clinton presidency, his part has been that of the Shakespearean fool.
One might have expected Moynihan to delight in Clinton's election. Here, after all, was a president whose intellect approached his own and one who shared his self-critical outlook on liberalism. And for a moment, it looked as if Moynihan would be Clinton's collaborator. "Whatever the president wants, I'll certainly try to get it for him," the senator announced in 1993 upon succeeding Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the all-important Finance Committee.
As soon became evident, however, this offer was entirely hollow. The embattled relationship that ensued can be analyzed at several levels. At the most basic, Moynihan disagreed with the administration. He thought Clinton should first fulfill his campaign promise to reform welfare, the topic nearest the senator's heart. The Clintons wanted to begin with health care, a subject Moynihan had never mastered. On a more general level, Moynihan's learned skepticism about government social policy was a poor match for the optimism and navete of the first Democratic administration in 12 years. The Clinton people thought they could use social policy to change the world. Moynihan had, after considerable delay, assimilated the failures of the Great Society he wrote about 25 years earlier. He cited Rossi's Law, so named for the sociologist Peter Rossi: "the expected value for any measured effect of a social program is zero."
Finally, at a personal level, there was Moynihan's vanity. The Clintons made a tactical mistake by not love-bombing Moynihan early on. On the other hand, it's possible that no amount of flattery would have been sufficient. Relations took a disastrous turn when Moynihan read a blind quote in Time magazine about himself from a "top administration official": "Moynihan supported Bob Kerrey during the primaries. He's not one of us, and he can't control Finance like Bentsen did. He's cantankerous, but he couldn't obstruct us even if he wanted to. . . . We'll roll right over him if we have to."
Moynihan says he knows the quote came from Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton aide. Emanuel, who now works as an investment banker in Chicago, says it wasn't he. In any case, the "roll over him" remark pushed Moynihan from skeptic to enemy. Demanding a welfare reform bill, he announced, "I might just hold health care hostage." He went on "Meet the Press" to declare: "We don't have a health care crisis in this country. We do have a welfare crisis." Later, he called the proposed budgetary savings in the Hillary Clinton-Ira Magaziner health care bill "a fantasy." Worst of all, he declined to hold Finance Committee hearings on the bill. "I probably was more assertive than was in order," he says today, with considerable understatement.
Some of Moynihan's criticisms were on the mark. He was correct in arguing that a major piece of social legislation like health care reform shouldn't pass the way the Clinton team thought it could -- by a slim, partisan majority. Moynihan was also right in asserting that politically, it would have been wiser to do welfare reform first. But in other respects, Moynihan was mistaken. He became fixated on the idea that health care inflation was caused by the phenomenon of "cost disease," an ailment diagnosed by his friend the New York University economist William Baumol, who developed it in relation to the economics of the performing arts. Because productivity increases are not possible in certain service industries, Baumol postulated, costs rise inexorably. Moynihan had Baumol testify before the Finance Committee, and then had Hillary Clinton to lunch at his Pennsylvania Avenue apartment to meet with Baumol.
But Baumol's disease doesn't afflict health care, an industry in which magnificent productivity increases have proven possible thanks to medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The cause of runaway health care inflation, as the Clinton social engineers understood, was a third-party-payer system in which users had no incentives to limit the expenses they generated. Thanks mainly to the rise of managed care, medical inflation was declining even as Moynihan repeated his analysis.
Does he now think he was wrong about all this? "I guess I was," Moynihan told me. "You start getting robots to do the work and you start getting pills to do the work. One pill, Zantac, cut the number of stomach operations by 80 percent."
If he missed this trend, it may have been because Moynihan's motivation wasn't to repair health care. Baumol was proxy for his view of grand social policy schemes in general -- that they inevitably cost far more than we expect, have massive unintended consequences and often fail to make the problem better. Given the possibility that the Clinton plan might pass, Moynihan wanted to be the one who predicted its failure. It was as if he were burying a time capsule of dire warnings that would one day be viewed as prophetic. More than he wanted to shape the outcome, Moynihan wanted to have been right.
Something of this phenomenon affected Moynihan's curious behavior in the welfare battle that followed the one over health care. With his vast credibility on the subject of welfare, Moynihan was the logical focal point for a bill that would bring together New Democrats and conservatives. After Republicans took the Congress in 1994, Moynihan, alone in his party, could have shaped what kind of reform bill Congress would pass. Instead, he became first a sphinx, who would not tell anyone the secret of what he supported, then a Cassandra, who screamed bloody murder about what others were trying to do.
Part of the problem was Moynihan's pride of authorship in a reform bill that passed in 1988, the Family Support Act. It's possible to argue that the 1988 bill opened the door to the more effective conditioning of welfare benefits on work that was passed in 1996. But Moynihan seemed to take the position that the very discussion of the topic implied that his attempt of eight years earlier had failed -- which, in fact, it had. The other part of the problem was his view that illegitimacy, a major factor in the lives of welfare recipients, was too little understood and too hard to discuss openly to support an effective governmental response.
Once Republicans captured Congress and passed an actual bill containing a stringent version of time-limited welfare, Moynihan became uncharacteristically hysterical, arguing that it would put thousands of children in the streets. He had found something worse than grandiose social policy efforts by liberals -- radical reform by conservatives. Moynihan's horrified opposition to the bill was persuasive to many at the time (myself included). But while the final verdict may not be written until the next economic downturn, mounting evidence suggests that he was wrong. Unlike all previous welfare reform efforts, the Personal Responsibility Act has reduced welfare rolls considerably -- by more than 50 percent. Births out of wedlock, which began to decline in 1994, have continued to do so.
Moynihan's relations with the administration, meanwhile, grew worse. "I kept getting into sort of unnecessary troubles," he says. He leapt at the opportunity in a "Meet the Press" appearance to call for an independent counsel investigation of Whitewater, which he now refers to as "something I should never have done." He also maligned the administration gratuitously. In a meeting at The New York Post after the 1996 campaign finance scandal, Moynihan cracked to the paper's editorial board: "Everyone has Chinese arms merchants to lunch. Don't you?"
In retrospect, it is Clinton who appears to have been right about many of the major economic and social policy issues of the 1990's, while Moynihan was making a muddle of his past positions. What went wrong?
To understand why the 90's were so unkind to Moynihan's reputation, you have to know something of his past. And this is murky territory, dominated by a subject who loves to revise his own history and cultivate his own myths. For instance, Moynihan has never made any real effort to correct the widely held belief that he grew up in the urban jungle of New York's Hell's Kitchen. In fact, as was noted in a recent biography of Moynihan written by his friend, the English journalist Godfrey Hodgson, Moynihan "didn't sleep a night in Hell's Kitchen until he had a college degree and a commission in the United States Navy." He was born in 1927 in Oklahoma, where his father worked as a reporter. As a young child, Pat lived in comfortable middle-class environs in Queens, Nassau County and suburban New Jersey. But when he was 10, his alcoholic father abandoned his family, never to be seen again by his eldest son. The family fell into a downward spiral, and Pat did spend some time in East Harlem. The Hell's Kitchen interlude, however, occurred in 1947, when Pat, on his way from the Navy to Tufts, worked as a substitute bartender in a saloon his mother ran for a time on West 42nd Street.
A Fulbright Scholarship took Moynihan to the London School of Economics, where he underwent a theatrical transformation. The self-consciously working-class Irish roustabout molted into an English dandy, replete with bowler hat, monocle and umbrella. But the career Moynihan sought upon his return was in politics, not scholarship. Moynihan met a well-connected New York lawyer on the boat ride back, which led to a job on Robert Wagner's campaign for mayor, which led to a job working on Averell Harriman's campaign for governor and then to a speechwriting job on Harriman's staff in Albany.
Moynihan joined the Kennedy administration in 1961 after a friend recommended him to Arthur Goldberg, the newly appointed secretary of labor. Despite intense ambition and efforts to ingratiate himself, Moynihan never penetrated the Kennedy inner circle. By the time J.F.K. was assassinated, however he had begun to make a mark with projects like his effort to revive Pennsylvania Avenue and his study "One Third of a Nation," which contended that many young men, poorly educated and untrained, faced lifetimes of unemployment or work in low-skill jobs.
He no longer had to worry about making a name for himself after the spring of 1965, when controversy erupted over another study he wrote for the Labor Department, "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action," aka the Moynihan Report. The story of the report, the hostile reception it received from many civil rights leaders and its subsequent vindication has been told many times. To read it today is to be struck by the continued trenchancy of Moynihan's insight that family breakup was becoming the chief obstacle to the goal of racial equality, and also by its style -- one of analytical boldness out of character for a government report, even one intended for internal consumption.
Drawing on work by the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the historian of slavery Stanley Elkins, Moynihan diagnosed a crisis in the structure of the black family. American slavery had been especially vicious, forbidding marriage and denying men the ability to provide for their families. This had encouraged a "matrifocal" family structure, which was worsened by racism and discrimination. With few economic opportunities, black men could not be good husbands and fathers. This led them to a pattern Moynihan was only too familiar with: desertion, disordered one-parent households and what he called in a phrase from the sociologist Kenneth Clark, a "tangle of pathology." One-parent families produced a disproportionate number of delinquents, dropouts and drug abusers. Moynihan also noted a salient fact: the number of new welfare cases, which had previously tracked the unemployment rate for blacks, had begun to rise even as unemployment fell. This suggested that antidiscrimination laws were insufficient to the goal of racial equality.
To that end, Moynihan supported a range of policies designed to enhance "the stability and resources of the Negro American family" -- jobs programs, housing programs, birth control assistance and what came to be known as affirmative action. But because his goal was to stimulate a government commitment to addressing the problem, Moynihan's report did not pursue the question of what remedies might work best. In part, this was a reaction to the War on Poverty debate his side had just lost. Moynihan, coming from Labor, wanted a jobs program. Sargent Shriver and others from the newly formed Office of Economic Opportunity were attracted to the modish strategy of "community action," which meant involving poor people in the programs created to help them. Moynihan didn't want to dissuade the Johnson administration from acting by reviving the quarrel. At another level, passing from diagnosis to cure meant moving from the realm of the known to what was perhaps unknowable.
Giving short shrift to solutions proved, however, to be a major political blunder. Because it de-emphasized the question of what government should do to help the black family, the Moynihan Report was taken by many on the left as potential fodder for racists who believed blacks were inferior and government could do nothing to help them. His depiction of blacks as deeply damaged by the vicious character of American slavery was taken as criticism of blacks rather than of white society. But it was the attention Moynihan paid to rising out-of-wedlock births that sparked the greatest outrage. While few disputed his statistics, many civil rights leaders took the position that for a white man to deliver this news to a white audience could bring only harm. In the famous formulation, Moynihan was "blaming the victim"; he was also accused of both subtle and explicit racism. The Labor Department disowned the report. President Johnson, who may not have ever read it, ignored it. Moynihan resigned and relocated to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of the City Council.
The attacks on his report sent Moynihan into the deepest depression of his life, which he rode out at Wesleyan before taking up a professorship at Harvard. It also left him in a curious position: a liberal despised by his own kind. With increasing vehemence, he returned the sentiment. A similar response to James Coleman's 1966 study of equal opportunity in education, which showed that parental income had more effect on educational outcomes than any other factor, ratified Moynihan's breach with the left.
Along with his friends clustered around a new magazine called The Public Interest -- Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, James Q. Wilson -- Moynihan was reacting to evidence that the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society were failing to achieve their goals. Among the responses of this circle, Moynihan's was the most political. He didn't give up on social policy as an instrument of change -- at least at first. He gave up instead on the supporters of social policy, the people who had maligned and abused him. Moynihan concluded that what we would today call political correctness was undermining the ability of government to do anything for the disadvantaged. "The liberal left can be as rigid and destructive as any force in American life," he wrote in Commentary in 1967.
Vilification also initiated what might be described as a career-long quest for exoneration. To be sure, Moynihan remained politically ambitious. But more than professional success, he demanded his due, to be acknowledged as a seer, not just about the black family, but about every topic he touched upon.
After Robert Kennedy's assassination in June 1968, Moynihan was left without significant ties within the Democratic Party. By the end of that year's presidential campaign, he was writing obsequious notes to Richard Nixon. Nixon, who had admired Moynihan's articles in Commentary, approached him after the election with an offer to become his chief domestic policy adviser. Having two Harvard-pedigree professors, Moynihan and Henry Kissinger, helped assuage Nixon's own insecurities. Moynihan knew just how to flatter Nixon, telling him that he was a 20th-century Disraeli. In Nixon, he also found the ideal audience for his eviscerations of upper-class liberals.
Moynihan's role in a Republican White House was at once that of policy maker and ideological warrior. He argued for maintaining Great Society programs he had earlier criticized, not because he had decided they could be made to work, but rather because doing otherwise would play into the hands of liberals. The same justification underpinned the welfare reform scheme he got Nixon to support, the so-called Family Assistance Plan, which was based on the idea of a guaranteed income to every poor family. The FAP, Moynihan's most audacious attempt at social policy, was based on an idea contained in his report on the black family: that welfare contained an incentive to family breakup, since only single mothers qualified.
The problem with his plan was that it was at odds with everything else he had learned, both about the destructive effects of welfare and about the potential for social engineering to produce massive unintended consequences. And indeed, subsequent experiments showed that a guaranteed income increased rather than reduced rates of marital breakup -- presumably because it freed men from the need to support their families. That Moynihan didn't anticipate this result can only be explained by politics: he thought the FAP would destroy the left by pre-empting its demands. After the Family Assistance Plan died in Congress, Moynihan wrote "The Politics of a Guaranteed Income," his longest and most serious book, laying the blame on liberals who opposed the plan because benefit levels weren't set high enough. To create a noble failure seemed almost the point.

While Moynihan was in Washington fighting fire with FAP, student radicals were threatening to burn down his house in Cambridge, forcing his wife and children to evacuate. In this context, in January 1970, he wrote Nixon another of his acerbic memos. He argued that blacks were making steady progress but that black-on-black violence, radicalism and reverse racism against whites were undermining it. Moynihan thought that the most useful thing the administration could do would be to damp down rhetoric and create more jobs for unemployed black men. ''The time may have come,'' he noted, ''when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect.''' After Nixon distributed the memo to his cabinet, a copy leaked to The New York Times, and the phrase, taken out of context, was used to bolster the accusation that he was a racist. To Moynihan, the reaction underscored the lesson he had drawn from the Moynihan Report: that liberals would never treat him fairly.
He was, in fact, edging toward the view that critics accused him of holding: that racial and social problems were hopeless -- at least so long as the left blocked sensible discussion and action. When Nixon offered to send him to New Delhi as the American ambassador, Moynihan leapt at the opportunity. India was a good place to sit out Watergate and what remained of the Nixon administration. It also got Moynihan thinking about why America was so hated in the third world. In 1975, he distilled his views into an article for Commentary, ''The United States in Opposition.'' The essay, which set out to explain why the United States was so often in the minority in the United Nations, dissected the lock step anti-Americanism of the so-called nonaligned nations. On the basis of the article, Kissinger recommended that Gerald Ford make Moynihan the United States ambassador to the United Nations.
At the United Nations, Moynihan proceeded to do what he recommended. Unwilling to accept the State Department's preference for diplomatic inoffensiveness, he denounced, in the loudest possible terms, the hypocrisies of third world dictatorships. After Idi Amin addressed the General Assembly, Moynihan attacked him as a ''racist murderer.'' This was too much for the bureaucracy at State, which distanced itself from Moynihan's remarks, and even for Kissinger, who drove him out after only eight months in the job. But in New York, Moynihan became a hero for his powerful denunciations of the resolution equating Zionism with racism.
Moynihan deserves great credit for his work at the United Nations, even if his accomplishment was mainly a rhetorical one. What he did there was to forcefully articulate a consistent liberal internationalism, based on democracy and respect for human rights, at a time when noninterventionism and skepticism about America's role in the world were becoming dominant strains in the Democratic Party. Indeed, looking back at the 1970's as a whole, Moynihan appears as a liberal loyalist even though he spent half the decade serving Republican presidents. Unlike many of his fellow neoconservatives, Moynihan never entirely abandoned either Democrats or the idea of an activist government, at home or abroad. He simply argued that liberals needed to be smarter, more self-critical and empirically driven. Ending his seven-year Republican exile, he announced his Senate candidacy as a Democrat in 1976. With the help of a divided left and an endorsement from The New York Times, he won a narrow victory.
Early on, he established what kind of senator he would be. Moynihan would not dominate a single field, as Russell Long did with defense, or build a record of legislative accomplishment on social issues, as Ted Kennedy has done. After Moynihan's four terms, the sole major bill to his credit is the 1991 transportation bill known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or Istea, a grab bag that has done little even to advance his own goal of supporting public transportation. Nor would Moynihan excel at pork barrel like Robert Byrd or constituent service like Al D'Amato.
Where Moynihan would prove superior was in bringing his understanding to bear on debates that otherwise might have taken place in a kind of historical and intellectual vacuum. His metier was performance in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor, which he would hold with sardonic, digressive lectures. These speeches were most trenchant during the early Reagan years, when Moynihan found his voice in opposition. To the chagrin of his allies in the neoconservative movement, he opposed the invasion of Grenada and denounced the C.I.A.'s covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A more consistent Wilsonian than Reagan, Moynihan argued that both actions violated international law. As a crude measure of his evolving views, his rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action soared from 47 percent in 1979 to 95 percent in 1982.
In the introduction to his 1988 collection of speeches, lectures and articles, ''Came the Revolution,'' Moynihan paints his shifting stance as a bit of mystery even to himself. He records that ''something in the new administration had sent me into opposition in a way I had not ever been before, not felt before.'' In retrospect, he points to two other factors. One was the refusal of conservatives to recognize that the Soviet Union was on its last legs. The other was his analysis of the Reagan budget deficits. Moynihan believed that they were an intentional effort to make it impossible for liberals to expand the federal government. David Stockman, the intellectual behind the budgetary disaster of the 1980's, had worked as a baby sitter for the Moynihans in Cambridge in the late 1960's. At the Gridiron Club dinner of 1981, the senator lampooned his protege's evolving enthusiasms. ''I have never known a man capable of such sustained self-hypnotic ideological fervor,'' Moynihan said. ''One day he arrives at Harvard preaching the infallibility of Ho Chi Minh. Next thing you know, he turns up in Washington proclaiming the immutability of the Laffer Curve.''
As fine a period as the early 1980's was for him, he failed to emerge either as a leader of the anti-Reagan opposition in Congress or as a savior of the Democrats. In truth he lacked the discipline, focus and organization to lead. Where other senators cultivated a loyal, long-serving staff, the irascible Moynihan produced a distinguished alumni association. His current chief of staff, Tony Bullock, is his 17th in 24 years -- and the record holder at four years on the job.
Somehow, whenever Moynihan turned from analysis to action, he always seemed to lose himself in the old thickets of revenge, pride and Pyrrhic victory. This was certainly true of the 1988 Family Support Act. The bill, which was the only major welfare reform passed into law until Clinton signed the Republican-sponsored Personal Responsibility Act in 1996, was in principle an attempt to condition welfare on work. But Moynihan resisted the Reagan administration's push for something resembling workfare on the grounds that liberals wouldn't support it. Thanks to abundant loopholes in the bill, only a tiny fraction of recipients ended up working. In the years following the bill's passage, welfare rolls continued to rise.
Moynihan's inspired idea of a Social Security tax break, which he proposed in 1991, is another case in point. Having served on the commission that created the Social Security Trust Fund to provide for the retirement of the baby boom generation, Moynihan became incensed that Social Security surpluses were being used to mask the depth of the Reagan deficits. He said that if George Bush, who was then president, wouldn't address the problem, Social Security taxes should be reduced and the system returned to a pay-as-you-go basis. What was brilliant about his idea was that it used the Republican device of a big tax cut to call the bluff of fiscally irresponsible conservatives. The idea had legs. Newt Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation quickly got on board, scaring the wits out of Bush administration officials. But Moynihan left his proposal to dangle and die. After announcing it, he departed on a three-week tour of Africa and the Middle East. In the final analysis, he didn't want a Social Security tax cut. He wanted to make a point.
Why wasn't Moynihan more effective? The familiar explanation, no longer spoken in whispers, was his fondness for drink. Hodgson, whose standards are English, says his friend the senator drinks merely a proper amount. He notes that Moynihan these days imbibes nothing stronger than Tio Pepe sherry, which his aides jokingly refer to as ''the Mexican ambassador'' (as in, ''don't bother him -- he's with the Mexican ambassador'').
Beyond the drinking, however, there is the more significant matter of Moynihan's temperament. Like Nixon, he lacked the largeness of spirit necessary to transcend his animosities. When the opportunity to address social policy questions arose again after Clinton was elected, Moynihan remained too obsessed with the past to engage in another reform effort. He thought of the Clintonites as arrogant liberals of the type who had demonized him in the 1960's and 70's. Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala's connections to the Children's Defense Fund, which had opposed his 1988 welfare bill, especially set him off. For him, the political had become entirely personal.
This temperament ultimately made Moynihan a better critic of politics than practitioner, a man with a greater aptitude for analysis than for accomplishment. Thinking and writing are activities that come naturally to him. Getting things done has always been a challenge. This was something that Moynihan recognized about himself early on. There's a striking comment in a letter written to a friend in his graduate school days that Douglas Schoen quotes in his 1979 biography of Moynihan, ''Pat.'' Moynihan described himself as having ''almost first-class critical intelligence'' but ''second-class abilities.'' This inversion of Justice Holmes's famous assessment of F.D.R. was all too acute. Moynihan's awareness of the odds against successful government action, and the perpetual tendency among his fellow politicians to ignore those odds, has made him a brilliant critic of politics. But it also prevented him from becoming a top-level political practitioner.
''Henry James somewhere describes a mind too fine to be violated by an idea,'' says Moynihan's old friend Irving Kristol. ''Pat really was too much of a thinker to be violated by politics.''
As he approaches retirement, Moynihan seems to have been devoting most of his time to writing and arguing that he was right. And to be sure, he was ahead of others on many issues. Moynihan was a lonely worrier about automobile safety in the late 1950's, before Ralph Nader happened upon the scene. He has never quite proved that the Reagan deficits were an intentional conspiracy to undermine domestic government, but he was certainly correct that they would have that effect. And in his most famous analysis, Moynihan was on the mark in arguing that the increasing rate of family breakup in the black community was a catastrophe in the making.
But many other cherished prophecies, which he touts to the point of obnoxiousness in his 1996 book, ''Miles to Go,'' fall apart on closer examination. Moynihan asserts, for instance, that he alone foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, in a 1979 article in Newsweek. His writings from the 70's yield statements that can be taken as predictions of just the opposite. But even if Moynihan gets credit for forecasting that the Soviet Union would fall, he was mostly wrong about the reasons. Moynihan focused on the problem of ethnicity; he thought Uzbeks and Tajiks would throw off the chains of their colonial oppressors. Something like that happened in Yugoslavia, but ethnic conflict was a relatively minor factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Moynihan drew the wrong implication from his prediction as well. He used it as an argument against the Reagan military buildup. But that buildup hastened the Soviet collapse. We spent them into bankruptcy. (''We spent ourselves into bankruptcy!'' Moynihan told me, in response to this line of argument.)
To read Moynihan's earlier writings is to encounter an incisive intelligence and a fine, mandarin style (now sadly dissolved into a kind of self-absorbed baroque). It is also to come across a plethora of other forecasts that we would have heard a great deal about had they been borne out. Just before Richard Nixon was elected, Moynihan predicted that Democrats would continue to hold power with no real challenge from conservatives for decades to come. Around the same time, he asserted that the nation was about to suffer grievous division on the issue of public subsidies for parochial schools.
Moynihan does himself an injustice by encouraging us to judge his career by his predictions. In the end, it's a matter of limited interest, since no one can forecast the future with any consistency. What is more important than prophecy is analysis, and here Moynihan has few peers in politics. Since the 1950's, he has played a role unique in American politics, bringing a vast knowledge of history and social science to bear on the practical questions of what government does. Even if his conclusions have often been wrong, his insights have been genuine. For the past two and half decades, Moynihan's thinking and argument have deepened and complicated American political discourse -- something that can be said for what other senator of his time?
In recent years thoughtful statesman types like Moynihan have given way to another type, furiously aggressive and ideological. Bob Dole has gone and been replaced by Trent Lott, Bill Bradley by Bob Torricelli, Harris Wofford by Rick Santorum. These transitions have left the Senate a bitter and impatient place, a glorified version of the Gingrich House -- which is where most of the new breed came from. Replacing Moynihan with Clinton or Lazio will complete the unfortunate process.
''In '94 and '96 we took the topsoil off that place with the people who left,'' says Bob Kerrey, the senator from Nebraska who, like Moynihan, did not seek re-election this year. ''But the real engine for making the Senate more like the House is Trent Lott. The reason you don't see the great debates is that Lott operates it like the House, limiting debate, and he doesn't like the messy amendment process.''
Moynihan says much the same thing. ''The notion is that there is a majority, and it will vote for what the leaders of the majority think,'' he told me. ''The other side really doesn't have anything to say.''
The institution has also collapsed socially. Instead of the old after-hours, across-the-aisle friendships developed over drinks, lunches and dinners, there are now ceaseless rounds of fund-raising solicitation and media appearances. To not return to your home state every weekend is to court a backlash from voters watching to see if their representative has ''lost touch.''
''Television has emptied the Senate floor,'' Moynihan says. ''That and money, money, money. It used to be that people would start drifting over around 5, then go out to dinner at 8. Now you go to vote and turn around and go back. On the floor is somebody with charts looking up at the TV cameras. It may be at my age that my middle years just seem more agreeable, but it was much more collegial. People talked. There was a high order of civility.''
Moynihan is in no hurry to leave the job he has held for 24 years. According to a close associate, the decision to retire this year was more his wife's than his. After serious back surgery, his stamina is not what it was. But in the end, Moynihan seems relieved to go because of the way the institution has deteriorated. An Oxbridge common room doesn't work if no one shows up for conversation. And these days, hardly anyone does. Moynihan's only remaining close friend, Kerrey, is leaving with him. The others are either dead, like Chafee, or retired, like Bradley, Dole and Bob Packwood.
''There's no one left in the building he can have a glass of sherry with at the end of the day,'' says Moynihan's aide Tony Bullock. That might be taken as a depressing valedictory for a politician who has squandered a vast influence. But what a sad comment, too, about the United States Senate.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 2000, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Times Magazine last Sunday about the legacy of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan misidentified a former senator who was an expert on military affairs. He was Richard Russell, not Russell Long. The article also referred imprecisely to Mr. Moynihan's actions on the 1993 Clinton health-care bill. While chairman of the Finance Committee, he at first declined to hold hearings on the bill, but he held them in 1994.
The article also overstated Senator Moynihan's English leanings while he attended the London School of Economics. Bowler, yes. Umbrella, yes. Monocle, no.

HEADLINE: Fat People Say an Intolerant World Condemns Them on First Sight

SERIES: THE FAT EPIDEMIC: Fighting the Stigma

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: NORWOOD, Mass.

 BODY:
Walk in Deidra Everett's shoes a moment: You know that you dress nicely; that you are well-spoken; that you are clean and friendly and funny and smart. Yet when you go for a job interview, your potential employer's eyes tend to sweep your person and fill with horror.
You can joke about it -- "the look" -- but it has happened so many times that you have almost given up. The unemployment rate in Massachusetts is under 3 percent. Your office administration skills are in desperate demand. But you, as you are often reminded by stares and gibes from strangers, are fat. Fat. 
 "I'm an upbeat and confident person," said Ms. Everett, 33 years old, 5-foot-10 and about 440 pounds. "But you get kicked enough and even the strongest people say, 'You know, I just don't want to be kicked anymore. I'll be strong in my own little world.' "
Deidra Everett's personal trials fit into a picture that scholars and advocates have been building for years. Over all, their work increasingly suggests that weight may now draw more open and widespread discrimination than race or gender or age. And opposition to such discrimination is mounting.
There have been lawsuits, "size acceptance" talks, and a current campaign by a fat woman for bigger seat belts in cars, as well as the recent pushes in San Francisco and elsewhere to pass ordinances banning discrimination based on a person's size.
The prejudice turns up in almost all spheres of life, from the classroom to the office to the streets.
Being fat "seems to have a consistent strong effect, more consistent than any other form of discrimination I've seen, though part of that may be because people feel freer to talk about it," said Mark Roehling, an assistant professor of management at Western Michigan University, who last year published an analysis of the extensive research on weight discrimination.
But the efforts to fight the discrimination appear tiny in a country where more than half the population is now considered overweight, and nearly 18 percent obese. Unlike other groups that face discrimination, fat people have not organized extensively to demand their rights. Their most prominent advocacy group, the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, has only about 5,000 members.
And the task before such advocates is daunting. Studies indicate that opinions about fat people turn negative in childhood and stay negative: As early as nursery school, they have found, children prefer drawings of peers in wheelchairs, on crutches or with facial disfigurements to those of fat children.
"Fat hatred is being taught to our children," said Miriam Berg, president of the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination, a national nonprofit group. "I know from how children react to me: at age 1 1/2, babies love me and smile at me; you come to 2 1/2 and already they look at me with fear; it begins that young, unless they grow up in a household with people of different sizes."
It could be said that fat hatred begins even before birth: According to a national survey, 16 percent of the general adult population would abort a child if they knew it would be untreatably obese, said Dorothy C. Wertz, an ethicist and sociologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who specializes in genetics and who performed the study. By comparison, she said, 17 percent would abort if the child would be mildly retarded.
By elementary school, another study showed, children use words like "dirty," "lazy," "ugly," "stupid" and "sloppy" to describe the silhouette of a fat child.
By adolescence, fat teenagers like Emily Zimmer, an eighth grader who lives near Seattle, may be used to the teasing, but moments of mortification still abound. Recently, Emily said, she went to a fair and found that the restraints on the roller coaster were designed for bodies smaller than hers, so she could not ride.
"It was just so embarrassing," she said. "I was with my brother, and he thought I was mad. And I said no, not mad; I was just dejected, depressed. What if somebody I knew had seen that happen?"
Such humiliations do not occur daily, she said, but she has become paranoid, trying to avoid them at all cost. Things do seem to be getting better as she grows up: "People are respecting me more because they realize I'm not just fat; I'm a human being," she said. "I have talent, I have a 4.0 grade point average, and I play a musical instrument, for crying out loud. I hope that impresses them a little bit."
But for all her brains, one thing still baffles her: "I don't understand what people are trying to do by making fun of fat people," she said. "It's not going to make them thin; if anything, it's going to make it worse."
Yet the teenage compulsion to be cruel to fat peers appears powerful. Consider a volley of 1998 messages still posted on the USA-Talk chat Web site about a fat eighth grader in Willowick, Ohio:
"He is the most disgusting slob I know," one posting reads. "Maybe it's the six chins, or thunder thighs. Any way you look at him, you have to be disgusted. A group of us are planning a little prank at the next pep-assembly. We're going to jump on him, drag him into the locker room and strip him naked. We'll then shove him out into the gym for all the school to see. Maybe then people will see what a disgusting person he is."
Other writers eventually censured the person who posted the message, but first, there was support like this: "Oh, and you failed to mention the fact that his gold chain around his neck is buried under a mound of fat."
A National Education Association position paper says that "for fat students, the school experience is one of ongoing prejudice, unnoticed discrimination, and almost constant harassment."
"From nursery school through college," the paper continued, "fat students experience ostracism, discouragement and sometimes violence."
Indeed, studies have shown that fat students are less likely to go to college and that their parents are less likely to pay for it; once there, they face still more hostile attitudes from their fellow students; a 1988 study found that students would prefer to marry an embezzler, a cocaine user, a shoplifter or a blind person rather than an obese person.
 
Trouble in the Workplace
The job market presents other challenges. Studies have found that fat white women tend to earn significantly less than their thinner counterparts. One study found that highly obese women earn 24 percent less while the moderately obese earn about 6 percent less. Another survey found that among 81 employers, about 16 percent considered obesity "an absolute bar to employment" and 44 percent considered it conditional medical grounds for passing over an applicant.
Dr. Roehling's review of 29 such studies found evidence for discrimination at every stage of the work process: hiring, placement, promotion, discipline and wages.
"I talk to managers here in Michigan, and they tell me flat out they wouldn't hire people because they're fat," he said.
The elements of such discrimination may be complex. Dr. Roehling said that employers described several concerns, from worries about the costs of their health insurance premiums to worries that their customers will respond negatively to a fat employee.
The interplay of cause and effect can also be complex: is a woman fat because she is poor, for example, or poor because she is fat? In general, it does seem that obesity causes poverty and other disadvantages rather than the disadvantages that cause obesity, said Esther Rothblum, a psychology professor at the University of Vermont who has done extensive research on the stigma associated with weight.
The evidence, she said, shows clearly that being fat makes people "downwardly mobile," because of obstacles they face to education, work and marriage. (Studies indicate that being fat does not seem to hinder developing friendships and good relations with colleagues, she noted.)
For the Deidra Everetts of the world, the outcome is simple: seeking to avoid "the look," she tells potential employers about her weight in preliminary phone interviews.
"They hear the word 'fat' and they're like, 'Gasp!' I can't believe you said that!' " she said. "Eventually, they say, 'You know the job I was calling you about? I'm really thinking it isn't something you'd be interested in.' "
It feels like discrimination, she said, but how can she prove it? Unless the employer curses her and says, " 'You're not going to get hired until you lose 300 pounds,' " Ms. Everett said, "unless someone says that -- and even if they do, it's legal. They can look me right in the eye and say, 'You're too fat!' "
Indeed they can -- anywhere except Michigan, Washington, D.C., Santa Cruz, Calif., and San Francisco, which are the only places to have passed laws against weight-based discrimination.
San Francisco, which passed its ordinance in May, did so at the instigation of some members of what Larry Brinkin, the member of the city's Human Rights Commission staff who handled the issue, calls the "fat liberation movement." Its advocates had been pressing for years for such a law, he said, but really gained traction after an incident in which a local health club put up a billboard depicting a space alien and declaring, "When they come, they'll eat the fat ones first."
Though the sign was clearly meant to be comical, advocates picketed the health club, giving momentum to the push for a law. City hearings at which dozens of fat people testified to the discrimination they had encountered, and the failure of all their attempts to lose weight, added impetus, as well.
Some in San Francisco disapproved, saying that the law was frivolous and that fat people could solve their problems simply by losing weight. The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized against the law, saying that fat people would be healthier if they lost weight, and that "it is true that genetics can be a factor in obesity, but that is not always the case."
The law passed the city's Board of Supervisors unanimously, however, and now, Mr. Brinkin said, the commission is working on implementing it, wrestling with such issues as whether theaters should be asked to have a row of free-standing seats without arms that can accommodate large people.
Though they lack such special laws to protect them in most places, fat people are increasingly taking discriminators to court, experts say. They have no solid estimates on the numbers of such cases but put them in the dozens each year nationwide. About 150 people call the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination with complaints each year, though not all will sue.
The case law on obesity discrimination has accumulated to the point that a book about it came out this year, "Tipping the Scales of Justice: Fighting Weight-Based Discrimination" (Prometheus Books), by Sondra Solovay, a lawyer in Berkeley, Calif. It argues that "discrimination against fat people is the civil rights hurdle of the new millennium."
Thus far, Ms. Solovay says, the outcomes of weight discrimination cases vary from place to place, in large part because there is no federal law protecting fat people.
Perhaps the trickiest question is whether obesity should be considered a disability. Courts have ruled that the Americans With Disabilities Act provides protection in some cases, particularly those concerning highly obese people, but not in others, depending on the circumstances.
What is clear, Ms. Solovay said, is that using a disability claim has tended to provide the best legal success. But "there are huge ideological objections" to using such an argument, she added, because many fat people want to argue not that they are disabled, but that they are perfectly able to do the same work as thinner colleagues.
 
Little Help From the Law
Many of the daily battles some fat people face do not lend themselves to the courtroom, however -- from plane seats that are too narrow to strangers who spout cruel taunts to doctors who refuse to believe that many diets only backfire. And then there are the insurers.
"The hardest thing to live with as a fat person is that you can't get health insurance," said Ms. Berg of the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination. "When people call me up and say, 'My H.M.O. kicked me out; what should I do?' I have nothing to tell them. Nothing."
A person's weight does influence many health insurers, and a significantly overweight applicant can be turned down, said Janet Trautwein, director of federal policy for the National Association of Health Underwriters. "It's not an appearance thing," she said. "It's just strictly a health status factor, and it's used in combination with other factors like, 'Do you smoke, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes?' "
In some states, she said, insurers may charge higher premiums for overweight members.
Elizabeth Fisher, a programmer in Baton Rouge, La., decided not to let one such moment of daily difficulty go by. She was buying a new car, and found that the one she wanted, a Honda Odyssey minivan, did not make a seat belt big enough for her; nor would Honda offer an extender, as many other companies do.
This summer, Ms. Fisher petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to require carmakers to offer the option of longer seat belts on new vehicles and seat-belt extenders on existing ones. Her fight had such resonance that it has gained national publicity.
"This issue is much larger than one fat woman who can't buckle her seat belt," said Ms. Fisher, who is expecting a decision soon from the agency. "There are millions of people in the United States who weigh more than 215 pounds, the current upper weight limit required for seat belts by N.H.T.S.A. And because fat is more prevalent in certain racial and ethnic populations, more common in women than in men, and more common in older people than young, denying fat people the protection of being included within the limits of federal seat-belt regulations disproportionately affects these disadvantaged groups."
Other efforts are under way outside the courtrooms. On the East Coast, Lisa G. Berzins, director of women's behavioral medicine at Manchester Memorial Hospital in Connecticut and a specialist in eating disorders, uses a special approach to open schoolchildren's eyes. She appears before them dressed in a fat suit that makes her appear to weigh 250 pounds, and talks about body image and the pernicious influence of the media in creating unattainably thin ideals. Then she leaves the stage and comes back as her real size 6, and talks with the children about how their perceptions of her changed.
"When I come back and I'm thin they're really stunned and really pay attention and are much more respectful," Dr. Berzins said. "It gets into a discussion about how they view heavy people in general."
Dr. Berzins is interested in creating programs to teach that size and shape are part of the diversity children should respect, but she has had trouble getting financing. In any case, she said, such efforts are "microscopic" compared with the large numbers of people who continue to see weight "as almost like a moral issue -- it's like you're virtuous if you restrain yourself and you're sinful if you give in."
In that sense, those who fight against fat discrimination acknowledge that one of their toughest challenges is the internalized self-hatred of the fat people themselves.
"It can be devastating to the self-esteem of a child to feel they are less worthy, and there's something wrong with them because their body is large, and to feel they're being held responsible for that fact," said Joanne Ikeda, a nutritionist at the University of California at Berkeley who works with overweight children. "It can lead to depression. It can end up with children taking bizarre steps to try to control the way their body is turning out."
Even for those like Deidra Everett who have come to peace with the fact that they cannot diet their way to thinness, the road remains hard.
A fat friend called her the other day, Ms. Everett said, and told her that she had been sitting in a restaurant when a neighboring diner started cursing at her for "eating all the food in this restaurant."
He was smoking a cigarette and threw it at her, and when she became upset, said, "Oh, now the big fat expletive is going to cry!"
"I wanted to cry myself," Ms. Everett said.
Some people justify attacking fat people by saying it is their choice to be fat, Ms. Everett said, "but who in the name of God would choose to live a life like this?"

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND JOURNAL;
Paradise Found, and Thus Threatened

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER; E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CLIMBING on a 1953 tractor by his roadside farmstand piled high with just-picked apples, Tom Wickham, 61, rolled slowly down a country lane through his peach orchard. At a mill beyond the blueberry bushes and his family's 1740's clapboard homestead, his nephews, Stephen Wickham Searl, 22, and Dan Heston, 32, were pressing Mutsus, Cortlands and Jonagolds into fresh cider. In the distance, past an inlet known for more than three centuries as Wickham Creek, was an old Indian camp where Mr. Wickham said he sometimes found arrowheads and potsherds.
The hay wagon rides go right past the spot, Mr. Wickham said, urging a visitor to take the trip through his 200-acre farm. There was an added attraction, he said: "Have you seen the corn maze yet?" 
 Earlier this year, Cutchogue was named one of America's 77 most charming, off-the-beaten-track burgs in the National Geographic Society's "Guide to Small Town Escapes." It was the only village on Long Island to receive the designation.
Blessed by surrounding salt waters that keep temperatures warmer in winter and cooler in summer, a bucolic maritime setting where the Corchaug Indians once harvested shells to make wampum, Cutchogue is Long Island as it used to be.
"It's a wonderful vacation escape area," said Katherine Fava, 46, who was a visitor for 30 years and moved from Scarsdale to Greenport six years ago. "Until recently it was more of a down-home kind of atmosphere. It is for the most part very friendly and more laid-back than the Hamptons.
"Out here," she continued, bouncing along on the bumpy hayride with her 2-year-old son, Dillon Wiggons, "dinner doesn't have to be served at 8 o'clock and we don't have to have the pate. We can just have some burgers and some chicken and some corn on the cob."
But increasing recognition of Cutchogue's charms may be their doom. It has been discovered, and not just by National Geographic. All summer long, and on fall weekends, traffic clogs the roads. More and more second-home owners and day-trippers are choosing the less expensive North Fork over the glitzy Hamptons. The look of the terrain and the attitude of the people, Ms. Fava said, are attracting so many people that longtime residents are worried.
"People with money are moving in and building million-dollar homes," she said. "The locals are always up in arms about the traffic."
Simultaneously, the agrarian encounter has changed. The North Fork's potato farms have been replaced by vineyards, farm stands now sell bok choy, and wineries are backdrops for Martha Stewart-style weddings. Tourists from parts west seeking a day in the country drive two hours to pick pumpkins from a field and tie rotting corn stalks to the roofs of their S.U.V.'s. Farmers raise cash and consciousness with hayrides and romps through cornfield mazes. Vintners offer free tastes of chardonnay and merlot. Even the quaint bed-and-breakfast inns are part of the swelling agritourism and agritainment trend.
"We've tried to give visitors not only the fruit they want but the flavor," said Mr. Wickham, a research scientist by training and a former supervisor of the Town of Southold whose family settled in Cutchogue three generations before the American Revolution. "We're giving them the farm experience.
"The kids coming out to do this as they grow up become consumers and they remember and become day-trippers," Mr. Wickham said. "Many of them come from along the Sunrise Highway, people who have gotten away from an agricultural background and want to relive it."
For $25 a family, the Wickhams' fall harvest package included a mile-long hayride down to the Peconic Bay, a trip through a seven-acre maze and a chance to pick half a bushel of apples. Prudence Wickham Heston, 34, the sales manager, said there were blossom and pollination tours and cherry picking in the spring, peach picking in summer. Tour groups learn about irrigation and the economics of farming. And Mr. Wickham is considering moving the antique cider mill to the farmstand as a new attraction.
For 300 years, Cutchogue was a rural village like its neighbors Peconic, Mattituck and New Suffolk, a world of spud farms and tidal estuaries. Some tilled the land; others raked the waters for clams, oysters and crabs.
Led by Mr. Wickham's ancestor, Parker Wickham, a magistrate and town supervisor, Southold's government seat was in Cutchogue for a long time before the Revolutionary War. Until Wickham was abducted and the farm confiscated because he was a Tory, Wickham resided in the Old House on what is now the village green and was once the center of the Wickham family farm. Originally built five miles down the road in Southold in 1649, the Old House was moved to its present site in 1660.
(The Old House is certainly old, but whether it's the oldest is a matter of dispute. Richard Barons of the Southampton Historical Society said the Old Halsey Homestead there was built in 1648 and is the oldest settlement house on the Island. But Bill Peters, a trustee of the Cutchogue-New Suffolk Historical Council, said the Old House in Cutchogue may have been built as a barracks for trading company workers even before 1640, when the first settlers arrived. He acknowledged that no proof exists, but was unwilling to concede anything to the Halsey House.)
In the past half-century, economics forced farmers to find more innovative ways to earn a living off the land.
"The cost of producing potatoes in the state of Maine is less than a third what it costs Long Islanders to produce," Mr. Wickham said. "We get among the highest yield of potatoes in the world. But we can't compete. Our labor costs are high, our electricity costs are high, fuel costs, environmental costs are high."
After building a series of dikes after World Warr II to stem flooding during hurricanes, the Wickhams planted orchards. They quit farming potatoes entirely in 1985 with new groundwater regulations.
"Our answer has been to retail our product at a farm stand rather than to wholesale it," Mr. Wickham said, though he and his father did take advantage of Suffolk County's farmland preservation program, selling the development rights. "It is just very hard to make money farming."
It was Mr. Wickham's father, John, who, in an experiment with Cornell in 1963, began growing Mediterranean table grapes on the North Fork. Besides Moses Fournier, who ran a successful vineyard here in colonial times, theirs was the first vineyard on Long Island.
"We don't drink as a family," Mr. Wickham said. "But we love the fruit and we enjoy grapes. We demonstrated that Long Island is a wonderful environment for growing grapes."
And they convinced Alex and Louisa Hargrave, who planted 17 acres of cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and sauvignon blanc in 1973, that Long Island could be the next Napa Valley. More wineries followed. Nearly 3,000 East End acres are now planted with grapes; 6 of the North Fork's 21 vineyards are in Cutchogue.
"They call Cutchogue the sunniest town in New York State," said Shirley Darling of Southold, a tennis instructor and part-time tasting room attendant at Bedell Cellars who relocated from Manhattan in 1985 for the quiet, less expensive lifestyle. "The south side, the Hamptons, they have a lot of fog. The grapes grow better on the North Fork. In Cutchogue they grow best. It's just the lay of the land."
Down the road at Gristina Vineyards, the tasting room is almost like a bar, said Mary Ellen Shea, the retail manager; the regulars just keep coming back. On weekends in October, Ms. Shea said, an average of 1,000 customers stopped by to sip.
"This has stopped being as much of an agricultural destination as it is a tourist destination," said Ms. Shea, 36, leading a tour past 100 oak barrels of fermenting wine. "They sit on the deck, they picnic, they listen to the live music, they drink wine."
At Bedell Cellars, Kip Bedell was testing a vat of merlot. Mr. Bedell, who sold his vineyards last summer but stayed on as general manager, moved to Cutchogue from Garden City in 1979 and started his winery the next year, along with Lenz, Peconic Bay and Pindar vintners.
"The wineries have certainly made this a destination for people," Mr. Bedell said. "Once they came out here they found the farm stands and the great beaches. We may get more and more day visitors but we don't want to see people building tons and tons of houses because it won't be the same. The lifestyle is nice. We'd like it to stay a rural area, which is why people come to visit."
With few motel rooms in the area, bed and breakfasts are part of the charm. Patty Monahan recalled that while living in New York City years ago, an elderly couple returned to her building every Sunday carrying corn and cabbage. Soon she was driving them out to their Cutchogue home and spending weekends visiting farms, collecting mussels on the beach and watching the sunsets.
"When she passed away she left me a lot of little things, like Depression glass," Mrs. Monahan recalled. "But they also gave me Cutchogue. It was just paradise. So when we were going to retire, we decided, where else could we possibly go but Cutchogue? This is God's country."
Five years ago, Mrs. Monahan and her husband, Tom, left Massapequa for a 1910 farmhouse on the edge of the North Fork Country Club. Mr. Monahan, a retired police chief of Great Neck Estates, renovated it as Top o' the Mornin, a three-bedroom bed and breakfast. Mrs. Monahan filled her new home with antiques and four-poster beds draped in lace, put rocking chairs on the porch, fluffy towels by the Victorian tub and fresh-made Irish soda bread and blueberry pancakes on the table each morning for her guests, charging $150 a night for a room.
"When people come out and they have never been here before, they don't know what to expect," said Mrs. Monahan, a former club entertainer whose latest gig is crooning for the guests after dinner at the player piano. "But they come away with the feeling that there is peace here, that it is someplace special."
Since the National Geographic citation, Mrs. Monahan said, she has helped visitors from California, Kentucky, Tennessee, Maryland and Colorado find the town's nooks and crannies, pretty vistas and delights.
Two years ago, Fred and Karen Lee opened a stand at Sang Lee Farms on the North Road to sell Asian vegetables like bok choy, snow pea shoots and tung ho, a chrysanthemum leaf, that they grow on just under 200 acres by the eastern edge of Cutchogue in Peconic. It is open year round.
"A few years ago, certainly 10 years ago, I wouldn't say that the local area would have supported something so different," Mrs. Lee said. "But the time seems to be right. People who enjoy fine wine enjoy fine food. We saw an increase in the traffic and possibly a willingness of people to try new things. The wholesale markets were becoming more difficult, even in the Asian markets, and we wanted to diversify from that as well."
The increased tourism is all upside, said Richard Noncarrow, president of the Cutchogue Chamber of Commerce. "The North Fork has found itself in the last two years," Mr. Noncarrow said. "It has gotten better and better. The wineries helped. It's quiet, but we understand people are trying to come over from the Hamptons. They would like to relocate over here because it's so busy over there. In the last two years prices have skyrocketed out here."
The locals have resisted plans to widen Main Road, Mr. Noncarrow said, though a traffic circle in the center of town is planned to relieve congestion. (Unlike the South Fork, the North Fork has two main east-west corridors, Route 25, called Main Road, and Route 48, known as North Road or Middle Road.)
"We are trying to keep all the development of businesses in the hamlet," Mr. Noncarrow said. The village has received $54,000 in grants for old-style street lights and repaving of sidewalks on Main Street, and a town clock was donated.
"Places like Cutchogue are harder and harder to come by," said Russ L'HommeDieu, 32, a physical therapist and standup comic from Cutchogue whose family settled in Southold in 1685. "Proximity to a large metropolitan area, or two, if you count Boston, make it very desirable for people who are trying to escape."
Escape is becoming more expensive. Burt Lewis, an owner of Lewis Realty Group in Cutchogue, said property values had risen 10 to 15 percent in the last two years, while Ed Forrester, head of the Town of Southold building department, said the number of permits for new dwellings had been steadily increasing in the last three to four years.
"People are selling their house in Sag Harbor and they are moving here, and selling their house in Southampton and they are moving here," Mr. Forrester said. "They are just tired of the endless traffic jam and having people driving up and down the street looking for celebrities. We have been sort of discovered as a nice, quiet place to live."
The town discourages growth through the purchase of development rights to farmland, said Craig Turner, a planner with the town. "Most of the buildable land left in the town is two-acre zoning," he said, adding that the town encourages a variation in which a developer with, say, 20 acres can build 10 houses on one-acre lots and leave 10 acres undeveloped.
Down a country road, Hallock Tuthill, 84, gazed across his seven acres of fallow land to the rows of vineyards at Gristina's beyond. Most of his original 32 acres of potato fields were sold long ago and the chicken coop is empty.
"Twenty years ago all you saw was potatoes around here," he said. "Now there are darn few."
Mr. Tuthill doesn't care much for grapes. "I'm the last teetotaler on the face of the earth," he said. "It doesn't make a darn bit of difference to me, but it is prettier to look at than houses." Mr. Tuthill's ancestors were rumored to be the first off the boat in Southold town 360 years ago. He has spent his whole life in Cutchogue.
Mr. Tuthill recalled when there were sheep and cows on the farm that is now the village green, when he could walk from farm to farm to see what other farmers were up to and sold his eggs to the Cutchogue Diner, which still serves a swell apple crumb pie.
"Gosh, what a different age," said Mr. Tuthill, shaking his head as he pointed out the rows of mesclun and other fancy lettuces another neighbor was growing and talked about the traffic. "Instead of making the roads wider and straighter, they should make them crookeder and narrower."

HEADLINE: Glen Cove Seeks Waterfront Investors

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

DATELINE: GLEN COVE

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT his six years in office, Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi has pursued a dream to make Glen Cove Creek, the dowdy, dirty stretch of waterfront at the heart of this city, into an attractive place to dine, drink, dock and stroll. Marshaling federal and state grants, the city has already spent $40 million on bulkhead building, dredging the creek and cleaning up the waterfront area.
Last week, Mr. Suozzi took his show before a paying audience, so to speak, when he announced that the city was seeking to sell to private investors 50 acres on the north side of the 213-acre Glen Cove Creek development zone. Plans call for a major hotel and dozens of restaurants and shops. 
 "Our vision is to restore Glen Cove's waterfront as a Gold Coast destination," the mayor said after a press conference on Tuesday that drew about 100 property developers, local residents and federal, state and local officials.
"Of the 10 miles of Glen Cove waterfront, 9 are already beautiful," he said. "But one mile is an industrial area that was once a contaminated site and is now abandoned and being cleaned up for development. This vision for a waterfront festival marketplace was developed with input from numerous planners, developers, public officials, environmental groups and the community.
"Just picture yourself dining on lobster while enjoying a sunset over Hempstead Harbor," he said.
His vision is a far cry from today's reality. Glen Cove Creek includes industrial sites that were piled with garbage and rubble and contaminated with chemical waste from the former Li Tungsten ore refining plant. Some of the contaminated industrial land remains on the federal Superfund cleanup list.
Nevertheless, the city is seeking minimum bids totaling $24.5 million for the land now up for sale, divided into four projects: a 250-room luxury hotel, conference center and banquet hall (suggested minimum bid: $6 million); a waterfront marketplace containing 200,000 square feet of restaurants, boutiques and other retail shops ($9 million); a high-speed ferry service to Manhattan ($6.5 million) to operate from a $2 million ferry terminal to be built by the city; and 70,000 square feet of bookstores, galleries or sports and health facilities ($3 million.)
Successful bidders will be required to work with the city to develop their properties in harmony with the overall plan for the area, which is to include a waterfront promenade.
Clearly, the linchpin of the proposal is the hotel. The city commissioned a marketing study from HVS International, a hospitality consulting firm whose president, Steve Rushmore, reported: "Nassau County is under-hoteled and desperately needs a luxury hotel. Occupancy rates are at record levels, and the Glen Cove waterfront is a premier site for a hotel in the style of a Hilton or Ritz Carlton."
The mayor said, "There has been a lot of interest from developers and hotel chains, but until there is a firm offer I'm unable to divulge any names." Bids for all four projects are due by Jan. 15, and winners are expected to be announced on Feb. 1.
Successful bidders will have to have good imaginations. Though cleanup efforts have been underway at least since 1986, when Glen Cove was identified as the most polluted harbor on the North Shore, much remains to be done.
The pace of cleanup accelerated after 1994, when the state's Long Island Sound Coastal Management Program designated Glen Cove as one of only three areas along New York's 314-mile Long Island Sound coastline where concentrated waterfront redevelopment should occur. (The other two were Mamaroneck and Port Chester.) Then in 1998, the city was selected as one of 16 national Brownfields Showcase Communities, making it eligible for additional grants dedicated to reclaiming "brownfields," polluted industrial sites. Glen Cove has been awarded more than $23 million in federal and state money.
In 1996 the federal Environmental Protection Agency began cleaning up the Li Tungsten site, near the head of the creek. In 1998, the city demolished the 250-foot Li Tungsten smokestack. Last year, the city purchased the Li Tungsten site and Captain's Cove, an abandoned condominium and a New York State-designated inactive hazardous waste site at the mouth of the creek, and has begun cleanup work there.
Maria Stanco, the E.P.A.'s brownfields coordinator for Glen Cove, projected that the waterfront piece of the Li Tungsten property will be removed from the Superfund list by the end of this year, with the remaining portions to follow within two years.
During the cleanup, the city has occasionally clashed with the Coalition to Save Hempstead Harbor, a local civic group, particularly over the inauguration in March of a high-speed ferry service to New London, Conn., operated by the Foxwoods casino.
The coalition objected to the noise and pollution of the ferry, and it is still a source of debate, said Corin Dunne, the group's co-president. But overall, she said, it has won the support of the community. And she said the coalition was backing the overall waterfront development.
"We support the city's master plan as the best possible kind of development," Ms. Dunne said. "We have been watching, and will continue to watch, for any problems."
When plans for a ferry terminal were first announced, the city met with resistance from neighboring Sea Cliff and the North Shore Environmental Alliance, which jointly filed a lawsuit against the city. On Oct. 5, a settlement was reached which, according to the Sea Cliff Court Clerk, Pete Hesse, reduced the proposed waterfront construction projects from 1.1 million square feet to 700,000, set back the proposed hotel from the waterfront to create a landscaped buffer area between the building and pedestrian esplanade, and moved the permanent ferry terminal into the creek and away from the harbor.
It also called for the city of Glen Cove to conduct an environmental impact study with respect to the operation of the commuter and excursion ferries, and the construction and use of the permanent ferry terminal and parking facilities at the Li Tungsten property.
Mr. Suozzi said the development would create 1,700 full-time jobs and generate $200 million in annual sales, $9.8 million of which would come back to the city and the local school district as property taxes.
"Our goals are threefold: to clean up the pollution, to bring back jobs and the economy, and to recycle the once-polluted areas rather than using up any remaining open space," the mayor said. "Where else can you find 50 acres of waterfront property? This is a unique opportunity to create something beautiful and to improve our city's image."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Nov. 5 about Glen Cove's waterfront redevelopment plan misstated the position of the Coalition to Save Hempstead Harbor regarding the high-speed ferry operating between Glen Cove and New London, Conn. The group supported the ferry service if the number of sailings and hours of operation were limited; it did not oppose the service.

HEADLINE: Mission District Fights Case of Dot-Com Fever

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 4

 BODY:
By day, the Mission District still looks like the workhorse immigrant neighborhood it has been for a hundred years.
Old women wearing kerchiefs, pulling shopping carts to mom-and-pop grocery stores, still own the streets. Young mothers wheeling strollers chat in Spanish on street corners. Taquerias selling $3 burritos are packed. 
 But by night, it becomes clear why the Mission is at the center of one of the most tense battles over the future of San Francisco in decades. This is when the newcomers -- mostly young, white and affluent -- come home from the jobs that afford them $700,000 loft condominiums in former warehouses, and when the limousines pull up to the bistros that have taken over the butcher shops and bakeries on Valencia Street. This is when the warnings -- "Artists Evicted!" stenciled in red paint on the sidewalks, posters that say "Gentrify Me" under the head of Medusa, graffiti that says "Dot Com" with a line across it on buildings in progress -- begin to make sense.
It was only a matter of time before San Francisco rebelled against its latest incarnation as a combination bedroom, home office and den for Silicon Valley. The city's artsy, bohemian soul could only absorb the biggest, fastest money-making machine ever for so long without a crisis. And as artists, nonprofit organizations and working-class tenants are being evicted in record numbers to make way for richer, glossier arrivals, the hue and cry against the dot-com world has reached fever pitch.
This is not to say that San Francisco, where two competing initiatives on the Nov. 7 ballot are being promoted as the solution to unbridled growth, is the only city in the Silicon Valley web saying "enough is enough." Palo Alto, the heart of Silicon Valley, has enacted an emergency ordinance banning companies from setting up in street-level retail spaces. Redwood City, the headquarters of Oracle, Excite@Home and Napster, imposed a moratorium on most new office development to assess the consequences of such growth. Other strongholds of the new economy, including Menlo Park, San Carlos and San Mateo, have either enacted or plan to enact similar moratoriums on high-tech development. San Jose expects a long legal battle and Seattle-style protests after approving a $1.3 billion, 20,000-worker complex for Cisco Systems.
But it is here in San Francisco, a city that boasts that it is one of the top cultural destinations in the country, that the dot-com backlash is seen and felt the most.
In part, this is because the city's quirky landscape has changed so much so quickly. No vacant lot is safe. Neither is any small company with an expiring lease. The dot-com economy, which hit its stride here in 1996, has dictated real estate costs, which have reached unaffordable levels downtown for all but the richest companies. The price of prime downtown commercial real estate has more than tripled in five years, to $85 per square foot today from $25.25 per square foot in 1995.
These costs have reverberated throughout the city. Small companies eager to be in San Francisco have set up shop in a former warehouse district known as South of Market, or SoMa, and, more and more, in the Mission. At least a dozen arts groups have been forced to close because of rents that have jumped to $10,000 a month from $2,500, or because they were evicted when buildings were sold for new offices.
Just the fact that the Mission, with its homely tenement buildings, squashed-together houses and teeming streets, has come to symbolize the housing crisis underscores how desperate the real estate situation has become in this city. The neighborhood, which is 62 percent Latino, is poorer than most in San Francisco: 83 percent of the residents are tenants, compared with 65 to 70 percent in San Francisco as a whole, and the per capita income is $20,112, versus $32,441 citywide. In recent years, rents here have gone from about $500 for a 250-square-foot studio apartment to $1,200 for that same studio, in a plain building with no amenities.
But because the Mission is the neighborhood of choice for the city's large array of activist groups, it is not taking its new-found popularity among the wealthy lying down.
Several groups have been formed to fight gentrification, including the Artists Eviction Defense Coalition and the Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition, an umbrella group of at least a dozen neighborhood organizations. The antigentrification groups have organized sit-ins at dot-com buildings and protest rallies, and they plan more in the coming weeks.
"I think it's O.K. to say that in residential neighborhoods, especially in low-income neighborhoods, we can't go with the whole idea of supply and demand," said Luis Granados, executive director of the Mission Economic Development Association, which assists residents and small businesses. "If we were to do that, the entire neighborhood will become a giant dot-com office park, and it's coming to that. It's really coming to that."
Even now, when Internet companies are shaky, with seemingly more of them shutting down than starting up, the hideous traffic jams, housing prices that are the highest in the country and record numbers of evictions have led to such resentment that Mayor Willie Brown, in his recent state-of-the-city speech, sternly lectured residents against blaming dot-coms for the city's problems.
"There is absolutely no justification for scapegoating anyone," he said. "Dot-commers! If I hear that one more time, I'm going to scream!"
The mayor also used his state-of-the-city speech to campaign for an initiative known as Measure K, which is backed by his main campaign contributors, the downtown development interests.
Measure K would impose a two-year moratorium on new projects larger than 25,000 square feet in the Mission and an adjacent neighborhood, Potrero Hill, and allow a one-time lifting for the next 15 months of the city's annual limit on office space of 950,000 square feet to ease the space shortage. It would also exempt many areas from the growth limit and create the post of development czar, appointed by the mayor, to oversee projects.
The competing initiative, Measure L, which is sponsored by artists and neighborhood activists, bans new development in parts of the Mission and South of Market districts, applies an indefinite moratorium on new development in two neighborhoods and other parts of SoMa, and bans so-called live-work loft construction, with far fewer exemptions from the annual growth limit.
Live-work lofts have become contentious. They were designed to create affordable housing for artists. But larger developers have used loopholes in the live-work loft laws to put up buildings exempt from certain development taxes that dot-com companies have used for office space only, or affluent renters or buyers have used only for housing.
For some longtime residents of the Mission, however, neither measure much matters; the neighborhood is already nearly gone. Pedro Linares, a drummer who moved here from Lima, Peru, 10 years ago, said most of his neighbors had moved. "No one can afford it here anymore," he said. "The old neighborhood we knew doesn't belong to us anymore."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 5 discussed growing cultural and economic conflicts in the Mission District of San Francisco between the working poor who inhabit the neighborhood by day and the Silicon Valley rich who return to its bistros and loft apartments by night. The article included statistics on income level in the district.
The figures were from a study by a San Diego marketing research firm, Claritas, commissioned by The San Francisco Examiner for an article it published on Aug. 29 about conflicts between newcomers and long-term residents. The figures should have been attributed. In addition, the Times article described them incorrectly. The statistics applied only to the section known as the Inner Mission, not to the entire district.

 A Personal Odyssey
 By Thomas Sowell.
 Illustrated. 308 pp. New York:
 The Free Press. $25. 
 "A side from the pleasure of sharing reminiscences," Thomas Sowell writes in the closing lines of "A Personal Odyssey, "the whole point of looking back on my life . . . is to hope that others will find something useful for their own lives." He takes his final words from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: "If I could think that I had sent a spark to those who come after I should be ready to say Goodbye." One could say that for the last three decades, Sowell, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, has been sending sparks into the highly charged arena of civil rights debate. Sowell, an economist by training, rose to national notice in the early 1970's, when he challenged, in The New York Times Magazine, "the prevailing assumptions behind admissions policies for minority students." The article linked him ever after with political conservatives, though he has long disavowed Republican Party affiliation.
"A Personal Odyssey" is cast in that most American of autobiographical molds: the narrative of the self-made man, from hardscrabble beginnings in Charlotte, N.C., to the Olympian heights of boardrooms, think tanks and the premier universities. While the narrative is strictly linear, Sowell's path from want to privilege is anything but straight.
Adopted as an infant by his paternal aunt, at 9 he moved with her to Harlem, joining relatives who bounced from apartment to apartment. A model student, he was admitted to Stuyvesant High School, but domestic tensions and financial strain soon proved too distracting and he dropped out, landing in a home for homeless boys. These lean years, during which he pawned his one suit for food and was estranged from his family, Sowell says taught him much about the virtues of perseverance, standards, grit and integrity, lessons failed by most people he encountered. At each juncture of his progress, which included the Marine Corps, the Labor Department and AT&T, he met with petty and unprincipled personalities, most quick to trade integrity for political gain -- types he also finds abundant in academia.
From Howard to Harvard, Douglass College-Rutgers to Cornell, Brandeis to U.C.L.A., the picture he paints is much the same: grade-hungry students abetted by unethical administrators who negotiate on their behalf for looser standards. Alone able to remain faithful to the "convictions of his own mind" and soured on deans and department chairs usurping his authority, Sowell ultimately abandons academia altogether.
It simply never occurs to him that those with whom he clashed during the tempests of the l960's and early 70's could likewise have been following the convictions of their minds, however flawed and misguided they might appear to him. While he freely admits his "views were certainly not in tune with the spirit of the l960's," this is hardly a license to scapegoat the entire period or to smear those committed to its causes. Sowell's descriptions of them function as epithets: "white liberal activist," +black militants,"+ "freelance black 'spokesmen,' "+ "white faculty patrons."
Sowell takes issue with the most significant social policies, programs and legal decisions of the 20th century, from Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Civil Rights Act figures solely as a measure vindicating him; he had already begun his career when it passed, he notes, and so was spared the "hang-ups" of black intellectuals stigmatized by the popular notion that they owed their careers to affirmative action. He entered U.C.L.A. by the front door and earned his achievements through hard work and merit, he says: they squeaked by on white guilt and largesse. Such shopworn sentiments are Sowell's stock in trade.
"A Personal Odyssey" is a bitter, brittle, captious book, despite its avuncular conclusion. There is no odyssey here, no journey. There is instead movement without growth in this largely unfaceted and self-regarding self-portrait.

 Time's Fool
 A Tale in Verse.
 By Glyn Maxwell.
 396 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $27.
 
The Boys at Twilight
 Poems, 1990-1995.
 By Glyn Maxwell.
 160 pp. Boston: Mariner Books/
 Houghton Mifflin Company. Paper, $14. 
 WHEN he published his first book of poems in 1990, Glyn Maxwell seemed to capture, for British readers, a new generation's ways of speaking and feeling. Here was poetry that was literate and sophisticated but not stuffily literary, and sentiments that were liberal and democratic but not piously held. Maxwell could be poignant and cheeky, and often at the same time; the work felt fresh in both senses. One challenge for such a poet is how to grow older. So it seems fitting that the hero and narrator of Maxwell's new novel-length "tale in verse," "Time's Fool," lives under a curse, unable to age beyond 17. The poem comes to American readers alongside "The Boys at Twilight: Poems, 1990-1995," a selection from Maxwell's three early books published in Britain.
The plot of "Time's Fool" is a variation on the supernatural tales that attracted Coleridge in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" and Wagner in "The Flying Dutchman." Edmund Lea rides a "ghost train." Every seven years, on Christmas Eve, the train returns him to his hometown, Hartisle, and the doors slide open for the night, temporarily allowing him out. This ritual repetition begins in 1970, when a stranger arrives in town and seduces Edmund's beloved, Clare. When Edmund confronts him, the stranger tells a mad story: long ago he killed a man where he and Edmund now stand, and he has been doomed to wander ever since. Edmund is driven to repeat his crime, and he falls under the same spell. Over the next five decades, during his nights in Hartisle (the name suggests the island of the heart, surrounded by oceans of wasted time), Edmund seeks his freedom through love, repentance and death, only to find himself back on the train each time.
Meanwhile, the world Edmund knew has been transformed. Clare marries and divorces. Her memory of Edmund grows fainter until she can't remember having loved him. In 1991 she says of her younger self, "There's not one cell of me the same / as her. Only the name. Or one of them." Hartisle too changes, cell by cell. Still rooted in a rural village culture in 1970, it soon dissolves into the global economy. The town center is displaced by a mall, and Edmund's parents move from their quiet lane into a "gated community," watched over by a uniformed guard in the blue glow of his television. Edmund's local pub, the Oak, is replaced by a brasserie in a "silvered office block," later by an "Ice-o-theque" and a chain restaurant called "Happy Eater." Edmund wonders what "software" is. His story becomes the subject of a rock album, then the focus of rival New Age cults.
This much is social satire, trenchant at times, trivial at others. Maxwell's deeper concern is with the solitude and emptiness of Edmund's suspended existence. Once he knows there is nothing left for him in Hartisle, he sees that "Home is the ride." During the seven-year periods between visits to Hartisle, Edmund is alone on the train, save for the train's spectral driver, a certain Inspector Stick, and a man Edmund nicknames Happy Hour, who gives him food and drink while speaking a language Edmund can't understand. Looking out and writing, yet always "going nowhere," Edmund experiences time as a featureless medium passed through and viewed, not grasped and lived in. He is the embodiment of an expatriate writer's homelessness. "It's living a missing life," he explains. But in this there is nothing very strange. "We all live one, / really." Only our homes and our families convince us we belong.
The feeling that life is somehow being missed is a central theme of modern English poetry, from William Empson to Philip Larkin. "The Boys at Twilight" belongs to this lyric tradition. Maxwell's contribution is to treat missed experience not as a private, psychological condition but as a social one, defining the blank quality of contemporary public life. A poem titled "Tale of a Chocolate Egg," from Maxwell's first book, is a virtuoso treatment of the theme. Antic and rambling, Maxwell's narrator follows a few stock types, including a skinhead, an Indian girl and a "brown-haired bloke," as they make their ways through a usual day, drawn by the magnetic appeal of a new product, a chocolate egg. The egg, which has no "slogan" but its own "O," is pure advertisement, a symbol for the hollow center of a consumer society.
The vacancy of political discourse is the issue in other early poems. "The People's Cinema" describes a screen on which myths of collective identity are projected: bare and blank, it is "how riches look in daylight when there are none." In "We Billion Cheered," Maxwell speaks of an unspecified social or political threat -- an "it" without a definite referent -- against which the national "we" gathers and defines itself, although "We missed it how / You miss an o'clock passing and miss now."
Many of the poems in "The Boys at Twilight" are about England and Englishness. The style of living they depict is suburban, bland, gently self-mocking ("We shrugged the Home County shrug"). But the loss of weight and depth that Maxwell evokes touches the whole world, and it requires a new cosmology:
The Earth is of course quite flat, and the heavenly bodies
Twinkle explicably. One is as big as a Swatch.
Today they are all gone away, gone away where God is,
Where the dead play whist and the unborn ask can they watch.
This is grim but fun. The mood can be darkened simply by changing the channel, so to speak, to the news from Eastern Europe. Maxwell does so in moving poems about violence in Bosnia and elsewhere. In "a world that had forgotten it was round," not flat, Maxwell's fighting men fail to recognize that the other men "up ahead, quite mad," are only "their own tail," and "they cut them to the ground." Here is the brilliant first stanza of a poem called "The Sarajevo Zoo":
Men had used up their hands, men had
offered, cupped, or kissed them to survive,
had wiped them on the skirts of their own town,
as different men had shinned up a ladder and taken
the sun down.
As these quotations suggest, Maxwell is a formal poet who uses rhyme and meter nimbly but often loosely, as if to be too exacting would be to risk pretentiousness. His shorter poems, even the most serious, resemble light verse and popular songs. He can be brisk and cutting (as in "The High Achievers," a poem about people on the fast track: "Made, / they counted themselves free"). But he seldom has the concentration to be pithy. His unique effects derive from rapid modulation between voices, levels of diction, tones. The poems in "The Boys at Twilight" race forward in run-on sentences, rubbing against the restrictions of traditional prosody, refusing to be mistaken for merely well-made things.
Maxwell has an ear for empty statements, syntactic stumbles and conversational filler, the expressive contentlessness of so much that we say. Even when there are missing pieces or semantic gaps, however, Maxwell's poems plunge on, with the implication that life is like that -- a little out of control, a little out of reach. This rush of speech is hard to manage and sustain, even in a short poem. In the 396 pages of "Time's Fool," there are passages where the writing thins out, and Maxwell's calculated slipperiness begins to feel like sloppiness.
To be redeemed, Edmund must enter ordinary time and age. This he does magically and almost violently at the close of "Time's Fool," passing from 17 to 66 in little more than an instant. This ending is less of an answer to the problem of how to grow older than a release from it. The sense of experience Edmund had missed is suddenly restored, but it remains impossible to articulate. Early in the poem, Edmund speaks of "the present" -- punningly -- as something to be unwrapped; and when he tries to get at it, he can't. At the end of the poem, as he watches the sunrise, Edmund is at last alive in the moment, but this new sensation is not so different from his former emptiness. The word that forms in him, Maxwell writes in a beautiful final couplet, only "fades again, too bright in the bright day / for ink to cling to or for soul to say."

HEADLINE: High-Technology Revival for Historic City

BYLINE: By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE

DATELINE: MANASSAS Va.

 BODY:
The opening of a semiconductor memory plant and the sudden proliferation of Internet facilities have contributed to a spectacular change in fortune for the Old Town district in this small city 30 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., best known for its key role in two Civil War battles fought nearby.
Five years ago, 33 buildings were vacant in the city's Old Town, an area of mostly two-story late 19th century or early 20th century brick buildings built close to the road in four short blocks along three narrow streets and a railroad. 
 The reason for the economic distress was the same as in many small towns and cities across the country, said Roger Snyder, the city's director of community development. During the late 1960's and early 1970's, Virginia decided to widen roads leading to Washington and its closer-in Northern Virginia suburbs to four lanes.
Key businesses left the Manassas area to be near the four-lane roads, he said. A regional shopping mall that opened in 1971 on one of the new four-lane roads on the outskirts of the city accelerated the hollowing out of the Old Town.
The decline worsened when the city's major employer, the International Business Machines Corporation, began to trim its work force. In 1990, I.B.M. had 5,300 employees working at its manufacturing and federal systems facilities in Manassas. By 1994, the manufacturing operations had moved elsewhere, and there were 1,800 employees remaining at the federal systems division, now owned by Lockheed Martin.
Today, all of the buildings in the Old Town area of this city of 35,000 are either occupied or undergoing renovation. Many of the buildings are used by new businesses appealing to the million tourists a year who visit the Manassas National Battlefield five miles to the north or the Manassas Museum, to antiques collectors and to Washington-area residents taking day trips.
The new businesses include an out-of-print bookstore, a fine furniture shop, a wine and food shop, a cooperative pottery studio, a clocksmith, a tearoom, a coffeehouse, a jewelry store, a dress shop, two gift stores, an establishment designed to look like a tavern in colonial Philadelphia and three new restaurants.
Adding life to the Manassas Old Town at night are people who have moved into some 20 modern apartments recently added to the upper floors of rehabilitated commercial buildings. The idea of building modern apartments on the second floors of old commercial buildings in Old Town Manassas originated with the late Loy E. Harris, a long-time insurance broker in the city.
Mr. Harris had long been active in city task forces and business groups promoting the revitalization of the city's Old Town. In 1995, he bought a large vacant commercial building, built in 1906, that originally had a grocery store on the first floor and a large hall on the second. The hall, locally known as the Opera House, had at various times been used for plays and movies and once, in 1916, for a reunion of a Confederate Rangers unit attended by its leader, Col. John S. Mosby.
In the first floor space, Mr. Harris opened a business called the Opera House Gourmet, which specializes in wine, fine foods and cigars. On the second floor, he built four 1,000 square-foot two-bedroom loft apartments that rent for around $1,000 a month. They are so popular that at one point, 10 people were vying for one vacant apartment unit, said John Weber, a Manassas real estate broker.
Mr. Harris next bought the neighboring bank building, which is now a gift shop, and added four more apartments. Next, he bought a third building nearby, and it now has offices for a stock brokerage firm on the first floor and two smaller offices on the second.
When Mr. Harris bought the Opera House, "everyone thought he was crazy, but he started the energy flowing," said Creston Owen, the owner of a Manassas company that provides telecommunications systems to local companies.
In 1996, Mr. Owen followed Mr. Harris's example. He bought a vacant one-story brick building that had been a catalog store on the western edge of the Old Town and renovated it for his own company's use. He has since bought seven other properties in Old Town and has an eighth under contract. Several other business owners have also bought properties and added apartments on the upper floors.
Mr. Owen's contractors are now putting finishing touches on a new three-story structure built on a lot near the tracks left vacant by a fire over 20 years ago. Its first floor has 2,200 square feet of commercial space, which will be leased to The Washington Post as a news bureau. The upper floors house six two-bedroom apartments renting for around $900 a month. Rent for commercial space in Mr. Owen's building is $19 to $20 per square foot a year, with utilities not included, he said.
City officials and business leaders agree that Northern Virginia's booming high-technology economy has provided the economic atmosphere needed for Old Town revival. Until recently, the city had been seen as too far away from the Northern Virginia's high-technology corridor in the Dulles Airport-Reston area, some 15 miles to the north, to benefit much from economic expansion.
That changed in 1995 when Dominion Semiconductor, a joint venture of I.B.M. and Tokyo-based Toshiba, announced plans to build a $1.7 billion plant to manufacture memory chips at a site owned by I.B.M. within the city about a mile west of Old Town. The plant employs about 1,000 people and another 150 contractor employees. Last May, Toshiba, which is buying I.B.M.'s share of the plant, said it had formed a venture with SanDisk, a Sunnyvale, Calif., manufacturer of nonvolatile memory products, to add a $600 million module to the plant and employ an additional 600 people to produce flash memory chips.
The Dominion Semiconductor announcement put Manassas on the national map, but the 10-square-mile city has only limited space for new facilities. So recently, a number of companies attracted to the area have selected sites west of the city in neighboring western Prince William County.
Last year, America Online opened a technology center in a 220,000-square-foot industrial building on a 25-acre parcel next to the Manassas National Battlefield in Prince William County. AOL paid $3.9 million for the site. Row after row of computers and peripheral equipment used to support the AOL service and other on-line services brought the total cost of the facility to $520 million.
Late last month, AOL began construction of a second $555 million technology center about five miles west of the first. The new Prince William County tech center will be AOL's fourth in Northern Virginia and its eighth worldwide.
AOL's technology center brought improved telecommunication and electrical services to the area. The new infrastructure brought to serve AOL is now attracting additional companies.
This spring, Data Centers Now, a division of Beco Management of Rockville, Md., paid $2.75 million to buy a 7.3 acre site adjacent to AOL's first data center. The company is currently building a 109,800-square-foot, two-story speculative data center there -- the first of three speculative data center buildings totaling 250,000 square feet that will be built at the site.
The highly fortified building is designed to withstand winds of up to 150 miles an hour and to provide security against assaults. Backup power and extensive fuel storage will be provided.
Along the same lines, U.S. Data Port of San Jose, Calif., said last month that it would develop a 153-acre campus designed to accommodate 10 to 20 different data center buildings inside a high-security perimeter next to the second AOL center in Gainesville.
The company's partner, the Calpine Corporation of San Jose, Calif., plans to use equipment on site to provide electrical power and chilled water much more reliably than utilities can provide.
Late last year, Prince William County sold 17.7 acres to Covad Communications, a leading provider of broadband DSL communications services, for $1.17 million so that it could build a 100,000-square-foot network operations center and a technical support facility. The center opened in September.
The county, which acquired 529 acres four years ago to promote economic development, is negotiating the sale of 155 acres to Gilbane Properties, a Providence, R.I., developer for $7.8 million. Gilbane has promised to begin at once to build a speculative building on the property that could be used for office or industrial uses.

HEADLINE: Impoverished Russians

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The United States government cannot pass the buck by asserting that Russia's post-Communist economic debacle is due mostly to that country's "failure to embrace change" (news article, Nov. 2). 
 If this charge is applied to the ordinary citizens of Russia, why should one expect them to embrace a system of shock therapy that has resulted in hyperinflation and virtually wiped out the life savings of millions? Why should they embrace a system that took economic power and control out of the hands of their government and gave it to a small handful of private individuals -- many of them with strong ties to the old government?
Had Boris N. Yeltsin allowed a truly democratic system to emerge -- and had Washington insisted that he do so -- the story might have been different for Russia's now impoverished people.

HEADLINE: Mideast Democracy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In their attempt to show inter-Arab solidarity by reopening ties with Saddam Hussein (front page, Nov. 1), Arab intellectuals highlight deficiencies in their own governments.
You quote a Cairo lawyer, Muhammed Monieb, as asserting that rapprochement with Iraq demonstrates support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel. "All Arab regimes are dictatorships," he said. "If the Americans consider Saddam a dictator, then let them tell us who is not a dictator in the region." 
 There is one country in the Middle East region that is not a dictatorship, one country that shares American values of democracy and freedom. That country is Israel.
If he gave some thought to the matter, Mr. Monieb might realize why America supports Israel so staunchly and why Arab citizens might be wiser to protest their home-grown dictatorships rather than rail against the only democracy in their midst.

As Internet stocks fell, other emerging technology issues suffered with them.

BYLINE: By Alex Berenson 

 BODY:
THEY began going public several years ago, promising to use exciting new technology to revolutionize the way people around the world live and work. Though they were rarely profitable and many barely had sales, their potential captivated investors. As their stocks soared, analysts and commentators offered ever more grandiose predictions of the companies' impact, and investment bankers rushed to take more and more of them public.
By the peak of the frenzy earlier this year, many carried multibillion-dollar market valuations. Then the boom ended. In a matter of months, the stocks plunged by half or two-thirds from their highs. Some have fallen even further, leaving unwary or overly enthusiastic investors with near-total losses. 
 And no, they are not Internet companies.
Amid the meltdown of Net stocks, less noticed has been the fact that investors have also fled former highfliers in other emerging industries, ranging from alternative energy and fuel cell developers like Plug Power to second- and third-tier biotechnology and genomics companies like SuperGen and Axys Pharmaceuticals.
These are what Wall Street calls "concept stocks," and they have had a very bad year. Plug Power, for example, has fallen to $23.63 from its January peak of $156.50, an 85 percent drop that has cost its shareholders $6 billion. SuperGen has lost about three-quarters of its value in eight months, sliding from $77.31, to $19.38.
The boom and bust was inevitable, said Roger McNamee, general partner of Integral Capital Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., money management firm that invests in public and private companies. "Every major economic wave in the United States has been driven by financial mania," Mr. McNamee said.
After watching information technology companies like Cisco Systems and Dell Computer grow seemingly overnight from fledgling start-ups to hugely profitable corporate giants, by the late 1990's investors were clamoring for the chance to buy shares in all sorts of extremely young companies with novel technologies -- the kind of businesses that in less giddy times had relied solely on venture capitalists for financing.
Investment banks were more than willing to indulge them, selling shares in ever weaker and younger companies as the decade progressed. The performance last year of Internet stocks like Amazon.com, whose share price soared as investors focused on the company's growing customer base and disregarded its growing losses, only furthered the frenzy, said Ken Pearlman, director of research for Firsthand Funds, a $6.5 billion mutual fund company in San Jose, Calif.
With Internet stocks rising despite big losses, investors and analysts in other emerging, technology-driven industries began to believe that their stocks should also be valued on hypothetical measures like ultimate market size, rather than on the basis of more traditional measures like price-earnings or price-sales ratios.
Speculative bubbles are most often the result of efforts to measure the unmeasurable, according to Mr. Pearlman. "When you're talking about a concept, your mind is free to go wherever you want," he said. "And so are the valuations."
Now those investors have had to face the truth, long known to venture capitalists, that big returns do not come without big risks and that most young companies fail, said John P. Whaley, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners, which manages $1.2 billion. "Before the last nine months, the market had been generous to virtually every company that had a strategy that led to a big market," Mr. Whaley said. "Now the market is more discriminating."
Inevitably, this year's sell-off has led to hand wringing about the proper role of the public markets in financing young companies and complaints that investment bankers and greedy venture capitalists took advantage of naive public investors.
"A lot of the ideas that were being floated were a lot of vapor and not a lot of substance," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer of New Amsterdam Partners, which manages $1.1 billion. "We did get into a speculative frenzy."
But Mr. Whaley and other venture capitalists say the truth is more complicated. Despite the frenzy, some of the concept stocks have remained good investments, at least for the people who bought early. Among Internet plays, Yahoo was losing money and had only $1.4 million in trailing annual revenue when the Web site company went public in 1996. Investors who bought it then have seen their investment increase 68-fold -- despite the 72 percent drop in Yahoo's share price since its January peak. In biotechnology, stock in Affymetrix, which makes chips that are used to analyze genes, has risen elevenfold since its 1996 initial public offering, even though it is still unprofitable. Compared with that of Yahoo, Affymetrix's performance may seem downright mediocre. But in the past, elevenfold returns were available only to venture capitalists who could buy into in companies before they went public.
"Why should just the private venture capitalists just have access to those growing companies?" Mr. Whaley said. "On the other hand, you're asking the public market to take risks that it perhaps doesn't know it's taking."
Steve Lazarus, general partner of ARCH Venture Partners, is one who argues that investors should be free to make their own mistakes. "I don't worry about setting up rules of behavior for the public marketplace," Mr. Lazarus said.
Now, some of the non-Internet concept stocks have fallen so far that they may actually be ripe for a second look, Mr. Pearlman said. "The pendulum has swung pretty far over," he said. "I suspect people are going to come back to them in a quarter or two and value them again."

Paper Delays Publication of Critic's Column

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Walter Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal's protean critic of the new economy's tools and toys, did not like the device that a Dallas concern, DigitalConvergence, rolled out this fall. Called CueCat, it plugs into an armchair shopper's computer. When the shopper moves the "cat's" nose across bar codes in a catalog or an advertisement, relevant Web pages pop up on the screen.
Mr. Mossberg's column panning the gizmo on Oct. 12 began: "Just because technology makes something possible, that doesn't automatically mean it's beneficial or convenient for people to use." 
 A week or so later, Mr. Mossberg found out that just because The Providence Journal usually features his columns promptly and prominently on Sundays did not mean it was rushing into print with this one. The article has yet to appear in Providence. The Dallas Observer, a weekly newspaper, pointed out that Belo -- The Providence Journal's parent -- is backing the device. Belo has spent $4.4 million promoting CueCat and related products, according to its last earnings release.
Mr. Mossberg said his columns usually run in The Providence Journal -- his hometown paper -- without incident. He was surprised, he said, because the paper always had "a strong separation of its news decisions from its business interests."
Joel P. Rawson, The Providence Journal's executive editor, first declined to discuss his decision to hold the column. In a second interview, he said he planned to publish it -- and other reviews -- when distribution of CueCats in the area begins on Nov. 12. FELICITY BARRINGER

Omnicom wins advertising's big race by gaining the consolidated account of the Chrysler Group.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE Madison Avenue version of Election Day came four days before the real thing when the Chrysler Group ended a closely fought, two-month battle for its massive consolidated account by choosing the Omnicom Group in New York over True North Communications in Chicago.
The decision, made late on Friday, created what is probably the world's biggest single automotive assignment, with estimated total billings of $1.8 billion; though spending by the Chrysler Group's competitors is larger, it is divided among various agencies. For Omnicom, it is a major vote of confidence in an agency company that is already one of the industry's Big Three in revenue and billings. For True North, smaller than Omnicom on both those measures, it is a serious setback that will wipe out $140 million, or 9 percent of revenue, and up to 15 percent of earnings. 
 "Psychologically, it's huge for Omnicom," said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst for Merrill Lynch who follows the advertising industry. "For True North, it's a genuine economic loss."
Indeed, David Bell, chairman and chief executive at True North, has scheduled a conference call for this morning with investors and analysts to reassure them that it will not be devastated by the departure of its largest domestic client, despite a projection that earnings per share for 2001 will fall 15 cents to 22 cents below previous estimates of $2.41.
"Our management has met such challenges before," Mr. Bell said in a statement.
For instance, "we will move swiftly in pursuing a new automotive account," he added, because "we are confident that there will be opportunities opening up in the marketplace." That was an allusion to reports in trade publications that auto makers like Toyota might be considering changing agencies.
Mr. Bell's statement was released after executives of the Chrysler Group, part of DaimlerChrysler A. G., told him on Friday afternoon that the True North incumbent agency, FCB Worldwide in Southfield, had lost out in the consolidation to two Omnicom agencies, the BBDO Detroit office of BBDO Worldwide and PentaCom in Troy, Mich.
FCB has created corporate campaigns for the Chrysler Group as well as ads for the Chrysler, Jeep and Plymouth vehicle brands and dealers. FCB and predecessor agencies handled those tasks for the auto maker and its predecessor, the Chrysler Corporation, since 1979. BBDO has created campaigns for Dodge products and dealers from 1960 to 1979 and then from 1982 onward. PentaCom has handled media buying since 1992.
"If I were True North, I'd think of it not as a lost account but as an open category," said Alan J. Gottesman, who follows agency performance as managing director at West End Communications/Consulting. "To protect profitability, they either have to replace this or retrench."
There is another alternative.
Michael J. Russell Jr., advertising analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, "Some investors may look at this as an opportunity to talk about strategic issues," said Michael J. Russell Jr., advertising analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, because True North's big advertising agency "now is without an automotive conflict."
Translation: Losing the Chrysler Group as a client makes True North more likely to be acquired by or merge with a rival like the Interpublic Group of Companies or the Publicis Groupe.
"Maurice is waiting for an invitation," Ms. Fine said, laughing, of Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive at Publicis, which is the biggest True North shareholder.
During the review pitting Omnicom against True North, which the Chrysler Group attributed to a need to cut costs after reporting its first quarterly loss in nine years, the two agency companies spoke about sharing the consolidated assignment or merging. Nothing, however, came of those discussions.
"I'm delighted at the decision," John D. Wren, president and chief executive at Omnicom, said in a telephone interview after being told by Chrysler Group executives on Friday that his agency company had prevailed in the review.
"It's a confirmation of a trend going on for some time," he added, "where the big are able to bring benefits to their clients in a complicated, competitive world where they need to streamline the way they articulate their objectives."
Omnicom is ranked No. 2 in revenue among agency companies, behind the WPP Group, and No. 3 in billings behind WPP and Interpublic. True North is ninth in revenue and eighth in billings.
"We did look at the whole Omnicom picture," said Arthur C. Liebler, senior vice president for marketing at the Chrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich. "I think there was an edge on that side."
The size of Omnicom and its other assignments from DaimlerChrysler, like customer relationship marketing for the Chrysler Group, were "very important to us," he added, particularly "in thinking where do you want to be down the road, 5 years from now, 10 years from now."
To handle the consolidated assignments, Omnicom will form an agency named PentaMark Worldwide, incorporating the BBDO Detroit and PentaCom operations along with, at Mr. Liebler's request, "much of the top talent" of FCB Detroit.
In a nontraditional step, the Chrysler Group will have a representative on the PentaMark board. Mr. Liebler told both agency companies that the winner of the review would be asked to provide such a board seat.
Or in other words, no consolidation without representation.
"In many respects, it's a new paradigm," said Allen Rosenshine, chairman and chief executive at BBDO Worldwide, who spoke after learning of the Omnicom selection.
While Mr. Rosenshine declined to discuss what specifically made the Omnicom proposals preferable to True North's, he acknowledged that "the depth of Omnicom resources certainly played a role."

HEADLINE: Patents;
As the scooter market grows crowded, Razor USA sues 16 rivals for patent infringement.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand; Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, a scooter was probably a clunky, red steel icon from a bygone era. By last spring, though, streets, sidewalks and parks across the country suddenly teemed with adults and children whizzing along on sleek, aluminum scooters with brightly colored rubber wheels.
Retailers seized on the craze, and scooters went on sale in sports equipment and department stores, toy and gift stores, catalogs and then even drug stores, minimarts and coffee bars under names like Razor, Oxygen, Stinger, Street Glide, Kickin' Mini and Rush Rider. 
 The Razor started the trend, and last week the company that sells that brand announced that it now owns a patent for its brake design. With that in hand, Razor USA immediately filed a lawsuit charging 16 competitors with infringement. The president of Razor USA, Carlton Calvin, says dozens of companies copied the Razor design in a rush to exploit the fad.
"The patent is on the brake, and the reason it is important is because the people who came to market so quickly after we became popular didn't have time to design their own product," Mr. Calvin explained last week. None of the companies had yet responded to the suit, which was filed on Thursday in California and demands that the defendants stop manufacturing or selling the scooters, Mr. Calvin said. His company had not yet decided whether it would license the patent to anyone else.
"This is just the beginning," Mr. Calvin said. "There may be as many as 50 other infringers. We tried to go after the infringers we felt were the most significant, but as we track others down, we'll try to stop them, too."
The intellectual property world has changed greatly in recent years, with intellectual property increasingly valued as intangible wealth, with the importance of software and computer patents to the new economy, and amid controversies over business-method and biotechnology patents.
But the scooter phenomenon is a reminder that an inventor with a good idea that captures the public's fancy can claim tremendous profits with a conventional patent for a simple mechanical device.
Razor USA represents the JD Corporation, the Taiwanese company that manufactures the scooters. It makes three models, and new versions are planned for next year. Mr. Calvin estimated that about eight million of the collapsible, lightweight scooters have been sold since last November, and he said five million Razor scooters will have been sold by the end of this year.
As with any consumer frenzy, the scooter fad might fizzle as quickly as it erupted. Mr. Calvin said he believes that using a patent infringement lawsuit to shut down competitors will help prolong the popularity of the scooters.
"One thing that hurts the perception of the scooter as a serious product is if you go to your video store or neighborhood deli and can buy your scooter there," he explained. "And that's where a lot of the infringers are going."
"We don't think the popularity is going to die," he added. "There were 28 million active participants in in-line skating last year. That's 28 million pairs of skates. Only seven or eight million scooters have been sold, and it's easier than in-line skating. Hopefully, new products and enforcing the intellectual property will keep the market alive for longer."
A motorless scooter usually has two wheels and none of the gear or chain mechanisms found on a bicycle. Instead, a rider propels it by pushing with a foot -- hence the name "kick scooter." The modern aluminum model can be used like a skateboard, for jumping and performing stunts and trick landings.
Patents for scooters with two wheels date to the 1920's. In July of 1999, a California inventor name Juan Banda won patent 5,927,733 for a "folding, portable, nonmotorized two-wheel scooter." Mr. Banda's design uses a foot brake, too, but with a mechanical assembly that differs from the Razor design. His patent is cited in the patent that now belongs to Razor USA, meaning the patent examiner who approved the latter found it to be different from Mr. Banda's design.
The importers and distributors named in the Razor USA lawsuit are K2, Gen-X Sports, Asa Products, The Children's Place Retail Stores, H.L. USA, Kash 'n' Gold, Rapid Suspension Technology USA, Sun Rams Products, Titan, Todo Dollar Wholesale, Variflex, Wysco, Yunn Haaur Enterprises, Z Scooter, and Zenital.
The patent on which the lawsuit is based is 6,139,035 and was issued to Shui-Te Tsai, a Taiwanese inventor, who assigned it to Razor USA.
If scooters do continue to be popular, other inventors may earn a piece of the market with variations on the theme. Steven Patmont, who lives in Pleasanton, Calif., invented an all-terrain scooter. His design includes enlarged wheels that can roll on "off road" conditions like dirt, grass, trails or fields. The scooter would be sold with the "some assembly required" caveat, since the larger wheels must be shipped alongside the scooter to reduce the size of packaging. The consumer would attach them with bolts. Mr. Patmont received patent 6,012,539.
Robert Brock, who lives in Anchorage, last month won a patent for a scooter with a tow bar extending from its front. A tow rope can be fastened to the bar and attached in turn to one or more dogs. The tow bar is low enough on the frame to ensure that the scooter will remain upright and stable while being pulled. Though he calls his invention a "dog training and exercising device," Mr. Brock also suggests that the scooter chassis can be lengthened (with more wheels added) to carry loads, just like a dog sled. He received patent 6,135,059.

HEADLINE: The Cray Legacy: Taking A Turn Toward Complexity

BYLINE: By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
The final supercomputer designed by Seymour R. Cray will look nothing like a Seymour Cray supercomputer.
This week, SRC Computers, the company Mr. Cray founded months before his death in 1996, plans to introduce its first machine since the loss of the man known widely as the father of supercomputing. After years of secretive development, the SRC-6 will be shown in Dallas at SC2000, the high-performance computing industry's trade show. 
 Absent from the SRC-6, industry experts say, is the simple and elegant architecture of custom-designed and configured processors that was Mr. Cray's trademark. In its place is an idea billed by the company as a virtuoso designer's final revelation, the use of off-the-shelf microprocessors and widely used hardware to build very powerful computing machines.
"The legend does continue," Michael J. Henesey, vice president of marketing and sales, said in an interview last week. "You start to see some of the brilliance in some of the fundamental designs on the machine."
Despite the change in internal architecture, SRC Computers says the new approach provides the same result that won Mr. Cray so many accolades: a revolutionary computer that calculates with blazing speed. Industry experts are more cautious, awaiting the chance to perform benchmark tests.
The SRC-6, a black-and-red cabinet about the size of a commercial refrigerator, links as many as 512 Intel Pentium Xeon chips with a hardware technology called field programmable gate array, or F.P.G.A., a reconfigurable chip frequently used in consumer products like cellular phones and other products that need to be rushed to market quickly.
The use of F.P.G.A.'s is an innovation in high-performance computing, an industry that has seen a recent lull in innovative architecture, said Debra Goldfarb, vice president of worldwide systems and servers for International Data, a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.
SRC Computers says the SRC-6 allows a user to completely change the machine's "'personality," or way it runs its calculations, based on the task. This permits the machine, for example, to race through weather calculations, then be reconfigured to model the flow of air over an automobile surface.
Mr. Cray began his career in the late 1950's as a young electrical engineer at Control Data Corporation, an early maker of computers, now defunct, in Minnesota. There he led the design of one of the early transistor-based computers, the first of many innovative technologies that the industry would later adopt.
He went on to start three companies: Cray Research, which became the world's leading maker of supercomputers, in 1972; Cray Computer Corporation, which ended in bankruptcy, in 1989; and SRC Computers in July 1996. Cray Research combined with Tera Computer Company to form Cray, Inc., based in Seattle.
Jack Dongarra, a professor of computer science at the University of Tennessee, said Mr. Cray's designs were noteworthy for their meticulous attention to the way data moves inside the computer, with an absence of unneeded delays.
"I don't see that in this design," Mr. Dongarra said. But he added, "This machine is a question mark."
Those who worked with Mr. Cray in his last years said the rapid technological improvement across the industry caused him to change his views on design. The low prices of off-the-shelf components persuaded Mr. Cray that he could design fast machines without spending time devising aesthetically elegant designs.
Mr. Cray founded SRC Computers in July 1996 and assembled a team to put his concept of reconfigurable hardware into practice. The company's dreams were shattered in October of that year, when, at the age of 71, Mr. Cray died of injuries he received in an automobile wreck.
"It's like losing Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls," said Steven J. Wallach, an industry pioneer who is the keynote speaker at SC2000. "You can't replace Seymour Cray."
After a short debate on whether to continue with Mr. Cray's dream, a small group of executives ran daily operations while the 10-person design team labored on development.
After the SRC-6's unveiling, Mr. Cray's legacy will be tested in the marketplace. The company he left behind will go to research institutions, governmental agencies and the commercial market to sell them on Mr. Cray's last design.
"We believe this is the way all computer architectures will be working in the next century," Mr. Henesey said.

HEADLINE: Ex-Rival Helps Microsoft Find Wireless Future

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash.

 BODY:
Much has been written about Microsoft's brain drain and the continuing string of newly minted multimillionaires leaving for early retirement.
So how to explain Dick Brass, who made millions during a decade at the Oracle Corporation and made even more as an early investor in the wireless company Omnipoint? 
 As others were cashing out of Microsoft, Mr. Brass came to work for the software publisher three years ago, in order to pursue his personal mission of introducing the world to a new kind of computer: a fully powered Windows "tablet," unfettered by keyboard or cables, that would always be with its owner, always turned on and always wirelessly connected to the Internet.
Mr. Brass is all the more anomalous in Microsoft's hothouse hacker's culture, because he is probably known more for his love of good food and wine and his passion for yachting than for his technical accomplishments. And yet Mr. Brass, who also has a well-known flair for hyperbole and was once the speech writer for Oracle's colorful and occasionally outrageous chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison, may be the best evidence that Microsoft is in the midst of a fundamental cultural shift, even as lawyers appeal the antitrust verdict that would break up the company.
Mr. Brass's supporters say the 47-year old former New York Daily News reporter and editor has the vision and leadership the company badly needs as it searches for new directions, now that Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, has turned over the day-to-day running of the company to Steven A. Ballmer.
Certainly, in a relatively short period Mr. Brass has made his mark here as Microsoft's impresario of electronic books.
But the e-book is just a small part of a bigger idea -- tablet computing -- that Mr. Brass predicts will extend the personal computer to the 50 percent of the population that does not use a PC today. Just two weeks after he came to Microsoft to work on electronic books in 1997, he was able to convince Mr. Gates of the importance of his idea after showing him an ultra-slim wooden model of the dream machine that had been put together by a cabinet maker who had worked on Mr. Brass's yacht.
Three years later, Mr. Brass runs four product development teams comprising almost 400 employees, including those doing research in handwriting recognition and computer systems for use in automobiles.
On Nov. 12, Mr. Brass's role in the company should become much more publicly visible when he joins Mr. Gates at the Comdex computer show in Las Vegas, where Mr. Gates plans to give the first detailed demonstration of the tablet computer still under development by almost almost 100 designers on Mr. Brass's team.
The tablet computer is one of the best examples of Microsoft's multibillion dollar effort to reinvent itself for the presumed post-PC era.
And Mr. Brass, the project's evangelist, has already traveled the globe spreading the word. In October, he even went to the Vatican for a joint news conference on the future of electronic books, an effort on which the company and the Vatican plan to cooperate.
"This is not a crass attempt to get people to buy gizmos they don't need," he said in an interview. "I truly believe that a tablet computer will have a profound impact on the world." Among other impacts, he predicts that The New York Times will publish its last version on paper in 2018.
In Mr. Brass's view of the new information-centric world, tablet computing is the Next Big Thing. But it is also a huge gamble. Sought by many in the computer industry over the last three decades, tablet computing has already been a Waterloo for some of the best and brightest minds in Silicon Valley.
Beginning with the Dynabook proposed in 1971 by the Xerox PARC computer scientist Alan Kay, the idea has died aborning many times and has led to some of the Valley's most celebrated failures -- most memorably in two abortive start-ups, the Dynabook Corporation and the Go Corporation, and the debacle of Apple Computer's notorious Newton.
Mr. Brass acknowledges the peril."We risk the same kind of boomerang that the Newton received when it debuted and championed its handwriting recognition and turned into a two-week hilarious run on Doonesbury," he said.
But there is no turning back, Mr. Brass said, citing plans to put commercial versions of Windows tablet computers on dealers' shelves in less than two years.
Microsoft is wagering that the time is finally right for a tablet computer in the form of an ultra slim slate the approximate size and thickness of a yellow notepad with an ultra-high resolution screen, an all-day battery and the ability to recognize handwriting -- all with a wireless, high-speed connection to the Internet.
Of course, not everyone is buying Microsoft's Next Big Vision.
"The problem with this is that it's still Windows," said Paul Saffo, a computer and publishing industry consultant. "It's like trying to put wings on a pig; you cannot mutate Windows to give a satisfactory experience in hand-helds or tablets."
While begging to differ, Mr. Brass says that however long it takes to reach tablet computing's promised land, it is a journey he has been on for years. In 1979, while he was a features editor for The Daily News of New York, it dawned on him while writing at his computer terminal one day that it might be possible to turn a thesaurus into a computerized reference.
He did just that and today is still credited as the inventor of the first electronic thesaurus and first dictionary-based spelling checker software. The resulting company, Dictronics, which placed various reference works in a form for use on PC's, was acquired by Wang Laboratories in 1983. "I'm a one-trick pony," he said. "I've been trying to turn books into software since 1981."
Born in Brooklyn, and raised in the affluent New York suburb of Scarsdale, he evinces a streetwise style that has more in common with New York's garment district (his father, Sanford Brass, was one of the inventors of Supp-Hose hosiery) than with Silicon Valley's world of software and hardware engineers.
While Mr. Brass's business timing has usually been good, he has also been luckier than most. In 1989 he bought a Macintosh computer for his friend Doug Smith, so that Mr. Smith could produce a proper business plan for his new venture, Omnipoint, a wireless telephone network that was eventually acquired by VoiceStream for $2 billion. Because he was given a 1 percent stake in Omnipoint in exchange for the Macintosh, the favor made Mr. Brass a millionaire many times over.
He has also had his setbacks, though. He moved to Seattle in the mid-1980's with a friend, the late technology writer Cary Lu, to start a company called General Information, which created the first PC-based phone directories. It was an idea that would blossom a decade later, but General Information was ahead of its time and the two men were eventually forced to sell the company without a profit.
Ever intrepid, Mr. Brass was hired in 1989 by the software giant Oracle after persuading Mr. Ellison that there was money to be made from broadcasting the content of newspapers to PC's. Because Oracle was soon brought to near-death by accounting missteps and a wrenching revamping of the company, Mr. Brass's ideas were put permanently on a back burner.
But Mr. Brass stayed on at Oracle for eight years, as senior vice president of corporate affairs, involved in strategy and writing speeches for Mr. Ellison -- who is known for having publicly taunted Mr. Gates. In one speech at a computer conference with Mr. Gates in the audience, for example, Mr. Ellison vowed to buy a surplus Russian fighter jet and fly it over Lake Washington -- the setting of Mr. Gates's waterfront mansion.
Mr. Brass even acknowledges being an accomplice to the group of Silicon Valley executives that worked behind the scenes to help persuade the Justice Department to bring its antitrust suit against Microsoft. In this context, Mr. Brass's move from Mr. Ellison's inner circle at Oracle to Mr. Gates's at Microsoft was a change of allegiance worthy of the novel "Shogun."
In that capacity, Mr. Brass has churned the waters in the traditional paper-based publishing industry. A few months ago, he stood before a room of executives from the paper-making industry, whose jobs he predicted would be made obsolete by e-books and tablet computers, and said, "I see dead men everywhere."
 Mr. Brass has converted at least one former critic -- his wife, Regina Dwyer. Ms. Dwyer, a physician, said she, too, had been skeptical about electronic publishing but had a change of heart earlier this year on a cross-country flight, during which she read Jack London's "Call of the Wild," on a Hewlett-Packard Jornada hand-held computer that was running the Reader software Mr. Brass's team had developed.
"I realized I had forgotten that I was reading on a display," she said.

HEADLINE: Fissures in Sunday Papers' Pot of Gold

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
During the first years of the long, slow slide in daily newspaper circulation, Sunday newspapers were the industry's hope and consolation. Weighing as much as a small stack of two-by-fours, filled with enough discount coupons to wallpaper a room and enough sections to keep a reader curled up for hours, they kept on selling.
Imagine, then, how top newspaper executives felt when these behemoths, which account for 40 percent or more of the industry's total revenue, began to lose their appeal. Circulation reached its most recent peak of 62.6 million in 1993. Six years later, Sunday circulation was down 2.7 million copies, or 4.2 percent. 
 While that decline is far less steep than the drop in weekday newspaper circulation -- down 11 percent from a 1987 peak of 62.8 million -- Sunday papers were the industry's safety net, scooping up advertisers and readers that seemed lost to the daily papers. Now, the net is fraying.
As Gary B. Pruitt, chief executive of the McClatchy newspapers, put it, "the loss of a Sunday reader has a disproportionate impact." John Murray, vice president for circulation marketing at the Newspaper Association of America, said, "Losing a Sunday sale is a bigger loss than any single day, and in some cases than all six other days put together."
So what is happening? Industry executives are not sure; they are looking at the usual suspects blamed for daily circulation troubles -- television, the Internet, lives overflowing with long commutes, undone laundry and children's soccer tournaments.
Then there are changes that hit Sundays harder, like the substitution of multiple three-day weekends for the old two- or three-week vacation, so people are not around on Sundays to buy the paper. Or, perversely, the introduction of color and multiple sections in the daily paper, which makes its Sunday sister seem less distinctive.
The explanations are anecdotal; the threat is real. In recent financial quarters, as advertising rose to flood tide levels, the circulation decline had no palpable effect on revenue. But newsprint prices increased this summer, and Wall Street has grown increasingly bearish on the industry. Problems like Sunday circulation are moving to the front burner.
One option that advertisers support is supplementing circulation data with new data on readership. A spokeswoman for the Gannett Company, Tara Connell, said that even if circulation is declining, the number of readers may increase as copies are shared with family members and friends. "Some of the trends that seem disheartening aren't so disheartening," Ms. Connell said. "People are passing newspapers along, particularly on Sunday."
The most vulnerable element of Sunday circulation is the newsstand copy. Like daily papers, Sunday editions are sold two ways: by subscription, and copy by copy from news boxes, newsstands and grocery stores. Since the greatest drop-off is coming in single-copy sales in many markets, more and more executives are focusing on that issue.
William P. Johnson, circulation marketing chief at the Newspaper Association of America, said, "Grocery stores are basically newspapers' highest sellers of single copies." To stimulate business, he said, "you can sell the $1.50 newspaper for 99 cents."
Another worry is the chronology of Sunday readers. The median age of people who read the papers regularly in a recent survey was 50.8, and 44 percent listed themselves as unemployed -- a group including many retirees. In addition, demographic trends make it clear that women -- 54 percent of regular Sunday readers -- have less time for anything, newspapers included.
In some markets, the Sunday declines are stark. Over the last decade, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Sunday circulation dropped by 142,000 copies, or 25.6 percent; The San Francisco Examiner & Chronicle's by 160,000 copies, or 22.4 percent; The Philadelphia Inquirer's by 180,000 copies, or 18.4 percent.
Bitter strikes and aggressive rivals helped decrease Sunday circulation at The Daily News in New York and at The Detroit News and Free Press by about 40 percent, for a combined loss of more than a million Sunday papers in the two cities.
Right now, a major project studying the declines, both daily and Sunday, is under way at Northwestern University's Media Management Center. A consultant's report on Sunday circulation was a major item at the last annual meeting of the Newspaper Association of America.
Sometimes, lower circulation is intentional. Mike Huot, The Courier-Journal's circulation manager for the last two years, said the newspaper continues to pull back on money-losing circulation in distant parts of Kentucky, staying closer to its core market in the Louisville area. "We just pulled out of 70 communities," he said, adding that, while overall Sunday circulation is down, it inching upward around Louisville.
But for how long? Tim McWilliams, 46, is the owner of Mission Data, a Web development company. He gave up the daily Courier-Journal a decade or more ago, he said, but still reads the paper on Sunday. So does his wife, Ann.
Would they give it up? "This is going to sound terrible," Mr. McWilliams said, "but if it didn't have the TV listings, I'd say, 'Just cancel it.' I can get the news via either radio or TV or the Internet."
For Mr. Huot, the McWilliamses matter. They are an audience that Sears, or the local drugstore or supermarket, would want: homeowners, small-business people with an anchor in the new economy. To attract other busy people who have news alternatives, Mr. Huot thinks he may have to re-emphasize Sunday-only marketing, which had fallen out of favor.
"There's been a shift from thinking that we ought to be selling seven days." he said. "As a result, we may have neglected some of the people who don't have the commitment -- don't want to read seven days."
For advertisers, particularly big retailers, the Sunday trends are a significant concern. While newspaper circulation may decline, newspaper advertising rates rarely follow suit. So some big retailers are letting it be known that while they love newspapers, they could develop an affection for direct mail or smaller daily or weekly papers.
"The loss of the Sunday reader impacts us to the greatest extent," said Terry Prill, who holds the job of newspaper strategist at the Minneapolis-based Target Corporation, owner of major retail stores that sell everything from jeans to cameras to holiday lights. "For our urban stores, we do some midweek inserts," she said, but then added, "Sunday is still where we have a lot of our newspaper advertising."
The corporation, with 1,023 stores in 45 states, loves Sunday papers for their reliable delivery schedules and sizable audiences. Of the hundreds of millions of dollars it spends on advertising annually, a large share goes to Sunday newspapers, which deliver glossy inserts beckoning consumers to stores full of discounted wares. But in 15 of the 21 major markets where Sunday newspapers carried ads for Target's merchandise, circulation has dropped. Sunday circulation for all 21 markets combined has fallen by at least 335,000 copies, or 1.6 percent, since 1996.
As a result, Ms. Prill said, Target and other big preprint advertisers are pushing for more analysis of newspaper readership. (The Newspaper Association, which has been refining these estimates for two years, now figures that each Sunday paper is read by more than two people.) "That is the more compelling information," Ms. Prill said. "We want to know if readers are homeowners; we want to know their ethnicity, their income, their age."
So far, Target has only dabbled in direct mail, but Ms. Prill rules nothing out. Matthew Spahn, director of media planning for Sears, Roebuck, said his company had recently abandoned Sunday inserts in two major markets in the West and Midwest, because ad rates climbed too high while circulation fell too low.
The Newspaper Association, ever upbeat, takes note of the success stories. Among them is the McClatchy Company's Sacramento Bee, in one of Northern California's fast-growing markets, where Sunday circulation is up 7.3 percent, or 24,000 copies, over the last decade.
Mr. Pruitt, the McClatchy chief executive, whose company makes circulation gains a primary goal, said that focus creates "a constant feedback loop, based upon market studies and how we believe we can improve the paper."
For the industry as a whole, Mr. Pruitt said, declining Sunday circulation may be a piece of a more positive picture. In a world of media proliferation, the number of Sunday papers changes little. "The newspapers' saving grace," he said, "may be that they are not proliferating. We are maintaining a mass-market reach much better than our competitors."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: MONTANA;
In Montana, Watching to See If Independent Streak Is Fading

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: MISSOULA, Mont., Nov. 2

 BODY:
When Democrats dream of regaining control of the House and the Senate, their thoughts turn to Montana, a rugged, rural outpost of gun rights, individualism and a sizable disdain for government.
But does that make sense, betting on a state where Ross Perot won 26 percent of the vote in 1992 to help Bill Clinton narrowly defeat President George Bush, where Bob Dole beat President Clinton in 1996 and where polls showed that Vice President Al Gore has almost no chance of winning the state's three electoral votes? 
 Apparently so, judging by the tight race for Montana's open at-large seat in the House and the unexpectedly tense battle that Conrad Burns, a Republican, has encountered to win a third term in the Senate.
The latest statewide polls, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research, showed the Congressional races to be statistical dead heats even as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas nursed a comfortable lead.
In the race to succeed Representative Rick Hill, a Republican who is retiring, Nancy Keenan, a Democrat and the superintendent of public instruction, was virtually even with her Republican opponent, Dennis Rehberg, a former lieutenant governor. The poll showed that after trailing Mr. Burns by as many as 28 points, Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, had almost completely closed the gap. In both races, the number of undecided voters was 10 percent.
"Montana is fiercely independent," Ms. Keenan said on Wednesday at a stop here, explaining how she, Mr. Schweitzer and Mr. Bush could all win on the same day. "Some people like to paint Montana as a Republican state. I paint it as a fiercely independent state. Rarely do coattails work here."
Mr. Rehberg echoed her assessment of voters, using the same phrase, "fiercely independent." But this year, the notion is compounded by the condition of the state's economy. According to figures from the state Department of Labor and Industry, Montana ranked 48th among the states in per-capita income in 1999, last in wages and tied with North Dakota for highest percentage of wage earners, 10.3 percent, holding more than one job.
As a result, political analysts here said that residents are angry and frustrated, so much so that they might be willing to vote in change for the sake of change in all major races, including the one for governor, which is also tight. With Marc Racicot, a Republican, barred from seeking a third term, the lieutenant governor, Judy Martz, and her Democratic challenger, Mark O'Keefe, are in a race considered too close to call.
But beyond that, the elections may offer a hint of whether Montana, for the time being, anyway, may be leaning more toward one political ideology or another.
"Historically, Montana has had some of the most two-party competition of any rural state," said Jim Lopach, a professor of political science at the University of Montana here. "But the big issue is whether we are becoming more like Idaho and Wyoming, which are conservative, or more like Oregon and Washington. These races could help answer that."
If Ms. Keenan wins, she would become only the second woman to represent Montana in Washington, following Jeannette Rankin, a Republican elected to the House in 1916 and 1940.
Ms. Keenan has pledged to improve the state economy and education, emphasizing that improvements in education would help attract new jobs and diversify a state dependent on natural-resource industries like timber and mining. She said the information superhighway passed right though Montana, "without enough exit ramps" to connect small businesses and help them cut through bureaucracy.
Mr. Rehberg, who ran unsuccessfully in 1996 against Montana's Democratic senator, Max Baucus, agreed that the state needed to diversify but not at the expense of its "old economy."
"We've turned our backs on natural resources before we've built the infrastructure to take advantage of the new economy" of technology-based jobs, he said. "We have to do both simultaneously by not overtaxing and not overregulating."
Pat Williams, a Democrat who held the House seat for 12 years through 1996 and now teaches environmental studies at the University of Montana, said the race could be decided by nothing more than Ms. Keenan's sex, an assessment reflecting another part of the culture. "I don't know if Montana men will vote for a woman," Mr. Williams said.
In the Senate race, Mr. Schweitzer, a rancher in his first run for office, has also used the flagging state economy to elicit support, saying Mr. Burns has not used his years in Washington to help the state.
"It's all about leadership," Mr. Schweitzer said before reciting the economic statistics that he repeats in campaign stops. "At least we're ahead of Guam."
Mr. Burns, who once promised to step down after two terms, said his poll numbers had slipped because of an onslaught of negative advertisements and out-of-state money helping his opponent.
He also disputed any suggestion that he had failed state residents, insisting that Montana ranks 15th among states in attracting high-technology jobs, an assertion the state labor department could not confirm. As chairman of the Senate telecommunications committee, he said, "I'm in a position to foster that growth."
Bowing to the slight lead that could make Mr. Burns a winner again, Mr. Williams said the senator reminded him of President Lyndon B. Johnson. "He wears a big hat and has dirt on his boots," he said. "That plays well in Montana."

Why So Close?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The polls have told us little, and the pundits even less. Nobody knows anything.
For Democrats, the best part of the campaign has been George W. Bush's zany zigging and zagging among the land mines of the English language. 
 "They have miscalculated me as a leader," he says.
No doubt. But Mr. Bush's missteps with the language are about the only things that have been fun for Democrats in this campaign.
With the campaign in its final hours, Democrats are still wondering how a nation at peace and benefiting from the greatest economy in its history could consider deep-sixing a highly qualified vice president in favor of a man who frequently finds himself lost in the thickets of national policy.
Speaking last Thursday in St. Charles, Mo., Mr. Bush said of his plan to partially privatize Social Security: "This frightens some in Washington because they want the federal government controlling the Social Security like it's some kind of federal program."
Well, it sure is some kind of federal program. It's the one that put the skids to rampant poverty among the elderly.
The Times's Frank Bruni wrote: "For all the confidence and ebullience that he projected today, Mr. Bush at times seemed a bit scattered, and not only when he misstated the nature of Social Security in St. Charles. At the same event, he seemingly tried to say that prescription drug coverage would be an 'integral' part of his suggested overhaul of Medicare, but he came up with 'in-grit-able.' "
And yet the race is too close to call. Obviously there are many factors, including a weariness with all things Clinton and the media's relentless fascination with the trivial. But I think the main reason the election is close is that George Bush and the Republicans have done a much better job appealing to Republican voters than Al Gore and the Democrats have been able to do with their own unruly Democratic constituencies.
Forget all the chatter about education and prescription drugs and the finer points of a patients' bill of rights. For hard-core Republicans the big issues are the big tax cuts and the opportunity to raid Social Security, one of the Democratic Party's proudest achievements. George W. Bush has not wavered on those issues.
Meanwhile, the Democrats have refused to hammer home their best issue -- the economy; have downplayed their most progressive themes (the environment, to cite one example); have wallowed in their love-hate relationship with Bill Clinton; have flirted with Ralph Nader; and have taken every opportunity to rant about Al Gore's deficiencies as a candidate.
The campaign has been anything but coherent. Now, with the election just hours away and Mr. Bush a half-step ahead in most polls, there is dismay among the party faithful.
"I'm getting ulcers," said Lucille Moyers of San Jose, Calif., a Democrat who had considered voting for Mr. Nader. Now, with the possibility of a George W. Bush presidency staring her in the face, she has changed her mind.
"I'm amazed that Bush has gotten this far," said Ms. Moyers, who is 53 years old and has a 15-year-old son. "I am going to vote for Gore because I'm afraid of what will happen to the Supreme Court if Bush becomes president."
Al Gore was portrayed early on as a viciously partisan fighter, but his campaign was not like that at all. It was restrained. There never was a full-scale assault on the other side.
David McCullough, writing about Harry Truman's famous 1948 campaign, told how Truman traveled the country telling voters the Republicans were up to their old tricks, "trying to fool the people into voting for the interests of the few." Truman urged voters to remember "it wasn't the Republicans who pulled the country back on its feet." And he said the "real leaders" of the "do-nothing" 80th Congress had been "sent off into the bushes to hide until the campaign was over."
Al Gore may know something. Maybe the public really is tired of political conflict. Frightened Democrats may still turn out in droves. And maybe there is enough concern about Governor Bush's qualifications to shift this very close election to Mr. Gore.
Maybe. But it would have been fun to witness some of that old partisan fire.

HEADLINE: The Ambitions of Hugo Chavez

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela clearly means to be an influential symbol of resistance to American influence, not just in Latin America but around the world. Whether he can succeed remains to be seen, though he is backed by one of the world's largest petroleum reserves at a time of high oil prices. Washington will have to watch him warily, though it should avoid unnecessary confrontations.
Since winning election to Venezuela's presidency nearly two years ago, the former paratrooper has quickly established himself as one of the more outspoken leaders of the developing world. At home, through a series of constitutional changes and national ballots, he has consolidated near-dictatorial power and now seeks authority to rule by decree. Abroad, he has helped revitalize the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as a price-setting force, embraced Saddam Hussein and reached out to Marxist rebels in neighboring Colombia. He recently received Fidel Castro in Caracas and agreed to supply Cuba with subsidized oil in exchange for Cuba's dispatch of medical and other specialists to Venezuela. These are not constructive steps. But the rise of a demagogic leftist leader in Latin America need no longer be considered the threat it was during the cold war. 
 It is disturbing to see Mr. Chavez extend an economic lifeline to the Cuban dictatorship, particularly when so many Venezuelans remain mired in poverty. But concessionary oil sales are a familiar tradition in Latin America. Cuba, even with Venezuelan oil, presents little threat to the United States today. The spectacle of Mr. Castro and Mr. Chavez happily bantering in Caracas will not change that.
By reaching for a leadership role in OPEC, Mr. Chavez is clearly hoping to gain Washington's attention and respect. Certainly, prolonged high oil prices could weaken America's economy. But the real power in OPEC is Saudi Arabia, which, for its own reasons, responds positively to American requests to increase supply. Caracas and Washington both have a strong interest in continuing Venezuelan oil sales to the United States. America is by far Venezuela's biggest international customer.
Mr. Chavez's courtship of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, has added an unhelpful new complication to Colombia's long and murderous civil war. He is unlikely to heed American advice on this issue. But other Latin American leaders, like Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, should urge Mr. Chavez to put his influence with the FARC to more positive use by encouraging it to take part in meaningful peace talks with the Colombian government.
Mr. Chavez's vague "Bolivarian" ideology -- inspired by the achievement of Venezuela's national liberator, Simon Bolivar, in briefly uniting present-day Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador -- understandably worries neighboring governments. But Washington can reinforce the political stability of Venezuela's troubled Andean neighbors by helping them strengthen their judicial systems, combat official corruption and develop new export industries.
The biggest challenge to Mr. Chavez's grandiose ambitions lies at home. He has repeatedly promised to revive Venezuela's depressed economy and raise the depressed living standards of the country's poor majority. So far, even with this year's oil price windfall, he has not been able to deliver.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE HISPANIC VOTE;
Candidates Woo Latinos With Ads, but Not Policy

BYLINE: By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Here in Little Village, a world away from the presidential campaign trail, Mexican music spilled from storefronts and passing cars. Young men up and down West 26th Street hawked sliced melon, pineapple and corn from stands in this working-class West Side neighborhood.
Ruben Gonzalez, 37, who owns Gonzalez Liquors, stood in his store as workers installed a shelf, his mind finally made up about the election. 
 "I really don't care for either candidate," Mr. Gonzalez said. "But I think Gore is more for the people. In the community, it's all working people. We've got to vote for him."
His wife, Danila Miranda, 31, is likely to vote for Vice President Al Gore too, but "not because of any campaigning."
"There really haven't been any discussions of any of the issues, no Latino issues, absolutely," she said. "It's a foreign election."
Despite intensive courting by Republicans and Democrats, many Hispanics to some degree feel left out in the cold, said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy of the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights group.
"We seem to have made one transition, which is that candidates get it, that they need to be campaigning in our community," Ms. Munoz said. "And that's been reflected in their use of the Spanish language and in the overall tone and tenor of the campaign, and in the extraordinary amount of marketing that is being aimed at our community."
But "for the most part, the focus has been on marketing and not on policy," Ms. Munoz said. "We would note that Latinos didn't come up in any of the presidential debates."
Among the major issues of concern for Latinos are education, employment, health care and immigration. While these issues may have been discussed by the presidential candidates, how their policies would specifically affect Hispanics was not addressed, some leaders contended.
"The major issue Latinos care about is education," said Rodolfo de la Garza, vice president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at the University of Texas. "The next issue is the economy. On neither of those two major points has Bush come forward with positions that are addressing the Latino concern."
A year ago, the Latino vote was seen as a potential key to the presidential race, an increasingly energized constituency that would be courted by both camps. After millions of dollars in advertisements by the parties and a big voter registration campaign by Hispanic groups, the fruit of that labor finally will come to bear -- or not -- on Tuesday.
What is clear is that the number of Hispanics registered to vote has grown to an estimated 7.7 million, about 5.8 million of whom are projected to go to the polls on Tuesday. In 1996, 6.6 million Hispanics were registered to vote and 4.9 million of those voted, according to the William C. Velasquez Institute, a nonpartisan Hispanic research and public policy organization in San Antonio.
Also evident is that the wooing of Hispanic voters has heightened the attention paid to a community that has long felt overlooked. But some Hispanic leaders and residents say what they still lack as a potentially potent voting bloc is respect.
"I don't think either candidate has done enough" to earn the Latino vote, said Adolfo Aguilar, a spokesman for the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies. Last year, the agency started a $10 million advertising campaign to encourage Latinos to register and vote, he said.
"I hope we are not faced with another situation that no matter which candidate wins, that as soon as the election is over they kind of take a back seat and it loses its priority status that it seems to be receiving today," Mr. Aguilar said.
The number of Hispanics registered to vote nationally has increased 164 percent over the last 20 years, while voter turnout among Hispanics has grown 135 percent in the same period, said Juan Andrade Jr., president of the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute, a nonpartisan organization in Chicago that helps organize voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.
In the next decade, Hispanics are expected to become the nation's largest minority group. This year, they represent about 6 percent of voters. With polls showing the presidential race as one of the tightest in years, a strong showing by Latino voters in states like California, and in New Mexico where they represent 40 percent of the state's voting-age population, could make the difference.
Over the weekend, Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, joined the former Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros and other Hispanic leaders on a tour across the country to help rally Latino voters.
On the Republican side, Gov. George W. Bush's use of Spanish while campaigning and the display of inclusiveness at the Republican National Convention last summer have at the very least won the respect of some Hispanics. But many say that did not overcome the ill feelings for Republicans, who are still seen by many Hispanics as being insensitive toward Latino immigrants.
Mr. de la Garza criticized the use of what he contends have been exclusively Spanish-speaking commercials on Spanish television and radio stations by the Bush campaign. He said it might be interpreted as an effort to appeal to Hispanic voters, but not at the expense of alienating his core constituency.
"The Bush people have long known that the way to reach Latino voters is in English," Mr. de la Garza said. "It's the immigrants who are Spanish dominant and who focus on Spanish language television. They can continue to make the symbolic claim of reaching out to Latinos, but substantively their natural constituency does not see it. So there's very little possibility of a backlash. If it's deliberate, it's a very sophisticated achievement."
Political observers say Mr. Gore will benefit from the tendency of Latinos to vote Democratic.
"What I have seen in surveys is simply the Latino electorate is one where Gore does get the benefit of being associated with Bill Clinton," said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Velasquez Institute. "He gets some of that sheen on him because Latinos are just wild for Bill."
But there is support for Governor Bush among Hispanics who have found appeal in his message of "compassionate conservatism."
Elvis Garcia, 24, a senior in accounting at Robert Morris College in Chicago, plans to vote for Mr. Bush "not just because I'm a Republican."
"I like his proposal for tax cuts," he said, and his emphasis on less government. "I'm actually prideful that the guy is running for president and he is up there trying to speak Spanish. I like that."
In Little Village, at La Justicia Restaurant, Julio Martinez, 32, the owner, says he is looking forward to voting for Mr. Bush. But Mr. Martinez says he is sure his late father, who founded a chain of grocery stores, would not have approved.
"He's from the old school. He's always been Democratic," Mr. Martinez said. "He started from the bottom up. Me, I sort of grew up with a silver spoon in my mouth.
"When it comes down to the presidency, you don't go toward Democrat or Republican," Mr. Martinez said. "You go toward the one who is going to do the best job."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATIC RUNNING MATE;
Lieberman Races to Energize Democrats in Swing States

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Making a last frenetic dash through Western swing states, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman worked today to motivate core Democratic voters to turn out on Tuesday, saying that every vote matters in a presidential race that is closer than any in a generation or more.
"I take it as an omen that fate has called me not just to worship, but to worship at a church called Victory," Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told parishioners at Victory Missionary Baptist Church, one of two black congregations he addressed in this city. "It's a last lap around America, and with your help, the good Lord's help, for Al Gore and me it's going to be a victory lap." 
 Mr. Lieberman began the day in New Mexico, kicking off what was planned as an almost uninterrupted 36-hour final push. Next, he went to Nevada, then to Oregon and Washington to rally supporters in those states. Tonight, he was flying to Minnesota, then Wisconsin, Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania by Monday night. Some of those states are commonly in play in presidential races, but it is a surprise that Democrats are still fighting for Washington, Oregon and Minnesota -- normally reliably Democratic -- on the campaign's final weekend.
Polls show all of the states Mr. Lieberman is scheduled to visit in his last swing, along with several others, to be in play just two days before the vote, evidence that the race is shaping up to be the closest since 1976, or even 1960. The candidates' chief mission now is to energize their most stalwart supporters and generate the highest possible turnouts in areas where they are strong.
"What is on the line is the future of America," Mr. Lieberman said here, to shouts of assent from the worshipers. "Prosperity is on the line. Jobs are on the line. A balanced budget is on the line. Education is on the line. One hundred thousand new teachers. Health care is on the line. Prescription drug help for seniors is on the line. A patients' bill of rights is on the line. The minimum wage is on the line. Affirmative action is on the line. And environmental protection is on the line."
In Albuquerque this morning, Mr. Lieberman visited two diners, hoping not only to persuade voters leaning toward Mr. Gore to go to the polls, but to close the sale with people who remain undecided. "We've got a plan to move the economy forward," Mr. Lieberman told David Mishler, 33, who was having breakfast with his 5-year-old son, Gabriel, in the Frontier Restaurant. "The other team would take us back to deficits, which won't be good for the economy."
Mr. Mishler said afterward that he was undecided, but that his conversation with the senator would "help me decide."
Minutes later, Mr. Lieberman implored Terry Latham, 45, and Ellen Rennard, 46, both teachers who said they were Gore supporters, to vote and to bring as many people with them as possible. "New Mexico is not a big state, but this thing is going to be so close," Mr. Lieberman said. "There are actually scenarios that people have written, that it could be tied in the Electoral College."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: VOICES ABROAD;
Other Nations Regard Campaign With Interest and Wonder

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Lawn party guests at Murli Deora's bungalow feasted on spicy lamb and chicken dishes, curried fish, dal and freshly baked nan. Then Mr. Deora, a Bombay businessman and Congress Party leader, offered his guests comments on a faraway subject that has become daily domestic fare for people around the world.
"You wait and see," Mr. Deora said. "Bush will carry California." 
 At a time when the United States is considered the sole superpower, its economy the engine of international growth and its presidency an office with unchallenged influence on lives far beyond America's shores, people abroad are following the election with keen interest.
Satellite and cable television and the Internet have put people in touch with more details than ever about arcane mysteries like the role of the Electoral College, the importance of winning individual states and the participation of talk show hosts like Jay Leno and David Letterman, whose reputations are global.
"Suddenly we're talking about earth tones, alpha males and 'the kiss' instead of the Balkans," said Gordon Corera, the London-based American affairs analyst for the BBC. "These aren't words that are normally part of the British political vocabulary."
Along with the fascination, there is widespread concern -- and, even among aficionados, bewilderment -- over the American manner of choosing a chief executive. "For a European like me, it is rather like being a Christian at a bar mitzvah or the Jew at a Catholic confirmation," said Philip Stephens, a columnist for The Financial Times. "The narrative is straightforward enough. But you cannot quite share in the secret."
Some baffled foreigners wonder uneasily if Americans understand the consequences to the world.
"On Tuesday," noted the German daily Die Tageszeitung, "the most self-absorbed and least politically interested people in the world are going to elect the most important government in the world."
Pal Martins, a management consultant in Johannesburg who is a member of the African National Congress, said: "What worries me is that the American public is so politically naive. They fall for all the razzmatazz, and they vote for a candidate who is better looking!"
Standards of personal behavior, churchgoing habits, proof of faith and ease with talk show hosts do not figure in the public life of most countries. Issues like abortion that are central to American politics attract less attention abroad. At the same time, issues like executions, which provoke the most passionate opinions in countries like France, where Gov. George W. Bush is called "Mr. Death" in the news media, are not the pressure points for Americans.
The importance of personality politics is understood in Mexico, where a premium is put on good neighborliness and close cooperation. Mr. Bush is liked because of his Spanish-speaking ability and because the country's newly elected president, Vicente Fox Quesada, let it be known that he found his August visit with the governor more agreeable than his drop-in with Vice President Al Gore.
Elsewhere in Latin America, which has received little attention and still smarts over past instances of American highhandedness, there is also an appreciation for the election as beauty contest.
"For the majority of Brazilians, the leader of the United States is, above all, a celebrity," said Paulo Sotero, a writer in Sao Paulo. "He is noticed less for what he says or does than by the star quality his office affords him."
There is widespread dismay over the small role that foreign policy plays in the national debate. "Here you have the choice of the man to occupy the most powerful seat in the world, a 'president of the world' if you will, and the campaign doesn't seem to speak to that," said Gary L. McDowell, director of the Institute of United States Studies at the University of London.
Europeans are surprised that Mr. Bush is doing as well as he is, given his limited involvement with the world outside the United States.
"Whether in London or Berlin or Paris or wherever," said Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University, "you hear people say, 'We don't know anything about this fellow,' and the noises he makes are of a neo-isolationist character, and it is causing a lot of nervous apprehension in the political class. You get Gore, and you get somebody in direct line of succession from Dean Acheson, but you get Bush and you're not even in direct line to George Bush the first, who was so well networked and knew everyone on the international stage."
Professor McDowell said, however, that many Britons felt Mr. Bush was not the only candidate who had demeaned foreign affairs. "They think that Al Gore has reduced foreign policy to a 'who can name world leaders' and 'I bet you can't pronounce that name' kind of strutting," he said.
Mr. Stephens, the columnist, said the European experience with Ronald Reagan suggested a less patronizing attitude toward Mr. Bush. "Foreigners tended to make fun of Reagan, and as it turned out, cutting taxes and defeating Communism were pretty potent ideas," he said. "There is a lesson here. Anyone smart enough to get to the Oval Office is probably smart enough to serve as president."
While President Bush's experience can throw his son's limited firsthand knowledge of the world into embarrassing relief, it plays somewhat to the governor's advantage in places like China where the Bush name is associated with an interest in the region. The elder Mr. Bush was the American ambassador there, and Governor Bush spent six weeks visiting his father in 1975.
Outside of frequent trips to Mexico, Mr. Bush's only other overseas travels have been to an celebration in Gambia as his father's representative, to see a daughter in Italy and to tour the Middle East with other governors in 1998.
While Europeans generally follow American events closely, Russians, mired in their own woes and perhaps less willing to cede to America the title of sole superpower, are so uninterested that only two in five know who the candidates are, said Moscow's Public Opinion Foundation. Leonid Sedov, the foundation's head, attributed this to a shift in attitudes toward America. "We expect less, and therefore we have less disillusionment," Mr. Sedov said.
In India, where interest in the race is intense, Mr. Gore profits from his association with President Clinton, an immensely popular figure since his triumphant visit there in March, and Mr. Bush suffers from his identification with his father, whose administration was viewed as too friendly to the Pakistani military.
Center-left governments in Europe are pulling for Mr. Gore and wary of the consequences of a Bush victory. Anthony Howard, a public affairs broadcaster and writer, said the New Labor government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, in particular, would take a Gore loss very hard.
Foreigners' questioning of the way Americans choose their presidents is nothing new, said Professor McDowell of the University of London, and he pointed to a passage from an 1888 book, "The American Commonwealth," by James Bryce, a longtime British ambassador to Washington.
"Europeans often ask," Mr. Bryce wrote, "and Americans do not always explain, how it happens that this great office, the greatest in the world -- unless we accept the Papacy -- to which anyone can rise by his own merits is not more frequently filled by great and striking men."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE POLLS;
Poll Shows Either Candidate Within Reach of Victory

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
The finish line is finally in sight, but Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush remain ensnarled in one of the closest presidential races in a century, according to the final New York Times / CBS News poll.
The poll suggested that the candidates were still struggling to lure a tiny pool of undecided voters. Among people likely to vote on Tuesday, Mr. Bush draws 46 percent, Mr. Gore 41 percent, Ralph Nader 5 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan 1 percent. While Mr. Bush's advantage is in itself statistically insignificant, it reflected an edge that he has maintained in this and most other national surveys. 
 But the national figures are only one gauge, because the outcome ultimately hinges on state-by-state contests. And the map is something of a jumble: it shows that either candidate is within reach of assembling the 270 electoral votes needed to win.
Beyond being so stubbornly close, the race has been extraordinarily fluid over the last month or so, with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore trading places in many vital states, often within the margin of error. The numbers seem so mercurial that some analysts have begun referring to the Gallup Poll as the Nasdaq.
Several fresh polls yesterday did little to yank this race out of the nail-biter category. They suggested that while Mr. Bush held a slight edge, neither candidate was ahead in some of the most important states.
In Florida and Wisconsin, the margin was one percentage point. In Pennsylvania, it was two. It was dead even in New Mexico and Tennessee. Each candidate has far more votes in his strongest states than he needs to win the electoral votes in those states. For example, Mr. Bush leads by daunting margins in Texas, while Mr. Gore has impressive support in New York.
The national poll conducted by The Times and CBS News was of 1,356 registered voters, including 862 likely voters, and was taken Wednesday through Saturday. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Some internal findings in the survey give Mr. Gore less comfort than the overall horse race.
Mr. Gore's unfavorable rating has risen more briskly than Mr. Bush's since Labor Day. It now stands six points higher than Mr. Bush's, although neither candidate has been able to break through the 50 percent favorability mark. Sixty percent of respondents said Mr. Gore says what he thinks people want to hear, while only 48 percent said that of Mr. Bush.
And in another favorable sign for Mr. Bush, 59 percent of his backers described their support for him as "enthusiastic," while only 44 percent of Mr. Gore's supporters said the same about him.
Probably the biggest differences between the candidates, as indicated in the poll, is their divergent stands on issues. The most striking is on abortion. Nearly 6 in 10 voters said they thought Mr. Bush was unlikely to appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote to keep abortion legal. More than 7 in 10 said the opposite about Mr. Gore; they expected he would appoint judges who would support abortion rights.
Mr. Gore is seen as more likely than Mr. Bush to preserve Social Security. Both men are seen as equally likely to improve education. And while they are both seen as inclined to keep the economy strong, voters say they are more likely to think that of Mr. Gore.
Though neither candidate had particularly high favorability ratings, nearly two-thirds of registered voters said they were satisfied with their choice -- more so than they have been in the last three elections.
Satisfied or not, voters were overwhelmingly pessimistic about the likelihood that either candidate would accomplish much as president. They agreed that a president's efforts to deliver on promises were inevitably hamstrung by the whims and desires of Congress and special interest groups. Only 2 in 10 voters said they thought it was possible for presidents to fulfill their promises.
"I don't really listen to their promises, I think they're mostly hopes and dreams," said Kathryn Smelser, 51, a poll respondent from Visalia, Calif., who has yet to make up her mind. "I don't think they're going to keep their promises unless Congress wants them to."
While neither candidate has broken away with a lead, the poll did indicate that there have been some shifts in the underlying dynamics in the three weeks since the final debate. Mr. Gore has picked up support in the Midwest, which helps explain the tight race in several states there, while Mr. Bush is doing considerably better than he had been in Western states and among women.
Other national polls have also suggested that, at least at first blush, the revelation late last week that Mr. Bush had been arrested for driving while intoxicated in 1976 has not appeared to move voters.
Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said the poll confirmed his belief that his side had a slim yet unmistakable edge. But he predicted a resounding victory for Mr. Bush.
"We're going to have a six- or seven-point victory and a substantial margin in the Electoral College of 320 votes or so," Mr. Rove said.
Although William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, predicted a Democratic win, neither he nor his colleagues sounded quite as confident as Mr. Rove and his team -- or were as willing to suggest as large a margin of victory.
"I think we're somewhere around 290 in electoral votes," Mr. Daley said, "and in the popular vote, two and a half or three percentage points. I absolutely believe we're going to win. But I'm not going to spin you and say, 'it's done, it's over.' The Bush people are trying to build a little momentum by saying that."
Edward G. Rendell, the Democratic National Committee's general chairman, said of the outcome: "I think it's up for grabs. I don't think we're far enough ahead in Florida, Pennsylvania or Michigan to have nailed this down. But we're close."
If the race stays this close, it may be a long night on Tuesday for the ballot counters, not to say the candidates. It could be that any small factor could turn the election, from the weather in Minnesota cutting or increasing turnout to the final advertising flourish from Mr. Nader. While Mr. Nader's Green Party candidacy could cost Mr. Gore a victory in some states, Mr. Gore would not be ahead in the Times/CBS poll if Mr. Nader's support collapsed.
Another possibility is that one candidate will gain momentum in the closing 24 hours and claim a more decisive victory, as happened with Ronald Reagan in 1980, according to polls at the time.
The outcome may hinge on the verdict of an estimated 10 percent of likely voters who are still undecided. Almost half of them said they would probably not decide until Tuesday.
For all the attention these undecided voters have drawn, exit polls in past campaigns suggested that the proportion of these down-to-the-wire voters is no greater in this election. According to exit polls from the last three presidential elections, between 14 percent and 24 percent of voters have waited until the closing week -- if not the closing three days -- before making up their minds.
It could be that some of those undecided voters do not vote at all. Those who were sampled are more likely than other voters to say that it did not matter all that much who wins the presidency. When pressed, those undecided voters divide their support evenly between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush.
In follow-up interviews yesterday, some voters confessed to having trouble deciding. "Neither of them have the vision of an Eisenhower or the fortitude of a Truman," said Dale Winblad, 57, a cabinet maker in Chicago. "It's going to be a crapshoot when I walk into the voting booth. I may even go the route of Ralph Nader."
Henrietta Hicks, 55, a correctional officer in Frankston, Tex., said: "This election is going to make a big change in everybody's lives. I think it's very important that people vote. I've talked to several people who have never voted in their lives, who decided to vote this year."
But for whom? "I probably won't know whom I'm voting for," Ms. Hicks said, "until I walk into the booth."
While the shadow of President Clinton has hung over the race, he does not seem to register much with voters. Only about 1 in 10 voters said they consider their vote to be one against Mr. Clinton, and more than two-thirds said their decision had nothing to do with their sentiments for the president.
Neither side said there seemed to be much fallout from the saturation coverage of Mr. Bush's arrest in 1976. Mr. Rove said his campaign conducted polls in Washington State and California to see if Mr. Bush was affected by the arrest and found that, if anything, news of the arrest emboldened Republicans who thought Democrats were using the matter as a tactic to damage his prospects.
"There's no evidence it had any effect except to intensify our side," Mr. Rove said.
Mr. Rendell countered, saying, "For the undecided voter, it just added another factor in the mix which makes them uncomfortable about whether this guy is really ready."
But he conceded that the Bush camp seemed more eager than his side to begin measuring for drapes in the Oval Office.
"They're awfully confident," Mr. Rendell said. "We're not doing what they're doing, we're not working on the transition. They must know something we don't."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Saturday with 1,650 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 1,356 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
Some findings regarding voting are based on "likely voters," weighted to an overall probable electorate, which uses responses to questions dealing with voting history, attention to the campaign, and likelihood of voting in 2000 as a measure of the probability of the respondents' turning out on Election Day. The method assumes a turnout of approximately 50 percent tomorrow.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.
In a poll conducted just before an election, like this one, there are additional potential difficulties, like dramatic events or campaign appeals made by the candidates between the interviewing and Election Day, unusual patterns of voter turnout and the ultimate decisions made by those voters who said they were undecided or might change their mind or were supporting minor parties at the time of the poll.

HEADLINE: Down to the Wire

 BODY:
The last day of the long presidential campaign brings an end to a remarkable journey for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. It also concludes, for the public, a compelling competition of ideas and personalities. A year ago, both men were aware of the tough challenge that awaited them in capturing the nomination, uniting their parties and slugging their way state by state through the fall. But few predicted that their fight would bring out so many ambivalent feelings among the voters, with so many states in contention at the end. A great deal depends now on the last-minute decisions of swing voters, the effectiveness of major drives to get out the vote, and the final barrage of slashing attack ads paid for by this election's record fund-raising.
The best election eve analyses show that for all the candidates' exhaustive crisscrossing of the nation, neither is ahead in enough states to assure a relaxed evening as they watch the electoral count. Mr. Bush seems to have sewn up most of the Sun Belt and Rocky Mountain West, while Mr. Gore leads in California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The surprise is that states that should have been part of each side's base are still in play. Mr. Bush has been forced to campaign in Florida, which his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, was supposed to have no trouble delivering for him. Mr. Gore has had to spend precious time in a push in his own home state of Tennessee. 
 Turnout is being marshaled not only by party organizations, but also by like-minded groups like labor and women's organizations for the Democrats and pro-gun and right-to-life organizations for the Republicans. Get-out-the-vote drives are also considered decisive for toughly contested Senate races in New Jersey and in New York, where the campaign between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio is filled with high-decibel exchanges. Mrs. Clinton, slightly ahead in the polls, has been campaigning with President Clinton in loyally Democratic parts of the state. That is a smart tactical move for her, just as Mr. Gore was smart to emphasize his determination to move out from the president's shadow by campaigning on his own.
One thing about this race has turned out to be depressingly predictable. It has demonstrated the need for the sweeping campaign finance reform that Mr. Gore has promised to deliver if elected. The amount of "soft money" -- the huge unregulated campaign donations raised from corporations, labor and wealthy individuals -- is coming in at more than $500 million this year, twice what was spent by the parties in 1996. Yesterday Senator John McCain estimated that the truly obscene sum of a billion dollars has been spent in this campaign on television ads. The money is so out-of-hand that even Republicans who oppose reform have been quoted as having second thoughts, since many of their Congressional candidates are being bombarded by unrestrained broadcast spending of the sort that the G.O.P. has favored in past contests.
Another reminder of the need for campaign reform came a month ago from the Committee for Economic Development, a business group favoring a cleanup of the system. The committee's recent survey of business leaders found that three out of five were resentful of being pressed to give campaign money in exchange for access and wanted a soft-money ban. The increasing feeling among businesspeople that they are victims of a shakedown scheme should embolden Mr. McCain and other reformers, who have already promised to make campaign reform a major early fight in the next Congress. On this, as on other policy issues, Mr. Gore has offered a clearer map of the policy he would pursue. That is a point that should not get obscured by the sheer drama of the contest.
To be sure, the race is so tight that some say it is possible for one candidate -- most likely Mr. Gore -- to lose the popular vote and win in the Electoral College. Three times in American history Democrats have won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The campaign in its final phase has provided a gripping horse race. Mr. Bush, with his energy and enthusiasm, continues to draw strength from the voters' view of him as a relatively straight talker. But as this page has argued in endorsing Mr. Gore, voters need to take a balanced look at the future of the economy, the fairness of the federal budget and the depth of the candidates' ideas for promoting social justice and for preserving a strong American role in the world. History teaches that confidence and a genial personality are assets for a president, but that there is no substitute for experience and knowledge in the fields of domestic policy and international diplomacy. These are the qualities by which presidents secure a brighter future for all citizens. If Americans dwell on the depth of Mr. Gore's preparation for the office he seeks, tomorrow should be a bright day for him and the nation.

HEADLINE: Nagging Doubts Linger for the Unsure;
Leaning, but Not Leaping, to Clinton

SERIES: UNDECIDED: The Final Three

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
While last year's Christmas decorations were still hanging from Buffalo to Babylon, N.Y., 11 undecided voters began sharing their thoughts on the United States Senate race in New York. That race ends tomorrow, and only three remain uncertain. All three say they are leaning toward Hillary Rodham Clinton, and all are still focused on the same issues that have nagged them from the start.
Much has changed, starting with the Republican candidate, since these voters agreed to frequent interviews with The New York Times. But for Bob Harrison, a high school history teacher near Albany and an enrolled Republican, the crucial issue is still the upstate economy. For Tom Smith, a customer service manager at a Wal-Mart near Saugerties and an enrolled Democrat, it is "mudslinging," which he says dominates American political campaigns. And for Doug Taggart, a vice president at a Wall Street financial services firm and an independent voter, it is campaign finance reform. 
 These three men have much in common. All are in their 40's, and married with children. All have a history of crossing party lines. All are avid consumers of news, which they say influences them more than political advertising. All had hoped for an issues-oriented campaign, especially after Representative Rick A. Lazio replaced Rudolph W. Giuliani as Mrs. Clinton's opponent, and all are offended by what they consider both candidates' hypocrisy about raising and spending campaign money.
All began with a fervent dislike of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani, and they followed with rapt attention the mayor's health and marital problems. All were skeptical and then enthused by Mr. Lazio, a spunky Long Island congressman, but they say that in the end, they did not believe that he had the presence, the experience or the gravitas for the job.
All said they were impressed by Mrs. Clinton's dogged campaign, which won unusual support in Republican strongholds upstate and slowly seemed to them to smooth the edges of her White House reputation. All agreed that she had won the first debate, the only one of three that all had paid attention to.
Their fellow undecided voters, culled from early New York Times/CBS News polls, made their decisions consistent with their previous party leanings. Of the original 11, two withdrew from the project, three chose Mr. Lazio and three chose Mrs. Clinton. These are the accounts of the remaining three, each of whom says he is close to choosing Mrs. Clinton but undecided enough to expect not to make a decision until tomorrow.
 
Caring About Upstate
Bob Harrison, a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, about 20 miles northwest of Albany, never uses stronger language than "gosh" or "golly," blushes when the subject turns to the Clinton marriage and gets misty at Lazio family photos fit for a greeting card.
Add to that a solid Republican upbringing -- Mr. Harrison's father, a draftsman for General Electric, ran two losing Republican campaigns for town supervisor -- and he would seem like a natural Lazio voter. But at the start of the race, Mr. Harrison was turned off by Mr. Giuliani's temperament and downstate focus. His vote was up for grabs, so he paid close attention to Mrs. Clinton's frequent early visits upstate.
The first lady seemed to care about shuttered carpet mills and toy factories, about places like Amsterdam, where the population has plummeted to 19,000 from 30,000. He found her regional attention flattering. Except for "the group that despises her just because she's Hillary," Mr. Harrison said, "people up here recognize her enthusiasm and like her."
Still, when Representative Lazio entered the race, he seemed an attractive candidate, upbeat and "family-oriented." Mr. Harrison did not buy the notion that the congressman was a pawn of Newt Gingrich. But Mr. Lazio did not seem to him to court the upstate vote. He was quoted in The Times Union of Albany as saying Mrs. Clinton was preaching gloom and doom about the upstate economy, and he made no specific proposals for economic renewal.
Then came the first debate, in Buffalo, where upstate reporters asked questions specific to the region. Mr. Harrison said he thought Mrs. Clinton answered with detail and assurance. Just as important, to this chivalrous man, was what he called Mr. Lazio's rude treatment of his opponent.
Soon, the soft-money pledge that Mr. Lazio extracted from the first lady became the campaign's central issue. Mr. Harrison found no moral high ground here. It was, he said, nothing more than "a political game."
Mr. Harrison said it bothers him that Mrs. Clinton may be using New York as a steppingstone to higher office and may be less than a model of integrity.
He says he questions Mr. Lazio's ability to lead and his indebtedness to the right wing of the Republican Party. In the last week, he said, he has been "turned off by the negative campaign style and ads by both candidates," as they have argued harshly about Arab terrorists and support for breast cancer patients. But, he said, "I have to ignore this" and focus on the issues.
"It's such an important yet such a hard election," Mr. Harrison said yesterday. "But I am starting to finalize a decision."
 
Allergic to Mud
Tom Smith does not expect much from politicians.
Nothing they do or say changes the fact that he scrapes by on $18,000 a year, that his ailing wife works two jobs, that he cannot afford a newspaper subscription or even a secondhand car.
What Mr. Smith looks for in a candidate or a campaign is both simple and elusive: honest talk and no mudslinging. Mainly no mudslinging, a word he has used in every conversation with The Times since January.
When Mr. Lazio entered the race dwelling on the assertion that Mrs. Clinton had moved to New York only to run for the Senate, Mr. Smith called it mudslinging. "That's beating a dead horse to me," he said. "Get to the issues."
When the first lady accused her new opponent of being a pawn of the conservative Republicans, that was mudslinging, too. "It gets old real quick," Mr. Smith said. "I'm still waiting for meat and potatoes."
Mr. Smith characterizes himself as "cynical," saying, "It takes a lot to impress me." In fact, he had nothing nice to say about either candidate (or any of the three, counting Mr. Giuliani) until Mrs. Clinton passed up the opportunity to take what Mr. Smith would have seen as a "cheap shot" at the mayor over his marital infidelity.
"He was wide open to be ripped and she declined," he said. "I like that."
Like his fellow undecided voters, Mr. Smith said he was energized by the prospect of Mr. Lazio's candidacy. He liked his "kid smile" and the way "he exploded out of the blocks." But he was turned off by the congressman's performance in the first debate.
"He's too busy trying to destroy character to come up with any concrete ways of improving things," Mr. Smith said that night at a Saugerties firehouse, where he is a volunteer. "If the vote was taken now, I'd probably go for Hillary."
Echoing Mr. Harrison, Mr. Smith found the tit-for-tat over campaign financing a wash. "They're both using it for their own purposes," he said. "The image of the typical politician is that they're basically dishonest. That's the view most people have."
Mr. Smith said neither candidate had done well articulating positions on state issues. But, he said, Mrs. Clinton has been "pretty straightforward about what her beliefs are, by carrying over what she was for in the White House." Mr. Lazio's chances of "winning me over are slipping away," he concluded. Not gone, mind you, but fading.
 
Seeking Finance Reform
Back in January, Doug Taggart had three main thoughts about the Senate race in particular and the state of American politics in general.
He was growing "more and more disdainful of the whole money situation," he said. Senator John McCain of Arizona was the only candidate who appealed to him. And he said he considered his vote "an extension ofwho I am" and would withhold it if it was not earned.
Much has happened since then, and Mr. Taggart has come full circle. He began by labeling Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton so unlikable as to be "monstrous," but said he detected a "softening" in the mayor after his cancer diagnosis. He bought into the idea of "a new Rudy" and thought Mr. Giuliani's brush with mortality would work to his favor as a candidate.
When the mayor withdrew from the race, Mr. Taggart concluded that the first lady's election was a fait accompli. That feeling did not last long, though, and Mr. Taggart soon declared Mr. Lazio a viable candidate, if only "because of the extent of the pure negativity toward her," he said.
He said he found the new Republican candidate telegenic, "made in New York," with attractive family values. He said he saw himself in the young candidate, who was the same age and also had a wife, two young daughters and a home in the suburbs.
Mr. Taggart said he forgave Mr. Lazio his fervor in hopping aboard the Gingrich bandwagon early in his career. He laughed off a minor stock transaction that may have been a conflict of interest. Mrs. Clinton, after all, had had a windfall of her own.
But the first debate closed Mr. Taggart's mind to Mr. Lazio's candidacy.
Mrs. Clinton made her opponent look like an agitated adolescent, Mr. Taggart said as he watched with his wife in their living room in Cortlandt Manor. There was nothing the least bit senatorial about him, he said; he seemed like a bully. The second debate was a more muted exchange in which Mr. Taggart said he found no winner or loser. He was about ready to declare himself for Mrs. Clinton.
But campaign finance improprieties were bubbling to the surface. When Mr. Taggart read about the first lady's use of a White House invitation list for solicitations, "I blew my top," he said. He ridiculed her insistence that it was an honest mix-up.
Mr. Taggart intends to vote for Al Gore for president. But on the Senate line, he may abstain. "I feel I've been robbed of something," he said, "because she holds more of the values that I hold dear. But where do you draw the line in terms of propriety?"
Abstaining, to Mr. Taggart, is the ultimate undecided vote. "Lazio is definitely out of the running for me," he said. "It's not an external choice -- him or her. She is running against my conscience at this point."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Focus Is on Crucial States in Campaign's Final Hours

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Nov. 5

 BODY:
On another 19-hour campaign day that included a swing through four states where the race is nip and tuck, Vice President Al Gore resurrected the name of Bill Clinton today as he declared to blacks in Philadelphia and union members here that Tuesday's election was about not only material prosperity, but also "prosperity of the spirit."
"Thank you for allowing Bill Clinton and me to bring change," Mr. Gore said at the Morris Brown A.M.E. Church in North Philadelphia. It was the first time in days that he invoked the president who has bedeviled him throughout the campaign but whose popularity in certain circles is undeniable. 
 Mr. Gore credited the "change" wrought during the Clinton administration to the strong economy, adding that "progressive policies are more easily pursued when we have a sound economy."
At an outdoor rally here, he recalled the debt and high unemployment of earlier years and said: "Now, because you gave Bill Clinton and me a chance to change our economic policy, instead of the biggest deficits, we've got the biggest surpluses. Instead of repeat recessions, we've tripled the market."
Mr. Gore pushed himself hard on this final Sunday before the election on Tuesday, attending three events in Philadelphia before heading to three other states in which the election seems nail-bitingly close -- Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa.
Though he refrained from direct assaults on Gov. George W. Bush, he clearly delighted in the increasingly vocal and harsh reaction in his crowds to his Republican rival. As people in the crowd here called out slurs against Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore chuckled and said, "I'm getting some good lines here."
The lines were inappropriate for a presidential candidate to utter, of course, but the vice president egged on his listeners anyway. "I can't use them," Mr. Gore said, "but you can use them."
Mr. Gore's campaign also quickened the drumbeat against the governor by deploying various allies to go after Mr. Bush on a range of issues, including his intelligence, his service in the National Guard, his 1976 arrest for drunken driving, and his spurning of pleas for a hate-crimes law from the family of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged to his death in a racially motivated attack in Texas in 1998.
Perhaps the harshest assessment came from Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. At a rally in Pittsburgh on Saturday night, Mr. Kerrey noted that Mr. Bush said he had not disclosed his drunken-driving arrest because he wanted to protect his daughters, an excuse Mr. Kerrey flatly rejected. "That reminded me of the old song by Willie Nelson, 'Are You Gonna Believe Me or Your Lying Eyes?' " Mr. Kerrey said. "You're covering your rear end," he said of Mr. Bush. "How dare you say that your character is superior to Vice President Gore's?"
At an outdoor rally in Philadelphia this afternoon, Mr. Gore was joined by Louvon Harris, the sister of Mr. Byrd. Ms. Harris, a single mother from Houston, described her brother's death in graphic detail. She added that Mr. Bush had rejected her family's pleas to memorialize him with a statewide hate-crimes law.
Ms. Harris said Mr. Byrd's attackers "spray-painted him black, chained him to a truck, dragged him three miles. His head came off, his arms -- dismembered his whole body. We have a governor of Texas who doesn't think that's a hate crime.
"My question to him is, if that isn't hate, what is hate to George Bush? We had an opportunity to do something for our family. He did nothing."
As Ms. Harris spoke, silence gripped the previously rowdy and distracted crowd of about 1,500 people in Fairmont Park.
Her story prompted Mr. Gore to instruct Governor Bush, long-distance, on the nature of hate crimes.
"Those who take the position Governor Bush takes say that all crimes are hate crimes," Mr. Gore said. "Well, is shoplifting a hate crime? There are crimes committed by people who have various motivations, and all crimes are wrong, and all crimes that result in the loss of a life must be severely punished, of course.
"But crimes that are motivated by hatred are different, and here's why," Mr. Gore said. "They are intended to have more than one victim. They are intended and aimed not only at the victim who is initially singled out for the tragedy. They are intended to intimidate and dehumanize an entire group of people, to give expression to the hatred that corrodes the soul."
The Byrd saga provided the emotional high point for Mr. Gore during another long day of frenetic campaigning.
Much of Mr. Gore's message was aimed at core Democrats, especially blacks and union members, whom Mr. Gore needs to push to the polls.
Many of the people in his crowds were die-hard partisans, anxious about the closeness of the race and bewildered by Mr. Bush's appeal.
"I'm definitely nervous," said Beth A. Freshwater, 36, an insurance underwriter in Philadelphia who came to the rally in the park. "It's so close, and I can't understand why. It seems pretty clear-cut to me. I just think Al Gore has so much more experience and his ideas are so much better. The comments I keep hearing about Bush are, 'He seems like a nice guy,' or 'I don't think he'll do that much harm.' It's like they don't even listen to what he's saying."
George W. Griscom, a retired high school teacher who drove from his home in Mount Laurel, N.J., to hear Mr. Gore in Philadelphia, said he too could not comprehend Mr. Bush's appeal.
"The only people that should be voting for him are those making $300,000 or more, and that's not 48 percent of the public," he said, referring to the level Mr. Bush is registering in some polls.
From the pulpits, Mr. Gore said material prosperity was not enough.
"The most important form of prosperity we need to focus on is the prosperity of the spirit," Mr. Gore said at Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Philadelphia. "We must decide in America whether or not we're going to make a path toward inclusion, investment and growth, toward justice and opportunity and hope, or whether we're going to be satisfied to stop the journey and tread water."
Reactions from the congregants varied. Claudia Bell, a secretary for the Philadelphia Housing Authority, said that Mr. Gore seemed "direct," but added that compared to Mr. Clinton, "he is not a starburst of charisma." Ms. Bell said her friends were not enthusiastic, per se, about the election, "but people who were not going to vote are paying attention to the point that they realize they need to vote."
Ann Edmonds, 76, a retired machine operator and a soprano in the church choir, said she was voting for Mr. Gore because "I've been a Democrat all my life."
"I remember Hoover," Ms. Edmonds said. "We don't want anymore of that. No, no."
More ambivalent was Kevin Wilson, 41, a portfolio manager for high-income investors. "I don't think either side is capable of doing what they say they're going to do." Mr. Wilson said he was especially skeptical that Mr. Gore could keep his pledge to stand up to the big pharmaceutical companies. "There's no way Merck and Pfizer and Lilly are going to roll over and play dead," he said.
In addition, Mr. Wilson added: "I'll miss Clinton's charisma and the eventfulness of Clinton's term, but do you think George W. Bush is competent or capable of running the country?" He answered no to his own question and said that he might vote for Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee.
Between church visits, Mr. Gore visited the Melrose Diner, a Philadelphia institution, where the cooks hummed "Hail to the Chief" as he walked by. And there, his pitch about being a Vietnam veteran paid off with Ed Domenick, 67, a maintenance worker at the diner and a veteran. When he saw Mr. Gore, Mr. Domenick told him, "You've got my vote, 'cause of Vietnam."
The Gore campaign has been making a concerted effort to rally veterans around the vice president, who enlisted in the Army. On Saturday night, Mr. Kerrey and Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, both highly decorated Vietnam veterans, railed against Mr. Bush at a union rally in Pittsburgh.
Mr. Kerry said: "Those of us who were in the military wonder how it is that someone who is supposedly serving on active duty, having taken that oath, can miss a whole year of service without even explaining where it went," he said of time that Mr. Bush had not accounted for.
Mr. Kerry also questioned Mr. Bush's intelligence.
"I'll tell you, all over this country people are asking whether or not George Bush is smart enough to be president of the United States," he said. "And I'll tell you what's really scary -- one of the people asking me was Dan Quayle."
 
In His Own Words
AL GORE
 
From remarks yesterday in Dearborn, Mich.:
"There's a lot that he's said that I think needs more attention. Why, after the tragedy that befell James Byrd, should he oppose a hate-crimes law? I think that we need a hate-crimes law because those offenses are different. They are intended to dehumanize a whole group of people. African-Americans have suffered. Arab-Americans have suffered also. Hispanic-Americans have suffered. Jewish-Americans have suffered.
I think that we need to enforce our civil-rights laws. I think it's very important that we respect the rights of all Americans. I think it's very important that the Conyers-Bonior bill pass that bans the use of secret evidence. I think we need to stand up for the rights of all Americans. . . .
Now, I'm asking for your support because I'm for the people and not the powerful. I know very well, as I've said before, that I won't always be the most exciting politician, like Carl Levin. But I will work hard for you every day and I will never let you down and I'll fight for you with all my heart. I know how to take on the special interests. I know how to win for you. I've got 24 years of experience and I've never hesitated to take on special interests.
Now, Governor Bush says that he'll get along with everybody in Washington. Now, there's a lot to be said for that. I think that we need less partisanship. But the question remains, Who does he want to get along with? The top one percent? The H.M.O.'s? The big oil companies? The insurance companies? The drug companies? Sometimes, a president has to be willing to say no in order to say yes to you -- has to say no to the special interests to say yes to the public interest. I know how to do that. And I can say no to the special interests with a smile."

HEADLINE: Cell Phone or Pheromone? New Props for the Mating Game

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
"Is that a cell phone you're taking out of your pocket? Well, then, I'm glad to see you!"
That, it seems, is the fondly imagined fantasy of the ambitious young lads of Liverpool, who, a new study shows, regard their mobile phones less as practical business tools than as handy little mate lures. 
 Observing patrons at an upscale pub frequented by lawyers, entrepeneurs and other single professionals, researchers from the University of Liverpool discovered that men had a markedly different relationship to their cell phones than did women.
Not only did significantly more men than women appear to own cell phones, but they clearly wanted everybody else to know they owned them, too. Whereas the women in the pub generally kept their phones in their purses and retrieved them only as needed, the men would take their phones out of their jacket pockets or briefcases upon sitting down and place them on the bar counter or table for all to see.
Lest they be overlooked, the men fiddled with them often, picking them up, moving them here or there, checking to be sure the battery was charged.
As the researchers see it, the men are using their mobile phones as peacocks use their immobilizing feathers and male bullfrogs use their immoderate croaks: to advertise to females their worth, status and desirability.
The study, which appears in the current issue of the journal Human Nature, shows how new technology subserves primal impulses -- specifically, the impulse to strut.
It also suggests that the breathless evolution of today's technology is driven, not merely by scientific innovations or the demand for heightened worker productivity, but by the social need of people to find novel ornaments and status symbols that distinguish them from the pack.
Pulling no punches, John E. Lycett and Robin I. M. Dunbar of the Center for Economic Learning and Social Evolution, entitle their report, "Mobile Phones as Lekking Devices Among Human Males."
In nature, a lek is a communal mating area where males gather to engage in flamboyant courtship displays, and females stroll by to judge the performers and presumably choose the fittest, most resourceful or most amusing of the lot.
Hammer-head bats, sage grouse, bowerbirds, walruses, Ugandan kob and fallow deer are among the species that engage in a lekking-style courtship system. And so, too, it seems, do some humans, at least in the pubs of Liverpool.
"This is quite an interesting paper," said Dr. Geoffrey F. Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles and the author of "The Mating Mind." Mobile phones are a "clever positional good," he said, a positional good being something that marks one's social position.
"The phones have an ostensible purpose, an excuse for carrying them around," Dr. Miller said. "If somebody brought a laptop computer into bar and started clicking away on it, even though it might be 20 times more expensive, it would be considered really tasteless to be seen using it in a bar."
On the other hand, a person who pulls out a phone and starts yakking away on it looks for all the world like a smooth operator -- even when that phone is phony. Dr. Lycett said that the new study was inspired by newspaper accounts of how, when night clubs in South America began requiring patrons to check their cell phones at the door, it was discovered that a huge percentage of the phones were fake.
"At the same time, stores in the U.K. were selling fake mobile phones, and some were quite sophisticated -- they even would ring and light up," said Dr. Lycett, in an interview on a conventional telephone. "We wondered, Why would anybody buy a fake phone?" The researchers also had casually noticed that men seemed to play around with their phones more than women did, prompting them to wonder if there were sex differences in cell phone behavior.
They chose to study the behavior formally in a pub, which is the center of social life in Britain, and to focus on professionals, a socioeconomic group with the means and presumed need to own cell phones.
Attending the same pub on 23 evenings over a four-month period, the researchers, financed through a grant from the university, discreetly kept track of all patrons who sat at the pub's 13 tables. They recorded who obviously had a phone -- that is, used it or displayed it -- and how he or she handled the phone. Over their study period, 54 percent of the pub patrons were men. Of the men, 32 percent were recorded as possessing a cell phone, whereas only 13 percent of the women did.
"It's possible that more women had phones than this and we never saw them, but that goes to the heart of what we're saying: that there's a gender difference in the way they're displayed and used," said Dr. Lycett.
To the women, a phone was just a phone, while the men fingered theirs so often you'd have thought it was, well, a cigar.
The researchers noted also that the amount of time the men spent toying with and displaying their phones increased significantly as the number of men relative to women increased, rather as male peacocks fan open their feathers more vigorously the greater the number of competing suitors in view.
Whether the exhibiting of a cell phone ever worked as a male courtship display -- that is, whether it attracted any women -- the researchers could not determine. Dr. Miller pointed out that, as status symbols go, cell phones were not mere indicators of one's bank account, as a Rolex watch or a Jaguar roadster might be. "What's being displayed here is not so much wealth as social importance, and the fact that you're plugged into social network and are important enough to be able to be reachable all the time," he said.
That association, said Dr. Miller, could explain why cell phones are status symbols not merely for young male barristers in Liverpool, but also for, say, female adolescents in Southern California. "Teenage girls have a high variation in the size of their social networks, which they love to advertise, particularly to other girls," he said. "It's a form of female-female competition."
Such tele-competition may even be healthy -- for girls and boys alike. In the current issue of The British Medical Journal, Clive Bates and Anne Charlton of the Action on Smoking and Health organization in London posit a link between recent declines in smoking rates among British adolescents, and the concommitant rise in the number of teenagers who own cell phones.
The researchers point out that cell phones, like cigarettes, keep the hands, mouth and weekly allowance well occupied, and that both objects satisfy a pubertal desire to appear mature, worldly, involved, indifferent, rebellious, ambitious, autonomous, fashionable and fully peer-bonded.
Fashion, though, is a ruthless slave master. Dr. Lycett said that, since his data were collected a couple of years ago, basic cell phones have become comparatively cheap and practically universal. Hence, the pressure is on to own a cell phone with the largest suite of extraneous features and, paradoxically, the smallest dimensions.
But small does not mean invisible or unlekkable. Small means -- you need a headset to go with it! Now if only somebody could figure out how to rig up a pair of antlers to this thing!

HEADLINE: Single Mothers, Working

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Far More Single Mothers Are Taking Jobs" (news article, Nov. 5):
It is good news that increased numbers of single mothers can leave welfare and earn more income in times of economic boom. Independence from a humiliating bureaucracy and improved self-esteem are pluses. 
 But gains are offset by a lack of other resources, including health care. As you report, the poorest fifth of female-headed households have experienced a drop in disposable income. Nor is data provided regarding the quality of child care that such women must rely upon, especially in the context of absent father figures in the lives of small children.
A culture tuned into "where is the money?" can certainly ask "where are the men?"

HEADLINE: Bill Gates, Skeptic

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I have worked in high technology for 16 years, and I share Bill Gates's skepticism that technology and capitalism alone will somehow solve fundamental problems like poverty, illiteracy and lack of health care around the world (news article, Nov. 3). 
 In the United States, where it should have been easiest to accomplish major social changes through technology (given the wide proliferation of high technology, a very strong economy and a high rate of literacy), it is clear now that the gap between the rich and the poor has actually increased over the last decade. In the same period in India, at a time when that country was turning into one of the leading software centers in the world, the percentage of the population living in poverty increased significantly.
It will take more than simple faith in technology to solve major social problems.

HEADLINE: Choices For the Election

 BODY:
As they vote in schools, libraries and community halls across the country, Americans will be doing more than electing a new president and Congress. In some mysterious but highly ritualized way, Election Day also marks a familiar transition in our political process. With the selection of new officials, we move from a highly charged period of partisan debate toward a new season of unity, cooperation and accomplishment. At its most idealized, Election Day brings the voters a sense of unity with the presidential candidates. The candidates fresh from the trail and the voters entering their millions of voting booths are joined in the quadrennial enterprise by which the shining Republic renews its strength.
Paradoxically, in this election many people have probably felt distant from the presidential process even while being in suspense about it. Those citizens not living in the decisive battleground states have gotten little of the candidates' time and a smaller share of their advertising budgets. 
 But the fact that the presidential campaign feels as if it were being waged someplace else should not be taken as an excuse for not voting. In every state, hundreds of local, state and national offices are in play, and the outcome of those races, in catalytic combination with the presidential contest, will determine the political texture of the next four years. We regard a heavy vote as particularly important in the close Senate races in New York, where we have endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton over Rick Lazio, and in New Jersey, where our choice, Bob Franks, has moved ahead of Jon Corzine in the final polls.
The tone of this campaign year should stimulate enthusiasm among those voters who have asked for more civility in the process. Except for some nastiness in the early phases of the Republican presidential contest, this year has been largely free of the calculating use of divisive issues touching on race or religion. Unlike past Republican presidential nominees, Gov. George W. Bush has not sought to use school prayer as a wedge issue. The Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore, has been accused of waging class warfare, but in fact he has offered a well-documented critique of a Bush tax plan that unfairly rewards the rich. We would argue that turnout is important not only to the chances of the candidate we have endorsed, Mr. Gore, but also as an affirmative public response to the serious tone of the campaign.
Below we list again our choices in the presidential election and in selected competitive races in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. We hope our recommendations will receive serious consideration, but our final exhortation for the 2000 campaign is for everyone to vote, regardless of choice of party or candidate. Participation is what makes the system work, infusing it with credibility and renewal. Both qualities will be needed as the country moves toward new leadership in the White House, a new Congress and a new chance to address pressing needs at the local and national levels.

HEADLINE: May Stores Says Profit Fell 38%

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The May Department Stores Company, which operates Lord & Taylor, Filene's and other chains, posted a 38 percent decline in third-quarter earnings yesterday because of markdowns to clear spring and summer inventory.
The company, based in St. Louis, reported net income for the quarter ended Oct. 28 of $85 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $138 million, or 38 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 5 percent, to $3.33 billion from $3.17 billion. Same-store sales -- sales at stores open at least a year -- fell 0.1 percent, the company said. 
 Analysts had expected the retailer to report a profit of 25 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Shares of May rose 31 cents, to $28.44.
Sales at many department stores have been sluggish since May as consumers, wary of a slowing economy and rising fuel prices, cut back on spending. As a result, many retailers have had to cut prices to encourage sales.
Looking ahead, May said that the clearance of spring and summer merchandise was complete and that inventories were in good shape.
One Wall Street analyst said May shares were trading higher because the company surpassed forecasts and because its sales of fall merchandise were healthier than those of this summer.
May operates 428 department stores and 118 David's Bridal stores in 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Its other chains include Hecht's, Foley's and Kaufmann's.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Cautious Investors Sell Treasuries and Wait for Election Day

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday in cautious trading as a hesitant market braced for the results of today's elections and prepared for new government debt supply expected this week.
With the outcome of the presidential and Congressional races too close to call, analysts said investors sold Treasuries to stake neutral positions and to prepare for a potentially volatile market reaction after the election. 
 "It's too close to call for anyone to feel comfortable," said Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. "I think everyone is expecting a certain amount of volatility once we get the results."
Analysts also said bonds came under pressure as dealers made room for the Treasury's planned sale of $12 billion of five-year notes today and $8 billion of 9 3/4-year notes tomorrow in its quarterly refinancing.
The price of the closely followed 10-year note fell 8/32 , to 997/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.86 percent from 5.82 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond fell 12/32 , to to 1053/32 . Its yield rose to 5.88 percent from 5.86 percent.
Economists said market participants were nervous about the election because the fiscal proposals of both candidates leave little room for future paydowns of government debt.
Expectations of limited Treasury supply as the government runs surpluses have lifted the price of Treasuries for most of this year.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 3-Mo. Bills 6-Mo. Bills Price 98.428 96.914 High Rate 6.22% 6.11% Investment Rate 6.41% 6.39% Low Rate 6.17% 6.05% Median Rate 6.20% 6.09% Total applied for $19,192,850 $17,695,936 Accepted $8,026,350 $5,428,436 Noncompetitive $1,408,188 $1,572,812

HEADLINE: David Brower, an Aggressive Champion Of U.S. Environmentalism, Is Dead at 88

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
David Brower, an uncompromising environmentalist who spent more than half a century fighting to protect America's wilderness areas against speculators, developers, state agencies and the federal government, died on Sunday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 88.
Mr. Brower was widely regarded one of the most articulate and powerful conservationists of the 20th century, and at various times led a number of environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth. 
 Long an opponent of compromise in the face of efforts to tame wild lands, he was a primary force during the 1960's in preventing the construction of two major government dams in the Grand Canyon. He also played a pivotal role in blocking a dam, proposed for the Green River in Utah, that would have flooded parts of Dinosaur National Monument.
Over the years he also fought, sometimes alone, to maintain the wilderness of the Northern Cascades in Oregon and Washington, Point Reyes and Kings Canyon in California, the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina, the Red River Gorge in Kentucky, the Allagash Wilderness in Maine and the Everglades in Florida.
He sought to protect redwoods from loggers, animals from furriers, porpoises from tuna fishermen and the public from nuclear energy and any number of projects proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Bureau of Reclamation.
Mr. Brower (the name rhymes with "hour") also spoke against the indiscriminate use of herbicides and pesticides.
"You are villains not to share your apples with worms," he would tell his audiences. "Bite the worms. They won't hurt nearly as much as the insecticide does."
Mr. Brower's life seemed to be a perpetual joust against what he found to be the careless use of land for commercial purposes.
"We're not blindly opposed to progress," he said, "we're opposed to blind progress."
In a book about Mr. Brower, "Encounters With the Archdruid" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1971), John McPhee likened him to a circuit-riding preacher on environmentalism, who referred to his standard conservation talk as the Sermon.
"Brower," Mr. McPhee wrote, "has computed that we are driving through the earth's resources at a rate comparable to a man's driving an automobile a hundred and twenty-eight miles per hour -- and he says that we are accelerating. He reminds his audiences that buffalo were shot for their tongues alone, and he says that we still have a buffalo-tongue economy.
" 'We're hooked on growth. We're addicted to it. In my lifetime, man has used more resources than in all previous history.' "
If Mr. Brower was a druid, he was an angry one; he seemed to maintain a level of indignation that would have burned out a lesser man.
"I wish we didn't have to be angry all the time," he said. "But someone has to get angry."
Russell Train, who in the early 1970's was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, once observed: "Thank God for David Brower. He makes it so easy for the rest of us to be reasonable."
In 1952, Mr. Brower became executive director of the Sierra Club, the conservation organization founded in 1892 by the naturalist John Muir. It had a membership of 7,000 and an annual budget of $75,000 when Mr. Brower started. By 1969, when he stepped down under pressure by members who thought he had gone too far too fast, it had 77,000 members and assets of $3 million, and had probably blocked or delayed construction of at least $7 billion.
Because of its opposition to the two proposed dams in the Grand Canyon, the Sierra Club lost its tax-exempt status in 1966, on the ground that it had become much a political organization. Mr. Brower later told the membership that it owed thanks to Sheldon Cohen, the commissioner of internal revenue, because his ruling had attracted new, militant members who did not care whether joining gave them a tax advantage.
Even as it moved from the gentility of Muir's time to the militancy of Mr. Brower, the Sierra Club attracted favorable notice from more traditional conservationists with its handsomely illustrated books, which argued the cause of nature with photographs. The books were Mr. Brower's idea, and among those for which he was editor and publisher were "Summer Island -- Penobscot Country"; "Time and the River Flowing," which described the Grand Canyon; and "Gentle Wilderness -- The Sierra Nevada."
But the Sierra Club's militancy continued to irritate some members, none more so than the photographer Ansel Adams, who described Mr. Brower's followers as "almost inquisitorial" toward those accused of despoiling the environment. Some in the club, for instance, were open to proposals for the construction of the Diablo Canyon nuclear reactor in California; Mr. Brower despised the project, which was ultimately built at 17 times the cost originally estimated and began operating in 1985, fully 13 years behind schedule.
In 1969, after the defeat of a slate of candidates for Sierra Club positions who were friendly to him, Mr. Brower resigned as executive director and founded two new groups: Friends of the Earth and the John Muir Institute for Environmental Studies.
He was dismissed as chairman of Friends of the Earth in July 1984 amid complaints that he had been too dictatorial and too wasteful in refusing to carry out staff cuts ordered by the board. He was reinstated a month later but resigned from the board in 1986.
In the meantime, there had been a reconciliation between Mr. Brower and the Sierra Club, which appointed him to its board in 1982. Over the years, the Sierra Club's 600,000 members would re-elect him to the 15-member board by overwhelming margins. He was last elected in 1998 but resigned this spring, once again citing differences between the board's agenda and his.
"The world is burning, and all I hear from them is the music of violins," he said in resigning. "May the Sierra Club become what John Muir wanted it to be and what I have alleged it was."
In his last years, Mr. Brower, still a fit and imposing man of 6 foot 3, with a shock of white hair, continued to stake out a militant's view of conservation, winning new adherents to the cause. He helped establish an organization of steel workers and environmentalists called the Alliance for Sustainable Jobs and the Environment, based in Portland, Ore.
A supporter of Ralph Nader, Mr. Brower flew to Denver in June for the Green Party convention and cast his absentee ballot for president the day before he died, said Mikhail Davis, his assistant at the Earth Island Institute in San Francisco, which Mr. Brower founded in 1982 to promote conservation projects around the world.
Mr. Brower is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Anne Hus; three sons, Robert and John, both of Berkeley, and Ken, of Oakland, Calif., and a daughter, Barbara Brower of Portland.
David Ross Brower was born on July 1, 1912, in Berkeley, the son of Ross J. and Mary Grace Barlow Brower. His father, who took the family on frequent camping and hiking trips, taught mechanical drawing at the University of California and then, having lost that job, managed and did janitorial work in two buildings he owned.
Mrs. Brower, also a lover of the outdoors, lost both her sight and her sense of smell to an inoperable brain tumor when David was young; he later recalled taking her on walks after she had lost her vision. He became permanently interested in both mountain climbing and butterfly collecting, enjoying his ability to identify almost any butterfly that fluttered near him.
Mr. Brower was admitted to the University of California at Berkeley and studied there in the early 1930's, but dropped out in his sophomore year. He would later tell his friends that he was "a graduate of the University of the Colorado River."
During World War II, he was an officer with the 10th Mountain Division, which fought in northern Italy, and wrote a manual of instruction for mountain troops.
After the war he went back to an old job at the University of California Press, where he edited manuscripts, and remained there until assuming the leadership of the Sierra Club, of which he had been a member since 1933, nearly two decades earlier.
In the 1960's and 70's, environmentalists were sometimes perceived as elitists who did not care if their activities contributed to unemployment. In his autobiography, "For Earth's Sake: The Life and Times of David Brower" (Gibbs Smith, 1990), Mr. Brower said, "We are in sympathy with the straits of unemployed loggers, but before we let sympathy be an easy route to expedience, let us consider who else needs some sympathy."
As a man who disliked cars, Mr. Brower added, "We can, upright people that we are, rediscover the foot; we can save a place to walk in, and an antelope, too."

HEADLINE: Philippine Panel Sends Impeachment Case to Full House

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Nov. 6

 BODY:
A Congressional committee in the Philippines sent an impeachment complaint today to the full House of Representatives, where more than enough members have said they will vote to remove President Joseph Estrada on charges of corruption.
If that happens, the complaint would move to a vote in the Senate. 
 The rapid committee action, cutting short what could have been a two-month process, was taken as public and political pressure grew for the removal of Mr. Estrada, whom a crony has accused of accepting nearly $11 million in bribes, mostly from an illegal gambling operation.
Publicly, Mr. Estrada continued to stand firm against widespread calls for his resignation. "I am not negotiating for any deals and have no intention of doing so," he said today. "I declare my steadfast commitment to defend my innocence against my accusers in the proper venue of our constitutional process."
But Manila was filled with rumors that private discussions were under way for a graceful exit for the president, who has been in office since June 1998.
Finance Secretary Jose Pardo, who is close to the president, said, "I have offered myself as a channel of communication" with Mr. Estrada's critics. The critics are led by former President Corazon C. Aquino.
The president's chief aide, Ronaldo Zamora, denied published reports that Mr. Estrada was seeking a negotiated exit.
"We don't know anything about that," Mr. Zamora said. "President Estrada has not given anyone permission to start any kind of negotiations, because he is determined to hold on to his position."
The view of most experts in Manila was that it was only a matter of time before Mr. Estrada left office, through either impeachment or resignation.
Though he was elected by an overwhelming popular vote, Mr. Estrada's base is among the poor, and he has never had the respect of the political and business elites. The economy has suffered under him from mismanagement and lackadaisical leadership, as well as from an atmosphere of corruption and cronyism.
The fast-growing momentum toward his removal drove the Philippine stock market to rise 16 percent today, its biggest one-day gain in 13 years. The currency, the peso, which has plummeted since the corruption accusations emerged last month, rose to 49 to the dollar today, up from a record low of 51.59 last week.
The crucial factor appeared to be the defections over the weekend from Mr. Estrada's party by the Senate president, the House speaker and more than 50 other members of Congress. Filipinos were also stirred over the weekend when tens of thousands of people rallied against the president.
The image was compelling. The anti-Estrada forces are led by what are known as the heroes of the peaceful ouster of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986 -- notably Mrs. Aquino and the influential Roman Catholic cardinal, Jaime Sin.
As in 1986, opposition forces are creating a sense of inevitability that could be self-fulfilling.
After the legislative defections, 99 House members signed a resolution endorsing impeachment, well over the 73 members needed for a one-third vote to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Speaker Manuel Villar said the resolution would most likely be submitted to the Senate after Congress resumed its regular session, on Nov. 13. A two-thirds vote in the 22-member Senate would be needed to remove the president from office.
The Senate began preparations today for its impeachment vote. Senate President Franklin Drilon ordered the drafting of rules for a procedure that has never been used.
Mr. Estrada was buoyed by the release of a survey that showed that his popularity remained strong among much of the public that loves his tough-guy persona, derived from years as a B-movie star. The survey, conducted from Oct. 26 to Oct. 30 by a respected polling group, the Social Weather Stations, found that just 20 percent of the respondents believed the corruption accusations, despite the furor that has gripped the press and the political establishment. Forty-four percent opposed his removal.
The accusations were raised a month ago by a friend of Mr. Estrada, Luis Singson, a provincial governor who is also an admitted illegal gambling lord. At a Congressional hearing, he presented documents that he said showed that he had provided Mr. Estrada with $8.6 million in gambling payoffs and $2.8 million siphoned from provincial tobacco taxes.
Mr. Singson said he was making his accusations after Mr. Estrada had cut him out of the profits of a new legal gambling scheme that was meant to replace the illegal one.

HEADLINE: Nurse in Malawi Wages War on AIDS and Apathy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 6

 BODY:
A personal tragedy taught Catherine Phiri that people have more to lose under dictatorship than their civil and political rights.
Mrs. Phiri lives in Malawi, which under the dictatorial rule of Hastings Kamuzu Banda refused to allow any public discussion of H.I.V. or AIDS. By the time a democratically elected government replaced the long-running Banda government in 1994, it was too late for Mrs. Phiri, a nurse. Victim in part of the silence that surrounded the disease, she tested positive for the virus in 1990, after her husband died of AIDS. 
 Watching the devastation of AIDS spread all around her in a country with one of the highest infection rates in Africa, Mrs. Phiri decided in 1994 to take advantage of the new democratic atmosphere. She founded a support group for people who were suffering not just from AIDS but also from the neglect of a society unschooled about the disease.
Last last month, Mrs. Phiri was in New York to receive a United Nations award for her work, one of four people from around the world to be recognized by the United Nations Development Program and Unaids for waging an exceptional fight against poverty and AIDS.
The other winners of the Race Against Poverty Awards were Maire Bopp Dupont, a radio journalist from French Polynesia who has led a drive to educate Pacific islanders about the epidemic; Rita Arauz, a psychologist and human rights campaigner from Nicaragua who established a foundation to study and confront AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and the Rev. Arkadiusz Nowak, a Polish priest who opened the first AIDS hospice in his country.
Mrs. Phiri credited her nation's new president, Bakili Muluzi, with raising awareness of the disease. The press became free enough to focus on the spread of H.I.V.-AIDS in Malawi, where 25 percent of the urban work force is expected to die of the disease by 2010. It was through newspaper reports, Mrs. Phiri said, that Malawians learned that 29 government ministers were H.I.V. positive.
But Malawi still has a long way to go, said Mrs. Phiri, who uses her slim and erratic earnings as a consultant on H.I.V.-AIDS to support a community-based organization in Salina, a town on Lake Malawi about 60 miles east of the capital, Lilongwe. The organization, known as SASO, short for the Salina H.I.V.-AIDS Support Organization, offers testing, counseling and moral support.
Mrs. Phiri, who is raising six children -- four of them adopted AIDS orphans -- operates without her own blood-testing equipment and never has enough money to provide good meals more than once a week for 1,500 AIDS orphans under her organization's supervision. "When we have money, we give them food only on Saturday," she said. "We are supposed to give them food every day."
Mrs. Phiri said she tries to focus as much time as possible on counseling victims of the disease, and on teaching schoolchildren, who can be very cruel with H.I.V.-positive classmates, about living with the virus and understanding others who have it.
"Since I founded this organization in Salima, I've seen many women, children and men die in the epidemic," Mrs. Phiri said, describing how others, worried about their fate, wait weeks for blood samples to be tested by uncooperative hospitals. Her center lacks basic antibiotics, and even aspirin, to treat opportunistic infections or aches and pains, let alone AIDS drugs, she said.
"We have been trying to get through to the government," she said. "I hope that we will be recognized by being given the award, and that the government will now have something to do with us. I hope when I go back home I'll be able to see our president. I've been writing him proposals that have never been answered."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Debating Reach of Arbitration Law in Workplace

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The question of whether employers can require workers to give up their right to a day in court was before the Supreme Court today, but the justices were not debating whether mandatory arbitration of workplace disputes was efficient or fair.
Rather, the issue was how to interpret what Congress meant when, 75 years ago, it passed the Federal Arbitration Act and made agreements to arbitrate commercial disputes generally enforceable in federal court. 
 Given the law's age and widespread use, its meaning in the context of employment disputes proved, on close examination, surprisingly elusive. The justices' response to the arguments today, in an employment discrimination case from California, raised at least the prospect that the growing use of arbitration in the workplace was about to be curbed substantially.
The Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 applies broadly to any "transaction involving commerce," but a separate section of the law contains an oddly worded exclusion to that general rule. The law shall not apply, Congress wrote, to "contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees or any other class or workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce."
Until a year ago, all federal appeals courts to have interpreted this exclusion did so narrowly. Arbitration agreements were generally enforceable in the workplace except for maritime and railroad workers and others who, like those, were engaged in the actual, physical movement of goods across state lines.
But last November, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, took a sharply different position. It interpreted the exclusion to mean that the arbitration act did not apply to employment contracts, at all.
Circuit City Stores, an electronics retailer that does business nationwide and that requires new employees to sign arbitration agreements, appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court. The Ninth Circuit had refused to require a computer salesman for Circuit City to arbitrate, rather than go to court, his claim that he had been harassed because he was gay.
David E. Nagle, Circuit City's lawyer, told the justices today that employers and employees have entered into "untold numbers" of arbitration agreements in reliance on the dominant judicial view that these agreements were enforceable.
If that view was wrong, Mr. Nagle said, Congress had ample opportunity to correct it.
Several justices were openly skeptical of Circuit City's argument, which was supported in briefs from the United States Chamber of Commerce and other employer groups.
Answering questions from Justice John Paul Stevens, Mr. Nagle said the arbitration act covered ticket agents who worked for railroads, but not employees of travel agencies who sold train tickets.
"Do you think that's what Congress had in mind?" Justice Stevens asked.
That was what Congress said, Mr. Nagle replied.
While many Supreme Court cases require the interpretation of opaque statutory language, this case, Circuit City Stores v. Adams, No. 99-1379, has an additional layer of complexity stemming from the law's reference to interstate commerce.
The understanding, by Congress and the Supreme Court, of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce was much narrower in 1925 than it is today, raising the question of what Congress thought it was doing with its awkwardly phrased set of exclusions.
Michael Rubin, arguing for St. Clair Adams, the plaintiff in the Circuit City case, said that in 1925, Congress had reason to think that its authority over interstate commerce, in the employment context, did not extend beyond seamen and railroad workers.
By excluding these employees, Mr. Rubin said, Congress was invoking what it thought at the time was the full extent of its authority to exclude employment as a whole.
"The underlying concern was the disparity in bargaining power between all workers and bosses," he said. Now that the commerce power is understood to extend across the economy, he said, only a complete exclusion for employment would accomplish the goal of Congress.
Justice Antonin Scalia appeared skeptical. "What you're really asking us to do is change the language" of the law, he told Mr. Rubin. Justice Scalia added that he knew of no case in which the court had decided that Congress "surely would have done it differently if they knew then what we know now."
There were also these other developments at the court today.
 
Voter Information
The court heard arguments on the constitutionality of a Missouri provision to "instruct and inform" voters on whether candidates for the Senate and House have taken steps to work for a federal constitutional amendment for Congressional term limits.
Incumbents seeking re-election who have not taken the steps are identified on the ballot, in capital letters, as having "disregarded voters' instruction on term limits." Candidates seeking office for the first time must take a pledge to work for term limits or be labeled as having "declined to pledge to support term limits."
The provision was made part of Missouri's constitution through a voter initiative in 1996 and was declared unconstitutional last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. Similar provisions in a half dozen other states have also been invalidated by federal courts.
The Eighth Circuit found that the provision exceeded the state's authority to regulate federal elections and violated the candidates' First Amendment rights.
Arguing Missouri's appeal, James R. McAdams, a lawyer in the state attorney general's office, said the required labels were little different than labeling candidates on the ballot as Democrats or Republicans. The information helps voters evaluate a candidate, Mr. McAdams said.
The argument was an uphill battle. The label "goes beyond information," Justice David H. Souter told Mr. McAdams, adding that it amounted to "a kind of conclusion of fault, that a person has violated a trust."
Jonathan S. Franklin, a lawyer representing a Congressional candidate who challenged the provision, said it was a "manipulation of the ballot" in the service of "the state's preferred political viewpoint."
Barbara D. Underwood, a deputy solicitor general, also argued against the provision, representing the federal government as a friend of the court in the case, Cook v. Gralike, No. 99-929.
 
Freelancers' Copyright
The justices agreed to decide whether publishers who include the work of freelance writers in electronic databases without their permission violate the freelancers' rights under federal copyright law.
In a ruling last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, held that this common practice was a copyright violation.
The appeal, New York Times v. Tasini, No. 00-201, was filed by The Times along with Newsday, Time Inc. and two companies, Lexis/Nexis and University Microfilms International, which sell databases in electronic and CD-ROM form.
The appeals court did not specify a remedy for the violations. The Times warned that the ruling would require "the destruction of decades' worth of articles currently stored in electronic archives."
The plaintiffs, a group of freelance authors led by Jonathan Tasini, maintain that the remedy would be a less drastic renegotiation of reprint rights through a central clearinghouse, similar to the approach used in the music industry.
The legal issue turns on a provision of law under which the owners of a copyright in a "collective work," such as an issue of a newspaper, are entitled to reproduce the individual works in "any revision of that collective work."
The appeals court held that the electronic databases could not be considered a "revision" of the original printed publication.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Europeans Intervene, but Markets Don't Listen

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Is Wim Duisenberg, leader of the European Central Bank, tilting at windmills? That was the question batted about yesterday after the European Central Bank bought euros for the second consecutive trading session in an effort to support the common currency.
With the Europeans intervening alone, the answer was yes. Without support from the United States and other industrial economies, something the European Central Bank had in September in the first effort to prop up the euro, this intervention is not expected to have much effect. 
 More important, the forces behind the euro's weakness -- and the dollar's strength -- do not appear to be turning in the currency's favor. And unless that happens, several analysts said, there is no significant rally for the euro in the offing.
The intervention "doesn't preclude another spike down nor does it mean we are looking for a major euro rally any time soon," said Anne Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
The first troubling result yesterday was that the intervention helped increase the euro's value only briefly. At the time of intervention, the currency was trading around 86 cents. It jumped as high as 87.27 cents, then fell for the rest of the session in Europe and tumbled further in New York trading, bouncing back slightly to settle at 86.07 cents, down from 86.68 cents late Friday.
The solo intervention also seemed to be interpreted by many traders as a sign of weakness. The United States had been on the sidelines Friday, the first day of the European Central Bank's intervention, and stayed there yesterday. All the United States did, in a statement on Friday from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, was to say that it shared Europe's concern "about the implications of the broad movements in the euro for the world economy." Washington still favors a strong dollar, Mr. Summers added.
David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., said yesterday's intervention did not scare traders into buying the euro. Instead, they sold as the European Central Bank bought, taking easy profits. James McCormick, a currency strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, said that on the basis of client trading flows, "no one was short the euro this time around, so no one got hurt." Being short means selling the euro in anticipation that it will decline and then buying it back at a profit at the lower price.
In a note to clients, Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities, said, "One does not get many points for persistence in the game of intervention." She said the European bank was running a risk in saying it intervened alone because it assumed the United States would not join in just ahead of the presidential election. "If Washington does not join in later this week," she wrote, "the markets may be disappointed and sell the euro."
What effect the election results will have on the dollar is unclear. A victory by Gov. George W. Bush with a Republican Congress could give the dollar a lift, especially because Mr. Bush's principal economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, has opposed American intervention in the currency markets. But the Clinton administration, which has supported a strong dollar, will be calling the shots on intervention until Jan. 20.
More disturbing for the euro's outlook is that the forces that have weakened the currency are still in place. Chief among these are the strong capital flows into the United States from Europe, as portfolio investments or as part of mergers and acquisitions. Mr. McCormick said that as of the end of last week, there was a pipeline of $49 billion in proposed mergers and acquisitions outside Europe -- up from $40 billion on Sept. 22, when the Europeans were joined by the United States, Britain and Japan in currency intervention.
In addition, much of the recent euro gain has come since the United States reported on Sept. 27 that the economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate, adjusted for inflation. That was much slower than expected and added to data indicating that the economy was slowing. Such a slowdown would be positive for the euro if it made American investment less attractive to foreigners.
But there are signs that the European economy is also slowing, which would offset the benefit of an American slowdown. Another sign of that came yesterday when Germany reported that manufacturing orders dropped 4.6 percent in September. The decline, in both domestic and foreign orders, wiped out much of the increase recorded since March.

OXFORD: ARSON SUSPECTED IN FOREST FIRE -- A suspicious fire in the Naugatuck State Forest involved more than two-thirds of the forest over the weekend but was under control yesterday, the authorities said. Naugatuck's fire chief, Kerry Flaherty, said the fire was confined to 250 acres of the 365-acre forest, which borders Waterbury to the south. The fire began around noon Friday at the edge of the main access road into the forest, he said. It is being investigated as a possible arson because suspicious fires have previously started in the same area, he said. (NYT)
 
MASHANTUCKET: INDIAN OFFICIALS OUSTED -- The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which owns the Foxwoods Casino, chose two new tribal council members on Sunday. In the election, for three of the council's seven seats, two incumbents were ousted and a third, Michael J. Thomas, was re-elected. Members of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe elected Charlene R. Jones, assistant executive director of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, and Fatima C. Dames, a tribal council staff member, to the tribe's ruling body. They will replace Gary A. Carter and Antonio M. Beltran. David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)
 
HARTFORD: STATE CHANGES DIPLOMA CRITERIA -- The state is revising the test for high school dropouts getting their diplomas under the General Educational Development program, or G.E.D., as school systems nationwide step up graduation standards. Starting in 2002, students will have to write more, solve more complicated math problems and analyze material like economic charts and editorial cartoons to earn their G.E.D. "It's important that the standard be raised and be consistent with what students in high school who do four years are subjected to," said Tom Murphy, spokesman for the State Department of Education. "It should not become an incentive for students to drop out because the test is easy." (AP) 

NEW YORK
 
MANHATTAN: GUILTY PLEA IN PARK ATTACK -- A Brooklyn man charged with taking part in an attack on a teenage girl in Central Park after the Puerto Rican Day Parade in June pleaded guilty yesterday to first-degree sexual abuse. Prosecutors in Manhattan contended that the man, Herbert Negron, 40, was part of a violent mob that ran through the park after the parade, attacking several women. Mr. Negron apologized for his role in the mayhem, saying that he was ready to pay his debt to society. Alan Feuer (NYT)
 
BUFFALO: GRAPE HARVEST DOWN -- This year's state grape harvest has shrunk, but the price for premium grapes has surged because of increasing wine consumption. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the harvest was projected at 165,000 tons, down almost 20 percent from last year. The reasons for the decline include stress from last year's record yield; drought conditions in 1999, which depressed the 2000 bloom; and heavy spring rains that brought more downy mildew and other diseases. (AP)
 
SARATOGA SPRINGS: RABIES FEAR -- Three middle school students are undergoing a monthlong series of rabies shots as a precaution because they had contact with a dead bat brought to science class last month, said an official at the Saratoga County Public Health office. An unidentified middle school student found the dead bat at her bus stop and took it to her science teacher. Public health officials had the bat tested, and rabies was confirmed on Oct. 26. (AP)
 
AMSTERDAM: MINOR EARTHQUAKE FELT -- A minor earthquake rattled parts of eastern New York yesterday morning. The quake struck at 7:16 a.m. and was centered about 10 miles southeast of Amsterdam, in Montgomery County, said John Minsch of the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. The quake was felt by people in Rotterdam, Niskayuna and north to the Great Sacandaga Lake. There were no reports of damage or injuries. (AP)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: MORE FLU VACCINE -- Health care providers who offer influenza shots can now get more of the vaccine thanks to a federal contract, state health officials said yesterday. Because of production problems at the manufacturer, many clinics and other health care providers received only part of their vaccine orders and limited who could get shots. But the State Department of Health and Senior Services said yesterday that health care providers could now apply for vaccine doses that are available through a federal contract. Vaccine delivery will begin Dec. 12 and end by early January. (AP)
 
TRENTON: BRENNAN URGES SPEEDY TRIAL -- New charges filed against Robert E. Brennan, the former financier, have not prompted him to seek a delay of his trial. Mr. Brennan's defense lawyer, Michael Critchley, told a federal judge yesterday that they would forgo pretrial motions to keep a Dec. 5 date, which was set after Mr. Brennan's original bankruptcy fraud indictment in August. The judge agreed. The unusual request was opposed by the prosecutor, an assistant United States attorney, Paul A. Weissman, who said it would be better to have a trial next year. (AP)
 
NEWARK: UTILITY SHUTOFFS CRITICIZED -- A consumer group yesterday urged the State Board of Public Utilities to strengthen protections against gas and electric shutoffs for consumers in compliance with a law passed last year. A shutoff moratorium between Nov. 15 and March 15 covers families on public assistance. Still, there 140,000 shutoffs in 1999, including some during the cold months of the moratorium, said Stacy Berger, a spokeswoman for the group, New Jersey Citizen Action. The next board meeting is scheduled for Nov. 28; a board spokesman declined to comment on what the board might do. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

HEADLINE: Taming the Chinese Hinterland;
Beijing Tries to Lift Economic Standards in Its West

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: CHENGDU, China

 BODY:
It was an eerily colonial moment: over the tinkling of wine glasses and the melodic hum of violins in a chandeliered hall here in mountain-ringed Sichuan Province, 300 Western business executives and nearly as many Chinese officials drank not long ago to China's great western development.
But it was not foreigners who led the toast, as they would have in the days when China's far western region was the subject of Russia and Britain's great game over who would dominate Central Asia. The initiative this time comes from Beijing, which is hoping foreign capital will help lift the economy of the ethnically diverse region before the disparity between living standards there and in the wealthier east, dominated by Han Chinese, bolsters fledgling independence movements in China's farthest reaches. 
 "Go West, young Han" is Beijing's message to China's educated youth these days and a focus of the country's next five-year economic plan. An early draft of the plan, which is the blueprint for economic policy through 2005 and will be presented in detail early next year, calls the development of China's west a "herculean, historic task" that must make "breakthroughs in building the infrastructure and preserving the ecological environment" in the next 5 to 10 years.
The government has a long list of projects it wants foreign businesses to finance, including a $14 billion, 2,500-mile natural gas pipeline stretching from the far western Xinjiang region to the country's coastal commercial capital, Shanghai. It is also asking development agencies like the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the Official Development Assistance program of Japan to focus efforts on China's west.
So far, though, the campaign lacks cash and cohesiveness. The government will spend nearly $4 billion on infrastructure in the west this year, though it has not said how much an increase that is from last year.
When asked at the Sichuan conference how much Beijing would invest in the west, Li Zibing, vice director of the central government's Western Development Office, would only say "a large amount," and stressed instead the opportunities for foreign investors.
China's western region includes 12 provinces, or autonomous regions, including Xinjiang and Tibet. It is almost as big as Australia, and with its huge deserts, dense mountains and isolated cities, is about as hospitable as Australia's Outback region. The area's population, though, is equal to that of the United States and Mexico combined.
Most people in the western region lead a meager existence on incomes that are a third of those along the coast. The average per capita income in the landlocked Guizhou Province is only 8 percent of that in Shanghai.
"Everybody is talking about the developing west here, but the point is you have to have money," said a middle-aged taxi driver in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, where banners extolling western development hang over the streets and from public buses. Droves of unemployed migrant workers gather daily at an intersection on Liberation Road wearing placards advertising their trades. Along the whitewashed wall encircling a construction site, a line of big red characters reads: "Carry out the grand development of the west, speed up the pace of reform."
But unlike America's Westward Ho!, in which the government grabbed land from Indians and gave it to homesteaders, China's ban on private ownership of land means the government has little to offer citizens in its development drive.
And while America's Far West had another coast from which to develop trade, China's western border is a mountainous fence between it and the even poorer Central Asia.
Western executives are mostly watching and waiting to see what policies the government's campaign will bring. Little of consequence has been announced so far. Beijing has said it will extend tax benefits to foreigners who invest in the west, but there are already plenty of more developed parts of the country offering similar benefits. And the government has said it will set up four western special economic zones that will give investors the same preferential treatment as do similar zones on the coast. But after China joins the World Trade Organization and trade barriers fall, such zones will not have as much appeal as when China's economy was more closed.
"The multinationals are looking at the risks and asking, 'Do I invest in Shanghai or Chengdu?', and the answer now is probably Shanghai," said Bruce Murray, who represents the Asian Development Bank in China.
Companies that have invested in western China at the government's behest say poor roads, slow telecommunication lines and a lack of local talent make it difficult to build a successful business there.
To reach On Semiconductor's factory in Sichuan, for example, trucks and factory managers must navigate through a crowded farmers' market each day. And before a new highway was opened last year, truckloads of semiconductors endured a jolting three-hour ride on rough roads to reach Chengdu, the provincial capital.
"For anyone who wants to come to West China, infrastructure is the biggest challenge," said the company's Asia-Pacific chief, Henry Leung.
Another challenge, he said, is keeping good people. Few educated young Chinese want to live in remote Sichuan Province, where On's joint venture partner, a radio factory, was set up in the days when Mao Zedong was moving strategic industries into the mountainous interior to protect them from a potential American invasion.
Many of the Han Chinese who live in the west went there during the earlier western development drive of the late 1950's and early 1960's. Most of them were stuck there even after travel restrictions were lifted in the 1980's because of China's household registration system, which requires that people stay put to receive education and other welfare benefits. Now, the brightest of those people's children are filtering back east. Despite the government's urging, few are likely to choose to move the other way.
Mr. Murray of the development bank and other development experts say China's central government would do best to spend its own money on roads and telephone lines, health care and education to grease the wheels of commerce in western China and strip the red tape from business deals so the market can do its magic. He fears the government will use a heavier hand, nudging the country's state banks to make loans as a matter of government policy, for example, at a time when they are struggling to purge their balance sheets of bad loans made to Rust- Belt-type industries in the 1980's and 1990's.
Already, China's central bank governor, Dai Xianglong, has asked the state banks to support the government's western development program, and one of the largest, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has responded by saying it will increase the proportion of its loans to western provinces.
"The government should not use moral suasion, subsidized interest rates or similar policies to force banks to lend for projects in western China," Mr. Murray said, warning that such moves would lead only to a larger bank bailout later on.
Even if the government does start pouring money into the west, many people doubt that it can keep track of all the money. The huge Three Gorges Dam being built across the Yangtze River has been plagued by corruption scandals that have siphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars. And the National Audit Bureau said $9 billion in government money was stolen, misused or wasted last year.
The alternative, though, is too terrifying to consider. Beijing sees the breakup of the Soviet Union as a cautionary tale. And already, the gap between the country's east and west is big enough to fuel discontent among ethnic minorities that complain they are either being exploited or left behind in the expansion.
Beijing recognizes that closing the east-west gap will take time. "If we do a good job in the next 5 to 10 years, we'll have a good start," said Mr. Li of the Western Development Office, "but this is an effort that will take several generations."

HEADLINE: The Court's Clean Air Case

 BODY:
Having failed to persuade Congress on the issue, a coalition of industry groups will be in the Supreme Court today asking the justices to disrupt enforcement of the health-based pollution standards that have been a cornerstone of a quarter-century of progress under the Clean Air Act. How the court responds could have consequences not only for the air Americans breathe, but also for the balance of power between the federal legislative and judicial branches, as well as the functioning of the modern regulatory apparatus.
Before the court is a controversial 2-to-1 decision by a federal appellate panel last year that invalidated tough new air quality standards that the federal Environmental Protection Agency imposed in 1997 to force further reductions in the amounts of ozone and soot in the air. Reviving the arcane "delegation doctrine," in disuse since the New Deal, the quirky ruling said that by failing to give the agency meaningful limits on the setting of standards, Congress had delegated too much legislative authority to the executive branch. 
 There are serious problems with this analysis, not least that it overlooks sections of the Clean Air Act containing guidance that seeks to tie agency action to broad policy principles established by Congress. As a practical matter, however, requiring Congress to go much beyond setting broad policy in a world where regulatory decisions increasingly depend on a high level of scientific or other expertise would upend the modern regulatory regime. Many administrative agencies, not just the E.P.A., operate within broad contours defined by Congress.
For these reasons, the court is unlikely to strike down the standards on the basis of the lower court's non-delegation reasoning. The industry groups know this, which is why they are offering the court another rationale for rejecting the regulations. In brief, they are arguing that the E.P.A. should have been required to take economic factors -- costs and benefits -- into account when establishing the new standards for smog and soot, and indeed should be required to do so in the future.
If accepted, this rationale would effectively overturn an important part of the Clean Air Act as well as subsequent court interpretations of that act. Under the act, the E.P.A. administrator is required to establish "uncompromising" air quality standards that protect public health "with an adequate margin of safety." This language has consistently been interpreted by courts as barring the agency from taking costs into account.
Furthermore, Congress has extensively debated revising the statute to require a cost-benefit analysis at the standard-setting stage, but has declined to do so. Any decision to change course at this point properly belongs with the nation's elected lawmakers, not with the courts.
To a large extent, the fight over this issue relies on a misconception. Far from ignoring costs and benefits, the Clean Air Act is an exquisitely crafted compromise in which costs play no defining role in setting air quality goals, but can be considered by state and local governments in determining the most effective means of achieving those goals. In addition, state and local governments, as well as industry, can appeal to Congress if they find the timetables for meeting standards too onerous. In 1990, for example, Congress gave the states more time to meet existing ozone standards.
This regime, which allows the federal government to set health standards but gives the states flexibility in meeting them, has served the nation well. Absent a decision by Congress to rewrite the underlying statute, the justices have no basis now to alter a system that has worked for 30 years.

HEADLINE: 25 Years Later, Vietnamese Still Flock to the U.S.

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
"This present emergency should not last," said the top refugee official at the United Nations as desperate people jammed onto helicopters and small boats to flee the Communist victory in Vietnam 25 years ago.
But it did. It swelled into a vast, clamorous flood of nearly two million people, more than half of whom settled in the United States. 
 It was an unexpected artifact of the Vietnam War and, just as unexpectedly, it continues today. When President Clinton visits Vietnam later in November, in the first trip by a sitting American president since the end of the war, he will arrive in a country that is increasingly linked to the United States by a web of migrants who journey from teeming cities like Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, to cities and towns across America.
One result is that 26,000 Vietnamese a year now emigrate to the United States, helping to shape both countries and forming one of the half-dozen largest flows of immigrants into America from any country in the world.
"It's going to outlive us all," said W. Courtland Robinson, the author of a recent book on the refugee exodus. "I don't think anyone in 1975 thought it would last more than a few months or a few years. But here we are, all these years later, seeing not just the last vestiges but a new manifestation of this migration."
The immigrants say they go in search of an American dream of prosperity and education that shines as brightly here as anywhere in the world.
"I would go too if I had the money," said Nguyen Xuan Hien, 74, who is sending his 11-year-old granddaughter to join her parents in New Orleans. "She'll have a better life there. Conditions here in Vietnam are not perfect, you know."
Most of the immigrants now are part of what one consular official called "an expanding pyramid" of family reunification in which refugee citizens reach back to their homeland to bring their parents, children, siblings and spouses -- who eventually will send for more relatives.
But some, remarkably a quarter-century later, are still technically refugees fleeing the distant echo of a war. At the rate of nearly 2,000 a year, these refugees include the aging survivors of Communist "re-education camps" and the grown children of American soldiers, as well as hundreds of participants in a little-known program that is still cleaning up the last lingering cases of what became a huge refugee-processing bureaucracy.
On their journey, they are crossing paths with some 100,000 Vietnamese-Americans who now return every year to visit or do business in Vietnam.
This human flow will bind the United States and Vietnam for generations to come, but like the war, it also serves to some degree to divide Vietnam.
The migrants and the returnees are mostly from the south, America's former ally against the victorious Communist north. Although Vietnamese attitudes toward the United States are generally cordial today, there is a warmer and more intimate tone to them among many southerners.
And it is mainly the south that enjoys a notable windfall from this relationship: an estimated $2 billion a year sent back to family members from the two million or so ethnic Vietnamese who now live in the United States -- double the total amount of foreign aid received by the government.
Paradoxically, that cash amounts to a far greater contribution to Vietnam's economy than the former refugees could have made had the police caught them, years ago, and prevented them from fleeing the country.
In another twist, the same authorities who once imprisoned people trying to flee now appear to be encouraging the last refugee cases.
"The Vietnamese government occasionally hassles us about the slowness of our processing of these cases," said Charles A. Ray, the American consul general in Saigon. "I have on at least four occasions gotten a letter from the external relations office complaining that our processing is taking too long. It's an odd transaction: these are people going on refugee programs."
Many of those cases involve people who have spent much of their lives in refugee camps, trying for decades to reach the United States or other countries. When the camps around Asia closed down in 1996, more than 100,000 people who had failed to gain asylum were obliged -- sometimes forcibly -- to return to Vietnam.
As part of the deal, the United States promised to interview the returnees one more time. Though they are still required to prove "a well-founded fear of persecution" long after hostilities have ended, the Vietnamese are often given the benefit of the doubt by immigration officials, diplomats say.
In numbers of people resettling in America, Vietnam now ranks behind only the giants Mexico, China and India as well as two traditional sources of immigrants, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic.
Among the applicants at the consulate here the other day was Vu Nguyen, 25, an Amerasian who knows nothing about his father but still holds a hope of finding him. He is taking with him his 4-year-old son, the grandson of an American soldier he may never know.
Le Thi Thu Ngan, 33, was heading to join her new husband, a Vietnamese-American who returned here recently, as many do, to find a Vietnamese bride. She is a mathematics teacher but speaks no English.
Le Thi Minh Trang, 28, was going to join her father, a former inmate at a re-education camp, taking her two small sons along. "I don't know if I'll like it there, but I'm going for the future of my children," she said.
Over the years, the United States accepted close to one million people from Vietnam, beginning with the first rush of 130,000 who fled by helicopter, boat and airplane when Saigon fell in April 1975.
Then came the flood of "boat people," perhaps 10 or 15 percent of whom died at sea, with some 400,000 finding asylum in the United States. The United States took another 20,000 "land people" who fled on foot through neighboring Cambodia.
That emigration was curbed after 1979 when Vietnam agreed to an Orderly Departure Program, in which refugees were processed in Ho Chi Minh City and flown to receiving countries. Altogether some 400,000 people arrived in the United States in that program.
About a decade ago, the United States inaugurated special programs to accept the Amerasian children of servicemen and the survivors of re-education camps, where high-ranking South Vietnamese officials and military officers were incarcerated.
About 90,000 people have been admitted in the Amerasian program since its inception, including 902 in the last year. About 165,000 people have been admitted in the program for re-education camp survivors, 1,021 of them in the last year.
Vietnam also has become one of the leading sources for adoption by Americans, with 717 children going to the United States in the last year. And about 25,000 Vietnamese received non-immigrant visas last year, like visitors from any nation, as students, tourists, government officials and business travelers.
The last vestiges of the war have become the domain of clerks, processing paperwork and stamping visas. It is necessary work, Mr. Robinson said.
"We are simply acknowledging our continued commitment to the people who at one time sided with us and with the South Vietnamese cause, and we are all the better for it," he said. "So let's see it through to an honorable conclusion.
"One hopes that at some point it will conclude. But I'm not holding my breath."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush's Finishing Day Includes Tennessee and Arkansas

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark., Nov. 6

 BODY:
Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call for a "fresh start after a season of cynicism," Gov. George W. Bush ended his quest for the presidency today on a nearly identical note, pledging to purge Washington of what he characterized as a crippling discord.
The course Mr. Bush charted over his final hours on the campaign trail, plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw electoral arithmetic, left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that atmosphere. 
 The Texas governor's first major rally was in Tennessee and his last before heading home late tonight was here in Arkansas, the states that gave political birth to Vice President Al Gore and President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Bush's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing partisan wounds and making sure Americans could gaze upon the White House with unfettered respect.
"It's time for new leadership in Washington, D.C," Mr. Bush told the crowd here late tonight in Bentonville, a Republican stronghold with its own significance. It lies in the district where a young Bill Clinton once ran a failed campaign for Congress, and it is now represented by Asa Hutchinson, one of the House Republicans who presided over Mr. Clinton's impeachment.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton was the person Mr. Bush seemed to have in mind as he told a cheering crowd of thousands, "The next leader of the United States must understand the awesome responsibilities of the office."
Just before Mr. Bush began and just after he ended his remarks on a stage inside a local airport hangar, his campaign played a new tape of music. It featured snippets of the Fleetwood Mac song "Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow)," which Mr. Clinton used as the theme for his 1992 campaign, followed by The Who song "Won't Get Fooled Again."
Almost 12 hours earlier, in Chattanooga, Tenn., Mr. Bush told supporters there was "a better day ahead" if the country chose to elect someone who would "elevate the people's business above everyday politics." Supporters' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision.
"One more day!" they roared.
What the nation needed, Mr. Bush told them, was "a president who can unite this nation, a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation's capital, a president who puts the people first, a president who lifts this nation's spirits."
"I'll be that president," he added, a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction. It underscored the optimism that Mr. Bush had, from the very beginning, sought to project to voters.
His schedule for a 16-hour day was also an expression of that. Between stops in Tennessee and Arkansas, his plane touched down in Wisconsin and Iowa, and while any one of those four states could provide the key to a Bush victory, none has as many electoral votes as battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania.
But the states are genuine tossups that were initially expected to be much more hospitable to Mr. Gore. By visiting them today, Mr. Bush emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of the vice president.
He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the business of beseeching supporters to grant him victory. With 24 hours before Election Day, Mr. Bush stripped campaigning to its essence: coaxing and cajoling, pleading and persuading.
"I want you to understand that I can't win without you," Mr. Bush told a crowd of about 1,000 in Green Bay, Wis. "I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get out to the polls." Minutes later, he added: "When you go out there and tell the folks where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American people, I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in. They're going to come our way."
At a theater in Davenport, Iowa, he took a similarly blunt tack.
"Not only do I want your vote," Mr. Bush said, "I want your help. I hope you continue to man those phones, and for those of you who are calling on my behalf, thanks from the bottom of my heart."
"Don't let up," he said. "It's a close election."
Mr. Bush repeatedly needled Mr. Gore, which was much of the point of going to Tennessee, where Mr. Gore is not at all certain to prevail. The Texas governor used the location to claim that Mr. Gore's decades of experience in Washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal spending.
"My opponent vows to carry his home state," Mr. Bush said from a stage at a Chattanooga airport. "He may win Washington, D.C., but he's not going to win Tennessee."
"He forgot his roots," he said. "He trusts Washington. We trust the people."
Here in Bentonville, Mr. Bush was jubilant, clearly reveling in the way his appearance, and the choreography of it, tweaked Mr. Clinton. But at the rallies in Chattanooga and Green Bay, Mr. Bush had come across as slightly less ebullient than usual. He seemed serene, his demeanor in keeping with the events, which were less crowded and shorter on gaudy pageantry and eye-popping fireworks than previous rallies.
Maybe Mr. Bush was after an aura of simple earnestness. Maybe he understood that there was only so much a candidate could do at this late stage. Or maybe he had sacrificed some of his energy to the hundreds of thousands of miles that it took to get to this point. His hair was grayer than when he started. But his message, an answer to the challenge of campaigning against an incumbent administration during peace and prosperity, was mostly unchanged.
Mr. Bush was careful to dwell on positions with appeal in the places he visited. In both Iowa and Wisconsin, where agriculture is an important part of the economy, he called for an end to the inheritance tax, which farmers find especially onerous.
Mr. Bush referred to it as "the death tax," although he slipped in Wisconsin and labeled it "the death penalty." Falling prey to scattered flubs, he also said in Iowa that cash-strapped elderly people should not be forced to choose between "prescription drugs and medicine," meaning prescription drugs and food.
But what stood out today were broad themes and emotions, and he wrapped his events -- and himself -- in patriotic colors. There was no balloon drop or confetti in Davenport, but there was a giant American flag behind Mr. Bush. His outfit was red (tie), white (shirt) and blue (suit).
"The greatness of the country lies ahead," he told the people in Chattanooga. "I strongly believe that this nation can accomplish anything -- anything -- we set our mind to."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: PROGNOSTICATORS;
Experts, Once Certain, Now Say Gore Is a Maybe

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Political scientists who two months ago predicted victory for Vice President Al Gore acknowledged today that they were much less sure now. And they said it was not their thinking but the candidate's campaigning that had been wrong.
"It was Gore's election to lose," Christopher Wlezien, an associate professor of political science at the University of Houston, said today. 
 And has he lost it? "It's a coin flip," Mr. Wlezien said. Two months ago, at the 96th annual meeting of the American Political Science Association here, he predicted Mr. Gore would get 55.2 percent of the popular vote.
Thomas M. Holbrook, of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, went even further out on a limb in September, forecasting a Gore landslide of 60.3 percent. An outcome like that, of course, would make Gov. George W. Bush a latter-day Alf Landon or Barry Goldwater.
Did he still think Mr. Gore would win? "Yes," Mr. Holbrook said, but narrowly. The candidate has done "just about everything he could do to blow what should have been a sure thing," he said. Most important, Mr. Holbrook thought, Mr. Gore failed to make this era of prosperity the linchpin of his campaign.
Mr. Wlezien, Mr. Holbrook and several others at the Washington gathering used various statistical models in reaching their predictions. In general, they used equations based on the current president's approval rating and economic trends over a good many months leading up to this autumn.
On the face of it, the experts said, Mr. Gore looked like a sure winner. The economy is a politician's dream, and President Clinton's job-approval rating (notwithstanding his indiscretions) has remained high: 62 percent by one poll in early September, 58 percent in another in late October.
Mr. Wlezien, who worked with Robert Erikson of Columbia University in devising his model, said its calculations matched the outcome of the presidential elections from 1952 through 1996.
Perhaps, the experts agreed, Mr. Gore had been unable to resolve a central dilemma of his candidacy: how to claim credit for the good economic times that coincided with the Clinton presidency while campaigning as his own man.
James C. Garand, a political science professor at Louisiana State University, said "Clinton fatigue" might be the kind of "idiosyncratic occurrence" that derails even the best statistical models.
Taken together, the experts' comments are a reminder that success in politics demands art as well as science, knowing whose advice to listen to -- and having a little luck.

HEADLINE: Lazio and Clinton, Both Upbeat, Rally Troops on Last Day;
First Lady Stresses Issues, From Upstate to Midtown

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY and ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton closed out her 16-month quest for elective office last night at a boisterous rally in a union hall in Midtown Manhattan, saying the outcome of her bid for the United States Senate should be determined by the issues, not the name-calling that dominated the final weeks of the campaign.
Mrs. Clinton was joined by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring incumbent she hopes to succeed, in one of their few joint appearances since she formally announced her candidacy in February after a seven-month exploratory campaign. Mr. Moynihan was also featured in a two-minute television advertisement broadcast last night on three New York City stations, in which Mrs. Clinton thanked New Yorkers of all political leanings for an "extraordinary year and a half" and asked that "the truly important things" in the race do not "get lost in the shuffle." 
 Mrs. Clinton was escorted into the hot and sweaty union hall on West 43rd Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues by Mr. Moynihan as well as Senator Charles E. Schumer, who had joined her on a daylong push for upstate votes that took them to Buffalo, Albany, Jamestown and Rochester before the Manhattan rally.
"Eleanor Roosevelt would have loved Hillary Clinton," Mr. Moynihan said. "If she were alive today, she would be on this platform."
The rally was not quite as energetic as the one Mr. Schumer did with the first lady in the same hall two years ago on the eve of his own election. There were a few empty spots on the floor and some "shushes" to quiet some people who chattered as Mrs. Clinton spoke. Yet she plunged ahead.
"If you will fight for me, if you will work for me for the next 24 hours, I will go to the Senate and fight for you in the next six years," she said, her voice nearly gone.
The campaign finale in Manhattan came at the end of a day in which Mrs. Clinton made a final drive for votes upstate, where her apparent inroads into traditionally Republican territory had helped build a growing optimism in her campaign.
"There are so many issues at stake in this election, but the core issue is the upstate economy," Mrs. Clinton said at Buffalo State College. "I am making it a top priority. I will be a leader. I will be there for you, and I will be back here so many times you will be sick of seeing me."
Invoking little of the partisan rhetoric that had dominated much of the final week of the Senate race, Mrs. Clinton called for New Yorkers to vote Democratic, but never mentioned her opponent, Representative Lazio, by name and only occasionally made references to the Republican Party and its policies.
Her message and mood were positive throughout the day, ending with the rally last night and the release of the two-minute television advertisement. In the advertisement, Mrs. Clinton spoke directly to New Yorkers for 90 seconds. The rest of the ad had testimonials to the first lady from Mr. Moynihan, Vice President Al Gore and Senators Schumer and Joseph I. Lieberman.
"Tonight I ask for your vote," Mrs. Clinton said in the ad. "I want you to know if you send me to the Senate, I'll work my heart out for you. Now this election ends where it belongs, in your hands."
In Albany, she told about 1,500 supporters gathered in the afternoon cold outside the front steps of City Hall that upstate has "some of the most beautiful countryside in the entire world" and that she is committed to both "growing the economy and protecting the environment." In her remarks, she gave a broad summary of the other issues she considers most important to New Yorkers, including protecting Social Security, paying down the national debt, providing targeted tax cuts, improving access to health care and helping to ease the financial burdens on families caring for elderly relatives.
The comedian Bill Cosby, who joined Mrs. Clinton on her fly-around tour of the state, said in Albany that he could not imagine wanting to hold elective office, but he predicted that Mrs. Clinton would do just that beginning in January.
"This is another joke we are going to play on Hillary," Mr. Cosby said. "We are going to vote her into office. She wants it, she is going to get it."
At the early morning rally in Buffalo, Mrs. Clinton appeared jubilant and confident as she kept the beat with the band, 10,000 Maniacs, and then used a string of football metaphors in her speech to make sure her audience of 1,000 had no doubts that she knows what is important in Erie County.
Doug Flutie, the Buffalo Bills quarterback, took the stage first, speaking glowingly of the first lady's commitment to children and health care, and even taking a turn at the drums as 10,000 Maniacs welcomed her to the microphone with a deafening version of "These Are Days."
"He is there, he never gives up," Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Flutie, whose team won in overtime on Sunday. "I want to use that as an inspiration. I will never give up on Buffalo, western New York or Erie County."
Mrs. Clinton also said she was eager to work with Mr. Schumer in the Senate.
"I believe the two of us will be an unstoppable team for New York because we will never give up, just like Doug Flutie," she said. "We will be there day in and day out, throwing long and going down the field to bring prosperity and progress to New York."

HEADLINE: State Proposals Will Decide The Pace of Construction

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
Across the nation voters will decide today whether to enact anti-sprawl laws in hundreds of referendums that will show how far residents of fast-growing regions are willing to go to slow the pace of construction in the suburbs.
Statewide measures in Arizona and Colorado are the most prominent responses yet to residents' concerns in places like Denver and Phoenix that the quality of life is being harmed by congestion and crowding caused by rapid construction of subdivisions, shopping malls and other suburban development. At the local level across much of the nation, efforts to limit sprawl have already picked up strong momentum, with some communities implementing moratoriums on building permits or using other tactics to halt growth. 
 Hundreds of antigrowth proposals are on local ballots across the nation, including measures that could slow the pace of development in parts of California.
In 23 states there are at least 33 other statewide growth-related initiatives, including many calling for transportation improvements, said Phyllis Myers, president of State Resource Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington that just finished a report for the Brookings Institution on growth-control ballot proposals.
As recently as September, polls showed that the proposals in Arizona and Colorado enjoyed strong voter support. But business groups, led by the building and construction companies which stand to lose the most financially if the antigrowth initiatives pass, have poured more than $4 million in Arizona, and close to $6 million in Colorado, into television commercials and other efforts to defeat the measures.
That spending, as well as opposition from advocacy groups including Habitat for Humanity, which is concerned that the proposals could cause housing prices to jump, appears to have turned the tide in Colorado, where recent polls indicate that most voters now oppose the plan. In Arizona, both sides say they believe that most residents now oppose the initiative.
Among other things, both statewide proposals would require many towns to create growth boundaries approved by voters. New development outside the boundaries would be sharply limited, and any changes to allow significant new growth outside those confines could occur only with new voter approval.
The initiatives are the most wide-ranging growth-control measures ever proposed on a statewide ballot, and they would give residents unprecedented direct power over new development, Ms. Myers said.
Supporters contend that the voter approvals will serve as a check against the power of the building and construction industries to lobby for favorable regulations, but critics say the measures will sharply slow new development, hurt the regional economy and cause home prices to soar.
Businesses fear that the proposals would make it harder for employees to find reasonably priced housing, while housing groups, who are already having trouble coping with rising costs for land, worry that the measures will further worsen shortages of cheaper housing.
This is the first time in 21 years Habitat for Humanity's affiliates in Colorado have taken a position on any political issue there, said Lori Vaclavik, executive director for Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver.
"It is extremely rare for us to do this," Ms. Vaclavik said, "and we only did so because we feel this amendment so threatens our mission and the future of affordable housing in Colorado."
The environmental groups that have played a major role in getting the initiatives on the ballot say fears of higher housing costs are overblown. Growth restrictions do play a role in higher housing costs, but other factors have a bigger impact, said Deron Lovaas, a Sierra Club official who is helping coordinate the anti-sprawl initiatives.
Development has spiraled out of control in many Western regions, including in Colorado and Arizona, Mr. Lovaas said, because they "have been growing at a phenomenal rate, coupled with a very libertarian system of government and land use." Mr. Lovaas called this year's election a watershed for these sorts of issues and said he hoped strong support at the ballot box would encourage legislators in other states to take steps to control growth.
Noting that the Arizona and Colorado proposals -- and initiatives in other places -- were the result of citizen petitions, Ms. Myers of State Resource Strategies said pressure for such referendums had been growing because residents felt that lawmakers were not doing enough.
"They reflect years of frustration and lots of debate, and depending on who you are, action or inaction on these issues" by state legislators, she said.
Regardless of how the votes go on Tuesday, Ms. Myers added, "the political and elected leaders have gotten the message of how important these issues are to voters."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Campaign Ends; Now the Voters Will Have Their Say

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: MIAMI, Tuesday, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Focused to the end on his message, Vice President Al Gore persevered Monday through a 30-hour, seven-city assault on the closely contested states that will determine whether his 13-year pursuit of the presidency culminates in a "cold driving rain" or a "shaft of golden sunlight."
Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gore has portrayed himself as more vigorous than his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and he drove that theme home today with the help of a manic schedule. After a rally at the airport in Waterloo, Iowa, that ended at 1 a.m. Monday, he began again at 5:30 a.m. at a John Deere factory there, where he shook hands with workers and gave interviews in the dark to three television networks. 
 Mr. Gore's sleep-deprived schedule then took him to a rally in St. Louis, to a United Auto Workers union hall and a black church in Flint, Mich., and to a midnight rally with the musicians Stevie Wonder and Jon Bon Jovi in Miami's South Beach. It was to conclude with a 4 a.m. speech to late-shift health care workers in Tampa, a flight to Nashville just past sunrise and a drive to his hometown, Carthage, to vote at midday and then share lunch with his 87-year-old mother.
In an interview with a Tampa television station on Sunday night, Mr. Gore pointedly noted that he would hold his last campaign event "after my opponent's gone to bed."
By the time he arrived in Flint, Mr. Gore was punchy from exhaustion, his face puffy and pink, with rivulets of sweat meandering down his cheek. He sucked on lozenges as he spoke, but they did little to soothe his hoarseness.
"There are only a few hours left before the polls close," Mr. Gore said, meaning of course that they were about to open. On Sunday night, at a rally in Dearborn, Mich., he twice acknowledged Bruce Hornsby, the rock musician who had warmed up his crowd, as Rogers Hornsby, the long-dead St. Louis Cardinal.
At the midday rally in St. Louis, Mr. Gore dusted off the rain-or-shine allegory that he has used to close countless events. In it, he presents two Wednesday-morning alternatives to his supporters. The first, he tells them with the gloominess of Eeyore, is that they can wake up to a splitting headache and a cold driving rain and find that their waterlogged newspaper announces a Bush victory. Or, he says, they can awaken to golden sunlight, the sweet sound of songbirds, the aroma of fresh-brewed coffee and their favorite song on the clock radio.
"You leap out of bed," Mr. Gore said, sashaying to his right, "and you dance your way to the front door and you fling open the door to the warm rays of that sun, and you pick up that newspaper and it says: 'Gore-Lieberman Win!' "
Mr. Gore can only hope that Monday's weather was not ominous, as the cold driving rain he spoke of dampened his travels in Iowa and Missouri.
When he arrived at the Black Hawk County Democratic headquarters in Waterloo Monday morning, Mr. Gore found only about 60 die-hards gathered under a canopy of striped umbrellas.
In brief remarks, he sounded like a precinct captain charging his troops, telling his listeners that their ability to knock on doors, make telephone calls and drive people to the polls is "what is going to win this race."
In fact, Democratic strategists are deeply concerned about the weather, fearing that rain could suppress turnout in crucial Midwestern states like Michigan and Wisconsin.
"The weather will always be a factor in turnout in Democratic neighborhoods," said Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager and meteorologist for the day. "There's a Canadian cold front, there's some rain, there's a storm that started in the Pacific, there's a storm that came out of Texas."
Ms. Brazile said the campaign would be prepared for the worst, and had requisitioned more vans to transport inner-city voters in places like Detroit and Milwaukee. Last-minute radio and telephone messages would provide phone numbers for people to call for rides, she said.
In stressing the importance of turnout, Mr. Gore has spoken repeatedly in the last two days of the historic tightness of this year's race.
"It is close, close, close," he said in Flint. "They say this is going to be the closest race since 1960 when John Kennedy won by a margin of one vote per precinct. I need each one of you to get me one more vote if you can do it."
Mr. Gore's aides seem neither confident nor despondent. While they acknowledge that most national polls show Mr. Bush with a small lead, they have been heartened by positive poll results in states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan with crucial Electoral College votes.
"It's creeping momentum," said William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, who placed great faith in the Democratic field operation. "Whoever thinks there is big movement, there isn't."
Mr. Gore, who first ran for president in 1988 and then joined President Clinton's ticket in 1992 and 1996, offered no valedictories and no broad reflections on his campaign or career. Instead, he demonstrated the imperturbable discipline that has marked many of his campaigns, delivering virtually the same speech he has given hundreds of times.
In St. Louis, Mr. Gore stood with Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, and pleaded with voters to make their native son speaker by giving the Democrats a majority in the House. In Flint, he stressed his pro-union stands, and also tried to calm fears that he would take weapons away from hunters and sportsmen. "It never will happen," he said, "if I have anything to say about it."
Mr. Gore continued to bash Mr. Bush on his proposals for tax cuts and Social Security and for his record in Texas on the environment and health care. In a Sunday night speech in Milwaukee, he found a new, if offbeat, cause for derision: Texas, he said, has the country's highest rates for homeowners insurance.
But for the most part, Mr. Gore spoke of his devotion to middle-class families and his determination to bring along those who have yet to enjoy the recent prosperity. The Democrats' economic record, he asserted, stands far above that of the previous Republican administrations.
"It's ironic to me," he said, "that the folks on the other side are still living on a reputation of being good managers and having a good sense of the economy when actually they drove the economy into the ditch."

HEADLINE: EUROPEANS SUING BIG TOBACCO IN U.S.

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The European Commission said today that it had filed a civil lawsuit in the United States against the Philip Morris Company and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company seeking damages for what it called their involvement with organized crime in smuggling cigarettes into Europe.
In announcing the suit in Brussels today, the executive body of the European Union accused the two tobacco companies of using money laundering, wire fraud and other activities in "pursuit of a massive, ongoing dd <page Officials at Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds said they had not reviewed the suit, which ran 188 pages, but they denied any involvement with smugglers. They also raised questions about why the suit had been filed in the United States. 
 The case is only the latest sign of frustration among government officials in Europe who believe that they are losing billions of dollars in customs and tax revenues because of illicit sales of American cigarettes that officials believe involve American manufacturers.
The British government has opened an investigation into British American Tobacco, the world's No. 2 tobacco company, which it suspects of illegally importing cigarettes into Britain. And officials at the European Union said several of the 15 Western European nations that make up the union would probably file suits of their own over the loss of revenue. Italy said today that it planned to join the suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Friday.
Nor has the issue escaped the notice of Justice Department officials in the United States. A federal grand jury in North Carolina has been investigating allegations that tobacco companies have been knowingly selling to dealers who resell American cigarettes to smuggling rings that infiltrate European countries.
Faced with little or no growth in sales in the United States, American tobacco companies have been aggressively expanding their overseas sales and marketing. But American brands, subject to various taxes and import duties, are expensive -- as much as $6.67 a pack in Norway -- and smugglers are increasingly avoiding duties by illegally bringing cigarettes into markets like Spain and Italy and selling them for 20 to 30 percent less than the legal price.
The European Commission said it was seeking financial compensation for what the suit claimed was billions of dollars in tax loses the European governments have suffered, as well as injunctive relief to prevent further smuggling. It did not claim a specific amount of damages.
But experts have estimated that the countries that make up the European Union lose about $1.5 billion a year in taxes and duties because of black market cigarettes.
In a statement, the union's budget commissioner, Michaele Schreyer, said the suit represented a new strategy to fight fraud and financial irregularities. It maintains that the two companies breached the United States Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) by involvement with smuggling rings.
Industry analysts say the vast discrepancy in taxes on cigarettes in Europe makes the Continent an easy target for smugglers. In 1999, for instance, American cigarettes were selling for $1.75 in Spain and $5.25 in Britain. Since the European Union has open borders, transporting cigarettes from low-tax to high-tax countries is easy, the analysts say.
European governments have also blamed American manufacturers, saying they have sold cigarettes to distributors who admit that they are selling them to smugglers.
The lawsuit announced today repeats that claim and provides some detailed descriptions of smuggling activity that has brought thousands of cases of American cigarettes to Spain during the 90's. It also maintains that company officials have devised elaborate schemes to move cigarettes into Europe and accused top Philip Morris executives of ordering the systematic destruction of documents related to smuggling.
In one example, the suit claims that R. J. Reynolds would sell cigarettes from its offices in Miami to a Panamanian company that would arrange for the cigarettes to be shipped to a warehouse in Rotterdam. There, paperwork would be generated to show that the cigarettes were intended for the Canary Islands. In fact, they went by truck to Barcelona.
American tobacco companies have consistently resisted efforts to obtain the names of international customers, European prosecutors have said.
Some health advocates applauded the decision to file the case. "I think it is long overdue," said Dr. Ron Davis, the former editor of Tobacco Control, a British scientific magazine. "There is growing evidence that the cigarette manufacturers are involved in the smuggling."
But whether the strategy will succeed is unclear. Some industry analysts said the suit would be thrown out on jurisdictional grounds.
"What are they doing in Brooklyn?" said David J. Adelman, a tobacco industry analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Obviously, the E.U. wants to take advantage of the American legal system. But what is the connection? This is a little like taking a murderer from France and wanting to try him in Texas because it has the death penalty."
Others said the American lawyers who filed the suit were looking for a sympathetic judge. The Federal District Court in Brooklyn has several liability cases pending against American cigarette companies, and Jack B. Weinstein, a senior judge, is known for handling cases seeking damages from the companies. The European case has been assigned to Judge Viktor V. Pohorelsky.
Analysts said the union would have great difficulty proving how much money had been lost, and still others suggested that the lawsuit was at least partly a result of the European Commission's frustrations in dealing with the cigarette industry as a whole. A recent initiative to curb cigarette advertising in Europe was struck down by a European court.
In its brief statement, R. J. Reynolds said that to suggest that it has been involved in smuggling in Europe or elsewhere was insupportable and untrue.
Philip Morris Europe said it questioned why the Europeans sued in the United States. "We are convinced that the far better approach would be for the commission and all other interested parties to work together in the fight against trade in contraband, including counterfeit products, and we remain ready to cooperate with the European Commission and the member states in that regard," said David R. Davies, the company's vice president for corporate affairs.
In his statement, Mr. Davies also said Philip Morris "would vigorously contest the commission's unprecedented attempt to utilize American courts to impose liability upon us."
Trying to use the American courts to address smuggling has been tried before by Canada. Last year, Canada sued R. J. Reynolds for $1 billion in Federal District Court in Syracuse, maintaining that the company conspired to smuggle tobacco products into Canada to avoid taxes.
The lawsuit contended that the company had set up a network of smugglers and offshore companies to flood Canada with cheap cigarettes after the government doubled taxes and duties on tobacco. Canada later lowered the taxes after it said it could not combat a wave of smuggling from the United States.
The case was dismissed in July by a judge who ruled that American courts cannot be used to collect another country's taxes. Lawyers for Canada have appealed.

EUROPE
 
GERMANY: COMMUNIST APPEALS -- East Germany's last Communist ruler, Egon Krenz, 63, will be freed from prison today until Thursday so he can appeal a 1999 manslaughter conviction to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Mr. Krenz, who is serving six and a half years for issuing shoot-to-kill orders to border guards at the Berlin Wall, says he was only following orders from Moscow. The former Soviet president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has supported Mr. Krentz, saying his prosecution broke agreements that ended the cold war. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: STORMS CONTINUE -- Two people died when their car was struck by a tree as storms continued to batter much of Britain, bringing extensive flooding and causing widespread chaos to the railroad system. Much of western Europe was also struck by severe weather, including deep snow and winds of up to 160 miles per hour in Switzerland and heavy rainfalls that caused flooding along the Mediterranean coast in France. Sarah Lyall (NYT) 

FINLAND: APOLOGY TO JEWS -- Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen officially apologized to the Jewish community for the extradition of eight Jews to Germany in 1942. "The extradition was a shameful moment in Finnish history," Mr. Lipponen said on Sunday at the unveiling of a memorial to the victims. Only one of the eight survived after they were sent to Auschwitz in 1943, said newspapers in Finland, now home to about 1,500 Jews. (Reuters)
 
ITALY: ANCIENT BONES IN QUESTION -- Florence has called off a plan to rebury the bones said by a local journalist to be those of Giotto, the early Renaissance painter, after an American archaeologist disputed the findings, a Florence newspaper said. Franklin Tokler, a professor of art and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh who oversaw the original excavation, wrote to the cardinal of Florence imploring him to stop the ceremony, saying, "You may well end up honoring the bones of some fat butcher." Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
INDONESIA: U.S. EMBASSY SECTION REOPENS -- After a two-week suspension of consular services due to a security threat, the United States Embassy in Jakarta reopened its visa section today. The embassy was shut to the public on Oct. 25. The partial closure coincided with a sharp downturn in relations between the two countries. Indonesian lawmakers have demanded that Ambassador Robert Gelbard be replaced for meddling in the country's internal affairs. Mr. Gelbard has alienated some leaders with his recommendations for economic and political reforms in Indonesia. (AP)
 
INDONESIA: PLEA TO SUHARTO SON -- Lawyers for Hutomo Mandala Putra, one of the millionaire sons of former President Suharto, called on him to come out of hiding and begin serving an 18-month prison sentence for corruption. The son, known as Tommy Suharto, was convicted in September of involvement in a land scandal. Seth Mydans (NYT)

IRAQ: TRIAL IN U.N. DEATHS -- A man appeared in a Baghdad court charged with killing two United Nations staff members and wounding seven others in the Iraqi capital last June. Fuad Hussein Haider is accused of killing two Food and Agriculture Organization employees when he burst into the their Baghdad office and opened fire. (Reuters)
 
IRAN: PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTEST -- More than 1,000 students denounced hard-liners and voiced support for pro-democracy reforms at a rally on the Tehran University campus. Several hard-line vigilantes tried to disrupt the gathering, which ended without violence. Plainclothes security forces, however, arrested a few students after they left the university grounds.

NICARAGUA: A SANDINISTA VICTORY -- The Sandinista Party scored its first major electoral victory since being thrown out of power in 1990 when Herty Lewites, a former minister of tourism, was elected mayor of Managua in municipal elections held Sunday. While candidates for the governing Liberal Constitutionalist Party were expected to win a majority of local posts, the Sandinista victory in the capital places the former revolutionary rulers in an influential position for the presidential race next year.David Gonzalez (NYT)
 
CANADA: NECK AND NECK IN QUEBEC -- Three weeks from a national election, the governing Liberals and the secessionist Bloc Quebecois are neck and neck in Quebec, the second most populous province, according to a new poll by Leger Marketing. In the contest over Quebec's 75-member parliamentary delegation, the poll gave each party 43 percent. In the poll, held last week, the Canadian Alliance, the new conservative party, supplanted the Progressive Conservatives as the province's third party, winning preferences from 8 percent of the 3,514 people polled.

ZIMBABWE: WHITES SUE MUGABE -- Challenging President Robert Mugabe's land reform program, lawyers for white commercial farmers went to the Supreme Court to argue that the government did not have the right to seize land without compensation. The farmers are challenging the government's plan to resettle blacks on more than 3,000 white-owned farms. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
MALAWI: 3 TOP AIDES DROPPED -- President Bakili Muluzi has dropped three influential ministers from his cabinet after firing the previous administration over accusations of graft. A 32-member cabinet announced Sunday did not incude the former ministers, Cassium Chilumpha for education, Brown Mpinganjira for transport and public works and Peter Chupa for labor and vocational training.

A 'Serpent' Lives to Give His Testimony

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

SPEAK YOU ALSO
A Survivor's Reckoning
By Paul Steinberg
163 pages. Metropolitan Books. $21.
Our knowledge of the Nazi genocide against the Jews continues, remarkably, to increase, and with it the intimacy of our own vicarious confrontation with human iniquity. Among the most illuminating recent additions to the store of unwelcome but necessary knowledge are the two volumes of diaries by Victor Klemperer, a Jew who survived the war years in Germany itself, and the more recently published journals of the Romanian writer Mihail Sebastian. But it is unlikely that there will be a memoir of more terse power than Paul Steinberg's "Speak You Also," a testimony from within the chamber of evil itself that performs the duty of memory with a special kind of pain and meaning. 
 Long before he sat down to write and to remember, Steinberg was an acidic symbol of endurance in the Nazi death camps. Primo Levi, the first great chronicler of Auschwitz, wrote about him in his magisterial "If This Is a Man," published in the United States in 1969. Levi called Steinberg "Henri," and described him with an embittered awe as a kind of savage for survival -- "hard and distant, enclosed in armor, the enemy of all, inhumanly cunning and incomprehensible like the serpent in Genesis."
In "Speak You Also," Steinberg, who died last year at the age of 73, makes his own sort of apology for the life he led, and in so doing he has produced an important and unforgettable document. I do not mean that it is a faultless document. Steinberg's economy of gesture takes this account of spiritual and psychological attrition and strips it to its essentials, dispensing with self-pity and self-justification. Steinberg does not deny being the man whom Levi compared to the biblical snake. His purpose, as he states it, is not to provide a "litany of atrocities." It is, as he says: "To follow the process, the degradation of human beings before annihilation. The death of feeling, the death of thought, then the death of the man."
It does that, even if it also leaves us yearning to know more about Steinberg himself, for example, about his father -- an early Russian revolutionary who knew Lenin and Trotsky but failed to give fatherly love to his son -- whom he dispenses with in a few lines. We would like to know more about other members of the family, not just their contribution to the author's makeup, but the practical details: how did they manage, if they did manage, during the war? While Steinberg introduces himself as the Henri of Levi's account, he tells us very sparingly about his own encounters and thoughts about Levi, and about the different means used by the two men to survive.
Steinberg does recount his arrest in 1943 at the age of 16 at a bakery in Paris, and he tells us enough to demonstrate that he was a tough kid, more or less already on his own, interested in chemistry and in the horse races and gifted in the ways of the street. He presents his story with a kind of disillusioned eloquence, almost a gallows humor, as when he wonders whether the two French policemen who turned him over to the Germans ever "gave a thought, once or twice, to the kid they sent off to hell with his chemistry book." Steinberg continues: "The virus of conscience is present in all of us, but only a few people fall ill or develop an itch from it. The rest get off scot-free."
Steinberg felt the itch for half a century. His book is first of all a recollection of human abasement: "Our flesh and muscles melt away, our teeth loosen, our guts liquefy, our wounds fester, and we die, we die, we die." It is also an agonized coping with the selectivity of memory -- why certain faces have remained etched in his memory while others, including his best friend at Auschwitz, who died early, have been effaced. Steinberg puzzles over his own survival even as he pieces together the rare combination of personal traits and apparent sheer luck that went into it.
Born in Berlin, Steinberg spoke perfect German, which helped, and he knew English, which enabled him to ingratiate himself with some English prisoners of war who were able to offer him some crucial protection. He knew enough chemistry to be of use.
He quickly understood the power of life and death held by the block bosses, ordinary criminals whom the SS trusted to run the barracks, usually with Nazi-like brutality, and he sucked up to them: "Each one of these monsters had a flaw, a weakness, which it was up to me to find: this one needed flattering, that one had a repressed paternal instinct or the need to confide in someone who seemed to take an interest in him."
When he comes down with a debilitating fever known as erysipelas, a Jewish infirmary doctor finds two doses of a newly discovered sulfa drug, and, while others are dying, Steinberg is saved. Every month, the SS comes through the barracks selecting prisoners for immediate transport to the Auschwitz gas chambers, and he is still amazed never to have been among them.
"The sole common denominator of the survivors seems to me to be an inordinate appetite for life -- and the flexibility of a contortionist," he writes. "I don't believe in the steadfast hero who endures every trial with his head held high, the tough guy who never gives in. Not in Auschwitz."
There are extraordinary scenes depicted in this book of the amazing brutality of the Nazis. Steinberg is gripped by a little-known episode. Near the end of the war there was a final call-out of Jews in Buchenwald, which, owing to his savvy ways, he did not heed. Those who did, about 1,000 to 1,200 men, were sealed into cattle cars and left there to die of hunger, thirst or exhaustion. And then there is a contrasting memory of Czech workers seeing carloads of prisoners passing beneath an iron bridge, and opening their satchels and tossing down their lunches "without a moment's hesitation, without even thinking about it."
The mystery deepens, why some men are beasts, why most are not, and how, to survive, one has to have a little of the beast in oneself. Steinberg's book is saturated with those questions, which haunted this unlikely author for decades and now, thanks to his remarkable little volume, translated from the French by Linda Coverdale and Bill Ford, will haunt us as well.

HEADLINE: Genies for Hire Cash In on Worker Stress

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
Peter London has the biggest to-do list in all of New York. Bigger than Rosie O'Donell's. Bigger then Mayor Giuliani's. Possibly even bigger than Hillary Clinton's.
A few weeks ago, Mr. London was in charge of sorting 9,000 compact discs, picking up a prescription at a local pharmacy and driving a parrot to Boston. 
 Mr. London, 32, is the founder of N.Y. Errands, a concierge service in Manhattan. No job is too small for him and his 28 employees, who earn $9 to $11 an hour to cater to the needs of the overburdened.
Need a snake transported across state lines? He's your man. Do your giant stuffed teddy bears need their innards cleaned? For $45, one of Mr. London's trusted lieutenants will take them to the New York Doll Hospital (cleaning costs are extra).
They will also buy stoppers for your sinks or deliver lunch to your children in school. (Their most recent food run: a chicken fajita, small fries, Diet Coke, small chocolate sundae, courtesy of McDonald's.)
"Our goal is to take people's to-do list off their hands and give them back their most precious asset: time," Mr. London said from his spartan office on Lexington Avenue, which operates like a dispatch center. "We offer peace of mind."
Clients include supermodels, supermoms and superegos; college students who are too harried to wait at Kinko's; and businesses like the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson and Highbridge Capital, an investment firm.
It is all part of a trend, of course. Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Oracle offer corporate concierge services so that employees will not have to fret about the minutiae of their everyday lives on (God forbid) company time.
There is even a national association, the American Errand Runners Organization, which lists errand services nationwide on its Web site, www.errandinfo.com.
In Los Angeles, Denise Van Zant, the 36-year-old founder of Chores-N-More, has been hired as a tour guide at Disneyland, Universal Studios and Sea World and as a companion on a Rodeo Drive shopping excursion, a job she branded "nice."
"When I first started out, I had a request from someone to take their dog to the dog park and let it run around for four hours," Ms. Van Zant recalled. "They didn't even want me to play with the dog or throw a Frisbee or a ball. I made $25 an hour to sit on a bench and do my paperwork."
Such is life in the new economy, where many Americans are overworked and overstressed and simply cannot afford to take a break. This is hardly surprising: who can risk an ulcer or stress headache when there is work to be done?
"People are strapped for time and they have extra money and just want to relax and be with their family during their free time," explained Anne Bentley, 28, founder of an errand service in Dallas called the Runaround.
Customers who responded to a questionnaire that Mr. London distributed, for example, said they would be willing to part with up to $35 for somebody else to wait for the cable guy to show up at their home, and pay $10 to $15 for a hired hand to make a run to a nearby drugstore or florist.
Some N.Y. Errands clients call four to seven times a day, he said.
Sue Marcus is one of them. A broker at the William B. May real estate company in New York, Ms. Marcus uses N.Y. Errands "100 times a week sometimes," she said. "I have a standing order with them once every three to four weeks for Costco; they've taken my car in to be serviced; they've picked up my fish at the Midtown market I love. I send them to my favorite dry cleaners and they pet sit for me sometimes. I'm an addict."
N.Y. Errands divides tasks into four categories: waiting (at the Department of Motor Vehicles office, for example), local shopping (at the corner deli, say), specialty shopping (at stores like Costco or Zabar's) and create-your-own services (think breakfast in bed). Employees are screened extensively, and Mr. London says letting them into strange homes is not a problem.
He refuses all X-rated requests, he says, though he did once deliver an inflatable doll to a bachelor party. And once -- just once -- he spied on someone, he says, though he declines to give details. "We will provide anything as long as it's legal and doesn't jeopardize the integrity of our company and the companies we work for," he said.
Mr. London came up with his time-relieving idea as an M.B.A. student at New York University. He got a B- for his business plan, his worst grade in business school, though he cannot remember why (he thinks it was late). After graduating in 1996, he had a brief stint at the National Hockey League and then decided to revisit his errand idea. He did the research and discovered that while there were many concierge services in the city, few companies offered everything under one roof.
The "your wish is our command" concept has been around a long time, of course. For ancient kings, it was a way of life. For modern luxury hotels, it is a marketing tool. And for secretaries everywhere, it is a job description (though the feminist movement has curbed somewhat such demeaning tasks as picking up the boss's dry cleaning).
Surf the Web (or flip through the yellow pages, if you have the time), and you will discover service providers willing to organize a party for you, buy a car for you, even write an angry letter to the editor for you.
And then there are online companies like Kozmo.com that make home deliveries. Trouble is, customers can only order from these companies' inventories, whereas N.Y. Errands will go out and shop for you.
Founded in July 1999, N.Y. Errands expects revenue to approach $1 million this year, Mr. London says. Dealing with all that growth keeps him pretty busy, which raises the question: Who does his chores?
He sighed and laughed at the query, but not too heartily. "I hate to say it, but I'm lucky," he said. "I have a wife."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Richard Rothstein is correct: while more Americans should attend college, a higher education alone will not solve the growing problems of economic equality (Lessons column, Nov. 1). 
 The increasing demand for workers with precise technical skills has actually led to a growing number of options for high school graduates. Borough of Manhattan Community College and Cisco Systems offer qualified high school graduates in northern Manhattan the opportunity to become certified networking specialists during a six-month training program.
We are now placing people in entry-level jobs with average starting salaries of $49,000.
I am not suggesting that short-term courses like ours serve as an alternative to college. At the same time, institutions of higher education must ensure that their programs keep pace with the changing demands of the work force.

HEADLINE: Signs of Investor Worry in Sale of Argentine Debt

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Argentina sold $1.1 billion in treasury bills today at rates that reflected investors' worries about the government's ability to finance its growing debt.
Today's auction was crucial as Argentina, Latin America's biggest borrower, is being forced to meet more of its financing needs at home with short-term debt. Access to international markets is limited by growing concern about the country's weak economy and a debt load equal to nearly half of its gross domestic product. The country has $123.5 billion in public debt. 
 "It shows that they can finance themselves at home, but the question is at what price," said Simon Nocera, who helps manage $6 billion in fixed income at Dresdner RCM Global Investors in San Francisco. "It's a very difficult situation because they cannot continue to fund themselves at this rate."
Argentina sold $500 million of one-year treasury bills priced to yield 16 percent, up from 8.89 percent when similar bills were auctioned on July 12. On foreign markets the nation's bonds sank to the lowest levels since Brazil devalued its currency 22 months ago, before recovering later in the day.
Argentina also sold $250 million of 91-day treasury bills to yield 13 percent, compared with the 9.47 percent yield when bills were sold Oct. 24. Argentina sold $350 million of 182-day bills to yield 14.51 percent, compared with a yield of 8.64 percent when similar bills were last auctioned Oct. 11. The rates, however, were below what some had expected.
Investors have shunned Argentine debt on concern that the government, weakened by political scandal and a series of resignations, will have trouble paying the interest on its debt next year. That might require a large loan package from lenders like the International Monetary Fund to avoid default, some investors say. Argentina needs to meet more than $19 billion in financing needs next year.
Concerns about Argentina rippled throughout Latin America, raising the yield on $256 million of Brazil's treasury bonds by 76 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from 17.42 percent last week.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Slowed in September

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit increased in September at the slowest pace in five months, a sign consumer spending could start to cool, Federal Reserve statistics showed today.
The rise of $6.4 billion in September followed a revised increase of $12.3 billion in August. The annual rate of borrowing rose 5.2 percent in September, about half of the 10.1 percent increase a month earlier. 
 The increase in September credit, the slowest since $6.4 billion in April, suggests consumers may be pulling back to pay off debt.
"Things aren't quite as good as before" in the stock market and the economy, said Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. "There are more layoffs going on and consumer confidence has slipped."
Revolving loans, which include credit cards, rose $3.6 billion in September after rising $6.7 billion during August. Auto and other personal loans increased $2.8 billion in September after rising $5.6 billion during August.
Before today's Fed report, analysts anticipated that September borrowing would rise by $10.5 billion after a previously reported August increase of $13.4 billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Get as much information as possible before heading to potential trouble spots.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LONDON, Paris, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Milan. These are the sorts of places you think of instinctively when considering international business travel.
Not much to worry about if you're headed there -- and if there were, you'd be reading about it on the front page. But what about all those less-familiar destinations that are being increasingly added to international business-travel itineraries thanks to rapidly expanding economic globalization? 
 Let's say the boss suddenly asks you to look after some business in, say, Indonesia. Assuming your corporate travel agent hasn't done so already, you would probably want to be given a heads-up on the following before you start packing:
"The cities of Jakarta and Medan, in addition to other locations, have been struck by a number of bombings in recent months. The Jakarta Stock Exchange, foreign diplomatic facilities and Indonesian government buildings have been targeted. Some foreign travelers in troubled areas of Indonesia have been subject to arbitrary arrest, detention and deportation and, on at least one occasion, false accusations of espionage. In the central Java city of Solo, groups opposed to U.S. policy have undertaken or threatened 'sweeps,' trying to identify American citizens and order them to depart the country. There also have been a number of acts of intimidation and violence directed at American companies and U.S. diplomatic facilities."
That information is excerpted from a United States State Department travel advisory issued last week. It is available, along with a detailed list of travel advisories for other countries and regions (including a recommendation that Americans "defer all travel to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza"), at a government Web site (www.travel.state.gov/travel warnings.html), that many wide-ranging international travelers bookmark.
Travel agents and online travel sites that book corporate and leisure travel say, meanwhile, that they are paying more attention these days to the fact that increasing numbers of travelers, especially business travelers, are touching down in parts of the world where trouble may be brewing or exploding.
"Statistically we know we have people planning business trips to places beyond the traditional, both domestic and international, destinations," said Suzi LeVine, the marketing director at Expedia.com, one of the leading online travel sites, where business travel accounts for about a third of its sales. On its main page, Expedia.com has a "health and safety" link that contains current updates on trouble spots. One posted this week, for example, described a severe malaria outbreak in Burundi.
Far more people use online sites to gather travel information than actually book on them. Online sites, however, including those that are managed by outside travel agencies and used in-house by companies, typically provide a lot of up-to-date travel-destination information.
"Very few if any of our customers are actually booking travel to hot spots online, because they already know there's issues and they want to talk to professionals," said Thom Nulty, the president of Navigant International Inc., a leading domestic supplier of corporate travel-management services. He added that the company's online portals might handle some simple bookings like New York to London, but for "the complex international reservations, or the reservations to third world or difficult areas, live agents are probably always going to be involved" because people feel more secure dealing with a professional.
Incidentally, besides the State Department site, here are two other government sites with useful information for international travelers: www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook, containing an annual factbook with basic geopolitical information about world nations, and www.cdc.gov/travel, which has information on things like immunizations, disease outbreaks around the world, and cruise-ship health and safety violations.
On another note, more than a dozen readers reacted with skepticism to an item in this space a couple of weeks ago about the CNN Airport Network. The item quoted an official at the network, which broadcasts CNN airport programming on televisions in departure lounges, as saying that CNN goes to great lengths to ensure that those passengers who don't want to have a television blasting at them while they wait for their planes are provided with quiet zones where the bellow of the beast can't be heard.
"May I challenge them to provide locations in, say, the Denver or Chicago United terminals where the terminal is quiet?" wrote one reader, Gary Cohen of Sacramento, Calif.
Come to think of it, I was involuntarily subjected to 45 minutes of too-loud, in-your-face CNN just two weeks ago while waiting in the invincibly sluggish Continental Airlines baggage-claim area at Newark International Airport.
Marea Battle, a spokeswoman for CNN Airport Network, said that about 10 times a day the network puts on a programming announcement encouraging viewers to forward questions or comments via e-mail to airport.network@cnn.com. Viewer feedback is also solicited on the network's Web site, www.CNN.com/airport.
When major news is happening (last night's election returns, for example), the CNN service is of course wildly popular in airport lounges. But in slower times, some passengers just want to get away from a television and read or think in peace, and the network says that it designs its monitor installation in departure lounges to ensure that there are quiet, TV-free zones.
The spokeswoman said the network had technicians in airports to maintain "quality control standards" that include making sure the sound isn't too loud. "It is our objective to provide an informative, entertaining and free passenger service that is discretionary to passengers," she said.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Graduate Students Disagree on a Union at N.Y.U.

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Jonna Perrillo is one of the army of about 100 New York University graduate students who teach the writing workshop -- or the "writing sweatshop," as it is sometimes called -- that is required of all freshmen.
She selects readings for her class, plans the curriculum, teaches two 75-minute classes a week and corrects an endless stream of essays. She also helps to mentor some of the other graduate student teachers. 
 For that, Ms. Perrillo, a 29-year-old third-year doctoral student in English education who almost always has a bagful of student essays that need grading, receives an annual stipend of $13,000. To help meet her living expenses, she also has to work one day a week outside the university, at a publishing company. "I get $13,000 a year to live in a city where that's just impossible -- and a quarter of that goes back to the university for health care and fees," she said.
But last week, she and many -- though not all -- of her colleagues finally began to feel that their threadbare situation was about to change. For the first time, the National Labor Relations Board had given a green light to the formation of a union for research and teaching assistants at a private university, theirs. A union would let the graduate assistants bargain for higher stipends, health benefits and other terms of employment.
There is at least one important hurdle, however. It is not certain yet that graduate students want a union. About 1,500 students voted last spring on whether to accept the United Auto Workers as their bargaining agent, but the election results were impounded while the university, which had lost an earlier ruling by the board's regional director, was allowed to appeal to the labor board in Washington. Today the labor board will count ballots to see whether the students approved the U.A.W. as their union.
As they waited for the results of the election, Ms. Perrillo and many of her pro-union classmates were optimistic. But not all graduate students at the university were so pleased. In the sciences and at the business school, areas of the university where financial support for graduate students tends to be higher than in the humanities and arts, many students saw a union as an encroachment, an outside body that would shape the agreements they struck with their professors and interfere with their relationships. They also said that union dues would be an extra cost without much benefit.
"I was dismayed when I heard about the union," said Abigail Hornstein, a second-year doctoral student in economics and international business who helped lead an antiunion group on campus last spring. As a second-year doctoral student at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business, she receives an annual stipend of $21,000 -- far more than Ms. Perrillo gets. In return, she is expected to work 20 hours a week as a research assistant.
In Ms. Hornstein's view, however, such inequities should be addressed by individual departments rather than by a universitywide union. Another solution, she said, is for students who are paid poorly to go elsewhere. "If conditions are that bad," she said, "there are plenty of universities in the country that offer an equally good education and better compensation. People don't choose academic careers to become millionaires."
David Chesler, a research assistant in a viral immunology laboratory in the biology department, was equally uninterested in a union. Last year, he earned $20,000 for teaching the laboratory sections for an introductory biology course. He spent 20 hours a week preparing and teaching the sections and grading quizzes and papers.
This year, as a research assistant, he is putting in far more time -- often 50 or 60 hours a week -- but is still happy. His professor, Carol Reiss, is often only steps away, and he consults with her constantly about his research, his courses and even his private life.
"My biggest fear is that a union is going to hurt us in the sciences," said Mr. Chesler, a fourth-year graduate student from Scarsdale who hopes to attend medical school after he receives his Ph.D. He was concerned that the department might become less competitive in vying for top students. "To take union dues from a stipend that is already small would not be helpful," he said.
"I don't think a union has a place at a university," he added. "Unions are for people who have a career and need protecting."
Graduate student stipends had begun to rise even before the union surfaced at N.Y.U. as the university tried to compete with other universities that were increasing aid to graduate students. But many students believe that the aid effectively amounts to wages and that a union is necessary to make them more generous. They note that students who cannot live on the stipends they receive often turn to outside work, which slows their progress toward their degrees.
Paul Jackson, an art history doctoral student in his ninth year at N.Y.U., said that stipends in his department were about $9,000 when he started (N.Y.U. said it now has a $13,000 minimum) and that he has taken out loans, accepted teaching assignments at other universities and worked four days a week in the Jackson Pollock-Lee Krasner house in East Hampton.
Ms. Perrillo, the doctoral student in English education, said that between her teaching and her one-day-a-week work at a publishing company, her own schoolwork often got pushed to late nights and weekends. Her boyfriend is in a similar situation, she said, and instead of going on dates, the two often spend their time at the library studying. "It's just lame," she said.
Although university officials have expressed concern that negotiating with a union over the terms of graduate student work could interfere with faculty-student relationships, union supporters like Kimberly Gladman, a seventh-year doctoral student in comparative literature who was working at the U.A.W. office on University Place, near N.Y.U.'s campus, dismiss such arguments.
"A lot of my professors would be very pleased and relieved if we were covered by a union, because very often the faculty want better conditions for us but are not in a position to create them," said Ms. Gladman, taking a break from faxing notices of the labor board decision.
