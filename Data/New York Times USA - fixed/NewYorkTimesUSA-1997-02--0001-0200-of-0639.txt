HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mixed Showing for the Dollar As Early Selloff Is Overcome

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar overcame a selloff caused by negative comments from top German central bank officials yesterday, rebounding on a Commerce Department report that showed a healthy United States economy with benign inflation.
The currency finished the day mixed against most major currencies, as it completed one of its strongest monthly advances against the yen and mark. Traders said the underlying upward trend for the dollar had not changed. 
 "The market was like a yo-yo today," said Elena Shperling, chief currency trader for the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch.
In New York, the dollar settled at 121.38 yen, down from 121.79 yen late Thursday, but still up 5.45 yen, or 4.7 percent, compared with the end of December. The dollar was at 1.6383 marks, up from 1.6368 Thursday. For the month, the dollar rose nearly 6.3 percent against the mark.
The pound declined broadly on diminished expectations that interest rates would rise in Britain anytime soon. In New York, a pound cost $1.6007, down from $1.6213 Thursday and the lowest level in more than three months.
The dollar began the day rebounding against Asian currencies on diminished fears that the Bank of Japan might intervene to sell dollars to defend the yen.
But the dollar dropped later when two senior members of the Bundesbank made comments that were interpreted as signals to sell the dollar.
One of the German officials, Guntram Palm, head of the Bundesbank regional bank in Stuttgart, said that Germany's exports were already benefiting from the mark's depreciation and that a further weakness in Germany's currency would not necessarily help.
The dollar's declines were limited, reflecting a prevailing view in the market that influential finance officials were simply trying to control the dollar's ascent by making occasional comments.
The dollar rebounded later when the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a 4.7 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 1996, far stronger than the 3.8 percent that many economists had expected. But a measure of inflation in the report was much weaker than had been expected.

HEADLINE: C. E. Inniss, 61; Was a Leader In Many Causes

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Charles E. Inniss, a retired vice president of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company and the chairman of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, died on Thursday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Mr. Inniss, who lived in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, was 61.
The cause was cancer, said his wife, Marjorie. 
 Mr. Inniss devoted his life to community, social and educational concerns. A partial list of his titles at his death included trustee of the City University of New York, chairman of the university's Construction Corporation, trustee and past chairman of the Studio Museum in Harlem and a director of the Brooklyn Children's Museum, the Catholic Interracial Council, the Marcus Garvey Nursing Home in Brooklyn and the Staten Island Zoological Society.
At the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, a nonprofit community development group in Brooklyn where he became a director in 1983 and was elected chairman in 1994, Mr. Inniss helped establish and develop the Bedford-Stuyvesant Family Health Center, the Billie Holiday Theater and the corporation's Center for Art and Culture. He first served the corporation as its director of area development from 1969 to 1973.
At various times and in various capacities he also helped the Brooklyn Arts Council, the Mayor's New York City Advisory Cultural Commission, the American Gas Foundation and the Black Officer's Association. He was a retired captain of the 369th Artillery Battalion of the Army National Guard.
Mr. Inniss joined Brooklyn Union Gas in 1979 as an assistant manager in public relations and communications. He retired in 1995 as vice president for community affairs.
"Responsibility was taught in the home," Mr. Inniss's brother, Wilbur, said. "Caring for people was taught in the home, and my brother loved people."
Mr. Inniss was born in Harlem and spent the formative years of his childhood in the East Bronx. His parents, Edna and Stanley Inniss, had come to the United States from Barbados and Canada.
He graduated from Evander Childs High School and in 1968 earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from New York University. He began his career as an assistant district service manager for Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.
In 1980, Mr. Inniss received a master's degree in public information from N.Y.U. His honors included a Doctor of Laws degree from St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn.
In addition to his wife, the former Marjorie Thomas, and his brother, Wilbur, who lives on Staten Island, Mr. Inniss is survived by two sisters, Norma and Frances, both of the Bronx.

HEADLINE: Nissan Motor Cutting Jobs in U.S. Marketing Unit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Faced with stagnant sales and worried about what the consolidation of car dealerships will mean for auto makers, the Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. is eliminating several hundred jobs in its 2,500-member marketing staff through early retirements, incentives to leave and dismissals.
Nissan executives said today that the cutbacks reflected purely a strategic decision to combine many management functions and reduce costs. "We had accumulated a bureaucracy over 35 years that was really working against our intentions to be a small, nimble company," said Robert S. Thomas, the American unit's president. 
 But Wall Street analysts and even some people close to the company said that the steps were a sign of trouble at Nissan, which suffered a 2.7 percent drop in American sales last year.
For example, in the hot market for sport utility vehicles, Toyota has already introduced the small RAV-4 and Honda will come out with its slightly larger CRV in mid-February, but Nissan's offering is still a year and a half away from introduction.
Also, Nissan's latest advertising campaign, aimed at building long-term brand recognition, has actually coincided with a drop in sales in the last several months. And Nissan's mainstay cars, the Sentra and the Altima, face heavy competition.
While Nissan contends that the job cuts are a response to the steady consolidation among dealerships, auto analysts suspect that that element is only part of the story. "I would take it as kind of a confirmation that the news has been bad, they're probably overstaffed and they're not expected to get any better," said Jay N. Woodworth, an auto industry consultant in Summit, N.J.
Nissan has offered early retirement to 280 eligible employees and asked that 200 more volunteer for severance packages, and has warned of possible layoffs ahead. The company reduced the number of vice presidents last year to six from nine. Last week, Nissan forced out 4 of its 24 directors, the management tier just below vice president; Mr. Thomas said those positions would not be filled.
Nissan's American marketing operations have been criticized in recent years as bloated, and the company has little opportunity to expand sales because its main American factory, in Smyrna, Tenn., is already operating at full capacity. But with most of its offerings in the car market, and few in the lucrative markets for sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and full-size pickup trucks, Nissan has been forced to offer generous incentives to buyers, a step that tends to erode profit margins.
Mr. Thomas is one of the auto industry's most outspoken advocates of reducing marketing and distribution costs, which include not only car dealers' costs and profits but also rebates, lease subsidies and advertising campaigns. These costs run as much as 30 percent of the cost of a new car.
At a time when the Ford Motor Company, for example, has decided to save a dime on each Ford Explorer by no longer painting the inside of the ashtrays, big auto makers still have a dozen or more dealerships in each big city. That means that car prices have to be high enough to support the salaries of a dozen dealership general managers, finance managers and other dealership staff positions, as well as a sizable staff at each auto maker to stay in touch with all of the dealerships.
A labyrinth of state laws, often written by lobbyists for dealership groups, prevents auto makers from shutting down excess dealerships. But the recent wave of dealership purchases by publicly traded companies like Republic Industries has begun to produce some consolidation in dealerships.
Mr. Thomas said that he welcomed this consolidation, while warning auto makers in a recent speech at the Automotive News World Congress here that more needed to be done.
"Your entire wholesale and retail distribution, logistics and retailer support networks need thrifting," he said. "You have huge, unnecessary expenses in those areas, as well as in Government-mandated emission and regulatory areas, which could be shared and consolidated as an industry without interfering with brand marketing differentiation concerns."
Christopher Cedergren, the managing director of Nextrend Inc., a consulting firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said that while Nissan might have a few difficulties, particularly in the short term, the company's decision to cut marketing staff was likely to be followed at some point by other auto makers. The room for further economies in the manufacturing of cars is shrinking after years of aggressive cost reductions by all big auto makers.
"The next frontier is the marketing side," he said.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Rally as Inflation Stays Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices gained yesterday as a flurry of economic reports failed to persuade bond investors that inflation had become a problem.
Investors were confident that Federal Reserve policy makers, who start a two-day meeting on Tuesday, would not raise short-term interest rates. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond surged 31/32 , to 9612/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.78 percent from 6.86 percent. A week ago the yield was 6.88 percent.
Prices received a strong early push as short-sellers bought securities to cover potential losses after a report on the fourth-quarter gross domestic product showed little inflationary pressure.
Short-sellers are speculators who sell borrowed Treasury securities on the premise that if the market declines they can later buy back the securities at an even lower price, pocketing the difference as profit. But if prices rise, they can incur big losses.
While the G.D.P. rise was higher than expected, at 4.7 percent, investors were heartened by the weak gains in the report's price indexes. The chain-weighted price index rose 1.8 percent, compared with 2 percent in the third quarter. And the implicit price deflator -- a measure of inflation -- gained 1.4 percent, after rising 1.7 percent in the third quarter.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the G.D.P. provided convincing evidence that inflation was not yet a problem.
"It's obvious that many investors continue to be favorably surprised by an economy that can generate two quarters of 4.7 percent growth in a given year while still generating a G.D.P. price deflator that remains will within the zone of acceptability for the U.S. central bank," he said.
The market's momentum increased after a survey by the Chicago Purchasing Management Association came in weaker than expected. The managers' index fell to 55.9 in January from 57.1 in December.
The tame price components within the report on G.D.P. helped to ease investor fears generated by the large 4.7 percent increase.
One piece of data not released yesterday was December's sale of new homes. The Commerce Department said it was delaying the release until at least Tuesday because of a processing error in its statistics.
Next week most investors will be focusing on the National Association of Purchasing Management survey on Monday and the employment report on Friday.
Mr. Chan of Banc One Investments said that if next Friday's employment report was surprising on the wage front, it would be difficult for investors to maintain the positive sentiment of yesterday's market.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said what strength was reported in some of the G.D.P. components was probably not sustainable, like the jump in exports.
"There is no chance of a rate hike next week," he said, "which will help the markets to do better into February, but looking further ahead, I think both the markets and the Fed will have to deal with evidence of brisk growth, with this weighing on the bond market. And the Fed will probably tighten if this growth is accompanied by lower unemployment or higher inflation."

HEADLINE: Congress Is Asked to Speed Money for Family Planning Overseas

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
President Clinton formally asked Congress today to speed its financing of overseas family-planning programs, setting up what abortion opponents call the first abortion-related vote in the new Congress. The vote must be held by Feb. 28.
In a report to Congress, the Agency for International Development said a delay in financing would result in a serious shortage of contraceptives in at least 60 countries, including 50 million condoms, 500,000 intrauterine devices and 4.8 million cycles of birth-control pills. It could also mean shutting down 17 of 95 overseas programs. 
 Congress decided last year to delay the spending for another four months. But the consequences of doing so, the report said, "would be increased unintended pregnancies, more abortions, higher numbers of maternal and infant deaths and, of course, more births."
Abortion opponents on Capitol Hill have said the family-planning money was being used to promote and perform abortions, and the report repeatedly addressed that concern.
"As a matter of longstanding law and policy of this and previous Administrations," it said, "U.S.A.I.D. funds may not be used either to fund abortions or as a method of family planning or to motivate any person to have an abortion."
The Administration is seeking to move up to March, from July, the monthly installments of $385 million that Congress allocated in 1996 for overseas family planning.
The agreement said that if the Administration could make a case by Feb. 1 that withholding the money until July was damaging family-planning programs, Congress would vote by Feb. 28 on whether to allow the money to be released by March 1. Today's report was the Administration's effort to show that those programs were being damaged.
Citing the successes of the 30 years of United States involvement in family planning overseas, the report said the world had 500 million fewer people than it would have had without contraception. The average woman in the developing world now gives birth to four children instead of six.
It also said family planning had reduced abortions worldwide, especially in the former Soviet Union, where abortions were the primary form of birth control and the average woman had nearly three of them.

HEADLINE: Suit Says 'Cats' Character Was Much Too Frisky

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Bill Maher, the host of the ABC talk show "Politically Incorrect," says crime may be down in New York, but nobody can do anything about "Cats." Well, someone is trying.
"Cats," the Broadway musical that played its 5,988th performance at the Winter Garden Theater last night, apparently on its way to eclipsing the Broadway record of 6,137 held by "A Chorus Line," is being sued over No. 5,561. 
 On the night of that performance, Jan. 30, 1996, Evelyn Amato, an unemployed office worker who lives in Manhattan, was sitting in a fourth-row orchestra seat with her fiance, Dennis Melendez, and several members of his family.
In the lawsuit that Ms. Amato, who is in her early 30's, filed yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, she contends that just before intermission, an actor, David Hibbard, dressed as the feline character Rum Tum Tugger, came off the stage and as a packed house watched, attacked her as part of the show.
The suit -- for assault, battery, invasion of privacy, violation of civil rights, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment -- asks for $6 million in punitive and compensatory damages. It names as defendants Mr. Hibbard, who is no longer in the show; the Shubert Organization, which owns the theater; the director, Trevor Nunn; the producer, Cameron Mackintosh, and the composer, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.
It does not name T. S. Eliot, whose poems supplied the show with its lyrics.
The suit was filed a year to the day after the alleged assault, the last day allowed under the statute of limitations.
No one connected with the musical had any comment yesterday. Mr. Hibbard did not respond to a message left at his home.
"Cats," with its saccharine melodies and elaborate, whiskered costumery, was never a critical favorite, but it has been immensely popular. In a part of the show, several of its characters, dressed like, well, cats, roam out into the audience and behave in character, purring and snuggling and so on.
But last Jan. 30, Ms. Amato contends, Mr. Hibbard did far more than that. She said in an interview that Mr. Hibbard yanked her handbag from her and twice pulled her to her feet to try to get her to dance with him. Both times, she said, she shouted, "No."
"I didn't want to be a part of whatever he was going to do to me," she said. "I was afraid after he'd pulled me up so hard. I was petrified, as a matter of fact."
When she sat down for the second time, she said, Mr. Hibbard leapt onto the arms of her seat.
"He crouched down and started moving his hips back and forth, saying, 'Boom, boom, boom,' " Ms. Amato said. "He was moving his groin back and forth. If I hadn't turned my head he would have rubbed it in my face."
After that, she said, Mr. Hibbard grabbed her head and shook it from side to side, mussing her hair.
"The audience was laughing at me," she said. "I was totally humiliated."
She said she was unaware that yesterday was the final day she could legally file her suit. Her lawyer, Michael G. O'Neill, whom Ms. Amato said she found in the Yellow Pages, called the date a coincidence.
Mr. O'Neill said his client sent a letter to the show's general manager, Nina Lannan, and two months later received an apology with an offer of tickets to see the show again.
"That's like offering someone another ticket on the Titanic," Mr. O'Neill said, dismissing the suggestion that the suit might be frivolous.
"She didn't consent to this," he said. "She wasn't warned that someone might sit in front of her and thrust his pelvis in her face. She doesn't find public, simulated sex acts enjoyable or entertaining."

HEADLINE: Unocal Signs Burmese Gas Deal; U.S. May Ban Such Accords

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration weighs whether to impose a ban on new American investment in Myanmar because of its human rights abuses, the Unocal Corporation has signed a deal with the Burmese Government to greatly expand its rights to explore and develop gas fields off the coast.
The agreement was announced by Unocal on Thursday, the same day the State Department, in its annual human rights review, condemned the killing and torture of dissidents and ethnic minorities in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Though Unocal's statement made no mention of it, company officials confirmed today that the Burmese Government was paid a signing bonus of several million dollars. 
 In recent weeks, Administration officials say, there has been growing discussion in the White House and at the State Department about banning new investment in Myanmar by American companies; a new law empowers President Clinton to impose sanctions if repression there worsens or if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace laureate and opposition leader, is detained again.
The State Department report notes that in recent months, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi "has been severely restricted in her ability to receive visitors," and that at least 147 members of her party have been arrested.
Unocal would be a major target of that ban, because it is already the largest American investor in Myanmar. Another major American company that once operated there, Pepsico Inc., announced earlier this week that it would join a growing list of companies that are pulling out, partly because of protests by rights groups.
Unocal denied today that it had acted quickly to strike the deal before any investment ban.
"We do not believe that the sanctions are about to be implemented, and we hope they won't be," Barry Lane, a spokesman for the company, said today. "We believe sanctions are not good policy, and the best policy is engagement."
Mr. Lane added: "We would never enter into a contract in haste. We have been negotiating the terms of this contract for six or nine months, and the Ministry of Energy in Myanmar set the date for the signing ceremony."
Unocal's decision puts the Administration in much the same position it found itself in early 1995, when the Conoco Corporation announced a major deal with Iran. President Clinton ultimately ordered the company to void the contract and barred American companies from investing in Iran. Conoco's deal was picked up by the French oil company Total, Unocal's partner in Myanmar.
But some in the Administration, including in the National Economic Council, have argued that a similar ban on investment in Myanmar would be useless because other nations are eager to trade there. This week Japan protested to the State Department about a Massachusetts law that prohibits the state from doing business with any company that does business in Myanmar; those companies include Sony and many of Japan's automakers.
Others in the Administration fear that a ban on doing business with Myanmar in the name of human rights would open the White House to more criticism of its China policy. That policy, reiterated by President Clinton just a few days ago, holds that continued trade and investment in China will ultimately bring freedom to the country.
"There's a struggle on to come up with a way to differentiate China policy from Burma policy," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic aides said recently. "And here's what it comes down to: China's too rich to mess with, and Burma isn't."
Unocal and Total are already partners in developing the Yadana gas field, a $1.2 billion project that includes a pipeline to pump gas to Thailand. The new contract calls for the exploration of an adjacent field that covers more than 4,200 square miles.
The Yadana project has been a constant source of lawsuits, protests and problems for Unocal.
The International Labor Organization has accused Myanmar of using forced labor to guard the pipeline, and State Department officials say there is credible evidence that the Burmese military has leveled towns in the path of the pipeline construction. Villagers either are told to go elsewhere or are pressed into work for the military, the officials say.
Unocal says it does not have evidence of any such abuses, and notes that all of the Burmese it employs are well paid. The State Department report confirmed that, saying, "The preponderance of evidence indicates that the pipeline project has paid its workers at least a market wage."

HEADLINE: U.S. ECONOMY RISES BY A STRONG 4.7% AS INFLATION DIPS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Powered by a surge in exports, the economy grew at a surprisingly vigorous 4.7 percent pace during the final 1996 quarter, more than twice as fast as during the summer, the Government reported today.
Despite this latest surge, coming after nearly five years of steady growth that has kept factories humming and unemployment at low levels, the economy showed almost no signs of strain. Indeed, inflation by one important measure shriveled to the lowest point in 30 years. 
 The upbeat economic figures -- instead of frightening the securities market as they have so often in the past -- were so well balanced that they were greeted unusually warmly on Wall Street. Convinced that the Federal Reserve will find no reason to raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week, traders pushed interest rates down and the stock market up. The Dow Jones industrial average fell slightly at the end of the day, but all the broad market indicators gained ground. [Page 37.]
For the full year, the Commerce Department reported, the nation's real gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of the total output of goods and services by the American economy after adjustments to eliminate the effects of inflation -- advanced 2.5 percent.
With the most recent recession having ended in March 1991, the current expansion is now approaching its sixth anniversary. Since World War II, only two expansions have been longer -- from 1961 to 1969 and from 1982 to 1990.
At the White House, Vice President Al Gore hailed the report as part of "a galaxy" of favorable economic data and "another resounding affirmation" of Administration policy. "The American economy is growing and a land of new promise is emerging," he said.
Because of the low rate of inflation and the absence of any signals that the domestic economy might be on the verge of overheating, private economists agreed that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten monetary policy soon. Indeed, analysts said the economy might well have already started to slow down as it entered the new year, pushing a possible rate increase by the Federal Reserve even further off. into the future.
Several analysts lowered their estimates for the first-quarter growth because it appeared that many companies had little need to increase output an extra amount to replenish shelves and rebuild other inventories.
David Hensley, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers, said he now expected the economy to grow at a rate of about 2 percent from January through March instead of 2.5 percent.
That slow but steady pace is widely regarded as fast enough to provide enough new jobs for an expanding work force but not so fast as to risk driving up inflation. And some economists said that the combination of low unemployment and low inflation that the economy has enjoyed for many months may well continue.
"The economy's more productive," said John O. Wilson, chief economist at the Bank of America. So while the jobless rate, now 5.3 percent, is "way below" the point where in the past inflation would already have started to rise at a more rapid pace, "we're just aren't seeing it," he said.
The blistering rise in exports -- which accounted for nearly half the growth estimated for the quarter compared with their normal 11 percent share of the economy -- was a central factor in the strong pace of growth. But export growth is expected to slow this year because the stronger dollar and weak growth among the nation's major trading partners will make it harder for American companies to sell abroad.
And while consumer spending revived during the fourth quarter on all counts -- big-ticket items, nondurables and services -- it too was expected to slow.
The 4.7 percent growth rate matched the pace of last spring and has not been surpassed since the spring of 1994.
"This is not the kind of strength that's likely to continue," said Paul W. Boltz, economist at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.
The report also confirmed earlier indications that the housing market had softened -- this sector has now been a drag on G.D.P. for two consecutive quarters -- and showed that investment by business in new equipment fell for the first time in five years.
A Commerce Department report on sales of new homes in December that was scheduled to be published today was postponed until Tuesday. The department said it found in a final review that it had "misprocessed" the data.
Changes in the level of inventories, which are often a key force in sudden surges and quick drops in the economy, had almost no effect on the rate of growth in the fourth quarter. While expectations that the economy will slow on its own contributed to the sense that there is little risk that prices are likely to rise soon, analysts also took comfort in the fact that important inflation figures themselves have remained remarkably low. The implicit price deflator rose just 1.4 percent in the final 1996 quarter, the skimpiest rise since the beginning of 1967.
This "just jumped right out," said Deborah Johnson, senior economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York.
A different gauge of price pressure that measures domestic prices only climbed 2.5 percent compared with 1.9 percent but would have edged lower had it not been for a surge in energy prices that reversed a third-quarter decline.
From the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, the increase in G.D.P. was 3.4 percent compared with 1.3 percent a year earlier.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1996 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: Debt Crisis Adds to Woes Of Car Lender

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 31

 BODY:
A bookkeeping scandal at the Mercury Finance Company pushed the used-auto-loan giant further into financial straits today as banks balked at providing new short-term financing to cover $17 million in the company's debt that is coming due.
Shares of Mercury, which had not traded since Tuesday, before the accounting irregularities were disclosed, plunged 86 percent today. 
 Mercury has been struggling to line up new financing not just for the debt due today but also for approximately $75 million in borrowing due next week.
The company, which is based in Lake Forest, Ill., a Chicago suburb, disclosed the irregularities on Wednesday, attributing them to unauthorizied entries by its longtime controller, James A. Doyle. The company said that its earnings had been overstated by $90 million during four years and that earnings had declined since 1994, instead of rising sharply, as previously reported.
Analysts said today that they expected Mercury to seek bankruptcy protection if it could not obtain funds.
A spokesman for Mercury said that the company's focus had been on trying to resolve its liquidity problem. The spokesman, Joseph Kopec of the Dilenschneider Group, a public relations firm hired to deal with the crisis, declined to comment further on the debt situation.
Mr. Kopec did say that the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which the company's board had hired as investigators, had been unable to reach either Mr. Doyle or his lawyer, Joseph Duffy. Mercury dismissed Mr. Doyle on Wednesday after saying that he had disappeared,
Mr. Duffy told the Dow Jones News Service on Thursday that Mr. Doyle was cooperating with Federal authorities in an investigation of what Mr. Duffy said was an accounting "charade" that involved other Mercury employees as well.
The Wall Street Journal, citing an unidentified person, reported today that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into Mercury's accounting.
Mr. Duffy also said that Mr. Doyle looked forward to cooperating with an independent investigation by Mercury's outside directors.
Mr. Duffy did not return telephone calls and Mr. Doyle could not be reached.
Wall Street's concerns about Mercury peaked shortly after 2 P.M., when the company's shares resumed trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Faced with a growing likelihood that the company would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, investors raced to sell. The initial plunge of 88 percent, to $1.625, wiped more than $2.3 billion off the company's value.
The shares later moved up slightly to end at $2.125, down $12.75. Mercury led the Big Board in trading volume, with 42 million shares changing hands.
Mercury is "very close to some reorganization, bankruptcy filing, probably a voluntary reorganization," Thomas Kmiotek, an analyst with the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company, told Reuters.
Analysts said that the value of the company's loans to auto buyers appeared to far exceed its debts. The financial problem, in essence, is that the cash from the auto loans will flow too slowly to make scheduled payments on the company's debt. Normally such a shortfall is covered by revolving credit lines from banks, but they are now reluctant to provide such credit.
"I think it's oversold, but I don't know what it's worth," said Joseph Jolson, who follows Mercury and other consumer loan companies for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "It's obvious they are not insolvent in the normal business sense, but we just don't have enough information."
A number of lawsuits, meanwhile, have been filed against Mercury, its executives and others involved in Mercury's accounting.
The lawsuits contend that company executives received higher salaries and bonuses because of the inflated growth figures and were able to sell stock at inflated prices.
"We would expect our class action to proceed against the auditors and the company's executives even if Mercury itself gets protection in bankruptcy," said Steven Schulman, a New York lawyer handling a suit filed late Thursday in the United States District Court here.
KPMG Peat Marwick, Mercury's auditor, is named as a defendant in some of the suits. If those suits go forward, they could lead to a test of recent protections for auditors in such class-action securities lawsuits.
Executives of Mercury did not return calls requesting comments about the lawsuits. KPMG said it had not seen any lawsuit naming it as a defendant and could not comment.

HEADLINE: Mayor Rebuts Criticism Of Budget Plan

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani staunchly defended his new preliminary budget yesterday against criticism that he had not done enough to address New York City's long-term financial ills, maintaining that he had devoted a significant portion of a $1.2 billion windfall in tax revenues to whittling down future deficits.
The Mayor acknowledged that he had ordered some new spending, particularly at the Board of Education, but he maintained that the increase was judicious because it was only one half of 1 percent. 
 He noted that he had apportioned 42 percent, or 500 million, of the new money to help reduce projected shortfalls over the next few years. He allocated the other 58 percent, or $700 million, for tax cuts and new spending.
"The fact is that we have reduced the deficits that New York City faces by more than has been done in any recent year, more than has been done actually in any one of the last 10 years," the Mayor said on his weekly radio show.
Mr. Giuliani's comments stoked a debate over how the city should handle its new-found good fortune, which stems largely from surging profits on Wall Street.
Some experts who analyze the city's finances contend that the Mayor should have essentially applied most or all of the unexpected revenue to reduce future deficits.
They questioned whether Mr. Giuliani had loosened up a bit as he begins his re-election campaign in an effort to move beyond his reputation as a fiscal conservative who repeatedly tried to cut or hold spending steady in his first three years in office. These experts said Mr. Giuliani had made some progress in dealing with the city's chronic budget problems, yet they added that the long-term prognosis was still troublesome. By the Mayor's own projections, for example, the city still faces a gap of $2.54 billion in the year 2001. The budget that year, including money raised from city, state and Federal sources, is projected to be $36 billion.
"I think that the jury is mixed here, frankly," said Martin Arrick, a director at Standard & Poor's, the bond rating firm. "The real issue is that there are still large persistent gaps."
While the arguments about deficits and spending levels may appear arcane, they have an important impact on everyday lives. Future deficits are an important indicator of the stability of the municipal government's finances. If the gaps continue to loom, officials usually have to cut services, raise taxes or employ fiscal gimmicks to balance the budget. The Mayor, for example, ordered $550 million in cuts in his preliminary spending plan.
In addition, when bond rating agencies see governments repeatedly struggling to close gaps, it often leads them to lower the governments' credit ratings, which increases their borrowing costs. That in turn siphons away money that could otherwise be used for services.
Mr. Giuliani suggested in an interview that the fiscal monitors approached the budget as a sheet of numbers, caring little about its ultimate effect on the citizenry. He said that if he reduced spending or scaled backed his tax cuts in favor of deficit reduction, it would have hurt people.
"You can't do much less than a one half of 1 percent increase in spending and maintain a city," Mr. Giuliani said. He added that in a year when the economy was rebounding, he would have run into great difficulty persuading the City Council to approve a budget with hefty cuts.
"It would have been inconceivable that you could have presented a budget that decreased spending," he said. "It would have been a political joke. We could never have gotten it through the City Council."
Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, also emphasized that when the new plan is weighed against election-year budgets in recent decades, the Mayor is calling for smaller increases in spending. It is an election-year tradition that politicians raise spending to curry favor with voters.
The independent budget analysts issued their own comparisons. Responding to the Mayor's assertion on his radio show, they pointed out that Mr. Giuliani had made great strides in reducing future deficits only when his new preliminary budget is measured against the one he presented last year, which was so lambasted that he revamped it a few months later.
When compared with his preliminary budget for the 1995 fiscal year, the first of his tenure, the difference is more modest. In that budget, the projected deficits averaged 14.4 percent of revenues from city sources. In the Mayor's new preliminary plan, they average 10.3 percent.
Richard J. Raphael, executive managing director at Fitch Investors Service, another bond rating firm, said that while the projected deficits may have shrunk, they could easily balloon if Wall Street has a bad year and tax revenues drop.
"Yes, there has been some reduction" in the future deficits, Mr. Raphael said. "Do I think that they are still large? Yes, I do. We certainly would like to see more reduction of those gaps, given their magnitude, and given the vulnerabilities in the city's revenue structure."

HEADLINE: Just Girls, and That's Fine With Them;
At a New School, No Boys, Less Fussing, and a Freer Spirit

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
They have been together for only five months, but the students in the pioneering seventh-grade class at the all-girls public school in East Harlem have already begun to leave their marks on their surroundings.
First, the girls complained that their blue polyester uniforms were too itchy, and got the principal to commit to switching to cotton and wool. 
 Then they persuaded school officials to admit boys next month -- but only for a night, for a Valentine's Day social. And soon there will be tryouts for the first school basketball team, created at the girls' insistence.
They are also learning that school does not end with the final bell: those who have kept quiet in class have been startled to see their parents receive a letter from school, urging them to speak out.
This is the way that the founders of the Young Women's Leadership School had hoped it would be when, in a hotly debated decision last September, they moved to revive the city's long tradition of single-sex education -- a tradition that faded away so quietly 10 years ago that many New Yorkers did not even realize that an era had ended.
The founders hope that the absence of boys will help girls build self-esteem, become more assertive and take on new leadership roles. And in a sense, they are trailblazers: there are only two other all-girls public schools in the country, in Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the research on the subject is extremely limited.
The birth of the third school, on a commercial strip in East Harlem, was not easy. The New York Civil Liberties Union immediately derided the school's "no boys allowed" admissions policy as unfair. And some feminist groups, including the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, suggested that the school would set the girls back in preparing for a coeducational environment.
The outcry has yet to die down.
The United States Education Department is continuing to investigate whether the school is discriminatory to boys. New York Law School devoted an all-day conference on Thursday to the legal issues raised by the school's very existence. And civil liberties advocates are still hoping to shut it down, or at least force the acceptance of a boy. But while the outside world continues to be preoccupied with the novelty of it all, the 55 girls have quietly settled into a learning environment that they say feels, in places, like a genteel prep school -- albeit one grafted onto the top three floors of a 12-story commercial building on East 106th Street.
Walk down the school's mauve hallways and you're likely to hear Mozart wafting from a portable stereo. All of the 11- and 12-year-old girls wear the school colors, blue and ivory, a requirement, although they have the option to wear skirts or pants, or sometimes even sweatpants. And the classrooms are cozily furnished with rocking chairs and Oriental rugs, most of them supplied by the teachers themselves.
"It feels like home," said Iris Giboyeaux, 12, who transferred to the school over the summer from the nearby Central Park East Secondary School. "You can be more open."
Indeed, particularly when it comes to talking about sex.
"Last year, if I would have brought up a question about masturbation, the boys would have laughed," said Albeliza Perez, 13, of the Bronx. "This year, I brought it up in class and the girls were like, 'Thanks, Abby.' "
Although the legal questions remain unresolved, school administrators are continuing to move ahead undaunted. The school is accepting applications from girls for next year (no boy has applied, and they say they are not sure what they would do if one did). And when this year's class moves on to the eighth grade next fall, they will be joined by 55 new seventh graders and another 55 ninth graders.
Eventually, there are plans to have 330 students, in grades 7 through 12.
It will take several years of testing to determine if the girls have raised their achievement in science and mathematics, the two subjects where boys traditionally outpace girls nationally.
But for now, every effort is being made by the teachers to compensate for what girls lack in coed classrooms, at least according to the limited research that has been done.
Since some studies have shown that girls have a harder time picturing images of abstract mathematical concepts, the school's math teacher, Linda Metnetsky, has used props -- a six-pack of Diet Coke or the sections of a cantaloupe, for example -- to illustrate a discussion of fractions. Ms. Metnetsky says that some girls who used to rely exclusively on paper and pencil to multiply two fractions can now do so, using such pictures, in their heads.
To help the girls find role models they might have lacked in coed schools, the humanities teacher, Madelene Geswaldo, has introduced them to the stories of girls who lived in medieval Europe. Many of the students -- who are overwhelmingly poor and come from the surrounding neighborhood -- identified with the story of a 12th-century homeless girl who apprenticed as a midwife, Ms. Geswaldo said.
Some researchers have found that getting girls to talk about what they are learning is difficult in a coed environment, where the boys often dominate. So at the Young Women's Leadership School, class sizes have been kept intentionally low -- no more than 18 in a room.
Albeliza, who has personalized her uniform by complementing it with rainbow sneakers and neon-green barrettes, received a letter from the school recently about her reticence in earth science class. The difference the letter made was readily apparent the other day, during a discussion of mica, copper and other minerals.
The teacher, Suzanne Kerho, who addresses the girls as "ladies" but insists that they use her first name, was urging them to devise their own categories to classify the minerals' qualities.
One girl shouted out "smooth and rough." Another said, "shiny and dull." Then Albeliza's hand shot up. "Chappy and nonchappy," she said, explaining that some of the minerals peeled away like "chapped lips."
Ms. Kerho directed that the new category be added to the blackboard, and Albeliza beamed.
"Last year, I would have thought, 'I'll take whatever life brings me,' " said Albeliza, who dreams of becoming a marine biologist. "Now I say to myself, 'I can be absolutely anything I want to be.' "
The easiest way to gauge what's on the girls' minds is to visit the powder-blue dining hall. What's immediately clear is that boys may be absent, but they are ever-present in spirit.
Recently, a girl discussed a spat she had had with a boy she met on America Online. ("You should see the poem I wrote yesterday," she said with a sigh. "It's called 'Dying.' ") Meanwhile, two other girls disagreed over who was cuter -- Billy Corgan, the lead singer of Smashing Pumpkins, or Gavin Rossdale from Bush. And a few swooned from afar over the first male to infiltrate the faculty, Ben Lewis, a 26-year-old student-teacher from Bank Street College who has a reddish goatee and is teaching math.
While the girls concede that they are interested in boys, they quickly add that they are not pushing to introduce boys into their ranks anytime soon. They have plenty of time with boys after school, they say, and besides, each is entitled to bring a date or friend to the Valentine's Day dance. During the day, they would prefer to do without the distraction.
"The teacher doesn't have to spend the whole time disciplining them," said Dominique St. Amand, 12, of the Bronx. Then, quickly remembering that her interviewer was a "he," she added, "No offense."
There is another advantage, Iris said. "I get dressed in eight minutes in the morning," she said, visibly relieved that there were no longer any boys she had to impress. "Before it took me a half-hour just to decide what to wear. And then there was the hair. . ."
This summer promises to bring new adventures. School officials say that Smith College is taking the girls under its wing and is planning a two-week science program for them on its campus in Northampton, Mass.
All this has left Cynthia Lopez, 12, to admit that she may have been wrong about the place.
Like many of the girls, Cynthia arrived at the school under duress, at the behest of a mother who was concerned that her daughter was too "boy crazy."
Well, to her surprise, Cynthia said she liked the friends she has made and the information she has learned.
"My mother made a good choice," she said. "Next year, I'll be back."

HEADLINE: Subsidizing Competition In Utilities;
Has a State Tried Too Hard to Deregulate?

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: PETERBOROUGH, N.H.

 BODY:
With its white-clapboard houses set against pine-covered hills, this New England village of 5,300 might seem a piddling conquest for a $13.2 billion energy company trying to make a name for itself as a national supplier of low-cost gas and electricity to homes and businesses.
But Peterborough is part of New Hampshire's pilot program to open the state's electricity market to full competition in 1998 and a forerunner of national deregulation, and the Enron Corporation, based in Houston, was determined to make a splash here. So it set up an office last April with 30 salespeople, spent $25,000 to help revitalize the downtown and even threw a picnic for residents. Most of all, it promised cheaper electricity. 
 As a result, it beat out 30 competitors to gain Peterborough's endorsement as the "marketer of choice" for local customers, then signed up 700 of them, including the town itself -- far more than any of its rivals. [Last Sunday, it announced its victory in Super Bowl commercials beamed to 128.9 million viewers.]
"It's nice to have a choice," said Daniel L. Keaveny, owner of the Jellison Funeral Homes, who says his electricity bill has fallen by 15 percent, or nearly $20 a month, since he switched to Enron from the area's traditional utility, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire. "They had a monopoly," he said of the utility in a dismissive tone. "I hadn't heard from them in years."
Other residents say they have experienced similar savings, and Enron plans to spend $30 million in a nationwide publicity campaign featuring their appreciative comments.
There is only one problem with all this talk of lower rates, a problem that many of the townspeople are not aware of. Most of the savings are not a result of free-market competition or any economies of scale that an energy giant like Enron might bring to bear on a regional market. Rather, they stem from state-mandated subsidies and from the willingness of Enron and the other marketers to shave their profit margins to near zero to get a piece of the action.
And while the deregulation of the national market for electricity might ultimately bring about lower prices in some parts of the country, the monthly bills of the 17,000 New Hampshire residents taking part in the current pilot program could bounce back up if the subsidies are phased out and if Enron and other winners of the marketing battle reward themselves by taking a profit.
"There is a danger we have raised expectations," George R. McCluskey, head of the electric restructuring division of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, said in an interview in his office in Concord.
In a sense, the state felt it had to raise those expectations; without the 10 percent subsidies as an inducement, officials feared, too few people would join the pilot program to get the deregulation ball rolling.
That is partly because most consumers did not understand what deregulation was all about and were loath to switch to an unknown new marketer for a few dollars a month in savings that might never materialize.
Their confusion was understandable. After all, the same wires would continue to deliver electricity to their homes no matter who their marketer was, and the same local utility would continue to bill them. The potential gold mine in the new freedom is for the marketers. They can now shop around for cheaper power outside a local utility's power grid and deliver it into that grid. In the old days, the utilities did not have to open their lines to outside providers; now they do.
Industry regulators like Mr. McCluskey, as well as executives at utility companies and even some marketing companies, worry that the ballyhoo over New Hampshire's program will raise similar expectations in other states that are deregulating their utility industries. Twenty states are well on the way to opening their electrical utilities to competition.
But Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's president, brushed aside concerns that lower rates might be short-lived. Once his company is able to compete for all the customers in the state and build up a large base of customers, it will be able to recover its marketing costs, make a profit and still keep the cost of power at the current low levels, Mr. Skilling asserted.
And if Enron eventually gains the right to compete for other services like billing and meter reading, it could drive those costs down, too, for further savings to customers, he added. "To the extent we've been given a chance to compete, we've had a huge impact," Mr. Skilling said.
If New Hampshire is any guide, consumers elsewhere are apt to be overwhelmed by a flood of freebies and complicated offers in the early stages of electricity deregulation. Aside from Enron, 30 other marketing companies inundated Peterborough residents and other participants of the state's pilot programs with mail and phone solicitations.
One marketer, Green Mountain Energy Partners of Vermont, sent out brochures with tree seedlings attached and promised $10 in "Eco Credits" against future bills to any electricity users who signed up by May 28. "Then, if you plant this tree, we'll give you $2 more in Eco Credits, plus an additional $1 Eco Credit if you send in a photo of your planted tree," the mailing read. Another company sent free birdhouses to new customers. Enron offered a choice of one low rate plus a $50 sign-up bonus or an even lower rate without the bonus.
The blitz confused and even frightened some people, said Paul E. Ramsey, the division manager of customer service at Public Service. Some elderly people, misconstruing the pitches they got as threats to cut off their power, pleaded with his company to strike their names from the mailing lists provided to marketers, Mr. Ramsey said. "Some were in tears," he said.
Other potential customers, skeptical of the claims, simply threw away the literature, passing up savings that for some businesses could have run into hundreds of dollars a month.
Only 12 of the 31 companies survived the marketing frenzy, and only because they could absorb the costs of setting their prices for power so low -- between 2 cents and 3 cents a kilowatt-hour and in some cases below 2 cents, the wholesale cost most marketers pay to the New England Power Pool, according to Mr. McCluskey.
By contrast, rates previously averaged about 3.5 cents for residential customers for the power portion of their bill. (The total cost to New Hampshire consumers of electricity, including transmission, overhead, service and other charges averaged about 15 cents a kilowatt-hour. By comparison, New Yorkers pay an average of about 13 cents to the Consolidated Edison Company.)
"The prices that have resulted mean that they are not making any profits," Mr. McCluskey said. "They are at rock bottom."
If the marketers bump their rates back up to traditional levels, their customers' average 15 percent saving would be reduced by nearly one- third, Mr. McCluskey said. Even more troubling to some, state-mandated subsidies account for most of the rest of the price differential, meaning that if they are ended -- a real possibility -- much of the gains consumers now enjoy will evaporate.
The pilot program expires on June 30, 1998, by which time the entire state will be deregulated.
"In New Hampshire, the savings are artificial to make sure you got participants," said Gary Long, vice president of economic development and customer service at Public Service. "My concern is that people are getting used to 15 to 20 percent savings. People will expect to get 15 to 20 percent under real-world conditions."
Another doubter is Edward Harms, an assistant operator at the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant. Mr. Harms went about choosing a marketer scientifically, collecting all the mailings he got, not only from New Hampshire but also from companies in Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and even California. He then put all the prices, incentives and other data in his computer and ran comparisons.
"It's very hard to sort out from the information they send you," he said. He settled on the Granite State Electric Company, a small New Hampshire utility owned by the New England Electric System, adding, "The marketers are going with such low numbers that they are not going to be able to continue that way."
The subsidies are actually paid by the traditional utilities, which agreed to dip into their reserves to help entice people into the pilot program. They have accepted deregulation as a fait accompli and want a close-up look at how the new energy setup will look. Many proved to be quick on their feet, and won many customers through their own intense marketing efforts.
What will happen to the state's utilities in the coming deregulation is still uncertain. Some are weighed down by huge debts -- "stranded costs" in industry parlance -- from investments in nuclear power and other projects that never panned out. Until now, the state has bailed them out by authorizing special levies on customers' bills.
The state must decide whether to expose these financially vulnerable companies to the full brunt of outside competition, or continue to support them with surcharges and deprive consumers of the lower rates that they are coming to expect. Currently, Public Service levies 5.2 cents.
"It's going to be very difficult to meet customer expectations with competition alone," Mr. McCluskey said. "The only alternative will be to deny a substantial amount of the stranded costs. Such denial, however, may result in financial difficulty for the utilities."
That may be an understatement, Public Service, for example, is still recovering from a bankruptcy filing made in 1988 mostly because of cost overruns and problems from the construction of the Seabrook nuclear plant.
And John H. Forsgren, the chief financial officer of Northeast Utilities, its parent company, warned New Hampshire regulators recently that the New Hampshire utility could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if the stranded costs were not recovered.
The local utility's loss could become Enron's gain. While the company has signed up only 1,400 people, and has yet to make a penny from its involvement in the pilot project, it thinks the investment will pay off.
"Are we creating value for our shareholders? Yes," said Steven L. Lawrence, manager of the company's Peterborough office. Referring to the tens of millions of homes and businesses in the United States that Enron believes will one day be open to competition from outside electricity suppliers, he added, "We're learning about the biggest marketplace in the country."

Charts: "An Open Market"
In what may be a harbinger for other states that deregulate their electric utility industries, more than 30 companies in a pilot program have flooded New Hampshire with solicitaions for business.
 
"Real Savings or Illusion?"
A pilot program in New Hampshire that allows people to choose their electricity supplier has reduced the electric bill of many participants by an average of 15 percent But the savings come mostly from a rebate from the state's utilities and lower than usual prices from companies' tring to entice people to sign with them. Here is sample bill prepared by one of the state's utilites.
 
UNBUNDLED CHARGES: The state regulatory commission told the utilities to list the component charges of each electric bill so that consumers could see what they are paying for. Under the current deregulation plan, utilites will still be responsible for everything but the actual cost of the electricity.
 
STRANDED COSTS: What to do about costs from power plants and other projects that have not been paid for remains to be decided. The utilites say the costs must continue to be passed along to consumers or they will be pushed into bankruptcy.
 
REBATE: To entice people to join the pilot program, the utilities agreed to reimburse customers for about 10 percent of their bills. This rebate may disappear when deregulation is statewide.
 
COST OF ELECTRICITY: Many companies in the pilot are selling electricity only slightly above cost, in this case 3.1 cents per kilowatt hour. No one knows where prices will settle. (pg. 34)

Parcells Seeking New Kitchen

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
WHILE poor unemployed Bill Parcells shuffles home to New Jersey to sit by the phone and see if he has a future, he should know he has the philosophical blessing of many chefs around the world.
In his departure from the New England Patriots yesterday, Parcells tried to explain his drive for creative freedom, which forced the split with the owner, Robert K. Kraft: 
 "It's just like a friend of mine told me," Parcells said. " 'If they want you to cook the dinner, at least they ought to let you shop for some of the groceries.' "
Now Parcells must wait to see if the New York Jets will pay a high price for him -- the very first choice in the next draft of college players. But he made it clear that next time around he wants to be in charge of going to market as well as supervising the kitchen.
Football owners seem legitimately divided about the wisdom of giving shopping and cooking power to one person, but Parcells's friend is onto something when he cites the tradition of chefs who go poking at the trays of seafood.
"If the eyes are not bright, it's not going to be great fish," rasped Elaine Kaufman, the legendary proprietor of Elaine's in Manhattan.
Kaufman has seen customers like George Steinbrenner and Pat Riley and other sports executives with a lust for power. She understood exactly what Parcells was saying, and said she wants her own chef, Barry Wildman, out at the markets at dawn.
"You've got to see it and sniff it," she said, "just like you would with a player."
Parcells wants to travel the extra 100,000 miles to acquire new players for the same reason chefs make the long haul -- to keep everybody honest.
"Let's face it, produce people will try to push things on you," said Daniel LeBron, the chef at Josephine's, a delightful French restaurant in Marietta, Pa., along the banks of the Susquehanna River, between York and Harrisburg.
"You get 10 times the quality if you go there yourself," said LeBron, who used to make the hour-and-40-minute haul each way to Philadelphia Market, until the French-born proprietor, Jean-Luc Sandillon, began to spell him.
"I know what Parcells means," said the American-born LeBron. "I'm also a Patriots fan and I'm sorry they lost."
Parcells announced he was leaving the Patriots' kitchen two days after Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the league, ruled that the Patriots had legal rights to Parcells for the 1997 season. Yesterday Kraft said he could not give Parcells the authority he wanted because "you can't have the business dependent on just one person." "It's just common sense," he said. "What happens when that person isn't there?"
Many owners agree with Kraft. No sooner had 32-year-old John Spano bought the New York Islanders than he forced Mike Milbury to give up coaching and concentrate on being general manager.
As of last night, the Jets seemed willing to give Parcells the power he wants, but Leon Hess might not be as eager to give away the top draft choice, which could produce Peyton Manning, the quarterback from the University of Tennessee. Many football fans think no coach is worth a first draft choice, but my feeling is that some coaches are always going to be better than most of their peers, and Parcells is clearly one of the best.
Parcells put on a suit and tie and tried to hide his normal bluster yesterday at a press conference in Massachusetts, where he and Kraft parted ways. He said he had no problem with Tagliabue's decision that he was bound to the Patriots next season.
"I'm a league guy; whatever the commissioner says, I'll abide by," Parcells said, but it could not have been easy.
He chafed at the family-style layers of authority when he won two Super Bowls with the Giants. He rebelled against Kraft's involvement en route to the Super Bowl this season. He is at his best with unchecked powers, bullying his own players, stonewalling his bosses, showing contempt for the press. It must have been very hard for him to be civil yesterday as New England reporters questioned his veracity.
Until that moment, there had been no known link between haute cuisine and football coaching. Coaches remain sequestered in their grim bunkers for weeks at a time, watching film and eating ghastly takeout food, which may explain their lumpy shapes and sour expressions. Parcells looks like a cheeseburger kind of guy, always suffering from dyspepsia, but at least he has friends who explain the mystique of the master chef.

HEADLINE: Spotlight on Public Liaison Office

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
When President Clinton's re-election campaign needed suggestions for political and civic leaders to invite to coffees with him, it called members of a small White House office charged with building public support for his policies.
And when top Administration aides wanted to woo ethnic voters last year, they asked the head of that office, Alexis M. Herman, and her assistants to meet -- in off-duty hours -- with Democratic Party officials and fund-raisers to plot detailed strategies. 
 These and other of Ms. Herman's activities revealed over the past week have raised questions on Capital Hill about whether she blended her official and political roles, and have put her nomination to be Secretary of Labor in jeopardy.
The White House has said that Ms. Herman, who has run its Office of Public Liaison since 1993, did nothing wrong. Today she visited the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, to try to smooth things over.
Senator Lott said earlier in the week that he was concerned that some of Ms. Herman's activities might have come "awfully close to the edge" of Federal laws that limit the partisan activities of Government workers. After meeting with Ms. Herman today, the Senator said: "It was a good meeting. She answered a number of questions I had concerns about."
But he added, "I still think there is a lot of explanation needed."
The most controversial issue has been the role of Ms. Herman's aides in inviting a Federal bank regulator to meet with Mr. Clinton and some of the nation's most powerful bankers at a coffee meeting sponsored by the Democratic Party last May. White House spokesmen have said that Ms. Herman's office was involved only because of a miscommunication about the nature of the event, and that Ms. Herman decided not to go to the coffee after she learned it was being sponsored by party officials.
But the controversy has also focused a broader spotlight on the public liaison office, which promotes grass-roots support for the President's social and economic policies among ethnic, business and civic groups, and how the Administration has used it.
Several people who worked in that office in previous Administrations, both Democratic and Republican, said in interviews that officials of the liasion office have historically not had an extensive involvement with party operatives, especially during election campaigns.
Anne Wexler, who ran the liaison office under President Jimmy Carter and whose son works for Ms. Herman now, said she occasionally asked the Democratic National Committee if there were any donors it would like her to include in large groups -- usually of 200 or more people -- invited to White House briefings. But she said Mr. Carter rarely met with small groups, and her office was "never connected in any way with fund raising."
Bobbie G. Kilberg, who was the liaison director under President George Bush, said people in her office "were not permitted to even talk to anybody in the campaign" to avoid any possible ethics concerns. She said all communications with campaign or party officials were routed through the White House political office.
Others who worked in the liaison office said it appeared that high-level Clinton Administration officials had prodded Ms. Herman and her aides to get more closely involved with campaign strategy than had been the case in the past.
Frank J. Donatelli, who was a deputy in the liaison office when President Ronald Reagan ran for re-election in 1984, said this "is a sensitive area." He added: "If there is criticism, it shouldn't be just Alexis Herman that is singled out. You can't ignore the larger picture of what the White House was doing."
Indeed, the questions about Ms. Herman and her aides stem from the furor over Democratic efforts to raise huge sums of money by granting donors and other prominent people access to Mr. Clinton and by tapping new sources of money in ethnic communities, particularly among Asian-Americans.
The meeting with the bankers was one of more than 100 such coffees at which Mr. Clinton or Vice President Al Gore served as host in 1995 and 1996. And while many who attended the coffees did not make contributions, those who did gave a total of more than $27 million to Democratic candidates or organizations.
Ms. Herman, 49, has declined to grant any interviews while her nomination as Secretary of Labor is pending.
But Lanny J. Davis, a White House special counsel, said that any links that Ms. Herman or her aides had to the re-election campaign were "in substance neither inappropriate nor unusual nor in any way that we can determine illegal under the Hatch Act," the law that limits the political activities of Federal workers.
Mr. Davis also contended that some White House documents describing the work of the ethnic strategy groups contain "less that meets the eye." And he said that while Ms. Herman and her deputies discussed general political strategy during their off-hours with party fund-raisers, they never had anything to do with soliciting donations.
The White House has acknowledged that Ms. Herman attended a handful of the coffees with Mr. Clinton that included Democratic Party officials, although it said her office was not involved in arranging any others than the one with the bankers.
Documents made public by the White House also show that Ms. Herman led an informal group of Administration officials and party activists that was assigned to draft "a comprehensive blueprint for mobilizing the African-American community in 1996 to assure the re-election of President Clinton."
One of Ms. Herman's deputies, Doris O. Matsui, led a similar group focused on Asian-Americans that included John Huang, the former Democratic Party official who is now under Federal investigation for his fund-raising practices. The group's report contained a section on fund-raising goals, but a White House spokesmen said today that it was inserted by Mr. Huang with virtual no involvement from Ms. Matsui.
White House officials also said today that in response to requests from campaign officials, people in Ms. Herman's office also suggested the names of political, business and community leaders for possible invitations to about 15 of the coffees with the President.
One question in Congress is whether Ms. Herman or any of her staff members did anything improper in coordinating the strategy groups or suggesting who might be invited to the 15 coffees.
An Administration spokesman said the Clinton campaign recently paid the White House $917 to cover the use of Office of Public Liaison computers by two people who worked on plans to reach out to ethnic groups.
But Mr. Davis, the special White House counsel, said White House employees were free to get involved in some political activities as long as they worked 40 hours in a week on official duties and did not use Government resources.
Joseph Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said that when Ms. Herman's aides made the suggestions of people who might be invited to the coffees, they faxed them on special machines in the White House that were paid for by the campaign.

Palestinian in U.S. Cell Says He May Prefer Israel
By suddenly accepting his extradition to Israel, Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, the political leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas has called Israel's bluff and returned to the political spotlight. His move has prompted veiled threats and generated anxiety about what effect his deportation could have on peace in the Mideast. 1
 
Myanmar Deal for Unocal
As the Clinton Administration deliberates whether to impose a ban on new American investment in Myanmar, the Unocal Corporation signed an agreement with the Government in Rangoon, expanding the company's rights to develop offshore gas fields. The company announced the deal on Thursday, the same day that the State Department issued its annual human rights report documenting the killing and torture of dissidents and ethnic minorities in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. 4
 
Mandela Courts Zulu Rival
President Nelson Mandela appointed Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his archrival and leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, to act as President during Mr. Mandela's trip abroad this weekend. The move, a surprise, was seen as a canny tactic indicating that jockeying for position for elections, still two years away, has begun in earnest. Chief Buthelezi's party has been engaged in a bloody political war with Mr. Mandela's African National Congress Party in the KwaZulu Natal province for years. 5
 
Plot Twists in Mexico
The celebrated case surrounding a body unearthed on a ranch belonging to the brother of Mexico's former President took a new turn. Authorities in Mexico arrested Raul Salinas de Gortari's former mistress, accusing her and others of planting the body in an attempt to frame Mr. Salinas. Officials said they were also investigating whether the baroque plot may have included the top prosecutor in the case, Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, who was dismissed when tests proved that the corpse was not the politician Mr. Salinas was reported to have killed. 3
 
Germany Shrugs at U.S. Report
German officials brushed aside criticism from the State Department about Germany's attitude toward the Scientology movement. They said they would continue their inquiries to see whether the organization should be placed under surveillance or outlawed. The Scientology movement, which claims to have 30,000 members in Germany, has compared its treatment by the state to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. 5
 
Death Sentences in Vietnam
Vietnam sentenced four people to death at the end of a showcase corruption trial. The four, convicted of siphoning off millions of dollars in state funds, included three officials of a trading company closely affiliated with the Communist Party and one state official. Defense lawyers argued that the system let corruption flourish. (Reuters)

Economy Grows Rapidly, Paced By Strong Exports
Powered by a surge in exports, the economy grew at a surprisingly vigorous 4.7 percent pace during the final 1996 quarter, more than twice as fast as during the summer, the Government reported.
Despite this latest surge, coming after nearly five years of steady growth that has kept factories humming and pushed unemployment down to low levels, the economy showed almost no signs of strain. Indeed, inflation by one important measure shriveled to the lowest point in 30 years. For the full year, the nation's real gross domestic product advanced 2.5 percent, the best performance of any of the world's advanced industrialized countries. [Page 1.]

Unocal Signs Burmese Deal
The Unocal Corporation has signed a deal with the Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, to expand its rights to explore and develop gas fields off the country's coast. The signing came as the Clinton Administration weighed whether to impose a ban on new American investment in Myanmar because of its human rights abuses. [4.]

Group Split on Factory Standards
A Presidential task force created to set voluntary minimum standards at apparel factories in the United States and abroad has agreed on child-labor and anti-harassment practices but remains badly split over wages and hours. The group includes representatives of labor unions, human rights groups and industry powerhouses like Liz Claiborne, L. L. Bean and Nike [1.]

Hilton Makes Formal Bid for ITT
As promised, Hilton Hotels formally made a $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid for 50.1 percent of ITT. Even though the price of ITT's stock has traded consistently above the bid price of $55 a share since Monday, when Hilton announced it would pursue ITT, Marc Grossman, a Hilton spokesman, characterized the offer as "strong." [35.]

Stock Market Falls Slightly
The stock market ended a volatile month with a volatile day as the Dow Jones industrial average, after once again threatening to top 6,900, ran out of steam, dropping 10.77 points, to close at 6,813.09. The day, which closed with a series of late-afternoon computer-guided program trades, seemed a fitting end to a month of ups and downs, one in which traders were preoccupied with balancing news of strong economic growth with concerns about inflation. [37.]
 
Bonds Rally on Economic News
Treasury prices gained yesterday as a flurry of economic reports failed to convince bond investors that inflation had become a problem. Investors are confident that Federal Reserve policy makers, who start a two-day meeting on Tuesday, would not raise short-term interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.78 percent, from 6.86 percent. A week ago the yield was 6.88 percent. [36.]

Coca-Cola Has Strong Earnings
Coca-Cola said that its profits soared 18 percent during the fourth quarter, buoyed by growth in international soft-drink shipments and by an increase in market share throughout most of the world. Net income rose to $762 million, or 31 cents a share, from $648 million, or 26 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1996, meeting Wall Street analysts' estimates. [35.]

Sentence in Internet Stock Fraud
The former chairman of Systems of Excellence was sentenced to 46 months in prison for his role in a multimillion-dollar stock fraud that used the Internet to promote his company's shares. Charles O. Huttoe pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and one count of money laundering in November but that plea was kept under seal while he cooperated with Federal prosecutors. [34.]
 
Dollar Is Mixed
The dollar finished mixed after falling on negative comments from top German central bank officials and then rising on a Commerce Department report that showed a healthy American economy with benign inflation. [32.]

HEADLINE: The Roar of Cold Cash on Snowy Maine Trails

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: MOOSEHEAD LAKE, Me., Jan. 26

 BODY:
Snow draped the evergreen boughs of the spruce and balsam fir trees in fresh white. Here in the Great North Woods, hundreds and hundreds of square miles of remote forest, home to moose, beaver, lynx and the wily, rarely seen fisher cat, the only sound you can hear is---- vroooom.
Vroom, vrooom, varoooooom. Vrooom. Vrom, vrom. Vrooooom. 
 Here they come on their Ski-Doos and Arctic Cats: the Devil's Sledders, Moosehead Riders, Readfield Blizzard Busters, Hungry Hollow '76ers, Smokey's Angels and the rest of the snowmobilers, blasting through the woods at highway speeds and pumping tens of millions of dollars into tiny hardscrabble villages where people used to piece together a bare living cutting down trees and guiding hunters and fishermen.
The trail is broad and smooth as a road, and many of the snowmobilers will roar along for a hundred miles or more in a day, waving at the riders coming in the opposite direction and pausing sometimes in big clumps at trail intersections.
Encased in black leather and a helmet, Jim Lecuyer lounged with a group by his machine and took in the view. During the week, he drives a truck in Boston.
"Down there, it's a zoo," Mr. Lecuyer said. "Here, you could hear a snowflake fall."
Vroooom. He swung back on his snowmobile and the group was off, with the distinctive snarl and metallic smell of a two-stroke engine. Vrooom, vrooom.
Once a blue-collar pastime -- actually, red plaid in northern New England, where the locals favor wool hunting garb -- snowmobiling is now a major industry. So big, in fact, that a study just released by economists at the University of Maine found that snowmobiling had brought $226 million into the state's economy last year, more than twice as much as the ski slopes, which generated $110 million.
"Snowmobiling turns the wheels here in the wintertime -- we'd be lost without it," said David Costa, the town manager of Greenville, which had a population of 1,040 in the 1990 census. "This is big business, make no mistake. It's saved us the last few years."
The sleds are so important that Greenville, like Jackman and other nearby towns, invested big money this year for huge snow-grooming machines -- $100,000 for two for Greenville -- to smooth the trails in the hope of attracting more riders. And this winter, the various towns, snowmobile clubs and resort owners in the area got together to groom connecting sections of the Moosehead Trail, which runs all around the lake, which, at 40 miles long and 20 miles wide, is the largest lake in the East. It is lovely here, but it is so isolated and empty that mapmakers tend to cut out the region and stick it in the Atlantic Ocean so they can get all of Maine on a page.
"This was a poor man's sport in the 70's," Mr. Costa said. "No more.
"There's some serious money being spent on this sport. Six sleds in a family is not uncommon. And expectations have grown. People expect excellent groomed trails. That's why we bought this expensive equipment."
Paul Fichtner 3d, the Arctic Cat dealer in Greenville, president of the Moosehead Riders snowmobile club and, not uncoincidentally, the operator of the new grooming equipment, could not agree more. Along with Kevin McDonough over at Kelly's Landing restaurant and other business people, he pushed for the groomers and helped raise the money.
"Everybody else around was buying this equipment," Mr. Fichtner said, "and this stuff makes a big difference" in the competition for the snowmobile trade.
"This has become an affluent people's sport," said Mr. Fichtner, who is known as Arno. "The business is almost all downstate or out of state. A lot of local people can't afford to participate."
"Flatlanders are my bread and butter," he added, using the northern New Englander's term for people from the cities and suburbs to the south. "I don't mean 'flatlanders' in a derogatory way."
Twenty years ago, a snowmobile cost around $650 and was likely to be used by a farmer zooming around his pasture to relieve winter's boredom. They are more sophisticated now, with heated handgrips and powerful engines that make them go 100 miles an hour, and they cost $3,000 to $10,000, with a typical purchase about $5,500. There is even a tiny snowmobile for children 6 to 9 years old, called a Kitty Cat.
The snowmobile enthusiast, Mr. Fichtner noted, also needs a trailer to haul the sled; the enclosed boxes now becoming popular are running from around $1,200 to $2,500. (The sports utility wagon or suburban minivan hauling the trailer can mean an additional $35,000 or so, but it can be used year around, husbands point out.) The cold weather clothing with sled manufacturer's logos -- snowmobilers are fiercely loyal to their brand -- go for about $230 for a jacket and $180 for a bib overall. In leather, they are $479.95 and $439, respectively, Mr. Fichtner said. A helmet is $250, and boots, mittens and other odds and ends go another $250 or so.
"Then there's the trinkets: helmet clocks you can put on your desk, Arctic Cat notepads," he added. "We're not in an area that affluent, but I've been in stores downstate where they can't keep that stuff on the shelves."
The University of Maine's report found that the state's income from snowmobiling had gone up 74 percent since the last survey, in the early 1980's, when the sport was in the doldrums because of high gasoline prices and a recession. Snowmobile registrations had fallen to a low of 53,415 then; now they are now up to 76,477.
Nationwide, snowmobiling is a nearly $4 billion industry, with some 1.3 million machines registered, and the pattern has been similar, said Chris Jourdain, executive director of the American Council of Snowmobile Associations. Manufacturers' surveys show that most snowmobiling families nationwide have incomes of about $60,000, Ms. Jourdain said, "with more and more tending toward $80,000."
The survey here found that out-of-state sledders averaged family incomes of $68,213, while Maine snowmobile families averaged $47,492.
"This is a huge sport," said Bob Meyers, editor of the newspaper of the Maine Snowmobile Association. "And it's all built on volunteer labor."
Indeed, the snowmobile infrastructure that has been developed in recent years accounts for much of the success, said Stephen Reiling, a University of Maine economist (and sometime snowmobiler) who is the principal author of the report. Snowmobile clubs and volunteers have built and maintained an elaborate 12,000-mile interstate trail system stretching into Canada and New Hampshire. In this area, the clubs, Chambers of Commerce and town officials cooperate to buy the grooming machines -- municipalities get lower interest rates on loans and are exempt from sales taxes -- and they are eventually repaid by state grants coming from snowmobile registration fees and a tiny share of gasoline taxes.
There is even a state snowmobile czar, Scott Ramsey of the Bureau of Parks and Lands, who last year took care of about 200 miles of state trails and distributed $902,000 in grants to towns and $344,000 to clubs to maintain club trails. Part of the $20 snowmobile registration fee goes to the Fish and Wildlife Service, whose game wardens are the state's most powerful police agency. The wardens set up roadblocks along the trails to nab drunken snowmobilers.
"Last year, we had 12 fatalities," said Sgt. Tom Ward, who was stopping passing snowmobilers with four other wardens the other day and handing out safety leaflets warning of the dangers of speed and alcohol. "We're trying to stop that. One guy was drunk -- ran into a fishing shack at 100 miles an hour."
Farther along the trail, it was standing room only for the all-day buffet at an inn called Pittston Farm, 30 miles into the woods and a long way from anywhere. Once, the Great Northern timber company stabled horses here who would drag the logs out of the woods in winter. The logs would be piled on the river ice 25 or 30 feet high, chained into booms and floated to the mills in the spring. But the last river drive was two decades ago. On this weekend, the farm was surrounded by a constantly changing parking lot with scores of snowmobiles.
True to the university study, the crowd was largely made up of men in their early 40's, although there were families, too. The study, however, said nothing about size. Impressive girths made it clear that this is not an aerobic sport. These people can eat.
Ken Twitchell, the owner, figures that on a good day, he can dispense 250 pounds of mashed potatoes, along with, among many other rich dishes, 20 gallons of chili and 90 pounds of pot roast. He can also sell 1,800 gallons of gasoline.
"Wasn't no business, winters," Mr. Twitchell said, until the snowmobile trails were connected a few years ago and he groomed his section.
"I was trying to groom with a homemade drag on a snow sled," he remembered, musing that people might someday hang old trail-grooming gear over lodge fireplaces the way they do wooden skis. "Just thinking about spending $53,000 for the new machine was scary. But I figured either you've got to go the whole hog or nothing."
Mr. Fichtner, the Arctic Cat dealer and snowmobile club president, tried to put his finger on the appeal that led to the boom.
"There's unparalleled peace and quiet," he explained. "If you shut your machine off."

HEADLINE: VOLUNTARY RULES ON APPAREL LABOR PROVE HARD TO SET

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In a groundbreaking effort to set minimum standards at apparel factories both in the United States and abroad, a Presidential task force that includes representatives of labor unions, human rights groups and industry powerhouses like Liz Claiborne, L. L. Bean and Nike has agreed on child-labor and anti-harassment practices but remains badly split over wages and hours.
The task force hopes that if it can agree on the voluntary standards, they will be embraced by the entire American apparel industry. It would look for bully-pulpit help from President Clinton, to whom it hopes to send its report by late February. 
 But the panel is by no means united on what the standards should be.
The apparel companies in the task force, which want to set standards in order to dispel any notion that they themselves use sweatshops, say factories, whether in New York or New Delhi, should not be considered sweatshops if they pay the local minimum or prevailing wage.
The unions and the human rights groups, on the other hand, maintain that such a wage is often too meager to support a family. They say factories should be considered sweatshops unless they pay wages high enough to meet basic needs.
The members of the task force have pledged to keep their deliberations confidential. But several participants disclosed in interviews that in addition to the pay dispute, there was a split over hours.
The unions and the rights groups contend that factories should generally be considered sweatshops if employees are required to work more than 48 hours a week. The apparel companies say factories should be free to require a 60-hour week.
Any standards adopted would presumably have great potential to influence factory conditions in Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and dozens of other countries on which American clothing and footwear makers rely for production.
For one thing, the task force is leaning toward setting up a monitoring organization to insure compliance at factories that are under contract to companies that accept the standards. Further, it is discussing a proposal under which all such companies would be entitled to place "no sweat" labels on their clothes.
While the task force hopes that all major American apparel companies will adopt the standards, some members fear that if those standards are too strict, many companies will not sign on.
"It's not going to be helpful just to keep these standards to a small number of participants," said Roberta Karp, a co-chairwoman of the panel, who is general counsel of Liz Claiborne. "We really hope to galvanize the industry to go further."
Despite their differences on some issues, the business, labor and human rights participants have been able to reach agreement on others.
On child labor, the task force has agreed that factories should generally not use workers under 15, although in some countries they would be allowed to employ 14-year-olds.
Further, for an industry where workers often complain of being smacked, groped or shouted at, the group has adopted anti-harassment standards that some independent human rights advocates praise. The participants have agreed that "every employee shall be treated with respect and dignity" and that "no employee shall be subject to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse."
The task force, the White House Apparel Industry Partnership, was created last August. Its membership is made up of representatives from 18 organizations, among them Reebok, Nicole Miller, Patagonia, the National Consumers League, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
When the task force meets on Monday in Washington, the members will focus on methods of monitoring compliance with whatever standards are adopted, and on narrowing their differences over wages and hours.
One member, Jay Mazur, president of the textile employees union, declined to discuss the deliberations, but said: "On the question of wages generally, of course workers should be paid enough to meet their basic needs -- and then some. Most minimum wages are not adequate to do this."
But apparel companies and retailers say they fear that a "living wage," one that meets "basic needs," could prove too expensive and too hard to define.
"When you cross the line into what is a living wage, you get into this incredibly murky area," said Robin Lanier, senior vice president for government affairs at the International Mass Retail Association. "You don't have a concrete standard, and you wind up having to fend off charges that you're not supplying a basic wage."
Advocates of a basic-needs standard say it would not be hard for the task force or independent economists to come up with one, employing local indexes that gauge the cost of goods, housing, transportation and so forth.
Indeed, one task force member who objects to the apparel industry's stance on wages suggested that if agreement could not be reached on this issue, the panel's entire effort might collapse. "If we are not able to inject into the wage standard something meaningful about its meeting basic needs," this member said, "this whole thing is going to go down."
The adoption of standards would provide benefits to each of the effort's principals:
*The apparel makers in the task force hope that they can once and for all rid themselves of embarrassing accusations that the factories they use are sweatshops. These companies hope to avoid the kind of negative publicity that Kathie Lee Gifford and the Gap encountered for using Central American factories that were widely viewed that way.
*For labor, the standards might not only improve the lives of apparel workers around the world but also protect jobs at home, by raising the cost of production overseas. In a concession to labor, the task force has agreed that "employers shall recognize and respect the right of employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining."
*For President Clinton, the task force, though formally independent of the Administration, might burnish his image with unions by demonstrating that he is fighting sweatshops.
*And for consumer groups, the standards would be important because many shoppers want assurances that the clothes they buy are not made in sweatshops.
"We are committed to working with business, unions and human rights groups to insure better working conditions," said Linda Golodner, a task force co-chairwoman who is president of the National Consumers League, founded in 1899 to fight sweatshops. "There should be a way that the industry works together to establish something that consumers can rely on to be sure that goods are sweatshop-free."
Industry and union officials agree that whatever standards are adopted will probably push up production costs, but they say it is too early to estimate whether costs would rise several pennies or several dimes a garment. Ms. Golodner noted a recent poll of Americans in which 84 percent of respondents said they would be willing to pay $1 more for a $20 garment if they knew that it was not made in a sweatshop.
"The companies and retailers see that consumers care about this issue, and are feeling public pressure," said Maria Echaveste, administrator of the Labor Department's wage and hour division. "By tackling international standards and by making commitments to eliminate abuses abroad and not just in this country, they are taking extremely significant steps."
In one recent case of the kind at which the standards would be aimed, labor advocates accused the Walt Disney Company of allowing its Pocahontas and 101 Dalmatians apparel to be manufactured at factories in Haiti that pay 27 cents an hour -- that country's minimum wage but, these advocates say, far too little to support a family. Disney disputes the accusation, saying the factories pay at least twice the Haitian minimum.
"Many third-world countries set minimum wages below subsistence because they are trapped in a competition with each other to attract jobs," said Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee, a workers' advocacy group. "We've unleashed a race to the bottom as countries offer cheap, compliant labor. The basic-needs proposal seeks to set a floor high enough for people to live on."
But Steven Pfister, the National Retail Federation's vice president for political affairs, said a basic-needs standard was unnecessary.
"The fact that companies are investing in countries, notwithstanding the charge that they are seeking cheap labor, is enhancing the ability of these people to meet their basic needs," Mr. Pfister said.
Even on an issue resolved by the task force, child labor, the accord was struck only after a long dispute, participants say. Unions and human rights groups initially proposed that no one under 15 be hired. But the industry argued that such a demand was unrealistic, because in many impoverished countries families put
 12- , 13- and 14-year-olds to work, to make ends meet.
Given that, the unions and the human rights groups agreed to a standard that would allow apparel factories to hire 14-year-olds in those countries that permit children under 15 to do factory work.

HEADLINE: THE BIG CITY;
The Matatu Conjecture

BYLINE: By John Tierney 

 BODY:
THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS PRESENTED THE challenge shortly before Christmas: Could I possibly get them tickets to "Chicago" for an upcoming Friday night? I wasn't optimistic. The musical had just opened to phenomenal reviews, selling $1 million in tickets the first weekend. Broadway insiders accustomed to snagging house seats were complaining they couldn't get tickets before spring. Ticket brokers were being shut out; the first several I called wouldn't even bother looking for tickets. Eventually I found a broker who was offering $70 orchestra seats -- for $175. I was about to call the out-of-towners and confess that I had no better Broadway connections than they did.
Then a wild idea occurred to me. I looked up the "Chicago" ad in the paper and dialed the number for Ticketmaster. A minute later I had four seats in the center of the eighth row of the mezzanine, at $57.50 each. Now my only quandary was what to tell the out-of-towners. Should I revel in triumph ("Well, I don't want to get my connection in trouble, but let's say just I knew who to call") or admit the truth? Aside from enabling me to pose as a savvy New Yorker, wouldn't the lie also be good for my guests? Wouldn't they enjoy the show more if they thought the tickets were impossible to get? 
 I decided to be honest, which goes to show why I will never be a successful promoter, especially in New York. The city's trend-conscious industries and arbiters -- its theaters, restaurants, nightclubs, its fashion designers, art dealers, real-estate brokers -- traffic in illusions of scarcity. Manhattan, an island crowded with people who came here because it's crowded, is the mecca for those who don't want a seat unless they have to fight someone else to get it.
Economists explain this longing as a complicated consequence of the "snob effect" (we want something because it's available only to an elite) as well as the "bandwagon effect" (we want something because everyone else is buying it). It may seem frivolous, a lemminglike pursuit of fashion and status, but choosing something for its popularity can be a sensible form of decision-making. I call it the Matatu Conjecture, in honor of the strategy used by commuters in Kenya who ride in vans called matatus.
When choosing between competing vans waiting to depart from a depot, Kenyans typically get into the most crowded one -- for two reasons. A commuter sees the crowd as a useful bit of information about the quality of service; presumably all these people wouldn't have chosen a terrible driver or van. And because the first matatu to fill up will be the first to leave, a commuter knows that the crowd itself creates better service. Similarly, the popularity of a restaurant or play would seem to tell you something about its quality, and for many events the crowd itself creates a better experience, since you'll probably enjoy a concert or a play or a restaurant more if you're surrounded by an enthusiastic throng.
The problem, though, is that New York promoters have figured out the same counterstrategy as the matatu operators. When you spot a crowded van in Nairobi and take the last spot, another passenger may promptly get off, a ringer having been hired by the driver only to make his van look full. New York club owners sometimes hire people at hourly wages to stand outside in a line, but generally the city's promoters rely on more subtle variations. Restaurants keep window tables occupied and use partitions to hide empty tables in the back; theaters and restaurants quietly paper the house with people getting discounts or freebies.
"If a press photographer is coming to a restaurant, the smart owner does everything he can to fill the seats with warm bodies," says Ken Frydman, a restaurant consultant in Manhattan. "He calls his friends. He has some of his employees dress up and be customers for the evening. Some inexperienced owners want the photographer to shoot empty tables to show off the decor, but I tell them, 'People don't eat decor.' They go to a restaurant because they see other people there."
To create lines, promoters routinely offer some tickets well below the market price. By selling a few front-row seats for $20 shortly before each performance, the producers of "Rent" have induced people to camp out all day on the sidewalk, serving as a splendid advertisement to entice other customers to pay full price. And once they've attracted a crowd, promoters know that it's risky to tamper with popularity by raising prices. They appreciate the danger demonstrated by Gary Becker, a Nobel laureate economist at the University of Chicago. His paper, "A Note on Restaurant Pricing and Other Examples of Social Influences on Price," presents price-demand graphs showing how a popular restaurant can suddenly be ruined if people don't see a line at the door.
But no matter how much scheming promoters do, no matter how many lines they manufacture, there is ultimately a limit to consumer demand: all the seats cannot be filled all the time. My experience with "Chicago" wasn't particularly unusual. Broadway seats are easier to come by than the public realizes -- most shows still have tickets to sell the day of the performance. The hottest restaurants in town are often stuck with empty tables at the last minute. The media ritualistically report on scalpers demanding thousands of dollars for Super Bowl tickets, but some scalpers always get stuck at game time selling tickets for face value or less.
New Yorkers' illusions of scarcity could be devastated this year, because some legislators are trying to eliminate the state law that restricts the reselling of tickets. If we had an open market with lots of competing brokers, tickets would be readily available for much less than what black-market brokers now charge for the seats they obtain clandestinely. Promoters couldn't fool us any longer with artificial lines and baseless buzz. We'd know exactly how popular any show or a concert is by looking at the price of the tickets in the open market. We wouldn't need inside connections (or be so tempted to lie about having them). We could see any show we wanted without standing in line. The question is: Would we still want to go?

Affairs of State
 The Rise and Rejection of the
 Presidential Couple Since World War II.
 By Gil Troy.
 Illustrated. 486 pp. New York:
 The Free Press. $27.50. 
 It is hard to read "Affairs of State" without coming to the conclusion that the modern First Lady simply can't win.
She is expected to advance a serious project of her own -- like mental health or drug abuse or health care reform -- but also to avoid the slightest hint of seeking power and influence in her own right. She has to humanize and support her husband, without making him look dependent or needy. She has to satisfy the millions in the heartland who want to believe in the traditional marriage, and see it reflected in the White House, but also to appease the more liberal elites who expect a First Lady to be an issue-oriented partner.
She also has to manage -- and endure -- a press corps that plays to the public's almost unconscious fear of a dangerous, devouring, unelected co-President. Most First Ladies try, at one point or another, to carve out what Hillary Rodham Clinton once called a "zone of privacy." Bess Truman protested to a press corps going through Eleanor withdrawal: "You don't need to know me; I'm only the President's wife and the mother of his daughter!" Most of the First Ladies also chafe, at one time or another, at being pushed into the role of household saint. "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" Pat Nixon said to photographers who wanted her posing in an apron one more time (a remark that would have got Mrs. Clinton all but burned at the stake 30 years later). And most of them, sooner or later, feel whipsawed by all the competing expectations. "I could stay here and pour tea and entertain the guests all day and I would be criticized," Rosalynn Carter said toward the end of her stint in the White House.
But no matter how these women rail against their fates, Gil Troy's portrait of modern First Couples, beginning with Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, suggests that these tensions are all but unavoidable. To begin with, contemporary First Ladies have the bad luck to be serving at a time when the definition of a "good marriage" is a matter of bitter dispute, indeed one of the issues at the heart of the culture wars. Nancy Reagan's adoring gaze at Ronnie was as offensive to some Americans as Mrs. Clinton's firm control over her husband's biggest domestic initiative was to others.
The days are probably long gone when most Americans could accept Mamie Eisenhower's blithe division of labor: "Ike runs the country and I turn the lamb chops." A lot of people simply wouldn't believe it; the women who survive and thrive as political spouses today are, by and large, not the lamb-chop-turning type. But a truly equal marriage in the White House, an out-in-the-open "two-for-the-price-of-one" deal, as the Clintons put it, leads inexorably to questions about "the unappointed, unimpeachable status of the First Lady," Mr. Troy, who teaches history at McGill University in Montreal, argues. One of the central themes of "Affairs of State" is that most Americans, with their abiding suspicion of government and the psychological baggage they still carry about powerful women, are simply not ready for anything like a co-Presidency.
"Who elected them?" is, of course, a question that could just as easily be asked about Cabinet officers, but rarely is. Still, it is not entirely a reflection of neurotic fears about women. The intimacy of marriage does not easily coexist with the coldblooded trade-offs necessary to get a legislative program passed; it can, in fact, cloud a President's judgment. The Clintons' health care debacle is one example. Mr. Troy writes about another in the Johnson Administration, when Lady Bird Johnson's beautification campaign was mired on Capitol Hill because Congress was resisting legislation to restrict billboards on Federal highways. "Even when Lady Bird was willing to compromise," Mr. Troy writes, "Lyndon refused, thundering, 'Ain't nobody going to be able to write a headline saying that Congress administers defeat to Lady Bird!' "
Still, there are strong historical forces that keep pushing First Ladies to the forefront of politics. Mr. Troy argues that the rise of the First Couple is not simply a function of the women's movement but reflects a mixture of factors, including the weakening of parties, the rise of personality politics, the increasing power of the Presidency and the Federal Government and, perhaps most important of all, "the rise of the mass media and the new political culture it spawned."
Presidents, their wives and their advisers were often eager participants in creating this phenomenon. They recognized the potential political payoff from a popular First Lady or an endearing White House marriage. Charles Colson wrote to President Nixon at one point, "The image of the First Family as it has recently emerged -- warm and appealing -- may well be one of the most important political developments of your Presidency." The Kennedys, of course, were masters at the game, granting unprecedented access to home and hearth to a press corps that was all too willing to suspend disbelief: "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy will bring youth, beauty and babies to the White House," U.S. News & World Report declared during the transition.
The Kennedy Administration, though, was the last time the occupants of the White House had so much control in shaping the story of the First Couple. Mr. Troy's book goes on to detail the struggle between the press corps and each ensuing Administration over the image of the Presidential marriage. Was Mrs. Carter a supportive, loyal helpmate, or a steel magnolia sitting in on Cabinet meetings to buttress a weak husband? Was Mrs. Reagan the happy exemplar of a traditional wife, occasionally trying to protect her husband's interests behind the scenes, or, as William Safire put it in 1987, "an incipient Edith Wilson, unelected and unaccountable, presuming to control the actions and appointments of the executive branch" and making her husband look "wimpish and helpless"?
After a while, there's a certain depressing familiarity in these story lines that creeps into the political culture: the stronger the woman appears to be, the weaker the man must be. Mr. Troy, perhaps in an excess of Realpolitik, urges future First Couples essentially to resign themselves to these attitudes. He offers a series of recommendations in an appendix, ranging from "Don't Forget Who's Boss" (hint: it's not the First Lady) to "When in Doubt, Go Retro" to "Don't Be Yourselves; Be Who They Want You to Be." He makes the case again and again that the more traditional First Ladies, like Barbara Bush, are often the most popular -- with the masses, if not with the reporters who cover them. "First Couples should give the American people the love story they desire," he writes. "The Presidential spouse needs to symbolize the warm, traditional marriage she and the President have established -- despite working around the clock to get elected -- and give a warm-hearted facade to a welfare state that has grown increasingly complex, bureaucratic and impersonal."
At times, the author seems to have a striking lack of sympathy for the women caught in this hall of mirrors. Nowhere is that more clear than in his disdainful treatment of Betty Ford. As "an outspoken feminist activist," he argues, she embraced the new values sweeping the nation and "in so doing, she may have cost her husband the White House in 1976 and the historical respect his Administration is now often denied." (This is an exceedingly hard case to make, given the other factors at work in the 1976 election, including Watergate, Mr. Ford's pardon of Mr. Nixon and the turbulent economy.)
In the end, Mr. Troy clearly comes down on the side of stiff upper lips and maintaining appearances. He notes approvingly that Mrs. Bush had a firm grasp of an old truism: "The less power you seem to want, the more you'll get and the more popular you shall be." That is, of course, the advice given to women since the dawn of time. It would be nice to see it tested someday by a First Husband.

 BODY:
YOU'D THINK THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED States Senate would have better things to do. But Trent Lott likes order so much that he often irons his cotton shirts after they have come back from the cleaners to remove any remaining wrinkles. "He criticized the way I ironed shirts one day," recalls Patricia Lott, his wife of 32 years. "I said, 'Fine, you do it.' So when the shirts come home from the cleaners and he doesn't like the way they're ironed, he does it. I don't."
Even in a world of blow-dried politicians, Lott is known for never having a hair out of place. ("I just spray it once and it stays," he says proudly.) Indeed, starched and sprayed, he seems as if he has always been preparing for more public inspection. Now he's getting it. With House Speaker Newt Gingrich engulfed in a storm over ethics, Lott has emerged as the nation's pre-eminent Republican. His conduct, perhaps more than any other factor, could determine the success of President Clinton's second term. 
 But Lott, who confesses to liking everything just so, could stumble, well-shined shoes and all. And the biggest obstacle for this Mississippi Senator may arise in his own caucus as he tries to tame the most rambunctious, conservative and independent-minded group of Senators in nearly 70 years. With the retirement of a flock of moderates on both sides, the institution's center has all but collapsed. Now the Senate is flush with nine new Republicans, eight of whom are conservative -- firebrands, even.
At first, Lott seems the ideal leader for this restive new class. He was a partisan soul mate of Gingrich from the time the two were backbenchers in the House Republican minority during the 1980's. As the Republican whip for nearly a decade, Lott was a fixture on the House floor, helping lead insurgent conservatives who opposed the Democratic majority at every turn. Lott had such a reputation as an unswerving conservative that when he was elected to succeed Bob Dole as majority leader last June, even moderate Republicans shuddered.
But fears of his radicalism may be overstated. A close look at his style and record shows that Lott is no ideologue. Throughout his career he has been driven much more by pragmatism and ambition. If Lott burns for anything, it is to keep the legislative trains running on time and to build a record of accomplishment.
Yet the danger for Lott, and for the Republican agenda in Congress, is that the very qualities that propelled his extraordinary rise to Senate leadership -- affability and a passion for order and achievement -- may also impede him now that he is there. Lott is confronted by a challenge that even the most adept legislator would find daunting: he must somehow satisfy the deep conservatism at the core of the new Senate without sacrificing the bipartisan coalitions needed to make laws.
Lott has confided to friends that he would like to be President someday. But if he is to pursue that ambition, he knows he cannot alienate the conservatives who are the foundation of his party. At the same time, he also must be viewed by the broader electorate as a leader who can steer Congress out of gridlock.
Even as the House whip, Lott did not have the stomach for partisan bomb-throwing that many of his comrades did. Unlike Gingrich, who for years had a tense relationship with Bob Michel, the House Republican leader who prided himself on working closely with Democrats, Lott always maintained a solicitous respect for his leader. He is that rare politician who, while content to work within the system, has somehow been able to project the image of true believer. Lott has so deftly played down his enthusiasm for compromise that he stunned many Republicans last fall when he embarked on a deal-cutting frenzy. He joined with Democrats to pass welfare and health-insurance reforms, raise the minimum wage and enact a safe-drinking-water measure. His deals prompted even the moderate Mark Hatfield of Oregon, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to warn his new leader in one closed-door session, "Trent, you're giving away too much."
A prominent Republican Senator says of Lott: "What bothers me is his possible abandonment of principle and philosophy. He doesn't have the same kind of ideological drive that, frankly, Bob Dole had. In the end of the last session it just began to resemble an Arabian bazaar -- just giving the Administration whatever they wanted. That was disturbing to some of us."
The Senator, fearful of crossing his leader, spoke on the condition of anonymity. But if such sentiments come to be widely held and conservatives are not placated, Lott's control over the Senate could be undermined. In an institution where one member can gum up the works for hours, the new Senators are not likely to stand by and watch a leader who forsakes his conservative principles.
Lott presides over a different institution than he did just a few months ago. The new Senate more resembles the rebellious House of 1994. Forty-three Senators, including 25 Republicans, are alumni of the House, the largest proportion in modern history. During their long years in the minority many of those Republicans were schooled in partisan guerrilla tactics. Republicans are still short of what Lott calls "that magic 60" -- the 60-vote majority necessary to break efforts to block legislation through filibuster. But with a comfortable majority of 55 Republicans, the largest since 1929, this Senate may produce the first anti-abortion majority since the Supreme Court permitted abortion a quarter century ago. Lott could be saddled with an institution ready for confrontation and reluctant to compromise.
George Washington is said to have explained to Thomas Jefferson that the reason for creating the Senate was to have one house that is more thoughtful and deliberative. "We pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it," Washington said.
In the new 105th Congress, the Senate threatens to boil over with a reprise of issues that exploded in the last session in the House, like flag burning, late-term abortion and term limits. Many Republican Senators say they will not be content merely to join with the Democrats to pass the balanced-budget amendment, which failed in the last Senate by one vote. They hope its passage will embolden Republicans to push through other initiatives like tax cuts. Republicans also expect to bring about a sweeping review of regulations governing public health, safety and the environment; only last year, a more moderate Senate rejected as too radical a similar measure that had passed the House.
It is something of a role reversal only two years after Gingrich and the Republicans seized control of the House. Their rightward revolution left the more moderate Senate uncomfortably out of the limelight. But last November, House Republicans saw their numbers diminish to the slimmest majority of either party in four decades, while Senate Republicans picked up two seats.
"I'm not up here to be a potted plant," says Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. He replaced Howell Heflin, a Democrat who in 1986 cast the pivotal vote to deny Sessions a Federal judgeship and who accused him of racial insensitivity. This new Senator intends to press for allowing prayer in public places, saying, "There's a feeling that the Government has been hostile and disrespectful to people of faith."
Even in states where one Republican replaced another, there is movement to the right, as in Oregon, where Gordon Smith, a frozen-food executive, succeeded Hatfield. In Kansas alone, the replacements for Senators Dole and Nancy Landon Kassebaum are two hard-driving conservatives, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts. Brownback, a member of the rebellious class of 1994 in the House, moved even further to the right during his Senate campaign last year, calling for cuts in education, fewer environmental regulations and restrictions on abortion -- as well as the elimination of no fewer than four Cabinet agencies. "The country is moving more conservative and the Senate reflects that," Brownback says. "If the President puts forward 10 new programs he wants us to start, you're not going to see that happen."
When Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, went from the House to the Senate in 1995, he was considered something of a misfit, impatient with the more deliberate pace. Now, he hardly stands out. "We're willing to negotiate," Santorum warns, "but we'll negotiate on our turf. In the past, we've negotiated on the other guys' turf."
Indeed, many Democrats say Lott will preside over a Senate that is ruled by ideologues. Senator Tim Johnson, a freshman Democrat from South Dakota and a 10-year House veteran, says: "Some of the partisan mean-spiritedness that has overtaken the House appears to be contagious and may be gaining ground in the Senate. There are forces that would like to move Lott into a combative right-wing mode."
Already, many conservatives are furious at Lott for one of his first moves this year: agreeing to seat Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat from Louisiana, even as an investigation continues into accusations that voter fraud gave her an edge over her Republican opponent, Woody Jenkins. Lott followed past practice of dispatching the Rules Committee to conduct an inquiry, but some conservatives say he should have picked a more committed partisan than the committee's chairman, Senator John Warner of Virginia. "It upsets me terribly," says William W. Pascoe 3d, political director of the American Conservative Union. "He was caught up in all this balderdash about the spirit of bipartisanship."
Lott should take notice of such talk. So should other Republicans with designs on the White House, like Senators John McCain of Arizona, Phil Gramm of Texas and even Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who is soon to preside over the hearings on White House fund-raising. Even without threatening Lott's post as majority leader, those Senators would be only too eager to grab the mantle of conservative leader -- and the allegiance of conservative freshmen -- for themselves.
Asked if he, like some other conservatives, thinks Lott was too accommodating to the Democrats last year, Vin Weber, a former House member and a close friend of the Senator, chooses his words carefully: "I withhold judgment on that. Trent was not really leader in the true sense of the word. He sort of completed Dole's tenure as leader." Weber is one of many conservatives who find themselves explaining away Lott's behavior. It is hardly encouraging for Lott that rather than praise the Senator, the best his longtime ally can do is withhold judgment.
 CHARACTERISTICALLY, LOTT PLAYS TO BOTH SIDES WHEN he explains his actions last year. In what sounds like a bone for the conservatives, he says the compromises "could have been a result of the circumstances and the timing" and were not "necessarily a model for how we'll operate." He explains that part of the impetus last year was "the fact that I was new and that I was trying to force action to conclusions on legislation" in an effort "to get the approval ratings up of the Senate."
But then Lott could not help but betray his enthusiasm for making law: "There was a moment where if we didn't do those things, they weren't going to be done -- maybe not then, and maybe never. I have very strong principles and philosophies that I believe in. But what good is a 100 percent pure position if you don't produce any results for the people you care about and your country?"
This artful weighing of principle and product has been a tenet of Lott's professional life. But the new Republicans, not nearly as focused as Lott on building a record, may not accept Lott's balancing act. Sessions, for one, says getting a law passed is not always the goal. Even if he fails, he says, he's determined to press for aggressive efforts to cut waste and fraud in Government. "There are things I'm going to try that I wouldn't have had the energy to try if I had been here 18 years," he says. "And some of those will succeed."
Wayne Allard, a freshman from Colorado, says he plans to co-sponsor a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag burning, a cause he pushed when he was in the House. "We need to recognize there was a lot of blood shed behind that flag."
But Lott is not big on symbolic causes, so do not expect him to champion a flag-burning measure. He has no interest in bringing up an issue for a vote unless he is certain it will pass. This longtime legislative whip, the man whose job is to marshal votes, still views success in terms of passing laws: product, not polemics. When asked what he wants to accomplish this session, Lott does not list goals. He lists bills -- and the list is long. Lott will try to satisfy conservatives with other issues he thinks may have better prospects, like prohibiting late-term abortions. "The social and cultural decay in this country is a major problem and a major concern," he says, "and I think that late-term abortion is a horrible procedure."
Even so, as much as the freshmen talk passionately about eroding morals, Lott has no intention of letting grandstanding on social values preoccupy the Senate. "These issues will be voted on again and they will play out this year," he says. "But they're not going to be things that I just pound home repeatedly. What I prefer to do is bring it up, have a good debate, have a vote -- and win it and move on."
Will that be good enough for the hard-edged conservatives? Lott certainly seems to think so. He pleads ignorance of the notion of an obstreperous class of agitators, citing first Susan Collins of Maine, the only moderate (and only woman) among the nine new Republicans. "Oh?" he asked, bounding down a hotel corridor in Grand Rapids, Mich., shortly after the election. "I didn't notice that. Susan Collins? Who are you talking about? Wayne Allard? These are all very mild-mannered people."
As majority leader, Lott is quite comfortable asserting control by making rules. He recently backed efforts to make sure pedestrians do not stray from designated crosswalks on the Capitol plaza. But his most basic impulse is to control by making friends. The political solar system Lott has created around himself operates upon personal attractions and loyalties. The strategy has worked well for Lott. It is no accident that he is the only person to have ever served as Republican whip in both the House and the Senate, responsible for rounding up votes on both sides of the aisle.
Yet some conservatives wonder if Lott is too friendly to Democrats. Consider the scene on the Senate floor the first Tuesday in January, when members were sworn in. The Senate leader roamed the deep-blue-carpeted floor of the chamber as if attending a garden party, offering bear hugs to Senators like the two liberals from Massachusetts, Edward Kennedy and John Kerry. At that moment on the other side of the Capitol, there were no hardy embraces between Gingrich and the Democrats.
It does not reassure conservatives that Lott seems to get on well with Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. Eyeing an oil portrait of a smiling Dole on the wall of Lott's outer office, Daschle allows as to how there is a comfort level that did not exist with Dole. It is in part because he and Lott are closer in age. Lott is 55; Daschle is 49.
Moments later, when Daschle is ushered into Lott's office, the majority leader, characteristically, is all hospitality. "Y'all pull up a chair and have a seat," Lott says. Both Senators shed their jackets as Lott seeks Daschle's guidance in working out the Senate schedule. "I wanted you to look over that, go over it and make sure that you understand what we've got there," he says.
And while Lott warns that the Senate might not sign off easily on Clinton's appointments, particularly to the Federal judiciary, so far he has mostly played the accommodator. Hours after Madeleine K. Albright was selected Secretary of State, he assured her that "you'll do fine -- we look forward to working with you." Asked when he hung up the phone why he seemed so soft, he quickly dispensed with the sweet talk, saying Albright would be asked a lot of "very critical" questions. That never happened. The Albright nomination sailed through unanimously.
If it is Southern civility that he lavishes on Democrats, Lott is positively solicitous of his freshmen. One of his first outreach efforts was to hold formal orientation sessions at which the new members and their families could learn the ways of the Senate. In the past, such gatherings were more haphazard. And Lott won praise from junior members when he supported new rules that limit Senators in most cases to one committee or subcommittee chairmanship, a move that spreads influence among more members.
Smith of Oregon, for one, says he is indebted to Lott for a spot on the Budget Committee, "which I prize." He boasts, "I'm the only freshman." Asked if this means he will be more willing to go along with the majority leader, Smith says, "Of course it does." But Smith leaves himself an escape. "I'm certainly going to be deferential to him," he says, "to listen to him, to follow him when I can follow him, when I think he's right."
Lott courts the veterans just as aggressively, praising his leadership team at every turn. To smooth relations with Don Nickles of Oklahoma, his second-in-command, over whom he leapfrogged on the leadership ladder, Lott gave him a larger office and a bigger staff. And he saw to it that instead of being called whip, Nickles is referred to by the more impressive title "assistant majority leader."
In the world's most exclusive club, these gestures mean a lot. "Trent has been putting more responsibility to me as assistant majority leader -- and a better office," Nickles says. "I appreciate that."
But it is the moderates who speak most effusively about Lott. That is because time and again, he has demonstrated that he believes partisan cohesion is more important than conservative dogma. In the House, Lott won the allegiance of Olympia Snowe, who was then a Representative of Maine, when he appointed her as deputy whip, even though her moderate views were at odds with the Republican leadership. Snowe, now a Senator, is one of his most vigorous loyalists. "He does have a more conservative agenda, but he doesn't drive an ideological agenda," she says. "Trent's not going to force us to walk a political plank when it's totally unnecessary."
This year, Lott discouraged efforts by some conservatives who threatened to challenge the chairmanships of perhaps the two most moderate Republicans, Senators John Chafee of Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont. His support might make it less likely that Chafee or Jeffords will stray from the majority on close votes. "He's an excellent person to work with as long as you're square with him," says Jeffords. He and Lott are particularly congenial because they perform regularly in a quartet called the Singing Senators.
Lott has a booming bass and a style that is more open and affable than that of his predecessor, Dole, who was less gregarious -- and less likely to involve many Senators in decision-making. But Dole was also far less controlling. Lott injects himself into the nuts and bolts of committee assignments, concerns that Dole often relegated to Sheila Burke, his chief of staff.
Lott is a master at using charm to get things done his way. Consider how events unfolded after McCain stepped down as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. American Indian groups inundated the Senate with faxes and phone calls, imploring Lott not to give the post to the next Republican in line, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, who is viewed as an opponent of tribal self-government. Their pick was Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, who is part American Indian. With Gorton holding on the other line, Lott, speaking from his office in December, assures Campbell he could convince Gorton to pass up the job. But Lott first has to make sure Campbell wants it.
"If we could work it out where you could be chairman of Indian Affairs, would you be interested in that?" Lott asks Campbell. "I think we've got it worked out with Slade. But I just want to make sure you were interested. And if you are, I'll try to wrap that up tomorrow. O.K.? All right, sir! O.K.! That would be great! Thanks a lot, Ben!"
Lott adds a cautionary note: "Hey, Ben. That's not official yet. I've got to do a couple other things. O.K.? Thanks, buddy."
Then he grabs the line where Gorton is holding. He talks about options for Gorton, but does not tell him that he has just assured Campbell he would get Indian Affairs. "I'm sorry I didn't get back to you quicker," he says. "But I've been just swamped here." Everything went smoothly when Campbell's ascension was announced weeks later; Gorton ended up taking the chairmanship of an aviation subcommittee instead of Indian Affairs.
It is a telling demonstration of Lott's need for order, and his yearning for legislative accomplishment, that his one public outburst as leader was not directed solely at Democrats. Barely three weeks after he took over from Dole, Lott stunned official Washington by upbraiding his Democratic and Republican colleagues for gridlock, asserting that the Senate had become "all balled up here -- and it's not my fault." In Trent Lott's Senate, there is little patience for partisan posturing. He wants results, even if it means consorting with the other side.
 LOTT'S NEED FOR CONTROL, TO BRING order to legislative chaos and, most of all, to satisfy both sides, may stem from his upbringing as an only child in Pascagoula, on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. He often found himself as the intermediary between his feuding parents; his mother, Iona, now 83, was a schoolteacher, and his father was a shipyard worker who died in a car wreck in 1969 that Lott says was linked to a drinking problem.
Determined, as ever, to manage his image, Lott is reluctant to talk about his father's drinking. "I just don't like to get into personal things," he says. But after some prodding, he discusses his childhood, if only to prove that he is "not ashamed" of his past: "My mother was an educator, a very religious person. Very opinionated. Very blunt, a disciplinarian, a great lady. My dad was a little bit of a happy-go-lucky fellow and he liked to have a good time. He was a hard worker, very proud of his family. Had a drinking problem. He had problems with it all his life. And that sort of problem does affect you. You are forced into problems between your mother and your father. It makes you maybe grow up maybe a little early.
"But it wasn't a dysfunctional family or a cruel family. After I was 4 or 5 years old, I don't think my father ever laid a hand on me. It's not a sad story of oppression or depression or meanness. It's not something that I go home and brood about or cry about."
Lott's early friends say he never revealed any problems at home. He was voted Most Likely to Succeed by his Pascagoula High School class of 1959. "There were the goody-goodies and there were the hoods," says Jerry Dossett, a high-school classmate who runs a pawn shop in Gautier, Miss. "I'm sorry to say that I fit in with the latter group. But that Trent -- he could adapt himself to either group when he wanted to."
Even at the rowdy Sigma Nu fraternity at the University of Mississippi, Lott's passion for control was on display. "Trent was a meticulously neat fellow," recalls Roy Williams, a lawyer in Pascagoula who went to high school with Lott and roomed with him in college. "He had all the tools to be a hell raiser: a good talker, good looking and well liked by all the girls. But he never did raise hell. We never talked about politics in those days, but I recall him as always doing things in moderation, always being in control."
Lott, of course, has not lost the Southern sociability that he displayed in high school and as head cheerleader at the University of Mississippi. Combined with his driving ambition, his charm helped him leap over more senior colleagues to claim the job of Republican whip, then majority leader of the Senate.
His overriding pragmatism has also served Lott well, and it was obvious from the start of his political career. In fact, he was once a Democrat, albeit a conservative one. Lott had barely begun his law practice on Mississippi's Gulf Coast when Representative William M. Colmer, a Democratic segregationist and chairman of the Rules Committee, summoned him to Washington in 1968 to be his top aide. When Colmer retired in 1972, Lott, feeling increasingly alienated from liberals and anticipating the rise of conservatism in the South, announced that he was seeking Colmer's seat as a Republican. He vowed to fight "the ever-increasing efforts of the so-called liberals to concentrate more power in the Government in Washington."
But putting votes over partisanship, Lott insisted on restraint in advertising his new-found Republicanism. "He said, 'I'm running as a candidate for Congress in an area that is not very Republican, and so I don't want the word "Republican" on the headquarters,' " recalls Evelyn McPhail, who until recently was the co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and was one of Lott's first volunteers. "We wanted to argue with him: 'You'll be the first Republican we've ever elected down here. We want that on our headquarters.' He said, 'No, you're going to do 'Trent Lott, Congress.' That was the first indication I had that Trent was the boss."
Indeed, one of Lott's most impressive achievements is that he has managed to maintain his conservative credentials while pursuing deals. He has always won near-perfect ratings on social and economic matters from right-wing groups like the American Conservative Union. As late as 1983, Lott opposed the creation of a national holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Lott's discomfort with taxes and big government made him a champion of supply-side economics and deregulation in the late 1970's and 1980's. In fact, he was so opposed to taxes that in 1985, in a rare move, he abandoned Ronald Reagan on his top priority, a tax overhaul; five years later, he opposed George Bush's agreement with Congress to raise taxes. Even Lott admits that there have been moments of weakness. Most notably, he regrets supporting the 1986 tax-reform conference report because it didn't go far enough. "I didn't want to vote for that," Lott says. "I let the President talk me into it. If I could go back, I'd take that vote back."
Long a hawk on military issues, Lott was chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on strategic forces. He now sits on the Finance, Rules and Commerce Committees. He is vigilant in protecting Mississippi interests, especially the state's military-related concerns. But unlike many long-serving lawmakers who develop an interest and expertise in specific legislative areas, Lott is not usually identified with a particular issue. Instead, he channeled his energy into cutting deals and cultivating his colleagues so he could rise in the leadership. From 1981 to 1989, Lott served as minority whip under Michel, the minority leader. In that post, he sought to show fealty to Michel, who liked to work with Democrats, while also working closely with impatient conservatives like Gingrich.
John McCain says Lott was known as a hard-charging partisan because that was his role. "In the House, when he was whip of a minority his job was to be the adversary, the obstructionist," he says. "In the 80's, being in the minority, the only option you had was guerrilla warfare. You play the hand you're dealt."
But Lott felt stuck after 16 years in the House. He did not want to take on Michel, and unlike Gingrich, he had no master plan for breaking out of the minority. "I'd been in the leadership eight years," he says. "I didn't see Bob Michel leaving any time soon."
Senator Thad Cochran, the senior Republican Senator from Mississippi, a rival of his for years, says Lott moved on when he was threatened by others like Gingrich and Dick Cheney. (Cheney succeeded Lott as whip, Gingrich succeeded Cheney, and six years after Lott's departure, Gingrich became Speaker.) "When Dick Cheney and Newt Gingrich came in, he started to get crowded from behind," Cochran says. "He was beginning to lose his chance. Cheney was an unusually gifted person who had a lot of friends in the House. The word was, if Trent doesn't hurry up and run for leader, they might turn to somebody else."
So Lott gambled in 1988, giving up a safe House seat to take on a popular Democrat, Representative Wayne Dowdy, in a state that was still considered Democratic. Not surprisingly, he rose faster in the Senate, an institution that puts a premium on Lott's propensities toward civility and accommodation; he was elected secretary of the Republican Conference, the No. 4 leadership post, after the 1992 election. His biggest coup was in ousting Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming as whip after the 1994 election. With help from his Senate colleagues who had also served with him in the House, he won by a single vote. Capitalizing on the Republican takeover of Congress, Lott pitched himself as a conservative complement to the newly Republican-controlled House. That put him in line for majority leader. And in what was seen as another unseemly breach of Senate custom, last June, Lott took on and defeated his state's senior Senator, Cochran, who also sought the post.
Many of Lott's peers expected him to be far more partisan than Dole. But Lott's politics prove to be nearly as flexible as Clinton's. In fact, for years, one of his closest advisers was Dick Morris, who while advising Clinton in 1995 was meeting weekly with Lott. In his new book, "Behind the Oval Office," Morris says Lott spoke with derision about wayward House freshmen who refused to go along with the Republican budget plan. "He began to refer to the House freshmen Republicans, the radical purists, as the ayatollahs," writes Morris. "While in basic agreement with their conservative views, he had a professional politician's contempt for their naivete."
After he defeated Simpson for the whip post, Lott says Simpson urged him not to try to relive the partisan battles that scarred the House. "He said, 'Look, I know you came from a horribly mistreated, oppressed minority in the House where every day you had to battle for your very existence,' " Lott recalls. " 'It was partisan. It was mean. It was hard. Forget that. The Senate is not the same. You're not going to ever get anything done if you don't have some partisan cooperation." Simpson, who retired this year and was regarded as the moderate when he lost the whip's race to Lott, says he nows considers Lott "a moderate, thoughtful leader." In fact, the Senate is known for softening the hard edges of its members, even if newcomers are not always ready for mellow moderation.
 CLINTON AND LOTT, on opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, at times seem like bookends. "We both live next to the same river," the Mississippi, says Lott. "We both came from blue-collar families. We're about the same age. We're the same religion -- Baptist." Lott goes on, sounding as though he might be describing himself. "He's very capable, very intelligent, very smooth -- and he's a very worthy adversary."
Clinton agrees that "we have some similarities in our upbringing and, obviously, in the culture in which we grew up."
Lott declares himself to be an optimist and insists that Congress can be productive if it keeps separate its legislative duties and the inquiries into the Clinton and Gingrich ethical allegations. But many Democrats fully expect Senate Republicans to keep the heat on Clinton in retaliation for the Democrats' ethics campaign against Gingrich.
Lott's role model as majority leader is not Dole but Dole's predecessor, George Mitchell, the Democrat from Maine who was known for masking relentless partisanship with a judicial demeanor. "He was an intelligent leader and an effective one," Lott says. "He had a way of being very gentle and soft, in the way he appeared. He appeared moderate, but he was very tough. So I think there's something to be said for that."
He is already exhibiting traits that Mitchell put to good use. In the same language that Mitchell used with Bush, Lott has called on Clinton to go first, show leadership and come up with the first budget proposal. Declaring, "I want the President to lead," Lott says it is up to Clinton to put forward the first proposals on such volatile measures as wringing savings from Medicare.
Lott calls his approach to the White House, and to the Senate, not revolution but "regular order" -- the phrase Senators shout on the floor when rules are not being followed. It is a fitting choice of words for a majority leader obsessed with control. But he is essentially setting a challenge for the President: You hammered us relentlessly during the campaign about Medicare, and you promised to balance the budget. Let's see how you do it.
At times, Lott, still bitter over the Democrats' successful drive last year to portray Republicans as willing to sacrifice Medicare, sounds as if he is spoiling for battle. "I thought what the Democrats did, what the President did on Medicare was irresponsible," he says. "I thought it was demagoguery. They have not leveled with the American people. They have misled the American people. There is no question about that. They know it. We know it. You know it."
Further friction is inevitable. Clinton, the day after his second inauguration, called for a broad rewrite of campaign-finance laws, and Daschle says it is his top priority. But Lott argues that the problem may be more with the Democrats' fund-raising practices; the most he is willing to do for now is hold hearings. And Senate Republicans say they have no intention of "fixing" the welfare bill that was passed last year, as the President has suggested. Another area of tension may be over Clinton's use of the new Presidential line-item veto. "There are concerns that the President might use it in some ways that were not intended -- or could be interpreted as being political," Lott says.
Clinton might also find Lott to be less deferential than Dole if a foreign policy crisis erupts. "Bob Dole was a person who had a reverence for the office of the Presidency," McCain says. "He supported the constitutional authority of the President as Commander in Chief. That's an area where we may have trouble. Suppose another Bosnia arises? Lott just doesn't have the broad years of experience that Bob Dole has."
But for now, it is the freshmen, not Lott, who are more willing to register doubts about Clinton. "I've gotten a sense that you have to be pretty careful when you make a deal with this guy," says Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who joins the Senate after a career as an investment bank executive. "I will do all I can to work with the President. But when I think the President needs to be challenged and he's off track and off base, you'll hear from this Senator from Nebraska."
Since it is too soon to proclaim the end of gridlock, these are anxious days in Washington for both conservatives and liberals as they watch their standard bearers to make sure that their penchant for accommodation does not get the best of them. Clinton and Lott have spent much time on the phone with each other in recent weeks; often their staffs do not know of the conversations. The two have also been spotted chatting in the White House residence. Just as William Pascoe of the American Conservative Union complains that Lott did not use his power to try to deny Mary Landrieu her Senate seat, a Clinton aide gripes that the President does not marshal his influence to act tougher in his dealings with Lott. "It's amazing," says this aide, sitting only steps away from the Oval Office. "It's as if he doesn't know he's won and is afraid to use the power. He could go up there and [expletive] on Trent Lott's shoes if he chose to."
 AS LOTT AND GINGRICH stood before a roomful of reporters at a conference of the Republican Governors Association in Grand Rapids, Mich., late last November, one questioner asked what was on everyone's mind: Which politician is now the true superstar of the Republican Party? Gingrich, conceding the obvious with good humor, immediately pointed to Lott. Lott did his best to play down his role, saying he and Gingrich and the Republican Governors would all speak out on issues. "It's not going to be a majority of personalities," he assured the gathering. "This is going to be a majority of ideas."
Lott was speaking as much out of pragmatism as out of modesty. After witnessing a two-year case study on how not to run a revolution, Lott knows from Gingrich's experience that he must be careful not to appear too headstrong or unwilling to work with Democrats. While much of the partisan fervor that marked the House two years ago exists in the Senate today, Lott and his freshmen will express it in subtler, smarter ways.
One of his biggest worries is that he not repeat Gingrich's missteps of appearing to bask in his new-found power. "I will do my share of the Sunday talk shows," he says, "but I will not do it every weekend. We've learned some important lessons over the last two years. How we do things, and how we talk about what we're doing, makes a big difference."
Lott's point is that too often the House Republicans were outwitted by the White House, allowing Democrats to unfairly paint them as intolerant, extremist and unfeeling on issues like Medicare. "If you talk about things in military terms, it may not be well received," he says. "If you talk about what it means to an elderly person or a teen-age girl or for families, then they see that closer to home. Bill Clinton vetoed our budget bill and shut down the Government. He shut it down. But he got away with convincing the American people that Congress did it. That won't happen again."
As Senator Connie Mack of Florida, a member of the leadership and one of Lott's closest friends, puts it, "He is very sensitive to make sure he's not overplaying the situation." Mack says that reflects not only Lott's concern that he not repeat Gingrich's mistakes but also a more participatory approach. "It's generational in the sense that those in Trent's generation, we learned a different type of management, much more participatory than Bob's management, which was very hierarchical." He adds in a chest-thumping baritone, 'I am the leader.' "
But no matter how participatory Trent Lott is, no matter how much he tries to control, his colleagues are monitoring him closely for signs of movement to the middle. Even Gramm, who backed Lott for majority leader, is not prepared to classify him as die-hard a conservative as he is. "No one," Gramm says, "is as committed a conservative as I am."
Lott knows he had better watch out for such wary skeptics if he is to tame the new Senate. He says that was the only parting advice from Dole, who often scrapped with Gramm. "He cautioned me about a couple people to keep an eye on," Lott says. "People who'd give me trouble."
 
THUNDER ON THE RIGHT
 
Senator Alan Simpson, now retired, advises successors: "Relax. You're not here to be a firebrand; you're here to be a legislator." But several new Senators, and some veterans, are very likely to make work, or trouble, for the Republican leader.
 
SAM BROWNBACK, KANSAS
Elected in 1996.
Succeeds: Sheila Frahm, the interim replacement for Bob Dole.
Previous job: U.S. House of Representatives.
 A leader of the House class of 1994, Brownback derided "the imperial Congress" and pledged not to stay in the House long. He did not. Now, just two years later, he stands out in the Senate class of 1996 as perhaps the most prone to revolution. He is less seasoned but more of a troublemaker than the other freshman Republican Senator from Kansas, Pat Roberts, a 16-year House veteran. But Brownback has an outlet for his impatience: he has been named to head a Governmental Affairs subcommittee that deals with Government restructuring.
 Agenda: Brownback says he is most passionate about balancing the budget and fears that President Clinton is not as committed. "It's like what Ronald Reagan said, 'Trust but verify.' " he says. "I trust that he wants to balance the budget, but I want to verify that he actually does."

GORDON SMITH, OREGON
Elected in 1996.
Succeeds: Mark Hatfield, Republican.
Previous job: Frozen-food company executive.
 Smith, who campaigned as a staunch conservative, narrowly lost a special election early last year for a Senate seat from Oregon. When he ran for the other seat months later, he recast himself as a moderate in the Hatfield mold. While Smith does not have the persona of an aggressive conservative, some Republicans expect him to take the right-wing positions that marked his original run for Senate and his service in the state Senate. During his first U.S. Senate race, for example, he said landlords "should not be forced to rent to homosexuals" and emphasized his opposition to abortion and his support for rewriting environmental laws.
 Agenda: Smith says that the parties need to work together but that he fears the ethics clouds over Clinton and Gingrich will make that difficult. "My biggest fear is that it will all break down in recriminations and acrimony and that we'll never rise to the mandate of the electorate, which is to figure things out."

JEFF SESSIONS, ALABAMA
Elected in 1996.
Succeeds: Howell Heflin, Democrat.
Previous job: Alabama Attorney General.
Sessions's past experience with the Senate could not have left a good taste. His nomination to be a Federal judge was scuttled in 1986 after Judiciary Committee members (including Heflin) objected to sworn statements in which Sessions attacked the N.A.A.C.P. and the A.C.L.U. as "un-American" and "Communist inspired." Of the Ku Klux Klan he once said, "I used to think they're O.K." until he learned that some members were "pot smokers." In the campaign, Sessions promoted himself as an authentic conservative and won vigorous backing from religious conservatives.
 Agenda: Sessions says he intends to work to undo many regulations that unduly burden businesses. He says he also will press his views on social issues like opposing gay rights. "Government institutions seem to be quite hostile to anybody who makes a moral choice that gay activity is not acceptable and shouldn't be approved," he says.

TIM HUTCHINSON, ARKANSAS
Elected in 1996.
Succeeds: David Pryor, Democrat.
Previous job: U.S. House of Representatives.
 The Whitewater controversy has been a boon to Hutchinson. When Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, a Democrat, resigned after being convicted in a Whitewater-related case, the Republican Lieutenant Governor, Mike Huckabee, moved up to Governor. That created an opening for Hutchinson, who had served in the House since 1993 and who was closely linked with Newt Gingrich by Hutchinson's Democratic opponent. Hutchinson, a former Baptist minister, is closer to religious conservatives than any other freshman and may push hard to ban late-term abortions.
 Agenda: Hutchinson says he is determined that taxes be cut for American families. "The things that came out of the House that were dead on arrival when they came to the Senate -- some of those we'll now take a second look at," he says.

CHUCK HAGEL, NEBRASKA
Elected in 1996.
Succeeds: Jim Exon, a Democrat.
Previous job: Investment bank executive.
 In one of the big upsets of 1996, Hagel, a political unknown, won the Senate seat over Gov. Ben Nelson. Hagel is so fervent about cutting taxes to spur growth that he went beyond embracing Bob Dole's plan for a 15 percent tax cut; his other ideas include eliminating the capital gains tax as well as estate and gift taxes.
 Agenda: Hagel says he will press for cutting taxes and reining in entitlement programs. "If we continue going along the path we're going now," he says, "we will certainly ruin our country. I think we've asked Government to do too much in the last 30 years." Saying he is not in a great mood to compromise and cut deals, Hagel adds, "I did not run for the United States Senate because I need a job."

RICK SANTORUM, PENNSYLVANIA
Elected in 1994.
Previous job: U.S. House of Representatives.
 At 38, he is the youngest Senator and brash at that, some say to the point of arrogance. Ready to take on anyone who does not hew to his conservative views, Santorum has been impatient with the traditions of the Senate. He was the leader of the movement to oust Mark Hatfield as chairman of the Appropriations Committee for opposing a balanced budget amendment.
 Agenda: He will probably press for constitutional amendments on issues like late-term abortion and flag burning and to jab at moderate Republicans like Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont. "If the Democrats are still going to be in denial that they're not in the majority," he says, "and continue to be obstructionist and slow the process down, if they continue these tactics, we very well could have some pretty tough times."

JOHN McCAIN, ARIZONA
Elected in 1986.
 He has newfound power as chairman of the Commerce Committee and may differ with Lott about being too accommodating of Democrats. But McCain is not always predictably conservative; his views can be eclectic. He already clashes sharply with Lott on a major issue that is not at all ideological: McCain is championing a bipartisan drive to overhaul campaign-finance laws and limit the amount of money spent on campaigns. Lott has raised objections.
 Agenda: He says campaign-finance reform is crucial. "I have differences with Trent Lott and will continue to," he says. "I'm sure in many ways he regards me as a thorn in his side. But frankly, he's got to handle this campaign-finance reform issue."

JESSE HELMS, NORTH CAROLINA
Elected in 1972.
 The Senate's best-known mischief maker, Helms kept an unusually low profile in the last session, perhaps because he was up for re-election. A favorite pastime has been provoking secretaries of state and holding hostage nominees for ambassadorships. Madeleine Albright, the new Secretary of State, has worked patiently to build a relationship with Helms, which paid off with his courteous treatment of her at her recent nomination hearing. But at some point, contention is likely between Helms and the White House over Clinton's decision not to enforce aspects of the Helms-Burton Act, which punishes some foreign companies that do business with Cuba. Another possible area of contention: relations with China.
 Agenda: After years as something of a lone wolf, Helms is also sure to find more support among his colleagues for hard-right positions on social issues like opposing civil rights for homosexuals.

PHIL GRAMM, TEXAS
Elected in 1984.
 He ran unsuccessfully in the Republican Presidential primaries but was re-elected to the Senate in November -- and remains as outspoken as ever. His Presidential ambitions are still burning, and he has a new platform as chairman of the Finance subcommittee that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. Gramm could spoil efforts by Senate Republicans and the White House to reach bipartisan consensus. As one Congressional Democrat observes about Gramm's new post, "Can you be chairman of something you oppose?"
 Agenda: Gramm vows to make sure Senate Republicans do not waver in their conservatism. "I don't intend to be accommodating," he says. "We won the election."

HEADLINE: SAILINGS WORLDWIDE;
Not Just Cruise Ships Anymore

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL is a business reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
HEAVY bookings for millennium cruises, including cruises whose price and itinerary are not yet established, promise to jump-start the cruise business for the year 2000. But right now the industry is perplexed about 1996, worried about 1997, and wondering whether any of those heady projections about the growing popularity of cruising will be realized before the next century.
To insure that popularity, the biggest ships (whose number -- and size -- are growing rapidly) have virtually become floating destinations, competing with resorts for vacationers' dollars. Elaborate spas, entertainment complexes, boutiques, children's programs, wedding services and sports facilities are to be found on such modern ships as the Carnival Destiny, the Century and the Galaxy. 
 More shorter cruises are being offered, as well as more eco-tourism itineraries and more unusual ports of call.
When 1996 year-end statistics are released in about a month they are expected to show a slight gain over the 4.4 million cruise passengers in 1995 and the 4.5 million in 1994. But deep discounting bedeviled the industry again last year, notably for Caribbean cruises. And industry projections of at least 8 million passengers by the end of the decade (down from 10 million a few years ago) were quietly lowered last year to 7 million.
Nevertheless, many analysts envision a better showing in 1997. The economy is expected to be stronger, there are no Summer Olympics vying for discretionary travel dollars and it is unlikely that spring and summer will be unusually cool and rainy, as they were in 1996.
"The industry was too optimistic last year," said Victoria L. Hallstrom, the cruise analyst for Lehman Brothers. "And some of the ad campaigns seemed more concerned with image than addressing the public's concerns." Those concerns included several well publicized shipboard incidents in 1996 and 1995, including fires, groundings, the abrupt shutdown of Regency Cruises and exploding toilets on the QE2.
This year, with seven new ships scheduled for delivery, most early signs are favorable.
Reservations are strong into early summer. Recent surveys report that people who have cruised are generally well satisfied, while many others who have not cruised expect to do so in the near future. The average age of cruisers has fallen to 49 from 52 in 1986, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. And the fastest growing cruise population is the 25-to-39 age group.
Even the advertisements currently touting the 1998 introduction of the Disney Cruise Line are expected to pay dividends this year. The assumption is that the entire industry will benefit from Disney, the most famous name in vacations, which has put its stamp of approval on cruising and associated it with such words as "magical," "fantasy" and "fun."
The Disney name is also expected to help in another way. While cruising has been the fastest-growing segment of the travel business for about a decade, it still attracts only a fraction of the millions of people who take vacations each year. Cruising's potential remains huge -- especially if it succeeds in selling itself as a less expensive alternative to land-based vacations, in particular resort vacations, or if it can combine both elements in a single package.
The Disney Cruise Line is already promoting weeklong packages that will include three or four days at sea and the remaining days at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.
Other cruise lines will provide competition. Through May, Royal Caribbean's Nordic Empress will combine three- and four-night sailings from San Juan to the Virgin Islands, with remaining nights at any of five resort hotels in Puerto Rico and one in the Dominican Republic. American Hawaii's three- and four-day cruise segments can be combined with stays at any of 15 hotels on Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the Big Island.
Positioning cruise ships as floating resorts is a prime motivation for the many new plush spas and high-tech fitness centers, the Broadway-sized revues in Broadway-sized theaters, bigger and more attractive casinos, upscale shops and boutiques, miniature golf courses and, in 1999, an ice skating rink aboard a new Royal Caribbean ship.
Two months ago Tom Cruise attended the world premiere of his movie "Jerry Maguire" aboard the Celebrity Galaxy during her visit to New York. And last month the Crystal Symphony became the first cruise ship to perform a licensed show of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs; the Crystal Harmony will repeat the show next month on cruises through the Panama Canal.
In the case of spas, shops, on-board art auctions and casinos, a parallel motivation is, of course, additional revenue. During her recent refurbishment the Norway added 36 slot machines for a total of 239, and relocated the library and card room from a high-traffic area to make way for revenue-producing perfume and jewelry shops. The new Celebrity Galaxy's big, ultra-modern spa offers three levels of treatment from $200 to $699, the last of which includes a treatment with a seaweed soap shower, medicinal mud pack, herbal steam bath and massage.
Holland America is using an unusual approach to combining the vacation experience with additional revenue: Last month it bought an uninhabited, 2,400-acre island in the Bahamas, which it renamed Half Moon Cay. When its ships begin calling there late this year, on Caribbean and Panama Canal cruises, passengers will find not only paddle boats, a children's play area and other recreational activities, but also a shopping center complete with an art gallery. Similarly, Royal Caribbean has a fine arts and crafts shop on its private island, Labadee, in Haiti.
Twenty-one cruise lines offer honeymoon, anniversary or vow renewal packages, while nine offer wedding packages and four others plan to do so. Dolphin Cruise Lines' wedding packages, for example, cost $275 to $750, although options like wedding cakes, photographs, flowers, catering and music can easily triple that amount.
Shore excursions are also a growing source of options for passengers and revenue for cruise lines. While shore trips range from the predictable to the plush, many now include nature walks, eco-tours and historical excursions.
Holland America's Statendam recently began offering the first tour by a cruise operator to the land of the Carib Indians on Dominica, while the Windstar plans to have a full-time naturalist aboard when it begins weekly cruises under sail later this year along the coast of Costa Rica. Many of American Hawaii's shore excursions are designed around Hawaiian culture. And Silversea Cruises arranged for its lectures and excursions to be led by photographers and journalists who have traveled on assignment for National Geographic publications.
The industry's reputation as environmentally friendly suffered a possible setback with the December disclosure that a Federal grand jury in Puerto Rico had handed up a 10-count felony indictment against Royal Caribbean charging the line routinely dumped waste oil and falsified log books to cover up the dumping. Last month Royal Caribbean pleaded not guilty to the charges. A spokesman for the line, Richard Steck, said last week that the company planned to meet with the judge and schedule a time for "various filings."
Despite that assertion, the cruise business overall appears to be making a good faith effort to go beyond Federal and international regulations governing the environment, including monitoring the impact of pollution from fuel in buses and other vehicles used by the cruise lines.
This year 130 ships will call at more than 1,800 ports, including such off-the-beaten-sea-lane destinations as Casablanca (Windstar), Tasmania (Orient Lines), Dubrovnik, Croatia (Costa) and Chiloe Island, Chile (Seabourn), which Darwin visited on his way to the Galapagos Islands.
On May 27, the refurbished Norwegian Star will begin seven-day "Texaribbean" cruises to the western Caribbean from Houston. The cruises, the first ever year-round cruises from the Port of Houston, will call at Cozumel and Calica in Mexico and Roatan in the Bay Islands, Honduras. The main reason, officials of Norwegian Cruise Line said, is that the Southwest has the highest concentration of 45- to 75-year-olds in the United States, a prime target group for the cruise industry.
The American Canadian Caribbean Line, whose three 100-passenger ships range between Labrador and the Amazon, will offer two new 12-day cruises in each direction this summer between Massena, N.Y., and Rocky Harbor, Newfoundland. The Carnival Inspiration will call for the first time at St. Lucia and Santo Domingo, on its seven-day southern Caribbean cruises beginning May 11. And the QE2, recently reconfigured to accommodate 1,500 passengers instead of the previous 1,750, is currently at sea on its 75th world cruise, a 103-day round trip that will call for the first time at Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Muscat, Oman.
Any of its eight remaining segments, ranging from 10 days (Yokohama to Bombay or Haifa to Southampton) to 32 days (Hong Kong to Lisbon), can still be booked.
Around-the-world cruises fell to four this year from eight in 1996, and even the number of Alaskan cruises will drop in 1997 -- to 362 from 432 last year. But that statistic masks the fact that since the introduction of large ships into the Alaska market, the number of cruise visitors there has grown almost 150 percent in the past decade to about 450,000.
BECAUSE of Americans' preference for more and shorter vacations, the fastest growing cruises are those of two to five days, a segment that has increased 325 percent in the last 15 years. So while Premier, Majesty and Dolphin ships continue their extensive three- and four-night itineraries, primarily between Florida and the Bahamas, Mexico or Bermuda, many other cruise lines are adding similar short cruises. Twelve percent of Royal Caribbean's 68 itineraries in 1997 are three- or four-day cruises from Miami, San Juan and Los Angeles.
In their appeal to families, cruise lines are adding amenities for children: menus, playrooms, 24-hour pizzerias, supervised activities and, on the Carnival Destiny, a 214-foot spiral water slide.
Older "kids" will find a major change on Carnival. Since Feb. 6, the line has required that passengers on all its ships must be at least 21 unless accompanied by someone 25 or older occupying the same cabin. But married passengers under 21 can rest easy. Not only are they exempt from the regulation, but Carnival, as well as at least a dozen other cruise lines, will be happy to sell them a honeymoon package.

Since the $400 million Carnival Destiny was launched in Monfalcone, Italy last October she has enjoyed the distinction of being the world's biggest cruise ship. Built expressly to sail in the Caribbean, the Destiny is also the first cruise ship too wide (125 feet at pool decks) to transit the Panama Canal -- or, as Carnival put it, the ship may not be too wide, the Panama Canal may simply be too narrow.

HEADLINE: Railroads Should Play Bigger Role in Future

 BODY:
Your article ["County's Rails Tell of Past and Future," Dec. 22] told of some of the past, but to my dismay, incorporated little about the future. While it was enjoyable, it did not make any reference to the inequalities in public policy that almost brought the railroads to extinction.
I work for the New York State Thruway Authority as an emergency responder on the Tappan Zee Bridge. Every day I see the rat race Americans call commuting. High Occupancy Vehicle lanes lie idle as one-driver cars cram into long lines at EZ Pass and cash toll booths. Impatience, excessive speed and lack of driver attentiveness result in 90 percent of all incidents on the span. Politicians focus their attention on ameliorating conditions by exercising cosmetic changes. The flanged wheel riding atop a steel rail is still the most efficient form of ground transportation. 
 Without the railroad the Industrial Revolution would not have reached the farmers in Nebraska or the fishermen in Seattle. Yet in America the railroads were almost abandoned because of the vested interest of a consortium of key corporations. That group's lobbying led to the passing of the Interstate Highway Act of the 1950's. The consortium purchased key interurban train and trolley transit systems and replaced them with buses and automobiles. Americans were robbed of their transit investments and steered to riding buses and cars.
The car, bus and truck flourished on publicly financed streets, roads and highways. American railroads had to capitalize and maintain their assets. It is a wonder that the railroads, overly regulated and strongly taxed, survived into the 1990's.
While I am not saying we should all sell our cars, I am asserting that transportation solutions should solve the problems we have today with an eye toward the future. Not one mile of new railroad track has been laid in Westchester County in 80 years. Yet politicians still talk of widening roads, building new bridges for traffic and instituting more H.O.V. lanes. The past has proven that those actions will only put more vehicles on the roads.
We must get people out of their inefficient cars and buses and off our saturated highways. Your figures of increased ridership on Metro-North indicate that many commuters are fed up with the traffic situations and are willing to use alternatives. Yet in spite of the increasing appeal of railroad ridership, mass transit projects lay idle on drawing boards or go unfinished, such as the Second Avenue subway or the East River tunnel that would allow Long Island Rail Road trains to ride into Grand Central Terminal. Rather than focus on the benefits of mass transit, we choose to spend millions on rebuilding the antiquated and woefully inefficient F.D.R. Drive.
Cars and buses have choked our metropolitan area to the point that it often takes longer to commute to our suburbs than it takes an astronaut to circle the earth.
By investing in a new rail line between, say, Port Chester and Tarrytown, building a bridge or tunnel to cross the Hudson River and continuing the rail line through Rockland and Suffern, we would create a viable alternative to commuting from our suburbs to New York City and across Westchester County. Regardless of the initial investment costs, the results would be the creation of an enormous financial initiative for commuters and a tremendous surge and benefit to our entire region. This economic model could be extended with the building of a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River to allow New Jersey Transit's Bergen and Passaic Valley line commuters access to Grand Central Terminal. We should invest in rail links between our three major airports, and we should resume rail service on Conrail's West Shore line.
I commute from Yonkers to Tarrytown at different hours. Once a month, though, I take the train from Hastings-on-Hudson. Yes, it takes 30 minutes longer than in my car, but it is safer and more economical and allows me to unwind.
Today's stainless-steel commuter trains are not the parlor, sleeping and dining cars of the 20th-Century Limited, but the view is still spectacular and generally unchanged. The red carpets may be rolled up, but the all-water-level route survives, a tribute to the mass transit concepts of the past.

HEADLINE: ART;
Retrospective Reflects Artist's Eye to Nature

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

DATELINE: WEST NYACK

 BODY:
LARGE though it is, the gallery at Rockland Center for the Arts here can barely contain its present attraction, a show by Hugh Mesibov, which covers 60 years and numbers almost 100 works. The congestion is spiritual as well as physical and small wonder, given the political, economic and esthetic turbulence of the period.
The artist, who celebrated his 81st birthday in December, has a long line of exhibitions to his credit -- in Manhattan and his hometown, Philadelphia, as well as in Rockland, where he has lived for 30 years. Not only that, he is represented in many prestigious collections, notably those of the Metropolitan and Whitney Museums, and murals by him adorn a score of public buildings, among them Temple Beth El in Spring Valley. Add to that an academic record that includes 23 years as a professor of art at SUNY Suffern, not to mention several awards and honors. 
 Yet, inexplicably, this show is the closest Mr. Mesibov has come to a full retrospective, and, a joint effort by his daughter, Deborah, and Eudice Charney, an art historian, it apparently took some organizing. A complete survey of his output would require, the artist said in a recent phone conversation, "more than one museum."
The son of a Russian emigre painter, Mr. Mesibov studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts until 1936. Though forced to leave the school by the death of his father and the exigencies of the Depression, the young man continued attending classes at the Barnes Foundation. No doubt some credit for his assured drawing style is due to these two Philadelphia institutions, particularly the Barnes, which first acquired his work in 1947.
In 1937, Mr. Mesibov signed on with the graphics arts division of the Works Progress Administration, where he became among other things a pioneer of the carborundum print. A lithograph pulled from a stone coated with carborundum resembles an aquatint, which is taken from an etching plate dusted with rosin. To the degree that the image is "extracted" from its background by means of burnishing, the process is akin to mezzotinting.
In any event, the granular surfaces of the prints in the show, three colored and one black and white, not only reflect the grittiness of the Depression era but also seem perfect for the artist's then rather somber approach to figuration.
Mr. Mesibov counted Social Realists like Joseph Hirsch and Robert Gathmey among his friends but steered clear of the movement himself, perhaps because he regarded art as more important than politics.
But if there is no sign of the typical Depression picture, which a wit once described as "an interior seen by the light of a 15-watt bulb," there are images that in one way or another reflect his awareness of the world. One is a small 1937 painting of a city on fire: Nanking, bombed -- presumably by the Japanese. Two are Surrealist landscapes with wrecked buildings that seem inspired by World War II. As for two 1970's scenes of small craft riding turbulent seas, it may be enough that they echo Gericault's sketches for "The Raft of the Medusa." Based on an actual shipwreck, this magnum opus of 1819 is regarded as the first example of high-art journalism.
Works of the 1940's and 50's imply the influences of, variously, Cezanne, Klee and Hans Hartung as well as Pollock and Motherwell. But the show as a whole indicates that, abstract or not, Mr. Mesibov seldom paints without an eye to nature, and this is never more obvious than in "Flaming Duet," a flurry of red, yellow, blue and black gestures dated 1959. In this canvas and others like it the artist blossoms as a colorist while at the same time laying the foundations of his present style.
While his principal inspiration now seems to be landscape, Mr. Mesibov's piece de resistance for the 1990's is the watercolor, "Bobbie No. 4." The subject, beautifully outlined in charcoal, lounges on a sofa, half clad in a red satin slip and extending one booted foot as if she were posing for an Expressionist like Egon Schiele. The artist has always been a man of his time, yet this picture reminds the viewer that for all his awareness of Surrealism, automatism and, to a lesser extent, Cubism, Mr. Mesibov has kept to his essentially Expressionist self.
A show that may surprise those who think they know his work, "Hugh Mesibov: 60 Years of Art" continues at Rockland Center for the Arts through next Saturday. The information number is 358-0877.

HEADLINE: Hard Times at the Chapel Square Mall

BYLINE: By JANINE LaMEDICA WOLFE 

 BODY:
WHEN Terry Cranville opened Zab's Backyard Hots in the Chapel Square Mall in 1984, downtown New Haven was a much different place.
"Back then, we had major stores, national chains, advertising, and there was a good draw to this area," said Mr. Cranville. "Now, without a major draw, parking is a real issue downtown, and we are not an alternative for any shoppers at all." 
 Following the withdrawal of Macy's in 1993 and Conran's in 1994, the future of the Chapel Square Mall became uncertain. To make matters worse, the Rouse Company, the Columbia, Md.-based real estate development company which managed the mall for 12 years and spent between $13 and $14 million renovating it in 1983, left the project in 1995.
"We have many properties in our portfolio," said Cathy Lickteig, vice president and director of corporate public affairs for the Rouse Company. "Certain properties like the Chapel Square Mall didn't have the same growth potential as many of our other properties."
"The Rouse people had a time frame," said Matthew Nemerson, president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce. "When they approached us in November of 1994, it was made clear we were talking 90 days. One of the things that we had to deal with is that a lot of people in the community, in fact, a lot of people around the country, said when places like Rouse want to get out of malls like this, you turn out the lights and you give it up.
"It really became for the community a kind of yes or no situation," Mr. Nemerson continued. "Were we going to be in a situation where there would be another bankruptcy, another closing of the doors and shutting out of lights? Remember this was six months before the Special Olympics World Games and we were thinking 'What's the message that we're going to present to the world?' "
Mr. Nemerson's first stop was the office of New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. "He was totally supportive," said Mr. Nemerson. "We became total partners in this effort."
"Once Macy's left, it became clear it was only a matter of time," said Mayor DeStefano. "There was a discussion between the city and the Chamber of Commerce in which we decided that the chamber should take over the mall. We knew we couldn't let the mall go into free fall and the city didn't want to have interim ownership."
Joining the city and the Chamber of Commerce in the effort to save the mall were Yale University and the Bank of New Haven. Linda Lorimer, vice president and secretary of Yale, described it as a collective effort to begin a community revitalization program.
"The mall is just one of an enlarging series of projects that will enable the community to pull its forces together to revitalize the downtown area and promote the humanitarian and financial future of the city," Ms. Lorimer said.
Mr. Nemerson said that Yale and the Bank of New Haven helped negotiate a price, then put in roughly half a million dollars to support the project.
"There was over $13 million worth of mortgages on the mall," said Mr. Nemerson. "The way it was structured was that there were three levels of mortgage. The first level was a traditional major real estate mortgage. When Rouse came in 1983, and rebuilt the mall, they spent about $13 or $14 million. They got about half of that from the New York State Teachers Retirement Fund. By the time that we were ready to take over the project, they had given up on it and they were willing to sell it to us for about five or six cents on the dollar.
"Then you had Aetna, who was an in-between mortgage holder, they had put in $5 or $6 million," he continued. "They had just written it off. Then you had another $2 or $3 million from local institutions, and they realized that the best thing that they could do would be to invest that money back into the community. Yale and the Bank of New Haven were willing to come up with an additional $500,000 to allow us to buy the debt that had to be bought."
The Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce has been running the mall since 1995 out of cash flow, according to Mr. Nemerson. "Our challenge has been to run a major project that's over 300,000 square feet and that had a lot of deferred maintenance and a lot of marketing challenges, just out of cash flow."
Barbara Johnson, senior vice president and New Haven regional manager for People's Bank, was chairwoman of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce during this transition. "The critical component to the success of this project was a willingness to step forward and take ownership," said Ms. Johnson. "We never expected to be mall owners, but it was critical to keep the mall open."
After earning the distinction of possibly being the only Chamber of Commerce in the United States to own a mall, the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce will soon turn over the Chapel Square Mall and the adjoining site of the former Park Plaza Hotel to a partnership between the Cordish Company, a real estate development company based in Baltimore, and the Omni Hotel Corporation, a developer of luxury hotels and resorts, based in Corpus Christi, Tex.
"We had been involved with the city in trying to look at alternatives for the Park Plaza Hotel when it was slipping toward bankruptcy," said Mr. Nemerson. "As the hotel got into bankruptcy court, it was going to end up on the auction block if a deal wasn't cut with some developer to come in and buy it. The way the deal worked was the developer said 'O.K., I'll buy it for a million and a half dollars out of bankruptcy, but if this whole thing doesn't work, I give it back to you for a million and a half dollars'."
David Cordish, president and chairman of the board of the Cordish Company, has overseen hotel development and gentrification efforts throughout the United States. Downtown New Haven, he feels, is an ideal location for a four-star hotel. Slated to be completed by the fall, the hotel project is expected to cost $27 million.
"Downtown New Haven is surrounded by two of the largest hospitals in the area, Yale-New Haven and St. Raphael's, and also by Yale University and, of course, the green," Mr. Cordish explained. "What we're working on is the 'hole in the doughnut,' those few blocks that need to be turned around."
Keith Coe, vice president of development for Omni Hotels, agrees. "In this one city you have a world-class university, an outstanding hospital system and business base, plus outstanding cultural activities like the tennis tournament and the Shubert Theater. We're convinced that this will be a hotel that New Haven will be proud of and we'll be proud of."
The city put a caveat in the contract that the developer could exercise the option to develop the Chapel Square Mall site once the hotel is 50 percent completed. Mr. Cordish said that his company fully intended to exercise that option, and was also planning "to put in a movieplex which can serve as a stadium-style conference center during the day and a movie theater in the evening."
In addition to an increase in conference, restaurant and retail activity, Mr. Nemerson sees an additional benefit for the residents of New Haven. "When the hotel opens, the difference in terms of jobs will be 350 jobs at the hotel," he said. "If it has a restaurant, that could be another 40-50 jobs. If it brings in only six or seven retailers, that could be another 50-60 jobs. These jobs will run the gamut from entry level right up to management track, that anybody who comes in at the entry level could go to."
Bringing people in from all over the country for conferences will also give the city of New Haven a chance to "cross sell" its cultural activities, Mr. Nemerson says. "Most conferences have a guest or spouse program and are going to want to have an event or reception or one of the sessions outside of the hotel. So that means that the British Art Center can get more business, that the local restaurants can get more business, that we can show off all New Haven has to offer."
For Mr. Cranville, whose Backyard Hots made it through the hard times, that's a hope and a promise.

HEADLINE: How to Find a Fit in the New Job Market

BYLINE: By KATHY KATELLA 

 BODY:
MICHAEL GORDON was unemployed when he signed up for Eugene Hodge's career class at Quinnipiac College in Hamden. Mr. Hodge offered this solution: Go discuss it with 10 or more people a week. With few alternatives, Mr. Gordon went to the New Haven green and started talking to strangers about sports, gradually steering the conversation his way: He had certain skills, he wanted to work with computers, what did the person think about it?
He grew less timid as he saw the payoff: Lawyers and other professionals were giving him encouragement, advice and leads. One tip led the former parking valet to Microtech International in East Haven and a temporary job that could open doors in a high-tech field. 
 "I found that there is so much more out there because someone else was telling me about it," Mr. Gordon said. "I went down different avenues I never would have known about."
The class he took is called the Job Readiness and Computer Literacy Training Program. Mr. Hodge introduced it at Quinnipiac after several years at Gateway Community College in New Haven and other places. The kind, but no-nonsense adjunct professor, popular among his students, invented the course while rising through the corporate ranks in computer-oriented positions at the Cigna Corporation, Pitney Bowes and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
His theory is that companies today want workers who are doing what they like to do, what comes naturally to them, and they also want workers to be computer literate. He tells stories of students from factory workers to Ph.D's who say these ideas helped them get off unemployment and start turning their careers around.
Of the 720 people who have taken the course in the last several years, 88 percent found work during or soon after completing it, he said, with salaries ranging from $8 to $75 an hour. One student started a new job in the Middle West as a construction engineering manager before finishing the course, and convinced his new employer to fly him back for the remaining classes.
Mr. Hodge seeks out the most promising applicants based on a questionnaire on their accomplishments and goals.
"I want people who want something, and they don't know how to get it. I only want those. I don't want people who need to be pushed," he said.
He also wants to reach such people by offering the course in educational institutions throughout the country. He is looking for support from corporations, foundations and other sources, specifically $150,000 to hire sales, marketing and training staffs. Connecticut Department of Labor funds, which helped launch the program at Quinnipiac in Hamden, have run out, and he would also like money to help students who can't afford the $1,300 tuition the college is now charging.
In some ways, it's been difficult promoting a course that many traditional educators would consider "radically different," Mr. Hodge said. Explaining that society has encouraged people to pursue what they are good at instead of what they enjoy, he throws words like qualifications, attitude and skills out the window. Rather than rely on aptitude tests, he encourages students to look inward for answers, basing their career goals on natural strengths and past achievements.
Then he tells them to go out and find out what other people think about them. "I've got a bunch of degrees, but if you don't like me because I'm black or because I'm tall, it doesn't matter," he said. "The person across the table says, 'I don't care what you're good at. It's not good enough for us.' "
In his classroom, students are encouraged to be straightforward in assessing each other, even if it means talking about "the scar on your face or how thin your hair is." The idea is to face reality, change or accept it, then move on to other things, Mr. Hodge said.
He also tells them chances at a good job are slim if they don't understand computers, and he teaches such basics as document and spreadsheet creation, data processing and desktop publishing.
"Especially as employers are going global, and downsizing is forcing people to produce more, the technology is what has limited a lot of people," Mr. Hodge said. "The company is moving along, and it needs to know how it can get its people to speak the same language."
Such ideas impressed the Department of Labor, which usually reserves its support for small and mid-sized businesses, said Janice Hasenjager, program manager for customized job training. The department liked the way Mr. Hodge addressed the rapid changes in the workplace. "He has been able to place people who have been out of work for a long time," she said.
Mr. Hodge said his ideas for the course came from his own experience. He described himself as "a youth at risk" growing up in Springfield, Mass., and entering the workplace with "limited perceptions" that held him back. One day he began listening to the people around him. "Once I began to follow their direction, things began to open up," he said. "I realized people were opening the door for me to go places I'd never been before. I went from almost being fired to being put on the fast track."
In the classroom, he tries to re-create that office environment with its mix of employees. Students have ranged in age from 19 to 72, and come from a variety of educational and professional backgrounds. One recalled taking the class with a mother trying to get off welfare and a Yale graduate trying to find the best career path.
"When I visit the class, I notice a mix of students, from people laid off from Pratt & Whitney -- they were machinists -- to Ph.D.'s," said Edward Kavanagh, dean of the Samuel W. Tator School for Lifelong Education at Quinnipiac. "The common thread is that these are people who had not expected to be out in the job market, and they needed some guidelines on how to go about it."
Many of them were finding that the rules had changed since their last job hunt. For instance, while some have computer skills, many have no experience with the Internet, an important job hunting as well as work tool, he said
Students say it also helps to have friends who are truly interested in their plights. Mr. Hodge, they say, encourages them, builds bonds among them and never lets anyone skip an assignment.
Mary Ellen Squeglia of West Haven recalled her discouragement after losing her job in property management. "I really didn't have a lot of motivation or enthusiasm at the time," she said. "I was really sort of disgusted with everything." Soon after meeting Mr. Hodge, she found her kitchen table piled with coursework, and realized it was up to her to make things happen. "He taught us different approaches to use and to never say 'not' to yourself."
She is now in a new industry -- having gone from a temporary job at the Yale School of Medicine to another for a pharmaceutical company since the class. "Really, in a way, temping is an inconvenience," Ms. Squeglia said. "Everywhere you go you have to learn something new. But the pluses are you get to see the different workplace environments before being permanent. I never thought I'd be in a medical environment -- never, never, never."
Robert Fiore of Milford, who was laid off as a boiler operator, is also looking at new possibilities He once had a job in a hotel and wanted to return to the industry, but needed skills.
"When I started working in the industry, you just needed to have a good pen, a smile and a lot of refills for the pen," he said. "Now, you go for a job interview and you have to be computer literate."
After realizing that he could get where he wanted if he developed the right skills, Mr. Fiore is now dreaming of managing a hotel, and ultimately owning his own hotel and restaurant. "I feel I have the foundation," he said. "It's a matter of taking what I have and polishing it."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
A Power Behind the Play Emerges Into the Light

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
THEATER IS A GROUP ENTERPRISE. It represents the joint labor of playwrights, actors, directors, set designers, costume designers and a long list of more or less anonymous foot soldiers celebrated only in the fine print of Playbill. Perhaps the most mysterious of these is the dramaturge.
The term dozed in comfortable obscurity until November, when a dramaturge named Lynn M. Thomson sued the estate of Jonathan Larson, the creator of "Rent," who died in 1996. Ms. Thomson claimed that she is entitled to 16 percent of any royalties paid to the Larson estate as compensation for her help in shaping the musical with Larson at New York Theater Workshop. Although the show is a hit on Broadway and already has one road company, with more on the way, it is impossible to predict how much it will generate in royalties. At the moment, say people familiar with the production, royalties may amount to between $15,000 and $30,000 a week. 
 Ms. Thomson is the first dramaturge who has tried to claim the status of a co-creator for her contribution, which, she argues, was so extensive that by the time "Rent" left the workshop stage, one third of it was new material. Her lawyers have requested a trial in May.
Suddenly, a vexing question was in the air: What on earth is a dramaturge?
Lloyd Richards, the artistic director of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., asked himself that same question in 1969 during the National Playwrights Conference, the center's annual summer event for new plays. Seeking to defuse antagonism between critics and playwrights at the conference, he invited certain critics to sit in on rehearsals and offer advice.
"When I explained this procedure to someone, they said, 'Oh, you're using dramaturges,' " Mr. Richards said. "I said, 'What?' I had to go look it up."
Today, nearly 30 years later, more than 300 dramaturges work at 180 regional theaters in the United States, and many more teach at universities. They are instrumental in adapting classic works for the modern stage and in finding and developing new playwriting talent.
The word is German. It came into being when the playwright G. E. Lessing became an in-house critic at the Hamburg National Theater in 1767 and published "Hamburg Dramaturgy," a series of critical articles on the theater's productions.
In a distinguished line running from Lessing through Bertolt Brecht to Heiner Muller, the dramaturge became a fixture in German theater. As a resident theoretician and artistic conscience, the dramaturge played a major role in shaping repertory and establishing a theater's artistic identity. French theaters, too, made use of dramaturges, and in England, Kenneth Tynan functioned as one at the National Theater.
In the United States, commercial stages did without dramaturges and, for the most part, still do.
"The commenting and reshaping can come from anywhere, and in the past it was always the function of the producer and director," said Evangeline Morphos, the chairwoman of the dramaturgy department at Columbia University. "Think of Tennessee Williams and Elia Kazan. Kazan was right in there, getting Williams to do entire rewrites, like the third act of 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.' "
The rise of the dramaturge in the United States coincides with the explosive growth of nonprofit regional theaters beginning in the late 1960's. Institutions like the Goodman Theater in Chicago and Arena Stage in Washington needed someone who could support the dual mission of presenting classic works and developing new ones. For the classics, a dramaturge advises the artistic director on which works to produce, which texts or translations to use, and how to adapt a work, if necessary, for a modern audience.
When theaters turn to new plays, they need someone to assume a role analogous to that of an acquisitions editor at a publishing house, a professional who can solicit, read and recommend scripts to the artistic director, and then work with new playwrights whose scripts show promise. Some theaters assign the soliciting and reading of scripts to a literary manager. Others combine the two positions.
Dramaturges often go forth and make new projects happen. When Anne Cattaneo, now the dramaturge at Lincoln Center Theater, was at the Acting Company, she selected stories by Chekhov and persuaded playwrights like David Mamet and John Guare to adapt them for the stage.
All over the United States, theaters followed the example of Mr. Richards. At about the same time, Robert Brustein, now the head of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., created a dramaturgy department at the Yale School of Drama.
The job is protean. "I like to think of the dramaturge as a kind of friend, helping the playwright realize the play he or she wants to write," said Carol Rocamora, who teaches theater at New York University. "The dramaturge is an erudite and canny guide, a sounding board and a gadfly."
Dramaturges can be many other things as well. They can do research for the playwright, the director and even the set designer. Kimberly Flynn, for example, provided Tony Kushner with extensive background material on AIDS and Roy Cohn for "Angels in America."
The dramaturge might write program notes, assign reading lists to the cast or lead post-performance discussions with the audience. When Lincoln Center Theater produced "The Heiress," the director, Gerald Gutierrez, wanted to know how much the heroine's inheritance would mean in current dollars. Ms. Cattaneo went to the economics division of the New York Public Library and researched the matter, which found its way into a program note.
"It is the most interesting job in the theater," said Ms. Cattaneo. "It requires no fund-raising, and you can combine knowledge of languages and literature with practical theater work."
The back-and-forth between dramaturge and playwright takes as many forms as the plays themselves. Jack Viertel, the creative director of Jujamcyn Theaters on Broadway, said: "In some cases it's a matter of asking questions or writing letters and notes. Playwrights are sometimes better off if they don't have to defend themselves face to face."
With Lanford Wilson, whom he worked with at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, Mr. Viertel took the epistolary approach. "He told me, 'I throw darts at your letters until I calm down enough to read them and see if there's anything worth reading,' " Mr. Viertel said.
One thing dramaturges do not do is change the playwright's words, as an editor does with a novelist's manuscript in a publishing house. In the theater, playwrights own their material and no changes can be made without their permission.
If the playwright-dramaturge relationship requires tact, the three-way dance that ensues when the director enters the picture demands superpower diplomacy. Normally, the dramaturge attends rehearsal but takes a secondary role, making notes and offering suggestions, but always as an adviser to the director. Some directors loathe the idea of dramaturges, but many rely on them heavily.
"In rehearsal, the director sinks into the sea of subjectivity," said Jon Jory, the producing director of the Actors Theater of Louisville. "The dramaturge tells the director what it is he's seeing."
As time goes on, Mr. Jory said, the director tends to focus on smaller and smaller bits of the production puzzle. "The thematic aspects of the play can empty out of your head like a water pitcher," he said. The dramaturge, ideally, retains the big picture.
Recently, dramaturges have begun to receive heightened recognition, in part through the efforts of the Literary Managers and Dramaturges of the Americas, a 325-member organization created in 1985 to advance the interests of the profession.
At the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the name of the dramaturge is now printed on the front page of the theater's programs, a policy change prompted by the exceptional contributions of Shelby Jiggetts in developing the musical "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," now on Broadway. Tony Kushner has always made a point of giving credit to his dramaturges, and in some cases he has assigned royalty payments to them.
Although many dramaturges see the Thomson case as a chance to clarify their role and rights, some theater professionals worry that a victory for Ms. Thomson in the "Rent" case could throw the fragile, collaborative process of the theater into turmoil and put a chill on the development of new work. Either way, the widespread concern created by the case is testimony to the entrenched role of the dramaturge in nonprofit contemporary American theater.
"We could not conceivably live without them," said Mr. Jory. "It's not an optional process for us. It seems as essential as having lighting designers, sound designers and playwrights."

HEADLINE: ART;
An Elegant Flower In a Modest Garden

BYLINE: By DEBORAH WEISGALL; Deborah Weisgall, who lives in the Boston area, writes frequently about the arts.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
IN THE WINTER, YELLOW JASMINE trees decorate the Venetian courtyard of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, their masses of blooms like golden halos. Just behind that courtyard, the museum's intimate temporary exhibition space has been painted with pilasters and capitals to suggest the measured opulence of 15th-century Florence.
"Botticelli's Witness: Changing Style in a Changing Florence" opened in that gallery 10 days ago and runs through April 6. This small, elegant show of just 12 paintings and engravings that span Botticelli's life, 1445 to 1510, raises a big issue: the effect of politics and faith on an artist's work. It is an issue as urgent today as it was in Florence during the 1490's, when art and religion and politics were fatally intertwined. 
 Equally important, it demonstrates how a small museum with great art can, in effect, leverage that art to produce an exhibition ambitious both in its theme and the quality of its offerings.
 "There is a remarkable concentration of Botticellis in the Boston area, both paintings and lesser-known graphic works," says Hilliard Goldfarb, the Gardner's chief curator of collections. In addition, the authors of the catalogue have Boston connections.
Mr. Goldfarb organized the privately financed exhibition as an inquiry, presenting new research, on Botticelli and Florentine history. The gallery's limited space has become an advantage; viewers (only 15 are allowed in the room at a time) can see at once the continuities and the shifts in Botticelli's style. Those changes were so radical that some of his works have only recently been identified, but why Botticelli's art changed remains a mystery. The show illuminates that mystery; wisely, it does not try to solve it.
Bostonians were among Botticelli's earliest modern fans. He had been considered second-rate until the critic John Ruskin, in 1874, proclaimed him the greatest Florentine painter. Ruskin's protege, the Harvard professor Charles Eliot Norton, brought the cult of Botticelli to America. Encouraged by Norton, Mrs. Gardner acquired a copy of Dante's "Divine Comedy" printed in 1481, with engravings executed from Botticelli's designs. Later she bought three Botticellis, including the exquisite early "Madonna of the Eucharist" and his late masterpiece "The Tragedy of Lucretia," the first important Italian painting in her collection and the first she obtained through Bernard Berenson, who studied with Norton. The Gardner is the logical place for this show, given its holdings, and the fact that according to Mr. Goldfarb, "we could never have allowed both paintings to leave."
Botticelli's career flourished under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, who set out to establish Florence as a New Athens. Botticelli's best-known paintings, like "La Primavera," embody the Neoplatonic belief in the mirroring beauty of body and soul. Laced with literary allusions, they take sensuous delight in reinventing antiquity and blurring the line between sacred and profane.
But according to Vasari, who published the second edition of his influential "Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects" in 1568, Botticelli was also drawn to Savonarola, the Dominican friar who condemned the lust and pagan excess of Lorenzo's court. Lorenzo died in 1492; two years later, Savonarola ruled the city. In his sermons, he envisioned Florence as a New Jerusalem, purged of sin and the Medici's tyranny. His reforming zeal culminated in a bonfire of the vanities, a public burning in 1497 of art, books, musical instruments and sumptuous clothes. Just over a year later, Florentines turned against Savonarola, and he was imprisoned and tortured to confess that his visions had been lies. Condemned as a heretic, he was hanged and his body burned.
Wall texts and labels set up the exhibition as a drama of personalities: Lorenzo, Botticelli, Savonarola. In the catalogue, James Hankins, a professor of history at Harvard, writes that Lorenzo's New Athens and Savonarola's New Jerusalem, while very different, were also strikingly similar: grand plans for cultural and moral renewal through a return to an idealized past. Indeed, Savonarola came to Florence at Lorenzo's invitation.
Vasari claims that under Savonarola's influence Botticelli's art suffered and his output dwindled. But Vasari worked for the Medici, who were once again in power and inimical to Savonarola's movement. Botticelli kept working, but his paintings grew less seductive, sometimes even awkward. At the heart of the exhibition is the question, What happened to Botticelli? Did he lose his powers or transform them?
The Gardner's tender "Madonna of the Eucharist," with its Venus-like Madonna and gorgeous St. John, painted around 1472, hangs near its "Nativity," dating from a decade later and only with this show attributed to Botticelli. For years it was called a studio work because Joseph's rough features and coarse hands were inconsistent with Botticelli's famous delicacy. But at that time he had just finished illustrating Dante's "Inferno." The turbulent engravings show Botticelli learning to tell painful, visual stories directly and economically in 1481, nine years before Savonarola began preaching.
No document links Savonarola with Botticelli, although Botticelli's brother was one of the monk's followers. The badly worn "Mystical Crucifixion," however, painted two years after Savonarola's death, is dense with imagery from his sermons and visions. Devils hurl firebrands, Mary Magdalene embraces the cross, an angel holds an animal (with a slit throat?) by its hind legs; nobody can figure out exactly what is going on. Sarah Kianovsky, an assistant curator at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, says, "We took this painting out of a brand-new installation to lend to the Gardner because it is a very important exhibition."
Laurence Kanter, formerly of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, now curator of the Lehman Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, points out in the catalogue that Savonarola's sympathizers could have commissioned the painting; it does not prove Botticelli's own beliefs. "Botticelli is an artist," Mr. Kanter writes, "who is far better known than understood."
Yet few artists have painted emotions so directly. "The Tragedy of Lucretia," dating from 1501, sets tiny figures before a relentless architecture; Botticelli even incised the lines of columns and walls into the gesso, the layer of chalk priming the panel. There is no way out: Lucretia is raped, and she commits suicide rather than live dishonored; angry, grieving men whose drawn swords stab space surround the bier where Lucretia lies, her face bloated in death.
In "Lucretia," Botticelli no longer conjures a magical tension between air and flesh, observation and invention. The lilting dance of "La Primavera," with its goddesses whose feet don't touch the flowery ground, has squared into a march. Did this harsh change in Botticelli's art come about because of religious beliefs, some private despair or simply life? Was he reacting to new styles (Michelangelo was already working on his "David" in 1501) or trying to satisfy clients? Botticelli might have painted "Lucretia" to celebrate a marriage between two families of anti-Medicean republicans; its visual allegories are disputed.
In "Lucretia," Botticelli confronted a brutal story with clarity and physical immediacy, just as he had painted love. But starting with Vasari, people have wanted only sweetness from Botticelli. He painted "The Mystical Crucifixion" on unprimed canvas; despite its flaked paint, it reveals something of the "Madonna of the Eucharist" in the beautiful faces of the angel and Mary, their sublime disregard for gravity and in the play of their plain robes. It's as if in this small, private drama of penitence, Botticelli had finally redeemed his lyrical gift and reconciled the agonies of faith and the dangers of politics with his own art.
But how can we ever know? "That is the excitement of the continuing debate over Botticelli," says Mr. Goldfarb, the Gardner curator. "Documentary evidence can take you only so far. Then you respond to the work. And what we see essentially reveals our connection with our own world and times."

HEADLINE: Church v. State: Landmark Case

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
WHAT can be done with a house of worship that is treasured by the public but no longer wholly suited to the needs of its congregation? Must it be maintained? For whom? And by whom? Since the beginning of the century, and the early stirrings of the historic preservation movement, Americans have wrestled with the question of where to draw the line when religious freedom and civic responsibility collide.
The core of the debate is whether religious institutions, whose buildings are often among the most beautiful and historic in a community, are as bound by land-use rules as any other property owner or whether, under the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion, they are exempt from regulations that burden their ministries,. 
 As the century ends, a definitive answer may be on the horizon -- a hilly horizon -- in a Texas town called Boerne (BER-nie), 30 miles northwest of San Antonio.
In two weeks, the United States Supreme Court is to hear a case involving St. Peter Roman Catholic Church, a 74-year-old Mission Revival structure in Boerne's historic district that has run out of room for its burgeoning congregation. The church, part of the Archdiocese of San Antonio, applied in 1993 to build an addition but was turned down by Boerne's Landmark Commission and City Council.
Archbishop Patrick F. Flores sued Boerne, asserting among other claims that the denial of a permit violated the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which states, "Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability."
In response, Boerne claimed that the act itself was unconstitutional. A Federal district court agreed with the city but its decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
"If the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is constitutional, then churches have just received a windfall," said Marci A. Hamilton, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University in New York and counsel for the City of Boerne. "It will become extraordinarily difficult for governments to impose their historical preservation laws on religious institutions."
That is why a case involving a Catholic parish 1,600 miles away is being watched by the United Methodist Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, at West End Avenue and 86th Street.
"This could have a big impact on what our options might be," said the pastor, the Rev. Edward C. Horne. His church has struggled since 1981 under a landmark designation it did not want, which prevented it from replacing its deteriorating 100-year-old sanctuary, which it shares with Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, Ethiopian Evangelical Mennonites and Cristo Vivo, a group of Hispanic gay men and lesbians.
The impact may extend beyond landmarks. In a joint brief in support of Boerne, the Municipal Art Society of New York and the San Antonio Conservation Society said the Religious Freedom Restoration Act "may render local communities unable to prevent the destruction of historically important structures and unable to enforce zoning laws against religious organizations."
Vice President Al Gore intimated as much in the ceremony at which the act was signed into law. Speaking of problems it was meant to correct, he said: "Those who want churches close to where they live have seen churches zoned out of residential areas. Those who want the freedom to design their churches have seen local governments dictate the configuration of their building."
Because the very architecture of a church or synagogue or mosque expresses religious belief, the imposition of design controls is "like the government coming in and commenting on what song you're going to sing or what Bible passage you're going to be reading," said Nancie G. Marzulla, president and chief legal counsel of Defenders of Property Rights, a national group based in Washington.
"In effect," she said, "the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is a property-rights statute in this kind of context, when you've got a structure which is itself a religious expression or an exercise of religious belief. Government has no business interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs unless it's protecting safety or health."
But houses of worship also play a critical civic role.
"Religious buildings frequently constitute some of the country's finest architecture," said Jerold S. Kayden, associate professor of urban planning at Harvard University. "Over time, these buildings have become secularized by dint of having become a familiar and reassuring presence. The stakeholders of these religious buildings are not just the parishioners but the citizens. That tug is at the heart of the debate."
The debate -- indeed, the Boerne v. Flores lawsuit itself -- will not end at the Supreme Court. Even if the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is found constitutional, several key questions will remain for lower courts to answer:
* In designating and regulating religious landmarks, does the government "substantially burden" the exercise of religion?
* If so, can the government show -- as it must under the act -- that the burden furthers a "compelling governmental interest" and is the "least restrictive means" of doing so?
The Rev. N. J. L'Heureux Jr., executive director of the Queens Federation of Churches and a longtime opponent of landmark regulation of religious properties, said government could not clear these hurdles.
"Landmarking -- as desirable as it may or may not be -- is not a government purpose of the highest order and on that basis alone, it would fail the test," he said. "Even if it were to be regarded as a highest order of interest, there are a number of less restrictive ways for the government to accomplish its purpose than to require that a church pay out all its money to preserve a building it would rather change or dispose of."
But preservationists believe that landmarking does not amount to a substantial burden in the first place. And they have been going out of their way in recent years to convince congregations of the same thing.
"We really do try to keep a strong, cooperative relationship with the religious community," said Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. "In light of some past tensions, it's important to let them know we're receptive to their concerns."
Since 1987, for example, the commission has included a clergyman among its 11 members. (It is currently the Rev. Thomas F. Pike, rector of the Episcopal parish of Calvary St. George's in Manhattan.)
Also for the last decade, the private New York Landmarks Conservancy has given small grants, made low-interest loans and offered technical asssistance and referrals to eligible houses of worship under its Sacred Sites Program.
The Conservancy was brought in at Ms. Raab's suggestion in the case of the Reformed Dutch Church of Newtown, 85-15 Broadway, at Corona Avenue, in Elmhurst, Queens. The landmark complex includes a 166-year-old Georgian church and a 137-year-old Greek Revival chapel, known as Fellowship Hall, connected by a porch along Broadway.
LIKE St. Peter's in Boerne, the Reformed Church is thriving and needs more room -- specifically, classrooms. It proposed to add a second story to a nondescript 1950's addition behind Fellowship Hall.
The Landmarks Commission denied the application in August 1994. It said the proposed enlargement would disturb the "balance and architectural massing of the historic ensemble"; that the new pyramidal roof "would not harmonize" with the existing gabled roofs and that aluminum siding "would not ameliorate the appearance" of the complex.
Shortly thereafter, Ms. Raab arrived at the commission. "I was very determined to try to help a landmark church that had the uniquely wonderful problem of too many congregants," she said. "This was an exciting challenge, to see if we could help them through the process toward an appropriate addition in the most expeditious, sensible way."
While the overall size of the enlargement did not significantly change, a hipped roof was substituted for the pyramidal roof, gray clapboard siding for aluminum on that part of the new facade visible from Broadway. Meanwhile, the Conservancy helped prepare photo overlays to show that from most vantages, the enlargement would not be conspicuous.
"We went back to the commission and strongly supported their application," said Peg Breen, president of the Conservancy. "With the additional material we were able to present, it helped them change the commission's mind."
More recently the Conservancy made a $25,000 loan and $7,500 grant and provided engineering services valued at $15,000 to the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew. It is being used for a $100,000 stabilization project in which precarious pieces of terra cotta are to be removed or patched and roof tiles are to be replaced to prevent leaking.
The problem remains, however. "Even if you do $100,000 worth of work," Mr. Horne, the pastor, said, "it is by no means a long-term answer. The long-term answer is multimillions of dollars to renovate or rebuild."
Just fixing a leaky roof can be dauntingly expensive when the architectural integrity of a designated structure has to be preserved.
Last winter, wind, ice and snow ripped a large hole in the base of the copper-clad steeple at the 105-year-old St. John's Lutheran Church, 155 Milton Street, in the Greenpoint Historic District in Brooklyn.
Faced with the prospect of restoring the steeple, the first impulse of many in the church was simply to remove it, said the Rev. Daniel L. Anderson, pastor of St. John's and the nearby Church of the Messiah.
That idea was abandoned and now the 50-member congregation faces a repair bill that might run from $70,000 to $300,000, if a scaffold were built. It has applied for a grant from the Landmarks Conservancy.
"We don't view working with landmarks as competition," the pastor explained, "but as something that needs to be done, both esthetically and in terms of the mission of the church. We realize that it's a public building, so it's not just a matter of repairing at the most economical cost but to try to restore it with integrity so it would serve the community.
"In my younger days, from the seminary, I used to preach sermons that it was either bricks or mission, buildings or the gospel," Mr. Anderson said. "But it's not that kind of simple choice, because both are involved. Religion always involves a place, whether it's a storefront or a cathedral."
THE bricks-or-mission dilemma is not new. In 1908, Trinity Parish opened what its own historian, Charles Thorley Bridgeman, called a Pandora's box when it announced the closing of St. John's Chapel on Varick Street, south of Canal Street, implicitly dooming the lovely 100-year-old building to demolition.
Trinity's move was protested by President Theodore Roosevelt, Mayor George B. McClellan, J. Pierpont Morgan and the city's Art Commission, among others.
In a response that sounds as contemporary as the briefs in the Boerne case, the rector of Grace Church defended Trinity as existing "to further the interests of religion and only incidentally to care for ancient monuments of civic interest." He challenged the protesters to purchase St. John's Chapel if they cared to preserve it as a historic memorial.
They did not do so. Nor did any other efforts to save the building succeed after the congregation departed. It stood, little used, until 1918, when it was demolished to accommodate the widening of Varick Street.
Over the next 50 years, numerous religious landmarks were razed, including the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, Madison Avenue and 24th Street; All Souls' Unitarian Church, Park Avenue South and 20th Street; Congregation Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue and 43d Street; St. Agnes Chapel of Trinity Parish, 120 West 92d Street; Temple Beth El, Fifth Avenue and 76th Street and St. Nicholas Collegiate Church, Fifth Avenue and 48th Street.
Preservationists gained a strong hand in 1965 with the creation of the Landmarks Commission. Today, there are 99 individually designated religious landmarks and 78 religious properties within historic districts. (Noting that the "courts have upheld the Landmarks Commission's ability to designate and regulate so far," Ms. Raab said the Boerne case is "certainly something we're watching.")
Perhaps the most famous challenge from a religious institution involved the landmark St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on Park Avenue. In 1984, the church sought permission to tear down its Community House on 50th Street and replace it with an office tower. When the Landmarks Commission denied the application, the church sued the city, citing the First Amendment among other protections.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the city in 1990, relying in part on a case titled Employment Division v. Smith, in which the Supreme Court had recently indicated that religious beliefs did not excuse compliance with generally applicable laws.
In response to the Smith decision, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993. Churches in several cities -- Washington; Berkeley, Calif.; Ypsilanti, Mich., and Cumberland, Md. -- have already brought challenges to local landmarks laws under this act.
St. Peter's Church in Boerne was built in 1923, modeled in part on the 18th-century Mission Concepcion (Nuestra Senora de la Purisima Concepcion de Acuna) in San Antonio. It was designed for 230 worshippers, but the parish has grown so large in recent years that as many as 290 people seek to celebrate the 11 o'clock Mass on Sunday mornings and must do so in a local auditorium.
The church sought permission in 1993 to expand the sanctuary by tearing down the rear of the building while retaining the front facade, with its twin bell towers. But the Landmark Commission said it would not approve any plan that included demolition of the existing structure.
"This case is about a request to tear down a beautiful stone church whose times and memories are graven into the souls of a city," said the brief filed at the Supreme Court for the City of Boerne. "This highly visible church set on a hill speaks directly of the history of this city and its people."
The archdiocese frames the case much differently in its brief: "This case involves the right of a religious community to worship together and the right of excluded individuals to attend the Roman Catholic Mass."
Should the Supreme Court uphold the constitutionality of the 1993 act, the archdiocese still has to convince a lower court that it faces a substantial burden. "But that should be a pretty simple hill to climb," said Thomas Drought, a lawyer for the church. "We can't house our parishioners."
On the other hand, the National Trust for Historic Preservation believes that Boerne has imposed merely an incidental burden, since the denial of a demolition permit neither penalizes church members for their religious conduct nor coerces them to do something their religion forbids.
Mayor Patrick R. Heath of Boerne has grappled with the issue from both sides, as he is also an ordained Methodist minister.
"The church, along with all its facilities, finds itself in the middle of history," he said. "And part of its mission is not to destroy community but to build, along with other institutions, a sense of community, a sense of place, a sense of caring and a sense of responsibility.
"You don't step outside society and claim to judge it and claim to be outside its norms," Mr. Heath concluded. "You stay in society and help build the church on earth and help build the earthly city."

Where Eyesores and the Economy Collide

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
PETER B. DORRAM, dapper in vest and bow tie, tapped his pointer at a chart propped on an easel in Eddie Goldberg's office. The office is a remodeled trailer at Tri-Way Kars, the used-car lot Mr. Goldberg has run for almost 30 years on Route 46 in South Hackensack.
"I wish for you to pay attention," Mr. Dorram, 72, commanded in a clipped Czech accent. Compliance was immediate. Mr. Dorram, a Harvard-educated architect and land-use planner, immigrated here in the early 1950's after serving as a commando in the original Israeli army. He runs a tight ship. 
 There were 12 charts, including more than 100 photographs of local businesses within a 37-acre tract beside the half-mile of Route 46 that runs through South Hackensack. Last year, the town, population 2,200, decreed that the highway area was a civic embarrassment. It commissioned a grand plan to condemn the car lots, motels, bars and small service businesses along the highway, and an adjoining section of land containing offices, warehouses and light industry, to clear the way for something more attractive, like a sprawling retail mall. To begin condemnation, under state law, the area had to be declared blighted and crime-ridden.
This is where Mr. Goldberg and the 33 other business owners affected sprang into action in October, raising $50,000 and forming a group they called BASH -- Businessmen's Association of South Hackensack -- to fight the condemnation. They hired Mr. Dorram to draft an alternative plan to spiff up the area without bulldozing it for a typical suburban asphalt retail prairie.
"Most towns would beg to have all these businesses," Mr. Dorram declared, rapping his pointer on a chart showing photos of well-maintained businesses. One, a formerly ramshackle car wash, just spent $4 million on a very sleek renovation.
"What kind of an idiot would invest $4 million in a depressed area?" he scoffed.
Ugly is in the eye of the beholder. But no one disputes the numbers. The 37-acre tract contains businesses that employ 658 people, many in skilled jobs, with an annual payroll of $18.6 million. Vacancies are near zero.
So what's the problem?
"They say we're ugly," Mr. Goldberg grumbled.
"Rejuvenation is needed," Mr. Dorram agreed. But he and the business owners insist they can do it privately, under a well-designed plan to improve highway esthetics while addressing problems like parking and access on a major roadway used by 69,000 cars a day.
The town's alternative, condemnation, would lead to years of expensive litigation and an ensuing period of deterioration, since banks don't lend money to possibly doomed businesses. "Deterioration would then become a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Mr. Goldberg, who has become an avid student of Mr. Dorram's ideas about improving the character of a highway business district.
You could use the acronym DUH -- Drastically Ugly Highways -- for stretches of road like this part of Route 46 in Bergen County. Other examples include segments of Routes 17 and 22; Route 1 from the Lincoln Tunnel to the Garden State Parkway; Route 130 and Admiral Wilson Boulevard in Camden County. These are the original highways to suburbia, laid down 30 years before anybody heard the name Wal-Mart.
South Hackensack's redevelopment plan argues that the low-rate motels and bars on the highway bring crime and account for a large number of police calls. But the police chief, Joseph E. Brown Jr., said that was true mainly because the motels and bars had pay phones and stayed open at night. Most of the police responses, the Chief said, are to minor incidents, or "service calls" like car breakdowns. Serious crimes are rare, he said.
"I really can't say we have a problem out there," he said. "Other than some of those cars Eddie puts out on his lot."
Mr. Goldberg laughed at the gibe. Chief Brown added that he agreed with the businessmen, who say they can pay for their own solutions, without seeing a major part of a town's economic base bulldozed to make way for low-paying retail businesses.
As to appearances, "we get the message," Mr. Goldberg said later in his tiny office. He looked wistfully out the window, where rows of plastic flags snapped gaudily in the gusts of wind kicked up by the endless traffic. This decor would not comply with the recommendations Mr. Goldberg and his competitors would agree to under Mr. Dorram's plan.
"We'd draft an ordinance," Mr. Dorram said. "No flags. You'll get more business making it attractive."
Mr. Goldberg nodded but said glumly, "Well, I will miss the flags."

HEADLINE: Honoring Cow College Tradition At UConn

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM

 BODY:
TO walk into the auditorium of the Radcliffe Hicks Building in Storrs is to step backward in time. One of the largest classrooms on the main campus of the University of Connecticut looks less like a bastion of academia than a rodeo ring. Several rows of chairs surround an earthen pit some 90 feet in diameter. The floor's sawdust covering is redolent with the odor of the barnyard.
For many UConn students, the auditorium, if seen at all, is seen as a quaint reminder of the university's roots as an agricultural college. Built in 1951 for demonstrations of animal husbandry, the auditorium, like the academic subject it was built for, may seem to belong to another era. After all, in 1951 it was fairly common for a Connecticut resident to have grown up on a farm. These days, it is more common to have grown up without ever seeing one. These days it is also more common for a student to arrive at UConn in search of an engineering, business or liberal arts degree, but the study of agriculture not only remains at Storrs but also flourishes. The dean of UConn's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Kirklyn M. Kerr, says the program is taking some giant strides toward the 21st century, largely because it has to. 
 "The farmer needs every tool to survive," he said. "If you notice, the price of food never goes up. It's cheaper now, if you count inflation, than it was in 1940. The only way you can manage that if you're a farmer is to use the new technology to control costs and inputs. That's the only way agriculture can stay in business."
Farmers in Connecticut still pump more than 9,300 jobs and $844 million into the state economy. There may be only 300 dairy farms left in the state, but they produce more pounds of milk per day than more rural states like New York and Vermont. The amount of farmland in the state has shrunk drastically over the last half century, but farmers can maximize the use of the land they have better than ever before.
Production is not a problem; cost management is. "You go and talk to one of our graduates who was here 10-20 years ago and ask him, 'How was your education?' " Mr. Kerr said. "He'll say he had a wonderful time and learned a lot, but then he'll say, 'If I hadn't gone back and gotten my business training I'd be out of work.' "
Gone are some of the benchmarks of UConn's ag school past: The chicken coops that dotted the pastureland along Route 195, the classes on farm machinery, the creamery where milk was processed for campus use. In their place are courses on pollution control, business management, computers.
"The college is moving away from traditional agriculture and developing areas that are nontraditional," said Derek W. Allinson, a professor of agronomy at UConn. "For example, there's a new major in landscape architecture that has been attracting students on a regular basis."
Horticulture accounts for three-fourths of state agriculture, and it is in that subject area that some of the college's most notable changes continue to take place. Tucked away in the farthest reaches of campus, beyond Horsebarn Hill where an 18th-century farmhouse slowly rots away, are a pair of cramped trailers that constitute the college's Agriculture Biotechnology Facility. In the center, ferns are grown not in pots or garden beds, but in petri dishes and tiny glassine envelopes. More than 500 tiny plants can be fostered in a single bag, says Mark P. Bridgen, an associate professor of plant science at the university who helps run the center.
"The money is moving from farming to social horticulture," Mr. Bridgen said. His laboratory already produces 10,000 ferns a week, which is expected to be up to 35,000 by next June. Other plants grown in bulk include lilacs, rhododendrons and mountain laurel.
Kent Kratz, owner of an Eastford-based plant business, Just for Starters Inc., is working with the university, trading his expertise and technology for the chance to use the university labs as an incubator for his product.
"Connecticut has a lot of potential growers," Mr. Kratz said. "Demand is outstripping production like crazy."
The operation will enjoy a greater public profile in the very near future when it takes up residence in the soon-to-be-constructed Agricultural Biotechnology Laboratory, an 80,000-square-foot building that will represent a $20 million investment in the future of agricultural study at UConn. (It is part of a larger program of campus-wide upgrades and additions known under the umbrella term "UConn 2000.")
Getting financial support from the state and Federal Government was cumbersome enough, yet the final stumbling block for the college turned out to be a piece of its own history, an 85-year-old pale yellow barn that sits alongside Route 195, across from the dormitory quadrangle known as Towers.
The barn, which once housed many key agricultural programs but currently is used mostly for storage, was to have been torn down to make room for the new center, but a public outcry for its preservation forced a retinkering of the laboratory layout. The new laboratory is now slated to be constructed next to the barn, in an existing parking lot.
Dean Kerr accepts these circumstances with perceptible chagrin. "There's nothing historic about the barn," he said, saying the structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places only as part of the Horsebarn Hill vista. "It was built on a low-bid contract. It has nothing special about it. But they wanted to keep it, so here it is." Now he said he faces the costly hurdle of replacing the parking lot.
Mr. Kerr took over the agricultural college in 1993, charged with bringing a fading program up to date. The college, which had 1,596 students as recently as 1976, saw enrollment dip to less than half that by the late 1980's.
"There was a major concern that this college was living in the past, that they were still teaching the same animal courses they were 20 years ago. That there was too much emphasis being placed on things like how to put a halter on a cow. And there was some truth to that."
Established as a land-grant college for the purpose of educating a then-largely agarian region, UConn began in 1881 as the Storrs Agricultural School. It went through several name changes, but it wasn't until 1933 that the school finally dropped the word "agricultural" from its name.
"One could interpret the change in name having actual as well as symbolic importance," said the university archivist Bruce P. Stark. By the 1970's, the College of Agriculture had expanded its purview to include ecological concerns, a change reflected when it altered its name to the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
Louis Pierro, a professor emeritus of animal genetics at the college, said the agricultural emphasis at UConn was in decline "probably as early as the 1940's." But the real slide began when Homer Babbidge became the university's president in 1962.
"In the 1960's and 1970's the college wasn't appreciated as much as it should have been," said Dr. Pierro, who arrived at UConn in 1960. "By most yardsticks, Homer Babbidge was an outstanding president. But his vision did not include a major role for agriculture."
Instead, Mr. Babbidge built up the university's other programs, including its only other college, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. "It's not that the College of Agriculture was degraded, it's just that the other schools were growing," Dr. Allinson said.
Neglect continued to be a program for the agricultural college long after Mr. Babbidge's departure in 1972. Larry Carville, executive director of the Connecticut Nurserymen's Association, recalled serving on the original UConn 2000 panel in the late 1980's with the university's then-president John Casteen.
"We had a hard time convincing Casteen that agriculture is important to the university, that it got its start as a land-grant cow college," Mr. Carville said. "There has been a steady erosion in agriculture at the university over the last five administrations."
There are signs that may be changing. Harry J. Hartley's last official act before stepping down as university president last September was to preside at the groundbreaking ceremony for the laboratory. Whether his successor, Philip E. Austin, builds on that has yet to be seen, but members of his administration say he will.
"Our College of Agriculture and Natural Resources is a critical part of our history, but also a part of our future," said Mark A. Emmert, UConn chancellor and provost of university affairs. He added that UConn was a leader of the Green Revolution, the postwar period that saw giant leaps in farm productivity: "Now we are in a position to lead the next revolution, the biotechnology revolution," he said.
The university's investment in biotechnology goes well beyond ferns. Thomas T. Chen, a professor of cell biology, has been developing a program for talapia, a food fish prized in Asia that he believes can be bred in faster-growing and space-intensive ways, to meet the demands of a growing world population.
Also being developed at the college is the Integrated Pest Management program, which is working to increase the effectiveness of pesticides so that they can be used more sparingly, with less toxic exposure to the surrounding environment.
Such programming is reflected in the courses offered, Dean Kerr said. Ironically, one of the major criticisms about the college he hears from the students is that there is not enough emphasis being placed on more basic elements of agriculture -- like putting a halter on a cow. Fewer than a fifth of UConn's agricultural students were raised on farms, he noted, and he conceded they may have a point.
"Students coming from an urban setting need to be taught some basic skills, or they're going to be kicked in the head," he said. "We try to teach that, but that will be incorporated into a class like beginning animal science."
There are also student groups like the Dairy Club and the Block and Bridle Club that put on livestock shows at the Radcliffe Hicks arena, but Dean Kerr said more needs to be done. One goal of the college is to implement internship programs for all students in agriculture-related activities.
There are other criticisms of the college as well. "One continuing problem is that students come out with good academic records but no real-world expectations" as to what kind of salaries are available, Mr. Carville said. "I fault the professors for that. As a result, we're exporting our graduates to other parts of the country."
One common concern about the professors at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources is the paucity of them. For several years now, the school has had a hiring freeze imposed by the state government. From 1990 to 1996, while the agricultural student body increased from 606 to 842, the number of professors dropped from 100 to 73. Dean Kerr said that figure could dip to 65 by next year.
Making their case to Hartford has proved difficult. Only 2 of the 151 State Representatives are farmers, which is nevertheless 2 more than the number of farmers in the State Senate. At separate times in his administration, Gov. John G. Rowland proposed abolishing the State Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, only to drop those stands after meeting strong resistance.
"It has been difficult," Amy Hanaburgh, director of governmental relations for the Connecticut Farm Bureau Association. "We have to remind people where their roots are. It was nice at the laboratory groundbreaking to see people in the state government addressing the fact UConn was established as an agriculture college. As with agriculture itself, sometimes we have to step back and realize where our food is coming from."

Great-Grandma's House

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THE ghost of Rosanna Zuckerman's great-grandmother is watching. "I hope she'll be happy with the garden," said Mrs. Zuckerman, a handsome, gray-haired widow in her "early 70's" who has embarked on a total renovation of the two bottom floors of her great-grandmother's house at 491 West 22d Street. Ms. Zuckerman, who charmingly related the saga of the old house in Chelsea, lives in another family house two doors down.
The house at No. 491 was built in the 19th century, one of a long row of exquisite brownstones on the north side of the block between Ninth and 10th Avenues. The house is adjacent to the Empire Diner, the Art Deco restaurant on the northeast corner of Ninth Avenue. 
 It was this house that Mrs. Zuckerman's family bought first. "Chelsea was very Old World then," she said. "Clement Moore, who wrote 'The Night Before Christmas,' developed the area and divided streets into different economic levels: houses on 23d Street are bigger and grander; those on 22d Street are smaller.
"My family bought into Clement Moore's design," she continued. "I'm not really sure of the year, the 1880's." Her great-grandmother, Ann Thornley Cox, lived at No. 491; after being widowed, she moved two doors down to live with her children.
Somewhat daringly, the family rented out the house at No. 491. "Other people on the block were aghast," she said. "They said: 'Oh, they're not really renting; how could they?' " The neighborhood went through the ups and downs of the era; at first, the house was rented out to a single family. But during the Depression, it was cut up into single rooms -- with common kitchens in the hallways.
"The poverty of the Depression was a terrible thing," said Mrs. Zuckerman, a clinical social worker. "The rents for the whole house brought in $16. But I remember my mother saying: 'I don't care how much money we take in -- I don't want the vandals in there.' I was just a child."
After the war, Mrs. Zuckerman's husband, Gabriel, helped to care for the house the family had rented out. "He renovated it piecemeal," she said. "He built in kitchens for each of the apartments." Then, when Mrs. Zuckerman's mother died, her husband officially took over management. In the last couple of years, four of the studio apartments at No. 491 became vacant, two on the ground floor and two on the first floor.
"It was now or never," Mrs. Zuckerman said. "We decided to make a duplex." So they started ripping out the partitions, and the kitchens Mr. Zuckerman had carefully put in.
NOW the white space seems gaping, gigantic. Johnathan Cunningham, a local contractor, was chosen; Mrs. Zuckerman was particularly impressed that he had gutted out a house in the neighborhood several years ago. The term "gutted out" makes preservationists shudder, especially when dealing with a 19th-century town house, but Mrs. Zuckerman said the house had lost all its original details decades ago -- a process that was completed in the 1960's, when her husband did some extensive renovations.
The space that was created, designed by Robin Ostler, an architect who is the founding partner of her own firm, EOA, is simple and clean. Downstairs is the kitchen, which leads out to a backyard garden, being recreated with stone pavers and a new lattice wall separating the property from the one next door. There is a bedroom downstairs, with the master bedroom and living room upstairs. The apartment is empty now, but will soon be occupied by a family friend who will stay until late spring, when it will be rented out.
Several months ago, a real estate agent told Mrs. Zuckerman she might get $4,500 a month rent for the two floors. But an attempt to rent the property fell flat -- partly because some families didn't like two bedrooms on different floors, she said. Now, she said, she'll try for $4,000.

Optimism Drives New-Home and Resale Markets

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN Joseph D. Simon, a Garden City lawyer, and his wife, Dana, signed a contract on Dec. 26 to buy a new house in the Villages at Huntington, a Melville development, they did so without making the $340,000 purchase contingent on finding a buyer for their three-bedroom town house in Wantagh.
After living for nine years in an attached house, Mr. Simon said, he and his wife and their two children are ready to move on to a larger house on its own land. And with a closing date nearly a year off, they are not worried about finding a buyer for their present home, he added. 
 The desire to upgrade from an existing house to a new house, coupled with optimism that the resale market has revived, brought many buyers like the Simons into the new-house market last year, and predictions are that strong sales will continue this year.
The total number of residential building permits issued last year in Nassau and Suffolk Counties rose by almost 30 percent over 1995 in the 11-month period ended Nov. 30, the latest month for which figures were available. The number, including multifamily residences, rose to 4,921 from 3,810.
In the resale market, there was a 10 percent increase in completed sales, with 15,689 closings taking place in Nassau and Suffolk over the 11 months ended last Nov. 30, against 14,210 closings in the same period the year before.
"We've been doing very well here, and with the unemployment rate relatively low now, and interest rates low, we have broken out of the doldrums," said Robert A. Weiboldt, the executive director of the Long Island Builders Institute, a trade group.
The Simons, who expect to close around the end of the year on their Melville house, a four-bedroom colonial on a quarter-acre lot, had considered buying an older home.
"But here you get everything new, you get to choose the color and style of the house, and particularly important is that we will be in a community with children our children's age, and with people with similar situations as our own," Mr. Simon said.
The Villages at Huntington, a subdivision of 248 mostly detached houses, is being developed by McGovern-Barbash Associates of Babylon. Prices for the detached houses range from $295,000 to $335,000.
Debora Ruisi and her husband, Joseph, a dentist with a practice in Floral Park, also wanted to purchase something new. They expect to close in July on a five-bedroom traditional colonial being built for them and their three children in a Muttontown development called Ponds Edge. They are moving there from Garden City.
"After living first in a very old house, and then in one that is 20 years old, we decided it was time to buy something new," Mrs. Ruisi said.
Their Muttontown house, which will cost $605,000, will be one of 16 in the development where prices range from $535,000 for a 2,200-square-foot ranch to $650,000 for a 3,800-square-foot colonial. Twelve of the houses have either been sold or have gone into contract since sales began a year ago.
"People want to make a change, and they are making a change because they are able to sell their houses," said Steven A. Klar, the president of the Klar Organization of East Meadow, the developer of the Muttontown project.
The once-listless town-house market has also revived, he added. His town-house project, Willow Wood, in Hauppauge, opened for sales last September and is already half sold, he noted. Prices for the two- and three-bedroom attached and semi-attached one- and two-story houses range from $190,000 to $220,000. The units and grounds will be maintained by a homeowners' association.
"It's not the 80's boom days, but we have a nice, solid flow of people who are buying at a good pace, including an awful lot of seniors," Mr. Klar said.
Thomas Ammentorp and his wife, Christy, both engineers in their early 30's, are first-time buyers. They selected one of the three-story Willow Wood town houses for which they will pay $210,000. "We live in an apartment complex now and we liked the idea that everything would be taken care of," Mr. Ammentorp said.
THEY are now renting a two-bedroom apartment in a Holbrook complex that has a pool and a clubhouse, as does Willow Wood.
"We kind of got used to that, and we felt that buying a detached house would almost be a step down," Mr. Ammentorp said. "I see too many of my friends spending all their weekends working on their homes."
Sales are strong in all price ranges said Charles B. Mancini, vice president of Park Ridge Homes in Ronkonkoma, which has four developments under construction.
At his Park Ridge Estates at Setauket development, where 52 detached houses ranging in size from 2,700 to 3,500 square feet are to be built, six are already in contract although construction hasn't begun, he said. Prices there range from $279,000 to $350,000.
And at his Hunting Hollow Farm development in Dix Hills, where prices range from $500,000 to over $1 million, six houses have gone into contract since the first of the year, Mr. Manicini added.
Brian Farrell, a bank vice president, and his wife, Maureen, already own a house in Setauket. But they are purchasing one of Park Ridge's Setauket houses because with three children, Mr. Farrell said, they need more space. The four-bedroom colonial will cost around $290,000.
They signed a contract Dec. 10 after looking at almost 60 houses over a three-month period. Although they liked many of the older houses, Mr. Farrell said, there was always some compromise they would have had to make. "With a new house, we are getting the layout and everything we wanted," he added.
Builders say they are introducing fresh designs and new ideas to give themselves a competitive edge over resale houses.
"We are not building the repetitive shoeboxes we were five years ago," said Anthony F. Monaco, president of Springbriar Homes, a developer with offices in Kings Park.
Hip roofs, reverse gables, front porches, decorative details, nine-foot ceilings and maintenance-free exteriors are some of the features that differentiate houses now being built from those in the past, he said.
Springbriar will be starting two new projects this year -- one in Selden with 45 houses priced from $179,000 to $230,000, the other in Manorville with 79 houses priced from $160,000 to $250,000.
At Leisure Glen in Ridge, Donald M. Eversoll and Peter D. Klein, partners in Klein & Eversoll in Commack, are building 244 houses in a project called Timber Ridge Homes at Leisure Glen. It is the final phase of a 650-house retirement community started by another builder, Leisure Technology, in 1986.
The partners have redesigned the houses "to bring them from the 80's into the 90's," Mr. Eversoll said.
Instead of being attached, houses will now be detached, occupying quarter- to half-acre lots. They will have nine-foot ceilings, more storage, two-car instead of one-car garages and stone exteriors. Prices for the two-bedroom, 1,400- to 1,700-square-foot homes range from $185,000 to $200,000.
THE preference of buyers is still the detached house said Lennard Axinn, a Jericho developer. But at the same time, people want recreational amenities and maintenance-free living, he said.
So more and more of the new developments are being structured as homeowners' associations in which purchasers can buy a single-family detached house, yet still share recreational facilities.
Mr. Axinn. in partnership with Gerald Friedman and Harvey Gessin of Ronkonkoma, is building 75 houses priced from $299,000 to $399,000 in a Setauket development called Island Estates at the Three Village Club.
The dwellings will share a pool, a gatehouse and other facilities with 89 houses being built on adjoining land by another developer, AVR Realty of Yonkers, under the name Pondfield Estates at the Three Village Club. Those houses will be priced from $289,000 to $340,000.
The Villages at Huntington, where the Simons are purchasing a house, also has recreational amenities, as does Country Pointe in Melville, where Michael Dubb and Leslie Lerner of the Beechwood Organization of New Hyde Park are building 111 detached houses and 82 town house. Prices at Country Pointe range from $204,900 to $294,500.
People feel confident about the economy, so they are buying houses, said Mr. Dubb, who is the past president and now the chairman of the Long Island Builders Institute. At Country Pointe, he noted, 40 contracts were signed in the last two months.

Loews Details Plans for White Plains Movie Palace

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WITH the announcement last month of the decision by Regal Cinemas to drop out of the competition to build this city's first multiplex movie complex, the path is now clear for Loews Theaters to go ahead with its plans to build a mega-movie palace similar in style to its flagship Lincoln Square theater in Manhattan.
Like Lincoln Square, at 68th Street and Broadway, the proposed White Plains theater will "pay homage to the grand movie palaces of the 1920's," said Marc J. Pascucci, a spokesman for Loews, which is owned by the Sony Corporation. 
 The 130,000-square-foot, 20-screen theater will have "stadium seating [each row on its own level] and digital sound," Mr. Pascucci said. "And the interior design will create a sense of excitement the moment you enter the door."
White Plains has been without a movie theater since one closed in the Galleria mall six years ago. For the last year and a half, Regal Cinemas, based in Knoxville, Tenn., had been competing head-to-head with Loews. Each contended that its site would best stimulate downtown business.
The companies' proposals had been on parallel tracks, each with its own set of supporters. Regal's was favored by many downtown merchants since the company planned to build a 15-screen theater on a site bordered by Main and Court Streets and Hamilton Avenue, in the heart of the city's business district.
In partnership with Jon L. Halpern, a local developer who owns most of the site, Regal also proposed development of 30,000 square feet of complementary retail outlets and a community theater.
Apparently everything changed for Regal in October when the city gave Loews the go-ahead to build its theater on an empty parcel of urban renewal land, at Bank Street between Main Street and Martine Avenue. The site is at the western entrance to the downtown, near the Metro-North train station.
On Jan. 17, Mr. Halpern announced Regal's decision to withdraw. "Regal believed that having 35 movie screens within such a short distance of each other did not make good business sense," said Mr. Halpern.
"Nevertheless, following the city's decision last fall to clear the way for the railroad station site to move forward, Regal throughly re-analyzed its own plan." he continued. "Once again, Regal concluded that it simply didn't make economic sense to have two large multiplexes so close to one another; and, thus, it has withdrawn."
THAT Loews has emerged the victor should come, perhaps, as no surprise. From the beginning, the company stated its determination to build its theater regardless of any other company's plans.
Regal seemed equally determined to be this city's only multiplex. "I'm sure Sony will do very well with their site," said Greg Dunn, chief operating officer for Regal. "But we always said that if the city approved both projects, we'd drop out. We've always maintained that the area would only be able to support one large multiplex."
Since Regal's announcement, Sony has wasted no time in moving its plans closer to fruition. Last month, it presented design drawings to the city's Urban Renewal Agency.
The Loews' proposal is scheduled to go before the Common Council tomorrow for final site plan approval. "Ground could be broken as early as next month," said Mayor Sy Schulman. "The theater could be open in part by the end of the year."
To counteract the image of the concrete bunker look so often associated with suburban movie theaters, Loews has designed a structurally graduated facade with architectural flourishes such as lighted finials and ornamental copper cornices. "The drawings show a superior architectural tour de force," said Mayor Schulman. "It casts you back to the movie palaces of the 1920's with the richness and variety of the materials they plan to use.
The exterior will be composed of two kinds of limestone, said David Rockwell of the Rockwellgroup, of Manhattan, which is designing the theater. "At the front, there will be lots of glass, which will serve to spill the theater out onto the street."
The lobby will feature 30-foot ceilings and lighted fluted columns that lead to a rotunda. "In the old movie palaces, there might have been a fountain or sculpture in the center of the theater," Mr. Rockwell explained. "In our building, the concession area will occupy that space. But it will have a sculptural look and feel to it."
Beyond the concession stand will be a "salon," Mr. Rockwell said. "It will be a place to meet a friend, have a snack or relax and watch previews on video monitors."
LOEWS plans to run a public arts competition for mural designs to decorate the north facade of the building, the side facing Main Street. "It's the gateway to the city," Mr. Rockwell said. "We want something special there. The mural designs will be thematically linked." The Westchester Arts Council will coordinate the competition.
Mr. Rockwell has designed other Loews theaters, including one that recently opened in New Brunswick, N.J. "I base my designs on theaters from the golden age of movies," he said. "Those buildings were public celebrations. They had elegance, permanence and timelessness. They represented civic pride. That's what we want for White Plains."
Loews is developing the project jointly with a local development team called Rmap, a partnership of the original designated developer for the site, the Jack Parker Organization of Manhattan, and the Robert Martin Company, of Elmsford.
At one time, the Jack Parker Organization had planned to build a Parker Meridien Hotel on the site now slated for the movie theater. Years later, the plans changed to a 400,000-square-foot office building that was to have been developed in partnership with Robert Martin.
"That was just when the real estate recession hit," said Brad Berger, chief executive officer of Robert Martin. "This is the third time we're back at the drawing board for this site. But this time, it's the perfect use at the perfect time."
In October, the Urban Renewal Agency conveyed the four-acre site to Rmap, which in turn will lease it to Loews, Mr. Berger explained. "Loews will build its theater since that is their expertise," Mr. Berger said. "Rmap will be responsible for everything from the sidewalk out, the entire road infrastructure."
Loews plans to build a 370-car garage under the theater. It will also lease a 254-car commuter lot from the city for use in the evenings and on weekends. And Robert Martin has agreed to let theater patrons use a 1,500-car parking facility at an office building it owns directly across the street.
Mr. Berger expects business to be so good at the new theater that other operators will soon take notice. Without referring specifically to Regal, Mr. Berger said: "It's inappropriate to expect a monopoly. Everywhere Sony operates now, it has competition. And I expect the same will eventually be true of White Plains."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Acquisitions;
Westchester Firm Becoming Part of Jersey REIT

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
FOR 40 years, the company created by Robert Weinberg and Martin Berger was a major factor in the two counties immediately north of New York City, with their Robert Martin Company eventually owning 4.1 million square feet of office, mixed-use and industrial space in Westchester and in Fairfield County, Conn.
The name will continue to exist, but Robert Martin is about to become part of a fast-growing New Jersey-based real estate investment trust, Cali Realty Corporation. The $440 million transaction will mark the demise of yet another family-owned real estate company attracted by the ready access to capital and the favorable tax treatment a REIT provides. 
 The transaction had little effect on the price of Cali stock, but investors have been positive about its prospects for the last year. The shares, which traded at about $21 a share early last year, were at $32.375 late last week.
"We had been looking to find a way to recapitalize the company for 18 months," said Brad W. Berger, the chief executive of Robert Martin and the son of Martin Berger. "We wanted to grow the company and diversify geographically, and after exploring a spectrum of alternatives, both public and private, this seemed to be the logical way to go."
He said that without the REIT structure, the company had been at a disadvantage when trying to make acquisitions. "When were were negotiating to acquire Blue Hill Office Plaza, that's 1.2 million square feet in Pearl River, we had to find a financial partner to get it done," he said. "Now, when we negotiate to buy a property, we won't have to negotiate the financing at the same time."
Cali agreed to acquire 65 properties and the management operations of Robert Martin for $211 million in cash and 1,401,225 operating-partnership units. The units are convertible into shares of Cali stock worth about $44 million. The company also assumed $185 million of Robert Martin debt.
The Robert Martin acquisition by Cali parallels the takeover of Halpern Enterprises by Reckson Associates Realty Corporation of Melville, N.Y., in November 1995. Like Robert Martin, Halpern, also based in Westchester County, survived the real estate downturn caused by the recession and corporate downsizing of the early 1990's, but found itself scrambling to find capital to finance growth.
"The recession was a tough period, but we got through it and found ourselves in a position to make a discretionary decision," said Jon Halpern, who was president of Halpern and is now an executive vice president of Reckson. Some, of course, did not make it. The Shulman Realty Group, which had 3 million square feet of office space in Westchester, lost control and most of its properties were taken over by lenders in 1993.
"It became clear that the best access to capital is public markets," Mr. Halpern said. "So the question became whether you go public yourself or join with someone who is already established. It is clear that Robert Martin made a decision similar to what we did. It just took them longer because they are larger."
AT the time of its acquisition by Reckson, Halpern owned 935,000 square feet of office space in Westchester. In addition to the 4.1 million square feet of owned space Robert Martin brings to Cali, it has 1.9 million square feet it manages and in which it has an equity interest.
The Halpern and Robert Martin transactions are part of a larger trend toward public ownership in the real estate industry, said Milton Cooper, the chairman of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. "Real estate is a huge industry, amounting to trillions of dollars nationwide," he said. "It is one of the few of its size that has a relatively small percentage of public ownership."
Mr. Cooper, who is also chairman of Kimco Realty Company in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said the principal advantage to public ownership "is access to nontemperamental capital; private real estate companies are subject to the manic-depressive swings of lenders."
And as real estate becomes more of a business than a class of assets, he said, working executives want to know that the enterprise is not dependent on the health of the founder and are attracted by corporate perquisites such as stock options, which are not possible in a private company.
There are tax advantages as well. If a family-owned company sells its assets for cash, it could trigger a huge capital gains tax for properties that have been held for a long time. "If an entrepreneurial firm contributes its assets to an operating partnership controlled by a REIT, it triggers no tax," said Roger L. Johnson, national director of real estate practice for the KPMG Peat Marwick accounting firm.
"Those partnership shares can be converted to shares of the REIT, again triggering no tax," he said. "So now you have converted an illiquid investment into a very liquid investment -- shares that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange -- and one whose value is easy to determine. You look up the stock listing in the newspaper."
Thomas A. Rizk, the president and chief executive of Cali, said the acquisition was a quick way to achieve the company's goal of becoming a "super-regional" real estate power, with properties extending from suburban Philadelphia to Stamford, Conn. "We were unrepresented in Westchester and Fairfield," he said. "Robert Martin is the biggest and best company up there, so the acquisition seemed like the best way to accomplish that."
Although corporate mergers usually result in the departure of many senior executives of the company that has been acquired, Mr. Rizk said the Robert Martin structure would be left essentially intact to manage and acquire properties in Westchester, Fairfield and Rockland Counties.
In addition, he said Brad Berger and Timothy M. Jones, Robert Martin's chief operating officer, would become executive vice presidents of Cali, with corporatewide responsibility. "We are a fast-growing company and we think it is important to add senior managers to help with that growth," Mr. Rizk said.
"Tim and I will have companywide responsibility at Cali," Mr. Berger said. "I expect that we will spend a day a week in New Jersey and the other four days in Elmsford," the headquarters of Robert Martin. In addition, Robert Weinberg will have a place on the Cali board of directors along with Brad Berger.
ONCE again this arrangement parallels the Reckson-Halpern deal. Jon Halpern and his organization were left in place to manage property in Westchester and buildings later acquired in Stamford from another troubled family company, F. D. Rich. Now, Mr. Halpern said, he is being asked to play a broader corporate role.
Executives of Cali and Robert Martin say they expect to be compatible because of their similar backgrounds. Both were started by young men who parlayed a small house-building business into a real estate empire. Both have passed active management to a second generation. Although Mr. Rizk is chief executive of Cali, John R. Cali, the son of one of the founders, is director of acquisitions, and Brant Cali, son of another founder, is chief operating officer.
Upon completion of the acquisition of Robert Martin, Cali will own 122 properties with over 11.3 million square feet of space. That is quite a change from its beginnings as a public company in 1994 when it had 13 buildings with 2.2 million square feet of space.
There is no reason the company cannot continue to grow, Mr. Rizk said. Indeed, Cali appears to be a favorite on Wall Street, where the company raised $545 million in cash last year in two secondary stock offerings. The company can use this low-cost capital to make acquisitions or, if circumstances permit, new developments.
"Investors in REIT's are looking for returns in the mid to high teens," said Steven L. Kantor, managing director of the real estate operations group at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The dividend and increases in cash flow get you to 10 or 11 percent, so the rest comes from acquisitions and development. REIT's are very active acquirers and developers."
"We are at heart a development company," Mr. Rizk said. "It has been our history to buy land, get the approvals, build without a general manager, lease and manage." He said rents are currently still too low to justify speculative construction: "They would have to go up 15 to 20 percent, but that is possible in a couple of years."
To prepare for that day, the company has been quietly building up its land bank. "We have enough land to do 5.5 million square feet of development and options on 2.5 million more," he said. He said the company was discussing building projects with specific tenants, a less risky undertaking than a purely speculative project.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
For '96, a Slow, Steady Commercial Market Upturn

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE state's commercial market ran a relatively smooth course of slow but steady improvement last year.
"It was," said David T. Houston, of Colliers Houston & Company, a brokerage concern in Bloomfield, "a year of consistent if unspectacular growth." 
 The forecast is for more of the same, with some brokers, analysts and developers talking about the possibility of a rise in new construction.
The big surprise, almost everyone interviewed agreed, was that AT&T's split into three companies did not result in a flood of space returned to the market.
The low rate of new construction and the relocation and expansion of many companies within the state pushed the office vacancy rate down and rents up in the 11-county northern New Jersey market. Most of the deals were for quality space in well-situated buildings, "which succeeded in burning off most of the available Class A and B opportunities in the market," said Robert J. Rudin, executive director of the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/Edward S. Gordon Company, the national brokerage.
Developers responded to the space squeeze by starting construction on four new buildings in the tightest markets, with key tenants in hand or secured soon after the first steel went up.
Among them is the 207,000-square-foot office building that the Bellemead Development Corporation of Roseland, a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance, is developing in Warren Township on Interstate 78. The building landed one of the year's biggest leases when Hoechst Celanese signed on for all the space.
Meanwhile, tenants were forced into weaker markets with significant vacancies, such as Franklin Township in Somerset County; while the space there has been thinned out, vacancies remain.
In the industrial and retail sectors, stores and distribution space came back onto the market with bankruptcy filings by major retailers, such as Rickles, the hardware chain, and Giant Carpet. Moreover, Procter & Gamble pulled out of 610,000 square feet of space in Dayton and Okonite, a cable manufacturer, left 650,000 square feet of space in North Brunswick.
But demand for space from new tenants and the expansion of existing ones helped keep a lid on vacancy rates, as did the ongoing trend to consolidate scattered distribution centers under one roof. New construction also sprouted to meet specific size requirements or the need for modern space.
Most industry experts expect the market, for the most part, to stay on a similar track in 1997. Among the reasons they cite is that the state's economy will continue to improve and that while some companies will downsize, others will grow.
In the process, 40,000 jobs are expected to be added in 1997, up from 32,000 in 1996, according to Nancy Mantell, director of the Economic Advisory Service at Rutgers University. There is no sign of a recession in 1997, which is expected to be another reasonable growth year, she said.
A DETAILED examination of the commercial market's past year and a look into its near future shows that the office sector was getting bad news through the first quarter. "But since March," said Eric N. Witmondt, president of Associated Realty, a commercial brokerage in Parsippany, "tenants have been fighting for quality space."
AT&T's breakup did not have the harsh impact that was expected. This was because the space the company gave back in some buildings, it or one of its spinoffs took in others, brokers said. Indeed the market closed the year in a better situation than at its outset as firms, following AT&T's space-swapping lead, took more space than they vacated. "It was a record-setting year for absorption of space," said David A. Simson, senior vice president at the Teaneck office of the CB Commercial brokerage.
The vacancy rate in the northern New Jersey office market fell 3 percentage points to 16.4 percent, according to the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield. Most of the demand came from expanding companies, not from new arrivals, which is "a missing element in the market," said Donald P. Eisen, Cushman & Wakefield's senior managing director.
Average asking rents for prime space rose to $23.41 from $22.53, and overall rents crept up to $19.50 from $19.35, his firm reported. Concessions also vanished, indicating that "we are in the middle of a landlords' market," he said.
Among the top space takers were pharmaceutical firms, evidenced by the Hoechst Celanese deal and Bristol-Myers Squibb's lease for 162,871 square feet at 100 Nassau Park Boulevard in West Windsor. (It has since expanded to 195,871 square feet. High technology, communications and financial services are expected to continue to be significant players.
The scarcity of big blocks of space led to build-to-suit deals, and to construction starts on four buildings, each of which has signed on tenants for all or part of their space. The biggest is the 240,000-square-foot building SJP Properties of Parsippany is developing in Bridgewater in the I-78 corridor. In the last month leases were signed for 190,000 square feet, said Peter Eppie, its executive vice president.
The pressure for new construction will continue in 1997 in prime markets, including the Hudson River waterfront, brokers say. Many of them are betting that at least one of four developers who now have all approvals in hand will sign on a major tenant and begin construction in Hoboken or Jersey City this year.
While there will also be more renovations of older buildings, speculative construction will be minimal, brokers said. "Everyone sees the structural imbalance in the market," said Mr. Eisen of Cushman & Wakefield, "but they are not ready to risk their funds."
Added Mr. Houston of Colliers Houston: "Things are going well, but the 80's are not back."
THOUGH the industrial sector's overall supply of available space rose, it was unable to meet the strong demand for modern warehouse and distribution space from tenants seeking to expand or consolidate their operations. That led to a spate of build-to-suit and speculative projects and to an increase in rental rates, said John G. Orrico, senior vice president of the local offices of Grubb & Ellis, the national brokerage.
While the activity was widespread, traditional magnets along the New Jersey Turnpike remain the hot spots. One is the Exit 8A area where Playmobile, a toy manufacturer, will be expanding to an 80,000-square-foot warehouse/office structure being built for it at the Centerpoint business park straddling Monroe and South Brunswick townships.
The other hot spot is Exit 10 in Edison where the Heller Construction Company is building a one million square foot speculative warehouse, distribution and office center, now about half leased.
Edison was also the site of one of the year's larger leases: Exel Logistics, a storage company, took 419,000 square feet at the Raritan Center business park in Edison, reflecting an emerging trend toward farming out goods that a company needs to store.
Mr. Orrico said the market in 1997 would be a repeat of 1996, though with renovations of older buildings increasing.
As for the retail sector, new companies, like Target and Kuhls, the discount department store chains, are entering the state and the ones already in place, such as Home Depot and CompUSA, continue to expand.
Amid all this reshuffling "weaker players are being replaced with newer, stronger ones, helping to stabilize the market," said Ted Kraus, who runs a retail advisory firm in Mercerville.
Supermarket and movie theater chains, which are also in a growth spurt, are helping as well, he said, noting that the retail vacancy rate remains flat at around 5 percent.
While empty stores are evident throughout the market, new construction is taking place, mainly by big-box retailers. For example, a 1.2-million-square-foot factory outlet center is under way in Elizabeth and others are planned in Jackson and Carteret.
Developers are also planning "power centers" -- mainly made up of big boxes -- and shopping strips. Three projects planned in Linden, Watchung and Carlstadt could produce nearly 4 million square feet of space.
But Dr. Mantell of Rutgers cautioned that there would be a continued shakeout in the retail sector.
"There will be some losers," she predicted.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Casting a Wider Net For Web Site Workers

BYLINE: By BARBARA B. BUCHHOLZ 

 BODY:
COMPANIES are still struggling to find ways to profit from the Internet, but many people who set up and run corporate Web sites are not having the same problem.
As the number of sites on the World Wide Web has tripled, to 300,000, since last year, the demand for people to manage corporate sites has far outstripped the supply. Companies have been recruiting computer-savvy workers right out of college and, in some cases, high school. Some positions come with salaries higher than those of comparable positions in other computer fields. 
 The Software Publishers Association says a computer graphics artist makes an average salary of $36,400 and a programmer $42,600, but a recent survey by Buck Consultants, an employee benefits and compensation consulting firm in New York, found that the same Web-related positions were paying $46,600 and $46,200, respectively.
 Salaries are continuing to rise as more companies scramble to open Web sites. And what better place to find qualified workers than at the Web sites and graphics departments of other companies?
Brian Paris was a graphics designer at an insurance brokerage firm when the Web came knocking. He now manages the Web site at Maxwell Architects in Nashville; the new job has increased his salary 20 percent, to more than $40,000.
Graphical Business Systems, an Elmhurst, Ill., company that develops Web sites, lost two of its eight programmers in December. One began his own Internet company; the other moved to an executive recruiting firm to manage its site for more than $60,000 a year, a 30 percent increase from his previous salary. Recently, another programmer, Craig Huber, changed his mind about leaving after the company said it would give him a percentage of his billings. That could raise his salary 40 percent, to more than $60,000.
"You're constantly recruiting," said John Kilcullen, business development manager at Graphical Business Systems. "You find people with the right skills, call them back and they're gone."
Fruit of the Loom, the clothing company, hired 15 people for its Web site in 1995 and lost two of them to other companies within two months. "Retaining them has been difficult," said Glenn Banfield, director of electronic commerce at the company.
The Weather Channel in Atlanta had trouble finding more Web workers last year when it expanded its site. After unsuccessfully looking for 30 people with the right skills, it hired people with various backgrounds and then trained them. The jobs have salaries from $25,000 for Web customer service representatives to $100,000 for the new manager of Web operations.
A director of on-line business typically has 10 to 15 years of corporate experience and has come up through a company's marketing or information services department, while a Web programmer may have no corporate experience, but will be fluent in several programming languages, said Paul Gavejian, a principal at Buck Consultants.
Most in demand are workers with extensive advertising or direct-mail experience, said Bob Chatham, senior analyst at Forrester Research, a computer industry consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "What you need to make a Web site successful is to get customers there and keep them there," Mr. Chatham said. "That requires workers with hybrid skills."
When Greg Siskind, the author of "The Lawyer's Guide to Marketing on the Internet" (American Bar Association, 1996, $64.95), founded an immigration law firm in Nashville two years ago, he wanted to set up a one-page Web site. But he did the work himself. "There was no consulting industry to tap," he said. As the site grew, he hired two lawyers who also had Web skills to design and manage the site.
"We were seeking two things: lawyers knowledgeable about immigration law and attorneys who were Internet-savvy and could help with all the traffic on our Web site," he said. "We were willing to make them partners right away to reward and keep them."
Freelancers can profit, too. Brent Brotine, 47, left a Chicago advertising agency three years ago to start his own communications firm. He writes the content for the Web sites of several banks, insurance companies and mutual funds. Although he would not disclose his income, he said it had increased about 50 percent since he left the ad agency.
HOW long can the boom last? At least five years, said Josh Bernoff, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. "The industry is where television was in 1952: in its infancy," he said.
Others are more skeptical, saying companies may begin to abandon Web sites if they don't lead to an increase in revenue. "It's the Gold Rush of the 90's," said Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant in New York, "but don't be shocked if it doesn't work out."

HEADLINE: Opposite Views On Cross-Island Bridge

 BODY:
Congratulations to John Waldman. Resurgence in interest in a Long Island Sound crossing is long overdue.
It is high time a bridge or tunnel be constructed to access any area outside Long Island. Obvious reasons would include (1) the simple convenience of reaching a destination perhaps 20 miles away as the crow flies in 20 minutes instead of two hours, and (2) the cost saving of either gasoline/car wear and tear (driving around the horseshoe) or expensive ferry charges. 
 Furthermore, as eastern Long Island continues to be built up, it is obligatory to concomitantly build up all roadways and accesses. Access off Long Island across the sound may greatly diminish the parking lot atmosphere of major east-west highways for which Long Island is famous, or rather, infamous.
Mr. Waldman's opinion (on potential and likely political opposition) that "there are times when the common good should prevail over the preferences of the few" is extremely well-taken and right on the money. However, the same political forces that continue to build up Long Island (e.g., the tremendous build-up on Nesconset "Highway") and thus the population and traffic, must accommodate the population in return with easy traffic flow. It is also surprising that when political forces shut down the Shoreham nuclear plant due to lack of access off Long Island that a sound bridge or tunnel was never considered. For that matter, there should be access off Long Island in case of any emergency (e.g., weather or other natural disaster).
I also firmly believe that a span across the sound would have the great potential of boosting Long Island's economy. If a tunnel can connect such major entities as England and France, certainly a span can connect two local, closer places such as Connecticut and Long Island.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
Deflating an Inflation Worry

BYLINE: By NORBERT WALTER; Norbert Walter is the chief economist of Deutsche Bank.

 BODY:
IN testimony before Congress two weeks ago, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, discussed his worries about the danger of wage inflation. Specifically, Mr. Greenspan is concerned that shortages of qualified people for job openings may lead to excessive wage offers to fill those jobs. Some people take this uneasiness to suggest that a rise in interest rates may be in the offing -- if not at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting starting on Tuesday, then sometime later this year.
While German economists like myself are supposedly born with a penchant to worry themselves sick about even the slightest signs of inflation, I cannot quite share Mr. Greenspan's concerns. From my perspective, the most important dimension in evaluating future wage pressures in the United States is regularly overlooked: the increased global outsourcing of services like data processing and computer programming. Computers let American companies tap into a labor pool without national borders -- thus shattering old-school assumptions about tightness in domestic labor markets. If the labor market becomes tight at home, a company can look abroad. 
 In this sense, the United States is again the trailblazer. In the 1970's, big American manufacturers scoured the world to find cheap sources of offshore labor to control production costs. Undoubtedly, the decision to move production abroad not only helped American companies' bottom lines, it was also a crucial factor in keeping the nation's inflation rate in check. Other nations, like Germany and Japan, jumped on the bandwagon only much later.
United States companies are now repeating this process in the services sector. The global services labor pool, after all, is just a phone call or an E-mail message away. Accordingly, credit card providers, insurance firms, phone companies and technology service concerns are placing crucial business functions all over the world. Even important value-added skills, like software design, are being moved offshore.
This ability to tap into the global labor pool without headaches may well be a special advantage for American corporations. Because English is the second, if not first, language of many people, American companies can readily depend on service providers who speak the same language as headquarters does. Compare that with the problems of, say, a German or Japanese insurance company trying to start a billing department in Barbados or Sri Lanka.
While the effect of global telecommunications and computer networks is increasingly understood, little thought has been given to what it means for the labor-shortage debate in the United States -- specifically, whether inflationary pressures will result.
If the United States economy is supposed to grow faster, signs of inflation from a tight labor market would not be welcome because they would probably lead to higher interest rates. Economists typically refer at this point to a concept called Nairu -- the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or the lowest level of unemployment the economy can sustain without setting off inflationary pressures. But we have seen little to no inflation even though the American unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent -- generally seen now as the point at which the labor market supposedly becomes tight enough to become inflationary. Basically, policy makers and analysts have tried to cope with their failure to capture the correlation between unemployment and inflation by lowering the Nairu.
In my view, though, the issue ought to be cast in somewhat starker terms. I wonder whether, instead of fidgeting with numbers, it would not be more appropriate to assume that the Nairu concept may have been destroyed by the creation of global labor pools -- like the one in India generated by Jawaharlal Nehru himself, who, as India's first Prime Minister and a determined modernizer of Indian society, created a work force that is solving many of America's Nairu-related worries from afar.
Such skill pools around the world demonstrate the limitations of any economic model, like Nairu, that does not look beyond national borders. After all, for Nairu to remain a meaningful economic concept, the labor pool must be rather clearly defined on a national, or at least regional, basis. The globalization of services throws this requirement overboard. As a result, it is hard to draw reliable conclusions about slight pickups in wage levels in regions of the United States.
Labor supply is much more elastic today than in the past -- and not only because of old-fashioned (and much debated) immigration. These new forms of "labor sharing" provide great flexibility. This not only benefits American companies in their focus on the bottom line, but it also helps the American economy as a whole -- with its overblown inflation worries. And it helps other parts of the world to link into a better division of labor.

New Budget: A Primer For Investors

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN he lays out his vision for the nation during his State of the Union Message on Tuesday, President Clinton will no doubt speak in sweeping terms of the country's problems and his solutions. But when he sends his budget to Congress two days later, he will include detailed proposals that could affect investors in many ways.
The President's budget is nothing more than his opening negotiating position with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill. And many of Mr. Clinton's proposals will be similar, if not identical, to those included in his previous budgets but rejected or ignored by Congress. But they will help frame the policy debate, and with both sides pledging bipartisanship, the proposals are being taken seriously in Congress. 
 Here are some of the investment-related proposals Mr. Clinton is expected to proffer in some form.
 
AVERAGE-COST ACCOUNTING Mr. Clinton will again propose that investors be prevented from reducing capital gains taxes on the sale of securities by claiming to have sold the shares that had cost the most within a holding in any particular company or mutual fund. An investor would not be able to use that "specific identification" method, but would have to use the average cost of all the shares. Last year, the Administration said the change would raise $4.1 billion in taxes over six years.
Because it is effectively a tax increase, Republicans said they would oppose it again this year.
 
SHORTING AGAINST THE BOX The Administration will again seek to bar this practice, sometimes used by investors to get around capital gains taxes. The technique involves borrowing an equal number of shares in a stock that an investor already owns, and then selling the borrowed shares while holding on to the original investment. The investor can lock in gains on the original stock, but does not have to pay any tax until the positions are closed out -- and does not have to pay the capital gains tax at all if the short position is left open until the owner dies.
The Administration's proposal got little Republican support last year. But with both parties under pressure to reach agreement on a balanced budget this year, it could get another hearing.
 
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS Mr. Clinton is expected to renew his call for an expanded I.R.A. program that would allow more people to make tax-deductible contributions and would permit penalty-free withdrawals at any time to pay for higher education, first-time home purchases, medical care or living expenses while unemployed. He has also proposed a second type of I.R.A. that would not allow tax-deductible contributions, but would permit tax-free withdrawals of earnings after five years.
There is much support in Congress for expanding I.R.A.'s. Proposals similar to Mr. Clinton's are being pushed by Senators William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, and John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. The problem with any I.R.A. plan, however, is the cost. The Administration said last year that its plan would reduce revenue by $7.7 billion over six years.
 
CAPITAL GAINS Mr. Clinton will make a proposal to reduce capital gains taxes by permitting married homeowners to exclude from taxation as much as $500,000 in profits from the sale of a primary residence (for single filers, the exclusion would be $250,000), and to take the exclusion as often as every two years. Under current law, there is a one-time exclusion of as much as $125,000 for people over age 55.
Republicans want a far more sweeping reduction in capital gains taxes, including a steep reduction in the top rate, now 28 percent. Even some Democrats are pushing for a broader cut than the President is proposing. Mr. Clinton has signaled a willingness to negotiate.
 
EDUCATION Mr. Clinton has a variety of proposals that might affect investors' planning for college. He wants to allow annual tax deductions of as much as $10,000 a family for college tuition or job-training programs, subject to income limits. He has also proposed a $1,500-a-year tax credit, limited to two years, for students who maintain a B average in community college. Families would have to choose between the tax credit and the deduction.

A Low-Key Fund Group Nears a Limelight Level

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
COMING off one of its best years ever, the mutual fund industry is approaching yet another milestone, this one in a nook of the business that has attracted far less attention than stock funds and their persistent waves of cash.
Total assets in money market funds, now at $933 billion, are expected to top $1 trillion within a few weeks. The $1 trillion mark itself has little significance beyond its ability to satisfy humans' fascination with a figure that ends in a string of zeros. But the money market fund, often thought of as the runt of the mutual fund litter, is probably more responsible for the industry's success than either its stock or bond siblings. 
 "Money market funds were the launching pad for the whole mutual fund business," said Bruce R. Bent, president of the Reserve Fund, introduced in October 1971 and the first money market mutual fund. "They sensitized investors to the fact that they could do something with their money other than put it in a bank account."
Indeed, the growth of money market funds has been spectacular. While mutual funds that invest in stocks took at least 55 years -- from the Investment Company Act of 1940 until 1995 -- to reach $1 trillion in assets, money market funds will do it in less than half that time.
Stock fund assets, which totaled $1.75 trillion at the end of 1996, still are much bigger than those in money market funds. But late last year, for the first time since 1991, the amount of assets in money funds surpassed the amount in bond funds. Just over one dollar of every four in mutual funds was in a money market fund at the end of the year.
Also last year, and again for the first time, American households had more of their financial assets in money market funds than in checking accounts. While savings accounts and bank time deposits still exceed household investments in money market funds by five to one, savings assets have been relatively flat for five years. Money funds, meanwhile, have grown.
They probably will continue to do so, and for several reasons, industry analysts say. Short-term interest rates have remained stubbornly high, "well above the psychologically important level of 5 percent," said Peter Crane, managing editor of IBC Money Fund Report, a newsletter.
The level is significant, Mr. Crane said, because "it makes investors feel like they're earning something substantial, and it leaves too small of a spread between the yields on bonds and money market funds to attract many people to bonds."
"Investors don't like money funds when they yield 4.7 percent," he added, "but they love them when it's 5."
Many investors have not forgotten the pain inflicted on their bond fund investments in 1994, when the Federal Reserve Board began a series of interest rate increases that sent the value of bond funds tumbling down. And with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, apparently intent on nipping in the bud any resurgence of inflation, it appears unlikely that short-term rates, and, therefore, money fund yields, will fall sharply anytime soon.
Money market mutual funds differ from money market accounts at banks, of course, in that money funds are not federally insured. That has not hindered their growth, thanks to a couple of key marketing innovations within the mutual fund industry.
One was to obtain a ruling from the Securities and Exchange Commission that allowed money market funds to maintain a stable net asset value of $1 a share. While each money fund emphasizes in its documents that the $1 share value is not guaranteed, fund companies have vigilantly guarded that provision. In 1994, when rising rates took a bite out of some investments in complex financial instruments known as derivatives, several fund companies bought back these tumbling investments from their money market funds to keep their shares from falling below $1 each.
ANOTHER innovation, instituted in 1974 by Edward C. Johnson 3d, the chairman of Fidelity Investments, was to allow check writing on money market funds. Today, money funds offer a host of other conveniences, too, like the use of a debit card or credit card to deduct payments automatically from a fund account.
Customers were slow to respond in the early days of money market funds, uncertain of the promises of easy access to their money. "In 1973, we had one investor who kept moving $10,000 in and out of the fund every few days for three or four months," recalled Mr. Bent, of the Reserve Fund. "He was driving me crazy, and I was close to telling him to take his business elsewhere. But then, suddenly, he put a couple of million dollars into the fund. He said he didn't believe that the system could work the way we said it would, so he was just testing it."
When money market funds were introduced, banks were restricted from paying more than 5.25 percent a year on federally guaranteed savings accounts. That restriction was removed in late 1982, and banks immediately began to offer insured money market accounts that paid as much as 11 percent. So great was the demand for the insured accounts that the assets in money market funds shrank by more than a third.
Banks then reduced their rates. Not since April 1983 have banks offered a higher rate on insured accounts than that available on money funds, Mr. Bent said.
Money market funds have also been used by investors as a holding pen for money going into stock and bond funds, or as a haven in market upheavals.
Investors have aggressively pursued the highest possible returns in money market funds. But because the funds can invest in only certain types of securities under Federal regulations, about the only way a fund company can raise a yield is by achieving economies of scale and by lowering the operating expenses. Fund companies often waive a portion of the fees or expenses on a fund, especially a new one, to attract a critical mass of money.
THE role of expense waivers is nowhere more apparent than at the Strong Funds of Milwaukee. For most of the latter half of 1994, assets in the Strong Money Market fund crept upward, reaching $481 million at the end of November, from $433 million at the beginning of May.
Then, in December, Strong agreed to waive all fees and expenses on the fund, sharply raising its yield. Assets nearly doubled in two months, topping $2.4 billion in less than a year.
In August 1995, Strong slowly began adding back the operating expenses to its money market fund and assets immediately began to dip. But many of the departing assets went directly to another Strong money fund, the Heritage Money Market fund, which was introduced in June 1995 and which charged no fees or expenses in its first six months.
Assets in the Heritage fund continued to grow even after it charged investors for fund expenses and even though its minimum investment remained high, at $25,000. The main reason is that Heritage's charges were kept low, in part because the fund was big and transactions were minimal. In addition, the Heritage fund charges a fee for most transactions, including checks.
The low expenses gave the Heritage fund the highest yield of all money market funds for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, at 5.7 percent, according to the IBC Money Fund Report of Ashland, Mass. Assets in the Heritage fund, which last week totaled $1.946 billion, are close to surpassing those in the Strong Money Market fund, which had $1.949 billion.
Besides Strong Heritage, the retail funds with the highest yields for last year were the Olde Premium Plus fund, at 5.67 percent; the Frank Russell Money Market fund, 5.61 percent; the AIM Short-Term Investments fund, 5.50, and the E-Fund, 5.47 percent.
Each of the top five funds waived some or all of its management fees and expenses to achieve its yield -- a factor that investors should consider carefully. In most cases, funds can reinstate fees at any time.
Investors should also distinguish between yield and total return. The E-fund offers a debit card refund that contributed nearly half of a percentage point to its total return of 5.96 percent for the year, or above that of Strong's top-yielding money fund.
In response, the S.E.C. is considering a new rule that would restrict money funds to advertising their 12-month yield, not their total return.
Despite its top-yielding fund, Strong is not in the top ranks of money fund companies. Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch, the leaders, together control 20 percent of the assets in money market funds. Among the 10 biggest companies in money market funds, only one is associated with a traditional banking company -- Dreyfus, a unit of the Mellon Bank, which ranks as the fourth-largest money fund provider.

The Education of a Health Care Customer

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
DARRIN JACKSON-WEEKS got his Medicaid card two years ago. He had been an H.I.V. counselor, a member of a private health plan. Suddenly he was an H.I.V. client on public assistance. As smart, informed and assertive as he still was, he felt the difference right away. He had been walked around the desk. He was looked upon as a poor person now. What could he possibly know?
"Not enough people are listening to the people who use health services," he said. "It's life and death for us. We put doctors and the system on a pedestal. But we have to ask them questions and we have to get answers so we can make choices. We have to have a voice." 
 To coach those voices into full throat, the Community Service Society of New York has been sending Mr. Jackson-Weeks and 15 other volunteers around the city to give classes to people on Medicaid. There is a new urgency to their need to know and be heard. The state is seeking permission from the Federal Government to require Medicaid recipients to select and join a health maintenance organization by the end of this year. There are 1.9 million Medicaid patients in this city, mostly children.
Last month, based on its survey of 421 Medicaid recipients in Harlem and the South Bronx, the society issued a study concluding that their transition to managed care would be difficult. They had not been educated to be medical customers, the society said, and would be at a severe disadvantage when faced with what the report called "aggressive, and often misleading, marketing by H.M.O.'s."
Ultimately, a poorly run system will not only worsen an individual's health, the society says, but will cost the city more money.
Last week, Mr. Jackson-Weeks, a lively 36-year-old with a forceful presentation, and Alice Simmons, an elegant 61-year-old with a theatrical voice, led 22 students of the Literacy Volunteers' Begin program in lower Manhattan into a preview of their new health care world. The students, many of them single mothers, are on welfare. They are preparing for jobs as home health aides, clerks and maintenance workers. Some are already in health plans that accept Medicaid. Most are used to a system in which they can go to any doctor who accepts Medicaid. They make their own appointments with specialists, which would no longer be allowed under the proposed changes, and they often use emergency rooms for primary care, which would no longer be reimbursed. In managed care, they were told, "everything changes." There would be advantages and disadvantages.
"You will have to become your own advocate," Mr. Jackson-Weeks said. "H.M.O.'s are about cutting down cost. They make money by keeping you from seeing the doctor. If things go wrong, you will have to speak up or they will do whatever they want and you will get lost in the system."
Mrs. Simmons, smiling, stepped up. "I deal with how to complain when things go wrong, which is the reality of this world," she said. "When you call the H.M.O., you must always get the name of the person you are speaking with. Keep a paper trail, time and day and what they said to you. It never hurts to ask for a supervisor."
One student, Reba Rush, 26, talked about her toddler's scalp infection. Four years later, he still has it, she said, because no one would listen to her early account.
"When they see that Medicaid card," Ms. Rush said, "they have this type of attitude, like we are dirty and don't know about ourselves. You shouldn't ask questions; you're supposed to just take what they give because you're poor."
"You are not poor!" boomed Mrs. Simmons, a retired bank worker who was once on Medicaid. "I don't allow that. Say to yourself, 'I am just in a situation where I need some help from a system that was set up for my benefit.' Accident, unemployment, it could happen to anyone." Community Services has a number, (212) 614-5400, to answer questions about managed care (don't always expect a live voice at the other end) and a readable booklet with excellent suggestions on how to navigate the new system.
The switch to mandatory managed care is of particular concern to patients with so-called special needs. Mr. Jackson-Weeks, 11 years H.I.V.-positive, says his survival would cost $20,000 a year on the open market. He feels comfortable with his doctors and nurses at the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. He's worried about his future, even more worried, he says, about patients less sophisticated than he.
"We should also be giving workshops to the gatekeepers, to the doctors," Mr. Jackson-Weeks said. "There's a lot of doctors from other countries dealing with Medicaid recipients. There's a culture clash. There's a lack of sensitivity. I face it all the time. But as long as I can give these workshops, I haven't lost my voice."

Meet Some Buyers of the New Inflation Bonds

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
SALLY HEINEMANN has been going to Treasury auctions for nearly two decades. She remembers those inflationary days, in the early 1980's, when the prime rate hovered near 21 percent and people flocked to the Federal Reserve Bank near Wall Street to snap up bonds paying 15 percent interest.
So why was she pacing the halls of the Fed last Wednesday at a time that inflation is barely eclipsing 3 percent? 
 She was buying the new inflation-indexed bonds, those 10-year investments that regularly adjust both interest and principal to changes in the Consumer Price Index, all on top of a real interest rate of 3.375 percent.
Wednesday was the first day the Treasury sold the bonds, at the Federal Reserve Bank in Manhattan and at other Fed banks across the country. And Ms. Heinemann, a newspaper editor in her 50's who lives in Great Neck, L.I., wanted to buy some for herself and for her daughter.
"This is a hedge," Ms. Heinemann said, standing in the Fed's colossal stone foyer, just a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange, where somewhat riskier investments are traded. "I think interest rates are going up," she said. "And if inflation goes up, I won't be one of them who says, 'Why didn't I buy those things?' "
But Ms. Heinemann couldn't understand why there were so few like-minded people in line. "Today, it's dead," she said, squinting through her glasses at the handful of ordinary citizens who had also trekked to the bank. "This is the smallest auction I've ever seen."
The sparseness of the crowd might have been because of the January cold, the newness of the bond or even the chance that the Labor Department might revise the price index to measure inflation more conservatively. But the scene was misleading; over all, the bond received a warm reception in its debut. In fact, investors demanded $37 billion of the bonds, more than five times as much as the $7 billion offered.
Most of those investors were institutions, however, not individuals like those who had lined up at the Fed. And opinions differed on the size of individual interest in the bonds.
While Peter Hollenbach, a Treasury spokesman, said the interest was "great for a new security," two mutual fund companies that have started new funds based on the bonds gave more modest reports. Dreyfushad just a handful of inquiries. And at American Century, James A. Benham, a spokesman, noted the popularity of the auction among institutions but added, "Whether or not that spills over to retail folks, we'll just have to wait and see."
As with other Treasuries, the new bonds will be auctioned quarterly, with the next offering in April. Individuals can buy the bonds through a broker, a bank or directly from the Fed bank in their region. In the New York area, call Treasury Direct at (212) 720-6619. Tender forms can be ordered through the World Wide Web: www.publicdebt.treas.gov.
At the New York Fed on Wednesday, Fred Bernstein was also surprised at the small turnout. "I thought there'd be crowds," said Mr. Bernstein, a 40-year-old lawyer from Los Angeles, who was in New York for a job interview.
Earlier, when he was having breakfast at his downtown hotel, he came across a newspaper article about the sale of the securities and decided to buy a few.
"I asked the concierge, 'Where is 33 Liberty Street?' And he said, 'It's right there,' " Mr. Bernstein recalled. So he walked over.
"Some of my bank C.D.'s matured recently, and like a lot of people, I sat around wondering what to do," Mr. Bernstein explained. "None of the options seemed good. I had bank C.D.'s at 6, 7, 8 percent, and it hurt too much to even think about reinvesting the money at 3 percent. So I let a lot of money pile up in my checking account."
Since he has read only one article about the new bonds, much of Mr. Bernstein's decision to buy them rested on simple trust in the Treasury.
"As far as the Federal Reserve goes, you just stand in this building, and you know it's solid," he said. "I have a philosophy about investing: I don't invest in anything I don't understand, and that rules out just about everything."
Some of the buyers said they had bought the new bonds out of curiosity, a sort of test drive of the Government's latest security. Others talked of the thrill of being first. But even more, the buyers seemed to like the bonds for the same reason that investors have traditionally been drawn to Treasuries: safety. Indeed, with their safety net against high inflation, the new bonds are an even safer way to secure a nest egg.
"With Treasuries, you can sleep at night," Ms. Heinemann said. "You won't get rich, but you can sleep."
Safety was also on the mind of Lawrence Hayes, who bought $15,000 of the inflation bonds. "This is for my daughter's college education," he said, holding the hand of 5-year-old Lanay as his wife, Darlene, looked on. "We're not a wealthy family, so it's important for us to preserve the principal."
Mr. Hayes, 37, an electrician from Washingtonville, N.Y., is an active investor who bought the bonds both to combat inflation and to diversify a portfolio containing an equity mutual fund, savings bonds and other investments. He did his homework on the new bonds. He knew that because the inflation adjustment would be taxed each year, the bonds might work best in a tax-deferred account like a 401(k) plan.
Nor was he the only avid student of these new investments. Ms. Heinemann even called an analyst at J. P. Morgan to quibble over a paragraph in an analysis of the security.
But uncertainty was also common. Edward Holtzmann, a lawyer in New York, bought one bond out of "curiosity." He said that just as he was completing the transaction, he heard that there might be a sales charge. He said he usually buys his Treasury bonds at the Fed just to avoid such fees at banks.
In fact, the Federal Reserve does not charge a fee.
"I don't think many people understand how it works," Ms. Heinemann said of this new security.

HEADLINE: Next Front: Animals That Aren't So Cute

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN 

 BODY:
BIG brown eyes, furry coats, playful quirks. Most animals hunted and ranched for their fur have another thing going for them: they're cute. Judging by the species of animals that have won sympathy points with the public and those that have not -- lizards, alligators, cows and pigs -- Darwin's treatise might need an update, like survival of the furriest.
"In general," said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York, "people tend to get outraged about the animals that are warm and fuzzy rather than about those which are less so, like snakes." 
 The fur debate reared its head afresh this winter with the release of Disney's "101 Dalmatians," with its plot to turn cute little puppies into outerwear, along with reports that fur sales were showing signs of life after a decade-long decline. But the issue has overshadowed the fact that a vogue for animal skins -- high-quality leather, shearling and exotic animal skins -- has blossomed.
Since 1988, when Patrick Cox began using python for his stylish shoes, others have followed suit, some with python-print leather but many with the real thing. And now, even python jackets and pants are being sold at Mr. Cox's Madison Avenue boutique.
Last month, at Alexander McQueen's first couture show for Givenchy, he showed full-length coats rendered in snakeskin. Prada, Richard Tyler and Marc Jacobs have begun to make shoes, handbags, belts and jackets in various reptile skins as well. And Gucci, Chanel, Fendi and Saks Fifth Avenue have all been fined over the last decade for illegal trade in crocodile hides.
Animal-rights advocates, having invested heavily in antifur awareness, are now in a tangled web about how to confront an issue with considerably less sex appeal.
"The exotic wildlife trade issue is a bomb ready to go off," said Priscilla Feral, the president of the Friends of Animals, an international group. "There's a tremendous number of animals smuggled into the United States and killed to satisfy that trade. The fur issue is really only the tip of the iceberg."
Dan Mathews, the director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, a group known for its theatrical protests, also calls exotic skins a priority.
While the fur industry suffered a recession in part caused by the swaying of public opinion over ethical concerns -- an antifur feeling that some think has abated -- the reptile leather industry has only boomed.
The alligator-hide business more than quadrupled between 1987 and 1995, according the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, yielding more than 200,000 hides in 1995, an impressive number for an animal that was on the endangered species list less than 20 years ago.
Some 150,000 whole skins of reticulated pythons alone, which are caught in the wild in Asia, have been brought legally into the United States for each of the last 10 years, said Craig Hoover at Traffic, the trade monitoring arm of the World Wildlife Foundation.
From a conservation standpoint, trade in reptile skins is a much more serious problem than fur ranching, Mr. Hoover said. Since reptiles are difficult to monitor, conservationists are concerned about the potential for endangerment.
"From the humane standpoint, you can compare the two," Mr. Hoover said, "but I don't think you're going to see anyone throwing red paint on a pair of python shoes."
Mr. Mathews said that raising awareness of reptile farming and hunting for skins was becoming increasingly important to the organization. He said that Twiggy Lawson, the actress, former model and a PETA member, recently wrote to designers asking them to stop using exotic skins, describing how some snakes are skinned alive.
"It is going to be more difficult," Mr. Mathews said. "Alligators may not be the most cuddly animals, but when people find out how they're farmed and horribly mutilated, they'll find it offensive."
But the reptile agenda remains secondary to fur, Mr. Mathews said. The same goes for leather. He says he does not wear it and members are encouraged not to, but the group, he said, is more involved in promoting vegetarianism. "As long as there are meat eaters, there will be leather," he said. "And it only goes to reason that when people stop eating the insides, they'll stop wearing the outsides."
For retailers, the long list of potential offenses and the high demand for luxury products has meant that the only rule is no rule.
"We don't sell minks and sables because we don't think a big sweeping fur coat is modern," Mr. Doonan of Barneys said. "As a retailer, it's such a nuanced and tempestuous issue that we've really had to approach it from a style standpoint only." Hot items at the store for spring, he said, are python bags from Prada and suede dresses from Marni.
As a result of such attitudes, others would like to see the bigger picture examined further. Ms. Feral said the sharp focus on fur might be counterproductive to raising awareness of other animal issues like meat consumption and leather. "This movement has not made that as burning an issue as fur, and yet animal agriculture ought to be," she said. "If you're talking about sheer numbers of animals consumed, it's in the billions, whereas with fur, it's in the millions. And with pollution, what happens to the water and the land, factory farming is wreaking havoc on the environment.
"Really, the only ethical way to go is for people to forgo meat and animal products entirely. And that should be an issue that people begin to tune in to. Some have, but fur has taken a front seat, perhaps."
The designer Todd Oldham does not use fur or exotic animal skins, but does use leather occasionally for shoes. "It's a tough issue," he said. "There's no cut-and-dry way to look at it. I view it as recycling, because it is a byproduct. I do realize that all of this is justification, but it's very hard to find materials for shoes that work on the human skin as well as leather does."
Another designer, Cynthia Rowley, says she refuses to design or work with fur, but does use leather and shearling (sheep's skin with the wool attached) and would have no problem working with snakeskin. "I hate to say it, but if it's an animal that's soft and cuddly, people are more offended, so that's the whole funny thing about it."
Ms. Rowley says she walks a fine line between being sensitive to and oblivious of animal-rights concerns, which might be how many consumers feel.
"If I'm going to worry about something, there's a lot more important things than whether the whole world eats meat and wears leather," she said. "It's important to have a responsibility, but it's so complex that everyone has to draw the line where they want."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
How to Overpay For a Muni Fund

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
If you had $100 to invest, and could buy a diversified portfolio of municipal bonds worth $93, or one worth $112, which would you choose?
The market, it appears, values them equally. Or at least the market in closed-end New York muni-bond funds. 
 This is significant now because municipal bonds are starting to look awfully attractive as an investment, and closed-end funds can be a good way to invest in them, particularly if the fund in question is reasonably well-run and has low expenses.
But not all funds trade at fair prices. Too often, investors in such funds look only at yield. And that can be misleading.
Consider the Nuveen New York Investment Quality Municipal fund. As a fund, there is nothing wrong with it. Its annual expenses, less than 1 percent of assets, are reasonable. Its bonds are insured, so the chances of its being hurt by a default are practically zero. And you get a tax-free yield of around 6 percent.
Or consider one of its competitors, the Muni Yield N.Y. Insured Fund II, which is run by Merrill Lynch. Its expenses are a bit lower, but otherwise the story is the same.
Closed-end muni-bond funds, for those not acquainted with the breed, are similar to open-end mutual funds, but with two key differences. The first is that the closed-end variety can, in effect, borrow money by issuing preferred stock. As long as short-term muni-bond rates remain lower than long-term rates, that leaves more money for the common shareholders, and therefore higher yields. Both funds have done that.
The other difference is that closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange, for whatever investors are willing to pay. That may be more -- or less -- than the bonds in the fund are worth.
And that brings us to the important difference between these two funds. One, the Nuveen fund, is trading at 111 percent of what the bonds in the portfolio are worth. The other, the Merrill fund, is trading at 91.8 percent of its value. (A list of such premiums and discounts is on page 18.)
Why? Some of it may reflect Nuveen's excellent job of getting its story out to brokers. But mostly, it is a matter of yield. A look at the portfolio of the Nuveen fund shows it is full of bonds with high coupons that trade well above par value. The high yield comes from bonds that are sure to decline in price, simply because they will eventually be repaid at par value.
The Merrill fund, on the other hand, has more bonds that are trading around par. Its yield is lower, but its bonds are less likely to lose value.
There is nothing wrong with either strategy. Depending on the course of interest rates, one or the other might do a bit better in terms of total return. Buying high-coupon bonds that are sure to see their value drop is a way of maximizing current income, and for some investors it is appropriate. But investors need to understand that some of the yield from the Nuveen fund is really a return of capital. There is no good reason why the Nuveen fund should trade at such a premium to the one from Merrill.
Many investors could not care less about such things. It's more exciting to buy stocks and watch them soar. But with the Dow Jones industrial average in a manic-depressive move that can see it add or lose 100 points in an hour, there is a lot to be said for taking some profits and settling for 6 percent, tax free.
If that course appeals to you, consider closed-end muni funds. But don't pay too much when you buy.

HEADLINE: Traders Want Some Space, Too

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
THE battle for Wall Street's desktops has always been fierce. Now the jostling among the major competitors has become so intense that it is hard to tell who's winning. The short answer: no one.
Michael R. Bloomberg, the brash former stock trader who started Bloomberg L.P. in 1981 and turned it into the industry's hottest financial-data company, seems on top of the world. People familiar with Mr. Bloomberg said that 18 months ago, he even approached Dow Jones & Company, the venerable publisher of The Wall Street Journal, about a merger. 
 Although the board of Dow Jones rebuffed Mr. Bloomberg's overture, the company's executives may regret not having a provocateur like him around. Dow Jones has been struggling to fix its own financial data service, Dow Jones Telerate, which is technologically inferior and has been steadily losing market share to both Bloomberg and Reuters.
But if Mr. Bloomberg and his squat, desktop machines are the toast of many on Wall Street, he has had his share of setbacks, too. Executives at Merrill Lynch & Company, which reduced its 30 percent stake in Bloomberg L.P. to 20 percent in December, said he was passed over recently when the bank decided to install 25,000 new terminals for its army of retail brokers. Instead of giving Bloomberg the juicy contract, Merrill Lynch is developing its own network of linked personal computers. But the firm's executives stressed that the sale of a third of its equity stake was no reflection on Mr. Bloomberg.
Even Reuters Holdings P.L.C., the doyenne of the financial information market, has taken its lumps. The 146-year-old British company virtually invented this business and it still has more than twice as many customers as Telerate and nearly five times more than Bloomberg. But it has been struggling to sell its new flagship terminal, the Reuters 3000, because it has proved difficult for traders, bankers and analysts to integrate the new product with their existing data services.
The problem for all these companies is that the ground is shifting beneath them. After years of robust growth fueled by one of the greatest bull markets in history, the $6.5 billion financial information business has reached a crossroads. The emergence of the Internet as a vast information pipeline is calling into question the future of companies that feed data to desktop boxes over closed, proprietary networks.
"The whole on-line phenomenon has changed this business dramatically," said Michael J. Wolf, the partner in charge of the media and communications practice at Booz Allen & Hamilton, the management consultants. "In the long run, people won't want to have more than one box on their desk."
Those little boxes have been handsome money-makers. The companies charge anywhere from $200 a month for a bare-bones data feed to $1,140 a month for a fully equipped Bloomberg machine. And with multiyear contracts, these services are almost like annuities for the providers.
But what has historically been a battle by the makers of boxes to gain real estate in trading rooms and brokerage firms is now becoming a race to develop an array of information services -- stock quotes, analytical tools, news reports and the like -- that are flexible enough to be delivered to a customer's PC in any number of combinations.
"You get the feeling that the Internet is leaving Bloomberg behind, just like Bloomberg left Quotron behind," said John L. Sabre, a managing director at IndoSuez Capital, referring to the ill-fated stock-quote machine that Citicorp sold off to Reuters in 1994 at a huge loss. Mr. Sabre still gets real-time financial information at work, but now he gets it over a PC that runs Windows software rather than from one of the Big Three.
Reuters, Telerate and Bloomberg are all grappling with the changes in the industry, but Telerate has felt the sting most deeply. The Dow Jones financial information services division, which consists of Telerate and the Dow Jones News Service, reported a 21 percent decline in its 1996 operating income, to $156 million, on revenues of $980 million.
Edward J. Atorino, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, estimated that Telerate's operating margins dropped from 20.5 percent in 1995 to 15.9 percent in 1996, and would fall to almost zero in 1997. By contrast, he said, Reuters routinely rolls up margins of more than 20 percent.
Telerate's historic strength has been its real-time price data on government bonds. Through its exclusive arrangement with Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading bond brokerage firm, Telerate is still viewed as the place to go for information on Treasury bills. But several analysts said Telerate was becoming outmoded in other, faster-growing areas, like transactions.
Reuters, for example, allows customers to trade stocks and make foreign currency exchanges from their keyboards.
And Telerate also never developed the sophisticated analytical software of Bloomberg, which enables users to create their own complex financial models.
Part of this is simply a matter of inadequate financial support by Dow Jones. Reuters spent roughly $300 million on research and development in 1995, while Telerate spent only about $33 million. Mr. Bloomberg says his company spends some $250 million annually on research and development.
Still, when Dow Jones announced on Jan. 20 that it would spend $650 million over three years to retool Telerate, its shares went into a stomach-churning swoon and still have not fully recovered. Some shareholders believe that Telerate has fallen so far behind that Dow Jones would be better off to cut its losses and exit the business.
Among that group are three outspoken money managers -- Michael F. Price of Franklin Mutual Fund Advisors and James J. Cramer of Cramer Berkowitz & Company -- who recently amassed stakes in Dow Jones when the price plunged. Both are clamoring for the company not to pour more money into Telerate. "If you can't get me to use Telerate -- and I'm a machine junkie -- you're not going to get anybody else," said Mr. Cramer, whose hedge fund bought 1.1 million shares of Dow Jones earlier this year. Instead, he uses four other smaller suppliers.
Another money manager, Daniel Shuchman of Gotham Partners, noted that in a Dow Jones Government filing in 1989, the company projected that Telerate would generate $544 million in operating cash flow by 1995. In fact, he said, analysts estimate that the unit generated only $187 million that year. "It really gives you a lot of pause to lightly endorse spending another $650 million on the business," Mr. Shuchman said.
EXECUTIVES at Dow Jones say Telerate is not a lost cause. Kenneth L. Burenga, the president of Dow Jones, said the company would benefit from the underlying growth of the financial information industry, which he estimated at 7 percent a year. Mr. Burenga, who was asked by Peter R. Kann, the chairman of Dow Jones, to take direct control of Telerate six months ago, also said his $650 million rescue plan would put Telerate back on even footing with Bloomberg and Reuters. "When things start to happen, perhaps some of these critics will re-evaluate their positions," he said.
Mr. Burenga has a two-pronged plan. First, he intends to gather the historical data that have made Bloomberg so popular among traders and money managers. Then, he wants to replace Telerate's existing technology -- which transmits pages of data to the screens of Telerate work stations -- with an Internet-based system that will send information over a private network to customers' PC's.
In essence, Mr. Burenga wants to leapfrog over Bloomberg and Reuters by creating a system that boasts all the features of the other services, but also has an entirely open technology that would allow customers to receive Telerate's news and data, no matter what terminals they used.
To do that, Mr. Burenga is trying to engineer a radical change in the company culture. Instead of merely shuttling senior editorial executives from The Wall Street Journal to oversee the unit, Mr. Burenga is recruiting outside Dow Jones for top marketing and technology executives.
"I don't want to assign blame here," said Mr. Burenga, "The business wasn't perfect when we bought it. We had to do some work on it, and we chose the best people at the time to do that work."
Now Mr. Burenga says he is seeking people with expertise in the financial services industry to "create something that has the best resources from Dow Jones, the best resources from Telerate, and the best resources from outside."
It is an extraordinarily lofty goal, according to analysts and rival executives. In this industry, said Peter Job, the chief executive of Reuters, "$650 million doesn't go very far."
Reuters, for example, spent $100 million over three years just to collect a vast warehouse of historical data to compete with Bloomberg. That effort, called Project Armstrong after the astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, ended last year. And Reuters poured the data into the Reuters 3000, which was intended to capture the Bloomberg market.
Yet despite its grand scale, the project has not helped the sales of the Reuters 3000, according to Andrew P. Delaney, the senior vice president of Waters Information Services, a market research firm that tracks the financial data business. The 3000, which was introduced in June, is supposed to be added to existing Reuters 2000 terminals as a software upgrade. But Mr. Delaney said the graft was proving technologically difficult.
MR. JOB said Reuters sold about 9,000 units and installed 1,000 in the first six months of its availability. But Mr. Delaney noted that the 9,000 represented only a very small portion of Reuters subscribers.
Like Telerate, Reuters is known for its commanding position in one corner of the financial world: in its case, the foreign currency market. Analysts estimate that Reuters has more than 60 percent of the market for supplying real-time currency price data.
But the currency markets are vulnerable to a slowdown, particularly in Europe, where the adoption of common European currency could wipe out 8 percent of the volume of currency trading there. As a result, Mr. Job is rushing to spread the company's bets -- investing heavily to build up Reuters in the equity and fixed-income markets.
In its current issue, Business Week reported that there were rumors that Reuters had even approached Dow Jones's controlling shareholders about a potential merger. Reuters declined to comment, while a Dow Jones spokesman described the report as "nonsense."
Reuters has also been aggressive in turning its global network into a trading market. The company's Instinet service, which handles stock trades electronically, is its fastest-growing service, with revenue jumping 51 percent, to $262 million, in the first six months of 1996. Although Instinet has been around for years, Mr. Delaney said it recently achieved a critical mass of users seeking to trade electronically, which has accelerated its growth.
Despite such successes, Mr. Job acknowledged that Reuters still had to make its services more open. "Our goal is to get onto a client's network, allow him to plug his own data into our information and then link him to a source where he can do a transaction," he said. "We still have a ways to go."
Perhaps no one has further to go toward the goal of open technology than Michael Bloomberg. Until very recently, his company had the most closed system of the three leading providers. Although Mr. Bloomberg introduced a version of his service last year that runs on Unix- and Windows-based computer networks, analysts said the Open Bloomberg still required users to install proprietary technology from Bloomberg.
So far, Bloomberg's exclusivity has not stunted its growth. The number of installed Bloomberg machines grew 61 percent from 1993 to 1995, compared with 45 percent for Reuters and 8 percent for Telerate. Mr. Bloomberg said he had about 70,000 customers paying $1,140 a month for his boxes, which would give him annual revenue of nearly $1 billion. Mr. Bloomberg would not provide cash-flow or profit figures, but several analysts said the company was probably in the black -- though not as profitable as Reuters.
Wall Street traders said that Bloomberg's superior data and analytical tools compensated for the fact that most users receive Bloomberg's data on its distinctive, boxy machine. Until now, Mr. Bloomberg has used assiduous customer service and relentless marketing to turn his proprietary technology into an advantage. Having a Bloomberg on your desk has become almost a totem on Wall Street -- like owning a desktop BMW.
"I don't rank high enough, nor do I trade enough bonds, to have my own Bloomberg," said Bill Dailey, an equity sales trader at Montgomery Securities in Boston. He wishes it were otherwise. In addition to its financial data, Bloomberg offers frequently updated sports scores, Mr. Dailey said. Bloomberg even allows users to order shirts from Brooks Brothers over the network.
Mr. Bloomberg waves away questions about open-versus-closed technology. He said the Internet was not yet secure enough or fast enough to handle electronic trading. And many clients still prefer Bloomberg's proprietary system for complex financial calculations, he said.
Still, there are signs that Mr. Bloomberg cannot afford to turn his back on the Internet forever. Merrill Lynch is just one of several firms that are building their own networks by stringing together PC's in private networks and buying their data from outside suppliers. That arrangement is far cheaper than leasing 25,000 boxes from Bloomberg, even though Merrill -- as part- owner -- would effectively be getting a discount.
As one senior Merrill banker put it, "Why do our brokers need a Rolls-Royce when they can use a Chevy?"
At the Mariner Investment Group, the traders now use their own PC's equipped with two Microsoft operating programs, Windows NT and Microsoft Excel. Mariner, a small New York hedge fund, buys its pricing data from an outside supplier, S.& P. Comstock, which delivers the numbers directly to the PC screens.
Mariner still leases two Bloomberg boxes for the few complex financial models it cannot build on its other machines. But it has junked its Telerate terminals. As the Internet-based systems become more sophisticated, even the Bloombergs could become superfluous. "I'm not trying to slam Bloomberg, but the Internet technology is just so much cheaper," said Brandon Goyette, a trader at the firm.
Mr. Bloomberg says he has been listening to these gloom-and-doom outlooks for years, but Bloomberg just keeps on growing. He acknowledged that if the market crashed, the sales of his machines would fall, too. But he said his rich data and analytical services made him less vulnerable than other financial information providers to a slowdown.
If Bloomberg is hitting a wall in its growth, the ebullient founder is not letting on. Last month, he bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch's 30 percent stake in the company for $200 million. At that price, he and Merrill are valuing the private company at $2 billion.
Executives at Merrill Lynch said the firm simply felt it was time to cash out part of its investment. Based on its original investment of $30 million in 1983, Merrill has already earned back nearly six times its money, and still owns 20 percent of a valuable property.
Taking Bloomberg public would further enhance that return, since analysts said the company would receive a far richer multiple as a public company. But Mr. Bloomberg has steadfastly refused to do so.
"The only difference if we were public is that when the Forbes 400 came out, I would be worth $10 billion instead of $1 billion," he said dismissively.
Mr. Bloomberg's meteoric success is changing his life in other ways, though, raising questions about whether he is keeping his eye on the business.
He recently donated $55 million to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, where he is also chairman of the board. And he jetted off to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last Thursday, where he was scheduled to appear on a panel with Andrew S. Grove, the chief executive of Intel.
Despite his leeriness about the Internet, Mr. Bloomberg recognizes he cannot completely buck the on-line tide. Before leaving for Davos, he showed off his laptop computer, which was programmed to receive news and data from Bloomberg directly via the Internet.
Has this apostle of closed systems finally gotten religion? Not really. The Internet service is available only as an adjunct to the regular service. To get it, you still have to lease one of Bloomberg's familiar boxes.

HEADLINE: Republicans in Transition;
Corporate Welfare's New Enemies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REPRESENTATIVE JOHN R. KASICH, one of the standard-bearers in the Republican war on the welfare state, tells a story about an encounter he had recently with a business executive in Texas.
The man complained that doing business in Poland might no longer be profitable if Mr. Kasich succeeded in scrapping a Government program that subsidizes companies investing overseas. 
 Mr. Kasich says he replied: "I remember during the welfare debate when people stood up and said that if we passed these welfare programs, two million children would end up in poverty. You were one of the people who said, 'It's worth the gamble to change welfare.' "
The man nodded. Mr. Kasich continued: "How can you expect me to tell you that I don't want to risk the fact that you may not get a loan that helps your business in Poland?"

 
 
The Democrats' Issue
 Mr. Kasich, an Ohioan who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and an acolyte of Speaker Newt Gingrich, is in the vanguard of a band of Republican politicians who want to cast off the idea that the G.O.P. is primarily the party of business and to wrest from Democrats the issue of corporate welfare. Republicans should attack unwarranted Government subsidies with equal zeal, Mr. Kasich is fond of saying, whether the handouts go to people or companies.
President Clinton will doubtless make a similar point this week when he sends his budget to Congress. But Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kasich address the matter from different angles.
The President's budget proposes the elimination of several tax breaks enjoyed mostly by big corporations and investors but leaves intact most of the spending that subsidizes companies. Mr. Kasich skirts the question of tax subsidies for business and concentrates on what the Government spends and lends.
Meanwhile, two of the most prominent partisans in the Senate -- John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts -- took an intermediate approach last week. They proposed the creation of a commission to study all aspects of corporate subsidies and recommend what should be changed.
The politicians' interest is not mysterious. After Republicans took control of Congress two years ago, Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, field-tested many words and phrases to assess their political appeal.
"Corporate welfare," he reported, was third on the list of "things the public flips out on," right after "foreign aid" and "waste, fraud and abuse."
The problem is, there is almost no agreement on exactly what constitutes corporate welfare.
A series of articles in The Boston Globe last summer found programs totaling $150 billion a year. The Cato Institute, a libertarian research center, recently identified $87 billion worth.
A study in 1995 by the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the Government spends $28 billion a year promoting commerce and business and another $2.2 billion in loan subsidies. The budget office also counted more than 60 tax breaks for specific businesses, 14 of them costing the Treasury annually more than $1 billion apiece.
As a point of comparison, cuts in entitlement programs for the poor, like Medicaid and welfare, total about $60 billion from 1996 to 2002, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Eliminating the tax breaks that Mr. Clinton lists in the budget would raise about $40 billion over five years.
Mr. Kasich put together a coalition that spans the political spectrum, from Ralph Nader to ardent conservationists to conservative political strategists.
They called a news conference last week to identify a dozen programs that they all agreed could be abolished at a saving to the Government of $11.5 billion over five years.
 
Kerneals of Truth
"Every member of Congress wants to cut corporate welfare," said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute. But then he added ruefully, "It always turns out to be someone else's pork they want to cut."
That point was never more apparent than it was at the Senate Commerce Committee last week. Sam Brownback of Kansas was the only Senator who voted against the confirmation of William M. Daley as Secretary of Commerce.
Mr. Brownback, a Republican, said he did so because Mr. Daley had not sufficiently identified the corporate welfare he would flush from the Department.
But the Senator quickly noted that one program that should not be considered corporate welfare was the Government's subsidy of ethanol as a motor fuel, a program dear to the heart of the farmers who grow corn in Kansas.
The epitome of the scourge of corporate welfare -- the equivalent, say, of the Cadillac-driving, vodka-swilling welfare queen that Ronald Reagan used to talk about -- is probably the Agriculture Department's Market Access Program.
At a cost of about $100 million a year, this program gives cash to companies to advertise exports of food and beverages. Taxpayers have financed ads for, among others, Miller beer, Campbell's soup, Gallo wine, McDonald's burgers and Mars candy.
After a fight in Congress a couple of years ago to abolish the foreign marketing program, its appropriation was actually increased by 24 percent.
Among the lobbies that fight hard to retain the program is the Wine Institute, the trade association of California wineries. Exports of California wine, according to the Institute, have increased in the last 10 years to $300 billion a year from $25 billion.
 
Welfare or Equity
The growth, said John De Luca, president of the Institute, resulted largely from the few million dollars a year that California wine companies receive from the Government for promotion. Those funds, he said, allow the California companies to compete in a market where European countries spend $2 billion a year promoting their wines.
"Corporate welfare," Mr. De Luca said the other day, "should be renamed competitive equity."
Willard Workman, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, had a more punchy put-down. "One man's corporate welfare," he said, "is another man's paycheck."
Even disinterested people can have trouble identifying whether Government subsidies amount to corporate welfare. Few, for example, would curtail biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, even though pharmaceutical companies benefit handsomely.
Subsidies to airlines that maintain unprofitable air service to small towns obviously help the companies, but the benefit to the communities those airlines serve can hardly be discounted.
"Some of the programs may ring hollow on re-examination," said Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, "but each piece was designed to achieve some public objective."
Still, as a political matter, Representative Kasich, Senator McCain and the other Republicans who talk about corporate welfare have obviously struck a clear chord. In their view, a party that is so grounded in Wall Street and in the Chamber of Commerce is too limited.
John J. Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont-McKenna College in California and an expert on the recent history of the Republican Party, put the case this way: "If the Republicans are going to be the opponent of big government, they've got to oppose it even when the beneficiaries are affluent. There is nothing more important to the Republican Party than to shed the image of being the party of the wealthy."

HEADLINE: Algeria Is Burning;
A Chance to Try to End an Agony

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
JANUARY was the cruelest month in Algeria. Cruel in its violence, including a car-bombing that killed 42 people in central Algiers; cruel in the cynicism of the assassination of Abdelhak Benhamouda, an influential union leader who had wanted to forge a new political party. And cruel, above all, for the promise of yet more killing that was contained in a ranting speech by the President in which he blamed foreign plots for all of Algeria's woes and vowed to "eradicate" the terrorists.
The Algerian civil war, which pits a ruthless military-backed government against often barbaric Islamic guerrillas, is five years old. It has become part of the background noise of world affairs, rumbling on like Kurdish clashes but rarely registering on the world's consciousness -- that is, its television screens. 
 The conflict began when an election that was on the verge of bringing political Islam to power was canceled by the military in January 1992; it has rendered Algerian democracy -- and hopes that a stable political center could form -- stillborn.
Hocine Ait Ahmed, an opposition leader, recently spoke of a "Berlin wall" around the war, evoking how the Algerian dreams of the 1980's have died amid general indifference.
That wall has been composed of many elements: the secrecy of Algeria's rulers, known simply as "le Pouvoir" or "the Power"; the intractability of a murky conflict; Western diplomatic inertia in a country where the choices appear particularly delicate, and the fact that Algeria's oil and natural gas have kept flowing to American and European companies.
But as the recent violence suggests, the Algerian problem is festering to the point where it may prove harder to ignore. Its threat, just south of France, is clear: spreading Islamic militancy, a spillover of terrorism, a flood of refugees and the disruption of large oil and natural-gas supplies (into which American investment pours).
 
 
 
A Hint of Opportunity
 But if this is a moment of crisis it may also be a moment when the West, whose options seem otherwise limited, could put some pressure on Algeria's leaders to restore a hope of democracy.
Within the next few months, the country is due to hold its first parliamentary elections since the cancellation of the 1992 poll that nearly brought the Islamic Salvation Front to power. The party had brandished slogans like "Islam is the solution" to protest the corruption and economic mismanagement of Algeria's military-dominated regime. When the election was canceled, the party split into armed factions pursuing insurrection and a more moderate wing.
How -- and indeed whether -- the new elections are held will test Algeria's direction and the West's readiness to encourage a democratic solution there. Breaking a long, and increasingly eerie, silence, French politicians of the left and right last week called for France to act.
Lionel Jospin, the Socialist leader, said France could no longer provide "blind support" to President Liamine Zeroual's Government. And Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a former President, said the Islamic Salvation Front, now banned, should be allowed to participate in the election.
The United States has maintained a determinedly low profile on Algeria since the war began. But tension between America and France over Algeria has been easing. French feelings that the Clinton Administration had been too conciliatory toward the Islamic Salvation Front have changed since the arrest late last year of Anwar Haddam, a prominent party member, in America.
So a joint French-American initiative is technically possible, combining French economic leverage over Mr. Zeroual (France grants more than $1 billion annually to Algeria in subsidized loans) with the Clinton Administration's greater access to the Islamic Salvation Front.
Opening the way for meaningful elections might entail a call on Mr. Zeroual to approach all parties, including the Islamic Salvation Front, in order to hammer out certain principles: the rejection of violence, respect for human rights, the elimination of torture, a commitment to the alternation of power through universal suffrage, a free press and respect for Algeria's Arab and Berber culture. the European Union's aid, debt relief, World Bank loans and the like, could all be used as carrots and sticks.
But huge difficulties remain, all of them illustrated by the events of the last month. Mr. Zeroual's speech on Jan. 24 -- in which he raged against "criminals, traitors and mercenaries manipulated by external circles" -- was a textbook study in the closed mentality of Algeria's rulers. The very notion of open dialogue is generally foreign to them. In the speech, Mr. Zeroual ominously neglected to set a date for the new elections.
The murder last week of Abdelhak Benhamouda was equally ominous. A prominent 55-year-old union leader and a determined opponent of Islamic fundamentalism, Mr. Benhamouda had been preparing to form a centrist political party. His last words to a friend, as reported in Algiers, were, "Kamel, my friend, they have betrayed us." One problem in Algeria is always to know who is killing whom.
These words -- and the efficiency of his killing in central Algiers -- were widely seen as suggesting that the murder was the work of rival clans within "le Pouvoir," rather than of Islamic guerrillas.
Finally, the barbarity of the car-bombings, throat slittings and other killings that have swept Algiers and towns nearby since the Muslim holy month of Ramadan started on Jan. 10 have illustrated, once again, the unconscionable methods of the violent factions that have splintered from the Islamic Salvation Front. It is unclear to what extent the Front itself -- its leaders dead, arrested or abroad -- is still a coherent political force.
Still, the frustrated, largely silenced democratic yearnings of a broad Algerian center exist and could be buttressed by Western diplomacy. Those yearnings, and economic frustration, propelled people into the streets of Algiers in the late 1980's to push for democracy, at the same time as people in Central Europe protested against their own dictators and Marxist economic mismanagement.
The Algerian democratic movement went nowhere. The country remains torn by latent ethnic tensions (a Berber minority represents perhaps a third of the population), suffers from decades of official corruption and is unsure what to make of its long French colonial history. It still seeks its true identity. The democratic opening that began in 1988 was largely about finding one. Still today, it appears, as Mr. Jospin said, that "democracy, in the end, is the only road to peace."

HEADLINE: With Strict U.S. Rules, Fewer Dealers Seek Permits to Sell Guns

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Three years after toughening requirements for getting a gun dealer's license, the Government says the number of Federally licensed dealers has declined nearly 57 percent, from 286,531 in 1993 to 124,286 this year, the lowest level in 22 years.
Requirements that gun sellers provide fingerprints and meet Federal inspectors, as well as higher application fees and added inspections of stores, have helped remove the people who got licenses even though they did not operate legitimate stores, said Raymond W. Kelly, the Treasury Under Secretary for enforcement and a former Police Commissioner of New York City. 
 "Three years ago, the United States was awash in what I call marginal Federal firearms licensees," said Mr. Kelly, whose office oversees the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "Many of them were no more than kitchen-table dealers."
About 2,600 dealers volunteered to relinquish their licenses, and 301 licenses were revoked.
Under a Presidential directive in 1993, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms started requiring applicants to give additional information and show that they had real businesses. Fingerprints and photographs were gathered for criminal checks. The agency raised fees for three-year licenses, to $200 from $10, and for renewals, to $90 from $10.
A 1994 law required applicants to promise to obey state and local laws. The Brady Law added five-day waiting periods and background checks for handgun sales. At the same time, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms stepped up inspections of stores and started requiring applicants to meet inspectors.
The current total of 124,286 dealers is the lowest since 1975, when the bureau began keeping complete records on licenses. Officials said they expected that figure to drop, reaching 100,000 to 115,000 by the fall, when the first cycle of renewals under the new rules will be complete.
In California, the number of dealers has fallen 15,000, to 8,827. Texas has 9,187 dealers, 11,000 fewer than in 1993. In Montana, the number fell to 1,822 from 3,398.
Gun-control advocates said fewer fake dealers were using the system. "These were people who were gun owners masquerading as gun dealers so they could buy guns at wholesale prices and order handguns interstate," said Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control Inc., the gun-control lobby.
With fewer dealers, Mr. Walker said, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms stands a better chance of insuring that licensed dealers are legitimate.
Opponents of gun control said that the number of licensed dealers had dropped because higher fees and that state zoning laws were forcing out small dealers. "In many rural areas, there's just a local licensee," said a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, Chip Walker. "A lot of people are saying to heck with it, it's not economically feasible."
He said an audit by the General Accounting Office last year showed that most dealers who did not renew their licenses had sold fewer than six guns a year.
"The people who are dropping out," Mr. Walker said, "are not those who sell hundreds and hundreds of guns, but people who live on farms and use their license to supplement their income."

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Facing opposition from some of the nation's governors to proposals for toughening air quality standards, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving to extend the period for public debate before the final rules are issued.
Many state and local officials and major industries that oppose the rules have been seeking a delay in the timetable for issuing them. The request is included in a resoluiton criticizing the proposals that the National Governors' Association will debate in its annual meeting in Washington this weekend. 
 In a letter delivered today to Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio, one of the governors who has requested a delay, the E.P.A. Administrator, Carol M. Browner, said the agency would ask a Federal District Court in Arizona for a two-month extension of the deadlines that the court had imposed for reviewing the current air-quality standards.
"It is critical for the American people to have a thorough, fair and informed public debate on the E.P.A. proposal," Ms. Browner said.
The proposed rules, which are the most hotly debated environmental regulations on the agency's agenda this year, are intended to better protect the health of children, people with asthma and other lung ailments, and the frail elderly. They would set new limits on smog and sooty haze.
The Federal court had ordered the review of current standards after the American Lung Association sued the agency for failing to re-examine whether existing limits wereprotecting the public's health.
"We think that it is time to get on with protecting kids' health," said Paul G. Billings, assistant director of government relations at the lung association. "The purpose of this delay is not to invite more public participation; it is meant to increase the amount of time available for bad inside politics."
Despite the lung association's opposition, Administration officials said the E.P.A. would ask the court for permission to take public comments until mid-April instead of mid-February and to issue the final rule in late August, instead of the original deadline of late June.
Congressional leaders have already signaled that they intend to review the agency's final decision, perhaps using new powers under a law passed last year that gives Congress the right to veto major Federal regulations.
Hundreds of communities that have met existing air quality standards would fall short of the new ones, and the states would have to order costly new pollution control steps to bring their air into compliance over the next several years.
But not all the states oppose the new proposals. Governors from the Northeast, especially, have supported them, arguing that polluted air from the Midwest contributes to unhealthy air pollution in their region.
Last month, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts wrote to the E.P.A. Administrator, Ms. Browner, calling the proposals a "bold response to this serious environmental threat."
The Administration's concession to the governors comes as they prepare to debate a resolution questioning the new rules.
Governor Voinovich, a Republican who is vice chairman of the National Governors' Association, is sponsoring a resolution that is sharply critical of the proposed rules. But Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, also a Republican and chairman of the group's natural resources committee, favors the proposals and is among a bloc of governors seeking to water down the resolution.
The Administration's proposals would tighten the limits on concentrations in the air of the gas ozone and of tiny chemical particles that come mainly from burning fuels. The proposals were published in November after years of scientific study.
A delay could prove important if it gives industries more time to argue in Congress that the rules would cost more than they are worth. Congressional hearings on the proposals are to begin on Wednesday.
But one White House official suggested that environmentalists and others who favor the rules could use the extra time to educate the public about the health benefits that the agency says are at stake.
Under the Clean Air Act, the agency is required to review its air quality standards every five years, in light of the latest scientific evidence, and to set the standards at a level that protects the public's health without regard to cost. Later, when the agency reviews and approves state plans for achieving the standards, it takes into account the economic and technical feasibility of imposing various pollution controls.
A more moderate version of the governors' resolution, which will be debated on Sunday by a committee and later in the week by the full group of governors, calls for the agency to consider the "implications" of the rules rather than the "costs and benefits."
And it calls for "the development of consensus among governors regarding these proposals."

HEADLINE: New Calm in Balanced-Budget Quest

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
When Republicans pushed unsuccessfully for a steep reduction in the capital gains tax in the late 1980's, their proposals were attacked by Democrats as "a tax break for the wealthy paid for by the middle class," as George J. Mitchell of Maine, then the majority leader in the Senate, put it.
But when President Clinton was asked about the issue this week, he avoided class-warfare rhetoric, saying he was not sure that cutting the capital gains rate would help the economy but that he hoped both sides would "keep their powder dry" as they tried to negotiate a balanced budget. 
 Taxes are still a politically potent symbol of the differing views of Republicans and Democrats over the size and role of government. But with both parties committed to reaching a deal on eliminating the Federal deficit in the next five years, they have muted their ideological fervor, at least for now, and appear willing to compromise not just on capital gains but also on other crucial proposals like Mr. Clinton's call for tax credits and deductions for college tuition.
"Clinton will probably go along with some type of selective capital gains cut as a concession to the Republicans, but not a general one, and the Republicans will go along with some of his education proposals," said William A. Niskanen, who was President Reagan's chief economist and now heads the Cato Institute, a research group.
To some degree, the changing tenor of the capital gains debate may reflect a growing recognition among Democrats that the issue is of concern to constituencies other than wealthy investors, including farmers and small-business owners who must pay the tax when they sell property or their companies. Republicans have long argued that reducing the tax, which is paid on profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets, would spur more investment and create more jobs and economic growth.
But, for the most part, the more muted climate seems to be a function of practical politics and the critical role that tax policy will play in reaching agreement on a balanced budget.
Although Mr. Clinton vetoed a capital gains tax cut in 1995 when it was part of the Republican budget plan, Administration officials say they recognize that it may be impossible to reach a deal without giving the Republicans at least a partial victory on capital gains, and they have left Republicans with the impression that they are prepared to bargain.
President Clinton met a month ago with Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and one of the leading Republican proponents of halving the current 28 percent top rate on capital gains.
Some Democrats, including Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, have already called in recent weeks for limited reductions in capital gains taxes on the sales of small businesses and farms. Republicans in turn have signaled that they are willing to give serious consideration to Mr. Clinton's proposal on tax breaks for college expenses.
There is considerable agreement on other tax issues, too. Both sides want to provide child tax credits to families, although they differ over the size and many details. There is considerable bipartisan support for expanding individual retirement accounts, which provide tax breaks for long-term savings.
"There is some potential for common ground here," Mr. Daschle said after proposing his tax plan last month. "We're not drawing lines in the sand."
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, has introduced a bill that would reduce the top capital gains rate to 19.8 percent as part of a broader package of tax cuts valued at $193 billion over five years.
Mr. Clinton will send his budget to Congress on Thursday, and it is expected to contain tax cuts that the Administration values at more than $100 billion over five years, mostly accounted for by the child tax credit and college tuition deductions and credits.
Administration officials told Democrats in Congress, though, that the tax cuts would be paid for in large part by closing tax loopholes and extending a series of taxes that will soon expire or have expired, including a 10 percent tax on airline tickets. The Administration said those actions would yield $80 billion over five years.
Their optimism about an eventual deal aside, Republicans are expected to take a dim view of Mr. Clinton's plan, saying it does no more than shift the tax burden among different groups of taxpayers, rather than reducing the burden on the economy. They also question whether Mr. Clinton's budget will contain enough spending cuts to let him sustain even his modest net tax cuts beyond the next few years if he wants to balance the budget by 2002.
Most of all, Republican leaders insist that the Administration accept a broader reduction in capital gains taxes than the narrow proposal offered by President Clinton to exempt profits on the sale of many homes.
According to an analysis by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the capital gains tax reduction proposed by Mr. Lott would cost $33 billion over five years. The Republicans have not yet developed a detailed plan for spending cuts, but in the budget negotiations over the last several years they have called for deeper cuts than the Democrats in Medicare and other domestic spending programs to offset their tax cuts.
Congressional staff members of both parties say that because the White House and the Republican leadership have inched closer on cuts in Medicare -- they are currently about $20 billion apart over five years -- the budget negotiations this year will center on how much the Republicans will give up in tax cuts and how much the Democrats are willing to concede in spending cuts.
"The tradeoff this year is not taxes and Medicare," said a Democratic staff member for the Senate Budget Committee. "It's going to be taxes and discretionary spending."

HEADLINE: A SHARP DECREASE IN WELFARE CASES IS GATHERING SPEED

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The steep decline in welfare caseloads that began nearly three years ago has accelerated in recent months, offering states a larger-than-expected financial windfall and a head start in carrying out the nation's newly restrictive welfare law.
The unprecedented exodus from the rolls follows a period of similarly explosive growth. After reaching a record high in March 1994, caseloads have dropped nearly 18 percent nationwide, and they have dropped in every state but Hawaii. The declines have reached some of the nation's largest cities, where concentrations of poor and single-parent families have made the rolls hard to reduce. 
 In the last year alone, the number of people on welfare has dropped 19 percent in Milwaukee, 17 percent in Houston, 11 percent in Detroit and 9 percent in New York City.
Much of the decline seems driven by the country's economic expansion, which has kept the unemployment rate below 6 percent for 28 consecutive months. But some of it also seems to stem from the efforts of many states in the last few years to place welfare recipients in jobs.
As the nation's governors gather here this weekend for their winter meeting, many are crediting their programs for the reduction in welfare caseloads. But researchers are uncertain which force is dominant: good times or tough laws.
It is also unclear whether those leaving the welfare system are mostly moving out of poverty, as many governors have said, or whether some are simply losing benefits and slipping deeper into need.
Whatever the cause, the smaller welfare rolls will make it much easier to implement the law passed last summer, which ends six decades of Federal control and offers states broad new latitude in running welfare programs. Because of the way the law is written, most states will find themselves with both a financial windfall and a bookkeeping advantage in meeting new requirements for putting recipients to work.
"We couldn't have better timing for starting welfare reform," said Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Welfare rolls have fallen more than 40 percent in three states that have been among the most energetic in urging recipients to work: Oregon, Wisconsin and Indiana. And caseloads have declined by 25 percent or more in 16 other states.
What is more, the rate of decline has accelerated in recent months. From August to October, national caseloads dropped 2.7 percent, as the number of welfare recipients declined by 338,000. By contrast, caseloads dropped 1.5 percent during the same period in 1995, when the rolls fell by 201,000 people.
And there appears to be considerable prospect for continued reductions, since the rolls have only recently peaked in California, where more than a fifth of the nation's recipients live.
"These are phenomenal caseload changes," said Wendell E. Primus, who resigned last year as a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services to protest the new law.
Almost all of the decline occurred before the law passed last summer. The law imposes a five-year limit on most families' benefits and it is only now being implemented. But Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who helped write the law, speculated that the prominence of last year's debate had already prompted people to look for work.
"People are seeing that welfare reform is a certainty and that they had darn well better take responsibility for pulling their lives together," he said. "So many people have been throwing rocks at us and saying we're going to starve kids. And quite simply, they're wrong. The law's working. And it's working right from the beginning."
But Mr. Primus cautioned that some states might be dropping people from the rolls whether they had found work or not. "Offices can do things to make life more difficult for people seeking aid," he said, like penalizing them for missed appointments even when they lack child care or transportation.
There are 11.9 million Americans receiving benefits under the main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which is being converted to a successor program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The vast majority are single women and their children. There are about 2.5 million fewer people, or about 818,000 fewer families, in the program than at the 1994 peak.
Speaking at a news conference this week, President Clinton said the decline was "the biggest in history" and gave equal credit to economic forces and the experimental state welfare programs approved under his Administration. "I think a fair reading of it would say about half of this decline came from an improved economy, and about half of it came from intensified efforts to move people from welfare to work," he said.
But in a subsequent interview, Ms. Shalala described the President's figures as only "a hunch" and declined to offer a hunch of her own. "I'm too well trained a social scientist to make a guess," said Ms. Shalala, who holds a doctorate in public administration. "It may be a different split in different states."
Disentangling the forces that move families on and off the welfare rolls is a harder task than it may seem. Local economies play a role, but so do eligibility rules, population growth and changes in family size and structure. Vaguer influences may also be involved, like shifting public attitudes.
And because the sudden welfare decline follows an equally startling rise, some of the current reduction may simply represent a natural readjustment. After remaining stable for more than a decade, caseloads shot up 25 percent during and after the 1990 recession, when 3.5 million people joined the rolls.
The decline of 2.5 million people is much larger than the reductions that followed previous recessions. But there are still about a million more Americans on welfare than there were in the late 1980's.
The last four years have brought an unparalleled effort to put recipients to work. Forty-three states won Federal approval to run experimental programs, some covering just a few counties and some extensive and bold. Even analysts who typically stress economics say they think the new policies are partly responsible for the declining caseloads.
But the lessons are not immediately clear.
Indiana and Wisconsin have experienced large reductions under governors who frequently inveighed against the welfare system. And in 1995, both states began experimenting with a two-year limit.
Oregon, by contrast, has experienced its sharp reductions through an intensive case management system that imposes no time limits as long as recipients are moving toward employability. And welfare has not become a prominent political issue there. "We aren't trying to find fault with people who aren't working," said Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat and a physician who is best known for his advocacy of universal health care. "We're asking ourselves why aren't they working."
There are also intriguing contrasts between the Indiana and Wisconsin approaches. Wisconsin has achieved much of its reduction by diverting people from welfare at the time they apply. Indiana has not cut the numbers coming on the rolls but has increased the number who leave each month.
The unemployment rate is 5.2 percent in Oregon, 3.3 percent in Indiana and 2.7 percent in Wisconsin.
West Virginia has also had a sharp reduction in welfare, with its rolls shrinking 33 percent since March 1994, but it is also one of the few states that did not change welfare policy. Officials have attributed the reduction to a growth of jobs as the state's unemployment rate fell from 8.9 percent in 1994 to 6.8 percent at the end of last year.
Perhaps the place where welfare policies have had the clearest effect on caseloads is Wisconsin. The state expanded three new programs to Milwaukee last March and saw its caseloads suddenly plummet.
One is a "diversion program," which requires applicants to perform 60 hours of job search activities as a condition of getting aid. Another is a "pay for performance" plan, which reduces grants proportionately for every hour of work or training that recipients miss. A third is a program of bureaucratic incentives that measures caseload reductions and threatens lagging offices with a loss of money.
The welfare rolls in Milwaukee have fallen by 7,235 families in the 10 months since the program began, compared with a decline of 2,753 families in the previous year. Since March, new applications have declined by about 30 percent.
Some critics of the Milwaukee program fear that some families may be worse off. But Jason Turner, a Wisconsin official who helped design the program, said the screening discourages those with other options from coming onto welfare. "A lot of people said: 'The heck with it. I'll find my own job,' " he said.
The reduction in caseloads is far greater than what the Clinton Administration projected, said Mr. Primus, who oversaw those forecasts last year. As a result, the states will reap an unexpectedly large windfall.
Under the old Federal law, states received additional money for each additional person on welfare. Under the new structure, states get a fixed amount, no matter how many people are in the program. A recent Congressional analysis estimated that states will receive $1.3 billion more this year than they would have under the old rules.
The reduction in caseloads also makes it easier for states to meet the new law's work requirements. The law requires states to enroll 25 percent of recipients in work programs this year, but they can reduce that percentage by cutting their caseloads. As a result, the average state will have to enroll just 18 percent of its recipients in work programs, according to an analysis by the Ways and Means Committee.

HEADLINE: Skaters' Heaven in a Connecticut Suburb;
When Olympic Champions Moved In, They Put Simsbury on the World Map

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: SIMSBURY, Conn., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Among the dozen or so young girls executing double salchows, axels and camels at the rink here on a typical afternoon, a visitor would be hard-pressed to find one who actually came from this wealthy New England town.
There was, for instance, Gabriela Saurel, a 17-year-old figure skater with the grace of a ballerina, who moved here last year from Geneva. Across the ice was 13-year-old Rachel Kaminsky, who lives in a hotel room here with her mother and travels back to her Long Island home on weekends. And close by was another teen-ager, Valerie Miller, whose parents gladly sent her 1,300 miles from Jacksonville, Fla. 
 It is all part of the surprising transformation of Simsbury, a quiet suburb in the Farmington River Valley that lacks a movie theater or a mall, into a world figure skating mecca, a place some of the world's greatest skaters now call home.
Three years ago, the 1994 Olympic individual figure skating champions Oksana Baiul and Viktor Petrenko, and their coach, Galina Zmievskaya, announced that they were leaving Odessa, Ukraine, to train at a new, state-of-the-sport skating complex to be built here.
Since then, they have been joined by other luminaries from the skating world at the International Skating Center of Connecticut and this little-known town has become the focal point of hordes of skaters and fans, a position only enhanced by the publicity surrounding Ms. Baiul's arrest for drunken driving.
"Skating has put Simsbury on the map," said Jay Cobbledick, a college professor who owns the town's oldest house (circa 1700) and sits on the town's historic district commission. "Before this, we weren't really known for anything besides being a nice place to live."
One resident was on the telephone a few weeks ago to a mail-order company in Iowa, and when she gave her address, the operator screamed, "You're from Simsbury!" and begged her to get the autograph of Ekaterina Gordeeva, the Russian Olympic pairs skating champion whose husband and skating partner, Sergei Grinkov, died in 1995 of a heart attack.
Ms. Gordeeva and her 4-year-old daughter have remained here, and her struggle to continue her life and career has been followed closely by legions of new admirers. Simsbury is mentioned in her best-selling book, "My Sergei: A Love Story," and often comes up in her many national television appearances.
And after Ms. Baiul's arrest on Jan. 12, the town's name was heard again around the world. Faced with an onslaught of reporters, town officials met to figure out how to protect the privacy of the 19-year-old skater whom many residents talk about as if she were an adopted daughter.
All of this attention has left the Simsbury Chamber of Commerce routinely answering phone calls from skating aficionados who desperately want to send flowers or a letter to Ms. Baiul, Ms. Gordeeva or another favorite skater.
In turn, this central Connecticut town of about 22,500, separated from Hartford by about five miles and a small mountain, has fallen hard for figure skating. While most of the 275 skaters who train for competition are from elsewhere, the skating center's "Learn to Skate" program has 800 people, mostly children from this enclave of young professionals.
The town school system, which is considered one of the state's best, has made special arrangements for competitive skaters, allowing them special schedules so they can skate in the mornings and early afternoon.
Last year, the town's top elected official, First Selectman Mary A. Glassman, then 37, learned to skate and has become an ardent fan.
"My dream is that the gold medalist will some day be from Simsbury," Ms. Glassman said. "We have a lot of little Oksanas running around right now."
A local Ford dealership, hoping to capitalize on Ms. Baiul's popularity, had an advertising campaign with the slogan "Oksana's Other Double Axel." And shortly after the skating center opened on Oct. 17, 1994, a Moldovian immigrant, Gretta Bogdan, was inspired to start a new business here, Babushka's, which she called the only Russian restaurant between New York and Boston.
It was not always so obvious that the International Skating Center of Connecticut would be a success, let alone be built.
Today, figure skating is the second most-watched sport on television, after football, and the top stars can make six- and seven-figure salaries in skating shows that tour the world. Many small towns now look at skating rinks as an economic development initiative, the way larger cities view professional sports franchises.
Yet, a few years ago, such popularity was almost inconceivable.
In the early 1990's, the Simsbury center was merely the dream of Robert L. Young, a United States Olympic coach who headed pairs training at the skating program at the University of Delaware. When Mr. Young told colleagues of his determination to return home to central Connecticut and build a world-class center, they told him he was crazy, Mr. Young recalled recently.
Even after Mr. Young hooked up with an established developer from Simsbury, Stephen D. Fish, who insisted that the new center be built in his hometown, the project did not race forward.
Many in Simsbury had reservations, but the project was approved in a 1994 referendum that allowed Mr. Fish to build on 17 acres donated to the town by a local corporation.
The vote allowed Mr. Young to deliver on a promise he had made years earlier: to bring his friend, Ms. Zmievskaya, whom he describes as "one of the greatest coaches in history," to Connecticut.
A strong friendship was born among him, Ms. Zmievskaya and Mr. Petrenko at an international competition in Odessa in the late 1980's when one of Mr. Young's skaters was seriously injured. Alone in a strange city, his skater in a hospital that lacked basic medical equipment, Mr. Young was amazed when the two Ukrainians appeared with medicine, syringes and other supplies and then offered Mr. Young a place to stay.
Over the years, Mr. Young and Ms. Zmievskaya grew closer, and she confided in him that the desperate conditions in the former Soviet Union had made it almost impossible to skate. Sometimes, she and her skaters had to scrape the ice clean with their own hands.
"I've heard time after time that I built this for Oksana Baiul," Mr. Young said Wednesday. "When I started this, no one had heard of Oksana Baiul. I hadn't heard of Oksana Baiul. I built it for Galina."
Today, the $6 million skating center rises from an old tobacco field, across from barns where the crop was dried. Inside are two rinks, a dance studio and a weight room, as well as bleachers for 1,400 people.
"In Ukraine, you wouldn't get ice like this," said Vladimir Petrenko, a coach here and Viktor's younger brother, an accomplished competitor in his own right. "These rinks are beautiful."
There are about a half-dozen other elite figure skating centers in the United States, including those in Colorado Springs; Lake Arrowhead, Calif., and Bloomfield Hills, Mich. But Simsbury is the newest, and skating experts are impressed at how quickly it has developed. Trizec Hahn Ice, the company that bought the center from the original developer last summer, hopes to use Simsbury's figure skating expertise to build six new rinks.
At Simsbury, figure skaters can be found training as early as 6 in the morning -- paying $8 each for 45 minutes, with the cost of coaching $30 to $100 more. As the day goes on, the rinks are shared by hockey teams and precision skating teams, a sort of Radio City Rockettes on ice.
Four evenings a week, public sessions draw up to 600 casual skaters. An ice dancing team from Belarus trains between midnight and 4 A.M. Over the course of any given 24 hours, the rinks are rarely unused.
Still, what distinguishes the center is the talent it collects. On Wednesday, a Connecticut teen-ager stroked down the ice with April Sargent-Thomas, a United States ice dancing champion. Another practiced with her husband, the former Canadian dance champion John F. Thomas. A third worked with Nina Petrenko, who is Viktor's wife, Ms. Zmievskaya's daughter and a choreographer for Ms. Baiul. On the other rink, Scott Davis, a two-time American national champion who moved here this summer, had just finished a session with Ms. Zmievskaya.
A few people from town had watched the practice in awe, but no one bothered Mr. Davis as he left.
Susan Ferrara, the mother of one young skater, remarked that last year, before Ms. Baiul's legal troubles began, a visitor was likely to find the Olympic champion here, sometimes with a little girl on her lap or chatting away with another teen-ager.
Mrs. Ferrara moved here from Stony Brook, L.I., last year, and her husband, an investment banker, spends weekdays at an apartment in Manhattan. Her 8-year-old daughter, Alexandra, spends hours a day on the ice, something that was difficult to do on Long Island, she said.
On a recent afternoon, after brushing her daughter's hair and showing her some new outfits, Mrs. Ferrara sent her onto the ice. The little girl twirled and danced, speeding around the rink like a fish that had been set free in the water.
A smile spread across her face. It looked as if there were no place in the world she would rather be.
 
Stars in Simsbury

HEADLINE: DOWNSIZED PROMISE -- A special report.;
Black Workers Bear Big Burden As Jobs in Government Dwindle

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
In a better, fairer world, Wallace Riddle would have been a carpenter. He could build anything, his daughter Donna said.
But he was a black man, and in New York City in the late 1940's that meant he could not get a construction job because of the industry's color bar. So he went to work as a bus driver for the city, which had dropped racial barriers to employment, and that changed the fortunes of the Riddle family forever. 
 "When I was coming up, all I ever heard was, 'Get that good steady city job,' " Ms. Riddle said. She listened. In 1972, she joined the welfare agency as an income maintenance specialist. For 23 years, she proceeded on and up, as her father had before her, through the Civil Service hierarchy, ending as an administrative manager. Increasing prosperity brought a move as well, from Brooklyn, where she was born and reared, to southeast Queens, where thousands of city workers were building an island of middle-class success.
But now the Riddle family's connection with city government, spanning half a century and two generations of upward mobility, has ended. In 1995, Ms. Riddle took a buyout package to leave her job, burned out, she said, by stress in her early 50's. Waves of previous staff reductions had ripped through her department, raising the workload for those who were left.
A way of life grew up in the mostly minority Queens neighborhoods at New York City's easternmost edge. It was built around government work and suffused with government's assumptions of dependability and equality. The new way, life after government, is still unfolding -- in the neighborhoods, in individual lives and in the spaces inside families.
The changes cut both ways, as the children of city workers enter the work force, rethinking the paths taken by their parents. Ms. Riddle's two children, both in their 20's, want nothing to do with Civil Service, and she can't blame them.
"The previous generation was looking for job security," said Emily Marshall, who quit her job as a program director with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development in 1994, in her mid-30's. "Job security was everything."
Ms. Marshall is finishing a master's degree in city and regional planning at the Pratt Institute and working as the deputy director of a nonprofit foundation in Manhattan. "People in my generation are looking for more," she said.
Like garment making and retailing, the city government has absorbed successive groups of immigrants and members of minority groups. Three waves of newcomers in the last 150 years found a place there. In the 1800's, it was the Irish and Germans, and after World War I, Italians and Eastern-European-born Jews. Black and Hispanic workers entered in the 1950's, and especially since the 1960's.
 
Shrinking Ambitions
Government Seeks To Accomplish Less
But in the 1990's, the foundation of that world shifted and weakened, as government shrank its ambitions and its work force. The various levels of government have eliminated more than 93,000 jobs in New York City in the last five years, more than 1 in 7 positions, State Labor Department figures show.
The combined local, state and Federal work force reached what will almost certainly stand as its high-water mark for this century in May 1990, when 621,200 workers had government jobs. Every indicator since then has pointed downward.
For the region, the steady hemorrhage of government jobs has become a major theme of the economy, worsening the recession of the early 90's and dampening the recovery.
For Hispanic workers, and particularly for blacks, the implications of government downsizing are more profound. The city says it does not record the racial composition of the people leaving jobs under the various work force reduction plans that began in early 1994. But the cumulative evidence, including dozens of interviews with current and former city workers, is overwhelming that black workers have been hit the hardest.
One snapshot study of 14,000 departing workers, commissioned by the City Council, said 43 percent were black. Another study of 11,000 former workers found that a majority lived in black neighborhoods. Yet another study found that the racial composition of the work force had changed in just two years, to 36 percent from 38 percent black.
A factor is that while participation in city government by black New Yorkers is large, it is also narrow, and concentrated in agencies like social services and health care that had their most rapid growth in the last 25 to 30 years. It is in precisely those areas where the greatest cost-cutting pressures are being felt by governments, as big changes in welfare and health care sweep away the old patterns and the old jobs.
"The downsizing of state and local governments is going to have a predictable, disproportionate, negative effect on people of color generally and especially the black community," said Bennett Harrison, a professor of political economy at the New School for Social Research. Professor Harrison, who has studied urban government workers since the early 1970's, said minority groups benefited disproportionately from the growth of the public sector and are now simply in the wrong place as history's wheel has turned. "The case is unambiguous," he said.
The New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who as a young black man in the mid-1960's got his start working on antipoverty programs in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay before going on to a career at Citibank in the 1970's, said his greatest fear was not so much for the people leaving jobs now, but for their children and grandchildren.
"Public sector jobs helped establish a stable middle class for the minority community, but the next generation will not have that opportunity," he said.
Mr. McCall said government downsizing is just half the problem. The other half is that private industry, facing many of the same cost-control pressures as government, is not creating jobs fast enough in New York. "The major issue facing our city and state government," he said, "is the lack of planning for these major changes: the transformation of the work force."
Certainly, government downsizing is not merely a New York phenomenon. Nationally, economists estimate that governments have shed more than 454,000 jobs between 1979 and 1993, a trend that has accelerated since. Cities like Indianapolis and Milwaukee and Phoenix have invented whole new ways of performing city services, using fewer workers or private contractors.
But only in a few places, like Washington, has government assumed the role in local economics and culture that it has in New York. The city's pure size gives its lessened employment a resonance. If the city government were ranked alongside the Fortune 500, it would be the 14th largest financial entity in the nation, with annual revenues of $39.5 billion in 1996. That makes it smaller than the Chrysler Corporation, but bigger than State Farm Insurance, 15th, or the state government of Texas, 16th.
 
A Different Path
New York Tries To Avoid Layoffs
New York is also proceeding along a different path from other cost-cutting cities around the country, urban economists say, with more emphasis on job reduction in particular. As the city has downsized, it has also introduced new ways of defining how jobs are counted and paid for.
Last year, the city was able to eliminate, on paper, 1,800 positions from the Police Department through a shift of those workers from a city payroll account to one paid for by Federal anticrime money. Privatization of city jobs, through granting contracts to private companies for services, has also made inroads in certain parts of the government.
Of the roughly 3,000 jobs that have been eliminated in this way, according to the State Comptroller, more than half are in social services, primarily services for the homeless. In this area, workers and clients are disproportionately members of minority groups. But because New York sought to avoid layoffs, relying instead on voluntary buyouts and early retirements, the effect of the downsizing has also been subtle and often invisible. The story is not one of neighborhoods laid waste, but of large and small accommodations that suggest the end of a chapter for minority groups.
The contrast with the mid-1970's, when New York laid off thousands of workers as it struggled to avoid bankruptcy, is particularly stark. Then, the job cuts were demanded by creditors. Laid-off government workers tended to be those with the least seniority, a group that included many recently hired minority group members. But the 1970's were just an interruption. Hiring resumed as good times returned, and employment totals ultimately surpassed the old peak.
The downsizing of the 1990's, by rewarding voluntary departure, weeds out senior workers and managers and has thus hit minority employees who in many cases only broke into management levels in the 1980's. Equally important is that 1990's downsizing represents a change in policy and philosophy about what government is supposed to do, and not a short-term change in the city's fortunes, which have been in an upswing. Since 1993, the private sector has created thousands of new jobs. In the 1970's, recession was everywhere.
The momentum of minority hiring by the city began in the 1940's, even as doors in much of private industry remained closed. By the late 1960's, it was an economic engine in its own right, as Mayor Lindsay began big recruiting efforts to increase the minority work force. Hiring surged again in the 1980's, when the numbers of white applicants declined as the city's private economy boomed.
And it had its own place: southeastern Queens.
Dennis M. Walcott, the president of the New York Urban League and the son of two New York City public-school teachers, vividly remembers growing up in the sea of black city workers who had made their way up from Harlem and Brooklyn to Queens neighborhoods like Cambria Heights, Ozone Park and St. Albans.
The Riddles were just one of the networks of family and tradition that formed as the public sector economy evolved. Michael Leo Owens, a 27-year-old researcher at the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University at Albany, said government connections were everywhere in the Queens he had known growing up. Mr. Owens's grandfather, who worked for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, first took the family to South Ozone Park in the early 1960's.
"I had an aunt who was an administrator in child welfare, aunts and uncles and cousins who were bus drivers, three female cousins who work for the Police Department," said Mr. Owens, who recently went back to study the culture and economy of government workers in southeastern Queens. "My sister works for the Federal Bureau of Prisons and her husband is a professor at Queens College. It's amazing once you start to think about it."
Some city workers and residents see the changes in those patterns as reasons for hope. As education levels and opportunities have expanded, many young people like Mr. Owens with deep city government roots reject the idea of government work because they have options that their parents and grandparents could not even contemplate.
Others, like Ms. Riddle, think that the black connection to government work stifled the spirit of private enterprise that flourishes in other minority groups. She has started a home-based business, selling health food and natural medicines, and wants to train others to make the same leap.
Minority workers with government experience might also get some of the private sector jobs that are expected to grow in number as the city contracts out services that it now performs. And not every part of government is shrinking. Some agencies with large minority work forces, like the Police and Correction Departments, are still hiring, or are at least holding steady.
But there are also bleaker signs. The shrinking of jobs is accompanied by a national overhaul of the welfare system that is pushing the city to put tens of thousands of welfare recipients to work to earn their payments. In a previous era, those positions might have been traditional jobs with benefits and pensions. And both the public and private sectors in New York are demanding increasingly high levels of education and technical skills to fill new jobs. That leaves out many former and prospective city workers.
Willie Wren, the president of the Miracle Makers, a nonprofit social service group in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, said he frequently gets calls from people who took buyout payments of $10,000 or more to leave a city job, only to find themselves in trouble a few months later, with no new job and the money running out. "We have advised them, 'Why don't you go back and say, "I'd like to give the money back," then whatever they offer you, take it,' and some have done that," Mr. Wren said. "But I believe it's going to get progressively worse. I get frightened by it."
There is also a political element to downsizing that could resonate this year in New York's mayoral election. G. Nesbit Benjamin, a retired Transit Authority police officer from St. Albans whose two brothers and father were all city government workers, said that to his generation, Civil Service was more than just employment.
It represented hope, and that hope, he said, is being shredded by the policies of downsizing that accelerated with the election of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who took office in 1993 after defeating New York's first black mayor, David N. Dinkins. Even though the job cuts began under Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani has become the symbol of the changes and their impact.
Mr. Benjamin, repeating a frequent comment among blacks, said he believes that the downsizing trend represents, in part, a backlash by white society that began with the highly publicized reports after the 1990 Census about economic gains by black families in Queens. Median household income by black families surpassed that of whites in the borough for the first time.
"People said, 'Hey, how come they're doing so good?' " he said.

A Sense of Promise
When Government Wasn't Just a Job
 In 1967, when Valerie A. Walker began her conquest of municipal government as a clerk in the New York City Department of Finance, working for government was more than just a means to a paycheck. In a way that now seems quaint, government then had an aura, a promise, a sense of dynamic opportunity. It was flush with assertive attitudes about civil rights and fueled by a booming 1960's economy and an agenda to end poverty within a generation.
Mayor Lindsay, elected in 1965, had set as one priority an expansion of municipal employment among minority groups. Recruiting teams were dispatched to high schools. A cadet program was established in the Transit Authority police, aimed at putting minority-group teen-agers on a track toward becoming officers.
It worked. In 1963, the work force at the agencies under the mayor's budget was 13.6 percent black; by 1990, the work force was 36.7 percent black, according to a new book about the city's work force, "Still the Promised Land?" by Prof. Roger Waldinger, a sociologist at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Professor Waldinger said that in some agencies, the transformation was even more striking. The Transportation Department went from 4.5 percent black in 1963 to 42.3 percent black by 1990, and blacks attained majority status in the Housing Authority and the Health, Corrections and Social Services Departments.
For the first time, blacks in New York had found and exploited an economic niche all their own. But the downsizing of government, and the changed attitude by many young people about the desirability of city jobs, suggests just as strongly that that window has closed.
Of the 14,058 city employees who left under the first four severance programs through early 1995, 63 percent were women, and 43 percent were black, according to the city's Equal Employment Practices Commission.
Severance records from the Office of Payroll Administration show that of 11,362 people who left city agencies in the last two years, a majority lived in neighborhoods classified by the Census Bureau as having majority black populations. Altogether, of the nine city neighborhoods that had the most job cuts, eight had majority black populations.
A recent study by the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a Manhattan research group, similarly concluded that while Hispanic workers held onto their piece of a shrinking municipal pie, with 13 percent of city jobs, blacks, and especially black women, disappeared by the thousands.
In just 24 months, the institute said, the percentage of black workers fell to 36 percent from 38 percent of the city government work force.
"People don't want to talk about the racial dimension of these issues," said the institute's president, Angelo Falcon.
"But there is an extreme segregation within the government work force," Mr. Falcon said, "with some job titles 60 percent African-American and others 90 percent white. And when you have the kind of cutbacks of this administration that focus on the social services sector, then you have this racial disparity."
Jobs were also changed along the way. Christine Hughes ended a 30-year career at the New York City Human Resources Administration last year as a job cutter. Her final task was to downsize her own department from 200 people to 70. Then she was gone too.
Her former husband, Martin Hughes Sr., took early retirement from his job as a security officer at the Human Resources Administration at about the same time as his department was being turned over to a private security service.
"I said the heck with it," Mr. Hughes said. "That way I didn't have the aggravation of somebody constantly saying, 'We're going to get rid of you all.' "
Many residents say that as one door shuts, another door, to private enterprise, may be opening. Valerie Walker, who took a buyout at 50, five years before she can get her pension, specifically discouraged her three children from working for the city, telling them over and over that "they could do better." One child works for a hotel in Manhattan and another for an ambulance company. The third did choose government, working for the Federal Aviation Administration.
Ms. Riddle, whose life after government has been partly consumed by her grandchildren -- three of whom, at ages 3, 4 and 5, live with her in St. Albans -- said she hopes to use much of the rest of her life encouraging young black people to go into business and not government.
She has joined a one-year-old network of black businesses, which include home-based companies like hers as well as more conventional businesses like house painting and construction, aimed at helping one another through referrals and sales.
"Downsizing might be one of the best things that happens," she said. "It's forcing us to take another look and not leave our financial happiness to other individuals."

Roots and Rewards
Upward Mobility, Centered in Queens
Government work did not create from scratch the solid middle class communities of single family homes just north of Kennedy International Airport and west of Nassau County. Its roots and its reputation as New York's premier black middle class enclave go back further than that, to the 1940's, when Count Basie and Lena Horne and Jackie Robinson made their homes in St. Albans.
But government work gave the neighborhoods their muscle and their sense of assertive identity. In the New York region as a whole, about 18 percent of the population works for a governmental entity. In southeastern Queens, according to Mr. Owens's study at the Rockefeller Institute using 1990 Census numbers, 29 percent of all jobs were with government, while 10 census tracts had rates of over 40 percent. During the 1980's, 26 percent of all the new jobs in southeastern Queens came from government.
A high level of home ownership -- 63 percent, as against about 30 percent in the metropolitan area as a whole -- combined with relatively high household income place these neighborhoods among the upper tier of black communities in the country.
In a society in which blacks still have far higher poverty rates than whites, and where huge barriers still exist between many black neighborhoods and the style and culture of America's middle class, southeastern Queens became a kind of promised land that beckoned to those who could reach it.
It had its pantheon of founders like Mr. Basie and Miss Horne and Ella Fitzgerald and John Coltrane and Fats Waller and Roy Campanella, whose images are emblazoned on a huge mural under the Long Island Rail Road tracks in St. Albans.
In these neighborhoods, people felt in control of their lives. In the early 1990's, the residents of Addisleigh Park, perhaps the most affluent section of St. Albans, persuaded the city through hearings and petitions to reroute traffic on their streets to stop trucks from rumbling past their stately homes.
The quiet pride was evident at a meeting of former city workers organized for a reporter at the home of Thomas and Jean Leach, both retired school administrators, in Addisleigh Park. As the winter sun streamed through the dining room windows, residents spoke with pride about sending their children off to college, and the careers they had made, the challenges overcome. When it was over, all joined hands in a prayer of thanks.
Most St. Albans residents seem not to feel any need for gates or bars on their windows, a measure of any New York neighborhood's fear of crime, and the specter of idle and intimidating teen-agers hanging out on street corners seems almost entirely absent. On thoroughfares like Linden Boulevard, one of the main shopping strips of St. Albans, people walk with purpose and bustle.
Still, there is a sense of fragility in many homes and neighborhoods of southeastern Queens now as the underpinning of the economy changes.
Amy Berry, an owner of Berry's Florist in St. Albans, has cut her payroll from nine employees in the early 1990's to four today because her customers have simply stopped spending on luxuries like flowers.
"Our heyday was 10 to 12 years ago," Ms. Berry said. "Those were the good years."
Other signs of the change flicker like lightning.
The annual job fair in Rochdale Village, which for years drew recruiters from city agencies, was shrunken and diminished last year, while a new one at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in St. Albans recently was vibrant with private employers.
State Senator Aldon R. Waldon Jr. said a neighbor in Cambria Heights approached him asking for a letter of recommendation. The man was being forced out of a high-level city job, Mr. Waldon said, and was trying to make a transition. Mr. Waldon, who represents much of southeastern Queens, said that with a private economy growing and creating jobs, his neighbor landed a new position and still goes off to work every morning. Mr. Waldon fears that the worst is yet to come.
"There is an eddying effect from the downsizing, but it has not burst through the dam yet," he said.
At Richard's Place, a restaurant in St. Albans where talk is served up as generously as the Southern cuisine, an owner, Rhonda Jones, said health-care workers are the ones she hears from most.
One woman, a nurse in a city-owned hospital, comes in just to talk, Mrs. Jones said. The woman has been too upset to eat much.
"She said her stomach is so upset because every day, coming to work, the changes in her department, people being laid off and you don't know from week to week whether you're going to have a job," Mrs. Jones said.
Real estate professionals say home prices have remained stable, but patterns have changed. With a widespread housing shortage in New York, many adult children are still living at home.
Other young people are banding together in groups of friends and relatives to buy homes, setting up unconventional households to make the costs more affordable. Some residents say they fear the ebbing of government employment in the 1990's will weaken the traditions of local civic involvement in these tidy neighborhoods with their well-cared-for homes and lawns.
The number of foreclosures has risen as well, real estate brokers say, as overextended buyers who bought in the market peaks of the 1980's are finding themselves in trouble.
Bill Jones, who has sold real estate in southeastern Queens since the late 1970's, says he thinks that the market is still working off the excesses of the 1980's. The correction is based more on overpriced housing values than downsizing, which he thinks has yet to make its impact felt.
But either way, he added, "The chickens have come home to roost now."

HEADLINE: No Background Checks Done On Guests at Clinton Coffees

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The White House acknowledged today that it had never reviewed the backgrounds of any of the hundreds of visitors who saw President Clinton in scores of intimate White House meetings arranged by the Democratic National Committee.
Background checks are routinely done on other guests to the White House, an Administration official said, but the guests on the lists proposed by the Democratic committee were simply put on President Clinton's schedule. 
 The committee never performed any review of the people coming to see Mr. Clinton, said a committee spokeswoman, Amy Weiss Tobe. She said the committee merely supplied the Social Security numbers and birth dates of the White House guests so guards could match a guest to a name on the list.
The acknowledgment by the White House that the background checks had not been done came today after The Washington Post reported that a felon with possible ties to the Bonanno organized crime family had attended a Democratic coffee at the White House in December 1995, a few months after his second conviction. The felon joins a list of other questionable figures who were guests of the President at the White House in meetings arranged by the Democratic Party, often as part of an effort to reward or encourage contributors.
"No vetting was ever done for these events, other than asking for Social Security numbers or dates of birth in order to verify the identity of the guest," said Lanny J. Davis, a White House special counsel.
Ordinarily, officials said today, the Secret Service uses Government computer data bases to check the backgrounds of people who come in contact with the President to see if any visitors pose a security risk. Secret Service officials have been reluctant to describe the security measures at the White House.
But for reasons that are not clear, the Secret Service did not perform such checks on the lists that the Democratic National Committee provided to the White House for guests going to political functions, like the coffees.
"We never did any vetting either," Ms. Tobe said.
The details of the lax security procedures emerged in response to questions about The Washington Post article, which disclosed that a New Jersey man who was convicted of penny-stock fraud had met President Clinton at a White House coffee a few months after his second conviction. Law-enforcement officials and news accounts about the man, Eric Wynn, have said he had ties to figures in organized crime.
"Based on the facts and circumstances as we understand them," Mr. Davis said, "Mr. Wynn was not an appropriate person to be included in this White House event."
The White House has provided some details about 103 coffees there; most were small gatherings attended by President Clinton. Among those who have already been identified as attending the coffees are Wang Jun, the head of a Chinese conglomerate that includes a major arms manufacturer, and Roger Tamraz of Lebanon who has been sought under an arrest warrant issued eight years ago by Interpol.
The coffees began in 1995 under a program set up by Harold M. Ickes, the White House deputy chief of staff who was helping to oversee President Clinton's re-election campaign, an Administration official said.
Officials at the Democratic committee and the Clinton Administration said today that senior committee officials would compile the list of guests for a White House coffee from the names of prominent donors and party supporters and then provide it to the White House political affairs office, headed by Douglas Sosnick. Mr. Sosnick or his aides would then send the proposed guest list to other White House officials who set Mr. Clinton's schedule. Nowhere along the process would the guests' backgrounds be reviewed.
Ms. Tobe said Mr. Wynn had been put on a guest list for the Dec. 21, 1995, coffee at the suggestion of Richard T. Mays, an Arkansas lawyer appointed to the Arkansas Supreme Court by Mr. Clinton when he was Governor in the 1980's. Law-enforcement officials say Mr. Mays had sought to represent Mr. Wynn in one of his criminal trials, but it is unclear how much work he actually performed for Mr. Wynn.
Others at the small gathering, in the White House Map Room, included Erskine B. Bowles, now the White House chief of staff; the two chairmen of the Democratic National Committee, Donald L. Fowler and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut; Thomas F. McLarty 3d, counselor to the President; Dana G. Mead, chairman and chief executive of Tenneco Inc.; Robert N. Elkins, chairman and chief executive of Integrated Health Services of Owings Mills, Md., and two top Democratic committee fund-raising officials, the finance chairman, Marvin S. Rosen, and the finance director, Richard Sullivan.
Ms. Tobe said one of the party officials at the event said the coffee had involved "a discussion about the economic outlook for the country and how the economy was doing."
"One of the attendees doesn't remember Wynn saying anything," Ms. Tobe said. "He remembers him sitting pretty quietly."
A few months earlier, on July 21, 1995, Mr. Wynn was convicted by a Federal jury in New Jersey on 13 counts of conspiracy, security fraud and wire fraud for a 1988 scheme to manipulate penny-stocks. Dick Lavinthal, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's office in New Jersey, said today that evidence in the trial showed that Mr. Wynn's scheme had been done in part for the benefit of the family of Frank Coppa, who has been identified in news articles and court documents as a Bonanno crime family captain.
Mr. Lavinthal said that court evidence showed that Mr. Wynn had manipulated the stock to the benefit of Richard Tienken, an entertainment manager who has also been described as having ties to organized crime.
Last October, the Democratic National Committee returned $75,000 in contributions from Mr. Tienken and a company he is associated with. The committee acted after learning that at a 1991 racketeering trial, an informer from the Mafia said Mr. Tienken had engaged in business dealings with a captain in the Luchese crime family.
In September, Mr. Wynn, who is 37, was sentenced to 52 months in prison and fined $50,000. He remains free, pending his appeal.
While the Democratic committee has no access to Justice Department and other confidential Government records, details about Mr. Wynn's background are publicly available.
A check of Mr. Wynn's name in the Nexis data base, for instance, would have unearthed a 1989 article in Forbes that said, "Federal documents say Bonanno family capo Frank Coppa, his associate Eric Wynn and other friends paid a visit" to a stock promoter under indictment named Perry Constantinou and "bashed him on the side of the head with a telephone."
The Forbes article described how Mr. Wynn and Mr. Coppa might have laundered money to evade taxes and also reported that Mr. Wynn was serving a three-year prison term at the time for fraud and for filing a false tax return.

This Takes the Cake: Lyle to Manage

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Lou Piniella saw it in his morning newspaper and said, "They can have a cheeseburger before they pitch."
Fran Healy was told the news and said, "Just don't have any cakes in the clubhouse." Then, he added, "There will be no curfew and the pitchers won't have to run." 
 Willie Randolph greeted the news with a smile. "I'll tell you one thing," he said, "the players will have a lot of fun playing for Sparky." Then Randolph laughed.
Sparky Lyle laughed, too. "You probably didn't believe it," said the former reliever. "Yeah, I'm the same guy, just more mature. But not that much more. Don't get carried away."
Some players, from the day they first put on a uniform, have the word "manager" written across their chests. Some develop the interest and the aptitude as their careers near an end.
Others were just not meant to be managers. Sparky Lyle was one of those. But at age 52, 15 years after he last wore a major league uniform, he is prepared to prove that perception is a misperception.
Lyle has become the manager of the Somerset Patriots. The New Jersey team does not exist, but then, neither do the Arizona Diamondbacks, and Buck Showalter has been paid about $1 million to be their manager for the past year.
The Patriots will be a member of the Atlantic League, an independent minor league that its developers hope to unveil in 1998. The former major leaguers Bud Harrelson and Rick Cerone are involved in the league. And now, so is Lyle.
"Sparky's going to manage? Good for him," said Randolph, a second baseman behind Lyle during the pitcher's Yankee years in the 1970's. "I didn't know he had any aspirations. Sparky has changed a little bit, but from my experiences as a player, he's the last guy who I thought would want to manage."
Piniella, the Seattle Mariners' manager, gave Lyle the benefit of the doubt, based on his own experiences. "Could anyone ever imagine me being a manager?" Piniella said. "Probably not, right?"
Fred Stanley, now the player development director for the Milwaukee Brewers, said: "I would envision him as a pitching coach more than a manager, but he'll probably do a pretty good job. A lot of managing is getting guys to play hard, and I imagine they'll play hard for him."
Healy, a Mets announcer and a former catcher, said: "I think it's terrific. He never blamed anyone for anything, even when he pitched. If he won, it was good. If he lost, too bad, come back and get 'em tomorrow. I think he'll be great."
Dick Tidrow, the San Francisco Giants' new player-personnel director, was not surprised. "I thought he'd get back in baseball one of these days; it's his first love," said Tidrow, a former pitcher. "I think that's a great selection. Whoever made that selection should be commended."
Any credit goes to Steven Kalafer, a Flemington, N.J., automobile dealer and the owner of the Patriots. And give an assist to John Vukovich, a coach with the Philadelphia Phillies.
"I've known Steve," Lyle said. "My lease was up on my car, and I went to see him about a new car. Steve is good friends with John Vukovich. A couple of years ago I had put my name in through Vukovich for the bullpen coach's job in Philadelphia. They said no, they wanted to stay in their organization. That's about as far as it went.
"I guess when Steve was talking to Vukovich, he said I have this ball club, I need a manager. John said: 'You know Sparky. What about Sparky?' I go to pick up my truck, and Steve said, 'I want to talk to you when you get all your paperwork done.' "
Lyle said his time since his playing days has been spent "beating around, doing all these personal appearances."
"It'll be a different thing having a real job," he added.
Lyle acknowledged that he had not given managing any serious thought. "It was too far out of the realm," he said. "I was not going to go hop around Double A and Triple A, gaining experience, so to speak, to get a job in the big leagues. I felt that was pretty well closed to me."
One of Lyle's immediate worries is about flashing his players signals. "I'm concerned about giving signs because I use my left hand so much," he said. "I told Bud Harrelson: 'I know you guys are going to steal signs. I can't use my right hand.' "
Does that mean Lyle plans to coach third base? "I'm sure I will," he said.
"Oh, my!" Tidrow said at the thought of Lyle standing in the coach's box. "This is going to be exciting. That would be fun to watch in itself."
It would be fun, too, watching Lyle attempt to become a disciplinarian, but that is not likely to happen. "Jim Fregosi asked me who's going to check curfew," Lyle said, referring to the unemployed major league manager. "He said, 'You're gonna be out.' "
His pals don't expect the job to change Lyle's behavior and outlook.
"He's going to be Sparky," Randolph said. "He's not going to deviate from enjoying life."
Does this mean the Patriots will have a nightly or weekly promotion for fans to bring cakes to games, to see which one Lyle sits on? That was one of Lyle's favorite out-of-uniform clubhouse pastimes when he played for the Yankees.
"They brought that up the other day," Lyle said. "Of all the things I accomplished, I'll never live that down. I just told everyone I'm in therapy. I'm not allowed to have birthday cakes."
 
 
 
Randolph Wants a Chance
 Speaking of managing, Willie Randolph hopes to do that soon, not in the Atlantic League, but in the majors.
"It's time for me to step out and let people know in what direction I want to go," said the Yankees' third-base coach. "I do want to manage. I've had three seasons as a coach. I think I've proven myself. I don't want to coach third base the rest of my life. I'm looking to challenge myself and move up."
Randolph, who has no managerial experience, said he would not necessarily refuse an opportunity to manage in the minor leagues.
"I'd have to look at the situation and see if it's right for my family," he said. "Sometimes they throw that on you as a way of holding you back."
He then cited Lou Piniella, Don Baylor, Ray Knight and Larry Dierker, current major league skippers who never managed in the minors. "I wouldn't say flat-out no," Randolph said, "but if I felt I was ready to move in, I would do that."
Randolph, 42, said he has "played for some of the best managers in the last 20 years."
"I've always taken notes and learned, playing games in my own mind."
 
 
 
One for the Home Team
 Jack Morris began the parade in 1991. Dave Winfield followed two years later. Paul Molitor got in line last year. Now, Terry Steinbach has become the latest player to go home to Minnesota.
"It's sure not the weather, I'll tell you that," said Tom Kelly, the Twins' manager. "I don't know what it is. The chance to play in front of family and friends, for the team they grew up watching, for stability."
Steinbach, who could have earned more money had he remained in Oakland, grew up in one Minnesota town, has lived in another and is building a house in another. Morris, Winfield and Molitor were born and raised in St. Paul. Winfield, Molitor and Steinbach went to the University of Minnesota.
"We could put together an all-star team," Kelly said. "It's great that we've had people wanting to come back here and play for the hometown team. Kent Hrbek led the way with that by wanting to play in his hometown. But I think we're running out of people."

HEADLINE: Caseworkers Aren't Sabotaging Welfare Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bradley R. Schiller argues that welfare reform efforts are being undermined by discretionary exemptions from work requirements (Op-Ed, Jan. 28). The reason, he asserts, is that "the army of social workers who carry out welfare at the local level is by and large liberal." 
 During my time as a caseworker in Boston, any client who exhibited even modest competence was sent off to job training and so-called opportunities. Most clients were unemployable: illiterate, pathological or overwhelmed by the stress of caring for extended families. Exemption decisions reflected caseworkers' practical judgment, not politics.
Mr. Schiller perpetuates the myths that most people on welfare are living a life of ease at taxpayer expense. Let him study the decisions of caseworkers where they are made and he'll see the reality: the chaotic lives of the desperately poor.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: QUEENS UP CLOSE -- BOROUGH REPORT;
The State of Queens

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
In her annual State of the Borough address delivered last week at the Queens Theater in the Park, Borough President Claire Shulman said unemployment in the county was down, infrastructure and library projects were under way and thousands of new seats had been created to ease overcrowding in the public schools -- although that remains one of Queens's most troubling problems.
"Our borough's schools remain among the most overcrowded in the city," she told an audience of about 500, including a half-dozen Giuliani appointees, among them Police Commissioner Howard Safir. "Thirty thousand seats are needed, and we have no capacity." 

 
POINT BY POINT -- Here is a look at other items from the report, which reviewed changes in the borough in 1996:
JOBS -- The unemployment rate in Queens was 7.4 percent in 1996, well below the citywide rate of 8.3 percent. Mrs. Shulman said 1,200 jobs had been created with the opening of Caldor's in Glen Oaks, Toys "R" Us in Jamaica and Sears and Marshall's in Rego Plaza Park.
CRIME -- The murder rate in Queens dropped 33 percent to 1996 from 1995 and motor vehicle theft, a perennial problem in the borough, fell by 15 percent over the same period and was down nearly 50 percent from 1993. Arson fires have decreased by nearly 25 percent.
SCHOOLS -- Among the new schools completed in 1996 are Public School 43 in Far Rockaway, with a 1,200-student capacity; Intermediate School 5 in Elmhurst, also with 1,200 students, and the Occupational Training Center, a 500-student vocational school in Elmhurst.
LIBRARIES -- Construction of the new $30 million Flushing Library is under way, and new libraries are planned for South Jamaica and Cambria Heights.
HOUSING -- Fifty-two of the 100 units planned for the Allen-Hall Estates project in South Jamaica were finished in 1996, and 25 of the 200 units planned for a development in Hallets Cove, near Long Island City, were completed. CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercedes-Benz SLK230;
Retro and Retractable

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
AUTOMOTIVELY speaking, I was born a generation too late.
Having grown up yearning to be behind the wheel of an MG or a Triumph, I instead found myself wallowing around in a decade-old 1961 Chevrolet Bel Air, my first car. But finally, and especially in the last year, I have been able to live out the dreams of my youth in several new vehicles with strong ties to great sporting cars of the past: the Jaguar XK8, which echoes the sensuous E-Type Jaguars of the 1960's; the BMW Z3, which recalls the 507 roadster of the 50's with its gill-like side vents, and even the Pontiac Grand Prix GTP, which is reminiscent of the wide-track Pontiacs that cruised American boulevards in the 60's. 
 Most recently I have been in the driver's seat of the Mercedes-Benz SLK230, which just went on sale in the United States. My automotive fantasies came true once again.
The SLK's introduction opens a second chapter of what promises to be a modern automotive love story. The stars are sexy European roadsters like the Z3, a phenomenal success since it made its premiere last spring (and now available with a more potent six-cylinder engine that answers criticisms that the car was underpowered). The trend continues with the Porsche Boxster, which is reaching showrooms now.
Mercedes executives in North America already believe they have produced a superstar with the SLK, and I'm convinced they are right. The company originally intended to send to the United States 5,000 of the 35,000 cars produced in Germany in 1997, then increased the number to 6,000. Every one is expected to disappear as soon as it reaches the showroom, and many dealers have long waiting lists.
Mercedes is positioning the SLK as an innovative roadster that represents, despite its $40,000 price tag, a good value. Its styling and design touches are intended to be reminiscent of SL roadsters of the 1950's.
The styling is alluring indeed. The car got raves in my suburban neighborhood, and women in particular seemed smitten by the calypso-green test car.
Nearly a foot and a half shorter than Mercedes' high-dollar SL roadsters, which begin at $80,000, the SLK is more youthful and more sporty, though it is not a sports car like its rival from Porsche. The car's proportions and styling cues, particularly the bulges in the hood, hark to the past. But the SLK comes in MTV Generation colors like Bahama blue. One interior hue -- a vibrant red -- is called "salsa."
The SLK's most distinctive feature is an automatic retractable hardtop -- which is also a retro touch, since it recalls the Ford Skyliner retractables of the late 1950's. With the top up, the SLK feels like a coupe. But wait 25 seconds. With the push of a red button on the console, the metal top folds like an accordion into the trunk, magically creating a convertible. Unfortunately, as often seems the case when I have possession of a convertible, the top was raised and lowered little during my week-long test drive in the snow. But no matter what position the top was in, the SLK was extremely quiet.
As attractive as the SLK's exterior is, the interior is my favorite part of the car. The designers skillfully blended retro cues with thoroughly modern touches. The round gauges, trimmed with chrome, have black numbers on white backgrounds, and the red needles glow a warm orange at night. The face of the center console is not the ubiquitous polished wood, but a modern woven material that resembles the carbon fiber used in the aerospace industry.
I felt more comfortable in the SLK than I have ever been in a Mercedes. Typically, my short stature requires that my seat be so close to the steering wheel that my knees rub against the bolsters under the dash. That was not the case in the SLK. With the multiple seat adjustments and a telescopic steering wheel, I was able to find an ideal driving position. And tall drivers said they had ample headroom and legroom.
Despite the car's diminutive size -- it is just two inches longer than a Mazda Miata and a bit shorter than the Z3 -- the interior does not feel claustrophobic. But with two occupants, there is no room in the cabin for even a briefcase. The trunk is roomy for a roadster when the top is up; when it is down, the cargo bay is reduced to 5 cubic feet.
The SLK is much more than an interesting design exercise. It is every bit as much fun to drive as its appearance suggests.
The rear-drive SLK, which stands for sportlich, leicht and kompakt (sporty, light and small), is powered by a four-cylinder, dual-overhead-cam engine with a displacement of 2.3 cubic liters. With the boost of a supercharger (which accounts for the Kompressor badge on the front fenders), the engine is rated at 185 horsepower. The acceleration is quite respectable, and the fuel economy (21 miles a gallon in town, 27 on the highway) is reasonable.
A five-speed electronically controlled automatic, which adapts its shifting patterns to the style of the driver, is the only transmission available. A five-speed manual may be added later.
While the ride is comfortable for cruising around town or speeding along highways, the SLK is fun to fling around on curvy country roads. (Indeed, the car registered the second-fastest speed ever in a slalom test by Road & Track magazine, trailing only the Ferrari F355. The slalom, in which cars are driven through eight cones set 100 feet apart, indicates how well a car can be controlled in quick maneuvers.)
Unlike virtually all convertibles, the solidly built SLK has not a hint of body shake even on rough gravel roads.
The SLK is packed with standard equipment, and safety is a priority. The SLK has side air bags in addition to dual front air bags and integrated rollover bars. A child-seat-recognition system disables the passenger air bag when it detects the presence of a new type of child safety seat -- an industry first intended to prevent children from being injured by the rapid inflation of a bag in an accident. Other SLK features include seat belts with retractors that tighten in microseconds in emergencies, strong anti-lock brakes, automatic traction control, heated windshield washers, retractable heated headlamp washers and an antitheft alarm system with an engine immobilizer.
If you consider that the Mercedes SL320 roadster costs twice as much, the SLK's price seems fair. Only three options are available: metallic paint at $595; heated seats at $600, and a package that includes a compact disk changer and cellular phone at $1,495. A Sport package, similar to one introduced last year for the SL-Class, will eventually be available.
The SLK is part of a new Mercedes corporate strategy to deliver not only engineering excellence and safety innovations, but to generate more emotional appeal than its cars have stirred in the past. Indeed, the SLK stirs passions, whether one is behind the wheel or just looking over its clean lines.
The company expects loyal Mercedes owners to add the SLK to their household fleets. But it also hopes to attract first-time buyers in their 30's, and a lot of women.
I only wish I were one of them.
 
INSIDE TRACK: One more time, with feeling.

Fix the C.P.I.? After You
Politicians are noisy sorts, ever willing to rant and rave on nice safe topics like coddling prisoners. Utter two little words, though, and they'll clam up in an instant: Social Security. You hear more and more these days that the Consumer Price Index -- which dictates the increases in retirees' checks -- badly overstates inflation, costing Uncle Sam and Aunt Samantha hundreds of billions of dollars. But fix the index? Political suicide. What of the Administration? It will consider it, it says, if there's a consensus. After you -- no, no, after you -- and politicians pile up in the doorway. Last week, though, Alan Greenspan said, in effect, get on with it. Fix the index, quickly. He may be the only person around with both the nerve to speak up and the weight to get things moving.
 
STOCK MARKET
Crash? File Under 'History'
Are stock-market crashes ancient history? Today's investors must think so. Why else would they send prices higher and higher, entrusting their futures to this huge poker game? (There is even talk of putting Social Security money into stocks.) The idea of a price collapse is treated as distant, dusty, "can't happen again" history. If you doubt it, consider this: the New York Stock Exchange ticker tape for the first few minutes of trading on Oct. 29, 1929, was just sold for $5,000 to the Museum of American Financial History. On that fateful day, it seems, a Boston broker sensed that something historic was happening -- it was -- and squirreled the tape away. "It can't happen again, it can't happen again," Dorothy says, clicking her heels frantically.
 
INDEXED BONDS
Take That, Inflation!
So here's your choice: You can bet that stocks will keep up their run, or you can turn to something teddy-bear safe like Treasury bonds. Until now, the second choice seemed foolish: not only would you get meager returns, but inflation could knock you for a loop at any moment. Last week, with the advent of inflation-indexed bonds, it suddenly looked a lot less foolish. Yes, the return will be meager -- 3.4 percent now -- but that's a real, after-inflation return, guaranteed for 10 years. If prices rise, the value of your bond moves higher in lock step. Considering the tax angle, though -- you pay tax on your whole return, even the part you don't see for 10 years -- the bonds may be most appropriate for tax-deferred retirement accounts.
 
BANKING
Giving, on Credit
The Roman Catholic Church is often accused of being behind the times -- on, say, women's rights. But in one area, it's at the forefront -- at least at San Claudio's Church in Leon, in northern Spain. San Claudio's, recognizing that "the age of plastic money" is upon us, has installed a bank machine in its entryway. No, it's not an A.T.M., exactly -- you give it money, not the other way around. Just pop in your bank or credit card, punch in what you want to donate -- and presto! The church gets its money without risk of theft, and you keep your privacy -- and have a receipt to show the tax collector. A local newspaper couldn't resist the headline "Through Visa Toward God."
 
TOBACCO
891 Billion Cigarettes
In the fourth quarter, Philip Morris had net income of $1.47 billion, mainly because of growth in its international tobacco business that, in one analyst's words, "defies gravity." In those three months, it sold 891 billion cigarettes -- about 156 for every human on the planet.
 
SUPER BOWL ADVERTISING
Men Behaving Strangely
This, as the millennium looms, is the glorious height to which humans have evolved: a bunch of guys in bumpy outfits with numbers on them smash into one another for a couple of hours, occasionally throwing a ball around, and fully half -- yes, half! -- of the nation's population feels compelled to watch on TV. And advertisers spent, for the first time, more than $100 million -- a record $1.2 million, on average, for 30 seconds -- to entertain these cheering masses with such uplifting fare as soft drinks throwing street parties. This is evolution?
 
'STAR WARS' INC.
The Force Gets a Paint Job
How times have changed. It used to be that 20-year-old movies were relegated to the faded, flickering depths of, say, Manhattan's old Thalia or Regency theaters. But that was before the age of -- need one say it? -- "Star Wars." Yes, "age." The "Star Wars" series is no one-year or one-decade phenomenon. No way. With T-shirts and all, it's a $4 billion business -- even before "Star Wars" blasted into theaters last week, dusted off, redigitized, respectacularized, whatever it is George Lucas and his techie buddies do out on that California ranch. It'll make millions, of course -- perhaps $100 million. But that's a drop in the galaxy. This is all part of a master plan, with more merchandise, more marketing -- all building to that long-awaited next trilogy in 1999.
 
BUDGETS
Miracle of the Ballot Box
What an astounding coincidence. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, after three tightfisted years, announced a preliminary budget last week that included his first overall increase in city spending and his fewest reductions in services. Practically as he spoke, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman -- a highly visible champion of slashing government spending -- proposed her own budget, one that increases spending for public schools and the environment. Could it, by chance, have anything to do with election calendars?
 
TECHNOLOGY
90's Taxes, 60's Computers
What pays most of this country's bills? Simple: $1.4 trillion in taxes. So considering how vital this money is, the I.R.S. surely has the best, most up-to-date computers around, right? Sadly, no. It has a crazy quilt of systems, some dating to the dark ages of the 60's -- and often those computers can't even trade information with one another. The agency recently spent $4 billion to make it all better, but last week it conceded that the system still didn't work, threw up its ink-stained hands, and proposed contracting out some processing of returns. And farewell privacy.
 
CYBERMESS
America on Hold
Yes, yes, this is a painful coming-of-age period in the exploding on-line world -- someday (really!) things will get worked out. Right now, though, confusion piles atop confusion. Last week America Online, which had opened the electronic floodgates with its all-you-can-eat pricing, responded to the inevitable gridlock with an offer to compensate subscribers who couldn't dial in. Try to call for that refund, though, and guess what? You get put on hold. (We spend increasing chunks of our day, it seems, either on hold or trying in vain to fit our particular needs to the touch-tone choices allotted us.) So, what next at America Online? Probably a new number to call to complain about the busy refund number. Think you'll get through?

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Business Diary column last Sunday about the fourth-quarter results for Philip Morris misstated the period in which the company sold 891 billion cigarettes. It was all of 1996, not the final quarter.

For Mohawks, Casino Dream Is Still Alive

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION, N.Y.

 BODY:
A STEADY stream of cars and four-by-fours pours in and out of the Bear's Den gas station, as though it offers some sort of wonder everyone must experience. And in a way, of course, it does.
Gas at the Bear's Den starts at $1.24 a gallon, 20 cents less than at the Mobil station a few miles down the road in St. Lawrence County. This is making the Bear's Den one very popular place, even while there is half a foot of snow on the ground and roads so slippery they send macho trucks spinning into ditches. 
 Though not much in the way of a scenic attraction, the Bear's Den and a handful of other stations on the St. Regis Mohawks' land are bringing the tribe on the United States-Quebec border a much-needed sense of security. Alma Ransom, chief of the Mohawk Tribal Council, says she doesn't know what the Mohawks would do without them. "The gas stations and the tax-free cigarettes are the only thing keeping us alive," she said. "If we didn't have them, there'd be a lot more people out of work."
 ON this land of gnarled forests and wild, wind-swept fields, the St. Regis Mohawks are weathering hard times. Unemployment, always high, hovers somewhere around 50 percent. There are small businesses -- crafts shops, diners, restaurants, convenience stores -- dotting the roads within the reservation, but all together, obviously not enough.
Now, the ailing Mohawks are in an unusual position. Over the last week, this remote 7,000-member tribe has been transformed by Catskill resort owners into the last best hope for the Borscht Belt's economic salvation. When the State Senate defeated a bill that would have allowed a statewide referendum on legalizing casinos in the Catskills and other aging resort areas, the Sullivan County business owners turned to their Plan B: a casino agreement with the St. Regis Mohawks to run a gaming hall at the Monticello Raceway.
Cliff Erlich, a co-president of the race track, said "Mohawk" has become the buzzword throughout the county. "When the bill was defeated," he said, "the entire county was in shock. Then everybody started calling up the race track and calling me and saying what can we do to bring the Mohawk casino here?"
 THE tribal council says the answer is simple: If Gov. George E. Pataki would just agree to the casino, then the Federal Government would give the O.K. to a 12,000-page land trust application that the tribal council submitted to build a casino in partnership with Watermark Investments Ltd. at the race track.
But it is not that simple. Not everyone in the Catskills supports the Mohawk-Watermark casino. (Some are suspicious of Watermark, which had entered into a deal to build a casino with the Oneida Indians that fell through before it turned to the Mohawks.) Just as important, not all the Mohawks support a casino, either here or in Monticello.
The St. Regis Mohawks know firsthand how divisive the issue of a casino could become. In 1990, two tribal members were killed in fighting over the closing of what the Federal Government called illegal gambling halls on the reservation. Ms. Ransom says the tribe is now united. But at least a third of the tribe does not recognize her council's authority, and divisions about the merits and sins of gambling are still wide open.
"Nothing has changed," said Loran Thompson, at his steakhouse, Loran's, by the St. Lawrence marina. As Mr. Thompson, a former traditional tribal leader, described it, the tribe's three often-competing branches of government are at cross purposes. One, the bank council, is negotiating with Canada to open a casino in Ontario; another, the traditional council, wants a casino only if the council runs it, and the tribal council wants to open at least two casinos.
Some members of the tribe say they are skeptical that the casino issue will be resolved. Teyonienkwatseh, who is 19, unemployed and uses only his traditional name, said his future is probably pumping gas. "I don't think a casino is ever going to open," he said. "We need something that everybody agrees to, and nobody agrees to everything."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Our Towns column last Sunday, about efforts to bring casino gambling to the St. Regis Mohawk Indian reservation, misstated the view of one of the tribe's three governing councils. The column quoted a restaurant owner, Loran Thompson, as saying that the traditional Mohawk council would support a casino as long as the council ran it. The traditional council officially opposes casino gambling, according to its administrator, Joyce Mitchell.

 BODY:

Behind the Oval Office
 Winning the Presidency in the Nineties.
 By Dick Morris.
 359 pp. New York:
 Random House. $25.95. 
 "BEHIND THE OVAL OFFICE" tells several stories. The rise of Dick Morris from New York City pol to sophisticated pollster to Presidential adviser to disgraced john is one. The behind-the-scenes story of the making of policy in the White House is another. President Clinton's transformation from unpopular captive of liberals to victorious New Democrat is a third. But its most persuasive story seems almost inadvertent: the extraordinary dominance of television, and the money to pay for it, in Presidential politics.
Thus, in Mr. Morris's view, the "key to Clinton's victory" wasn't the President's track record, wasn't the economy, wasn't the Republican-led Government shutdown, wasn't Bob Dole's age. It was Mr. Clinton's "early television advertising. There has never been anything even remotely like it in the history of Presidential elections," Mr. Morris writes. Spending a staggering $85 million, he exults, "We created the first fully advertised Presidency in U.S. history." No wonder Mr. Clinton had to consort with wealthy foreigners.
The television ad campaign had to "begin early, be continual, stress the same themes week after week, and above all, not be jammed or countered by the press." While the campaign blitzed most Americans with three ads a week, it deliberately avoided New York, Washington and Los Angeles, because of these cities' concentrations of national news media. Mr. Morris is positively gleeful that he succeeded so well -- "a brutal comment on the free media's limitations." He is less forthcoming about why it was so important that the "free" (as opposed to "paid") media be kept in the dark. Perhaps he feared scrutiny of the accuracy of these ads (a subject he discusses only glancingly), or media claims that voters were being manipulated. But surely none of that would have stopped the juggernaut he describes.
Mr. Morris, as befits a pollster, seems to have the numbers to back up his assertion that television turned the Clinton Presidency around. He notes that during all of 1996, a time when the President's poll-inspired agenda and re-crafted image were being relentlessly driven home through television advertising, his popularity remained constant. "Through Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Hillary's supposed seances, three terrorist bombings, reversals in the Middle East, the Republican primaries, the Republican Convention -- through all the ups and downs of Clinton's Presidency in 1996, the numbers remained basically the same."
Given television's importance, it's hardly surprising that the science of Q ratings, the instant polling long used by the networks to determine everything from a star's hairdo to plot twists, has been carried to its logical absurdity. Mr. Morris insisted that Mr. Clinton take a hiking vacation, even though the prospect bored the President, because polls show swing voters like hiking and the outdoors. When polls demonstrated that voters opposed teen-age smoking, Mr. Morris pressed Mr. Clinton to go on the offensive against the tobacco industry, even though the President worried about the repercussions in states like North Carolina and Kentucky. These are just two of what seem innumerable examples, the most revealing of which may be the account of Mr. Clinton's sweeping "values" agenda, the philosophical underpinnings of the second half of his first term.
Like so much else in the Clinton Presidency, this agenda began with a poll. (Mr. Morris reports that the President doesn't have time to read newspapers, but would "start his day with a summary of the latest polling information.") On one occasion, Mr. Morris's pollsters asked five "so-called values questions":
1. Do you believe that sex before marriage is wrong?
2. Do you believe that homosexuality is morally wrong?
3. Is religion very important in your life?
4. Do you personally ever look at pornography?
5. Do you look down on people who have affairs outside of their marriage?
Mr. Morris doesn't say who may have been present when these questions were answered -- spouses and children, for example -- but given their wording, it's hardly surprising that the answers suggested that "a third of the country was socially conservative" and "another third answered conservatively to three of the five." Mr. Morris's conclusion: "We had to get the values voters back."
In short order, the values agenda emerged as public policy. Mr. Clinton ordered his Secretary of Education to promote "religious observance and moral values on public-school grounds." He called for the wearing of school uniforms and denounced violence on television. He immediately embraced and then signed the Republican-inspired Defense of Marriage Act, permitting states to outlaw same-sex marriages. "Over the months, the focus of the Administration shifted more and more to values," Mr. Morris concludes with evident satisfaction.
All of this is narrated without the slightest hint of irony, even though Mr. Morris was seeing a prostitute at that very time. How would Mr. Morris himself have answered the "values questions" his pollsters put such store in? For that matter, how would Mr. Clinton? After the tabloid Star revealed Mr. Morris's affair just as the Democratic Convention was getting under way, he saw no reason to resign from the Clinton campaign. Mr. Morris tells us that Erskine Bowles, then deputy chief of staff, visited him in his Chicago hotel room to discuss his resignation.
"I was shocked, hurt and devastated" at the suggestion he resign, Mr. Morris writes. "I recognized the seriousness of the situation, but still hoped that somehow I could stay. 'Why?' I asked. 'What the hell did I do that he wasn't accused of doing in the exact same magazine four years ago?'
" 'You've admitted it's true,' Bowles replied." In the Clinton inner sanctum, truth is evidently the one unforgivable sin.
Hypocrisy aside, the entire values agenda and all the polling to support it would have been wastes of time and money unless they could be exploited on television, which is where the $85 million came in. "We formulated each ad according to our polling," Mr. Morris reports. The ads themselves, before being broadcast, were tested with shoppers in malls to assess their impact. At first, poll questions were cleared with President Clinton. But as time passed, Mr. Morris reports, "he let us proceed on our own." Thus the initiation of the entire chain of polling/ policy/television advertising seems largely to have passed out of the President's hands -- and Mr. Morris acknowledges that questions can be worded to produce almost any desired result. Is it any wonder that in Mr. Clinton we have a President who seems more interested in polling and advertising than he does in governing? Or that the likes of Dick Morris would have ended up as Clinton's closest adviser? ("I don't think any President has ever had someone as close as you are to me," Mr. Clinton tells him.)
That I find all of this profoundly depressing is no criticism of Mr. Morris's book, which, as best I can tell, delivers on his promise to write "simply the truth about my role in a series of extraordinary events." As the first of the Clinton White House insiders to publish his memoirs, Mr. Morris reveals much new detail, if no shocking disclosures. The portraits of Bill and Hillary Clinton are hardly uniformly flattering, with the President's childish temper and Mrs. Clinton's cold vengefulness amply on display (though it was Mrs. Clinton who was most compassionate about Dick Morris's demise). The portrait of Mr. Morris's rival and the President's former deputy chief of staff, Harold Ickes, is scathing, and George Stephanopoulos fares only slightly better. One can only sympathize with Mr. Clinton as he presides over what seems like endless backstabbing and squabbling by his White House staff.
And Mr. Morris succeeds in demonstrating his own real contributions, as he moves steadily from pollster to adviser. He percolates with ideas, all of which seem well intentioned if occasionally unsound, an amazing number of which were embraced by Mr. Clinton. As the President said on "The Newshour With Jim Lehrer" after Mr. Morris's resignation, "What I miss the most is his creativity, his ideas, his energy -- he would come up with lots of ideas. I'd go through them and pick the ones I wanted and discard the others, but I miss his ideas."
"Behind the Oval Office" suffers badly, if understandably, from Morriscentrism. We never hear anyone else's version of events, especially Mr. Clinton's. Mr. Morris's emphasis on polling and its implementation in policy and on television may ultimately demean both Mr. Clinton and the Presidency. But Mr. Morris, humbled by his recent public downfall, does not seem boastful. He has written an account that future historians of the Clinton Presidency will not be able to ignore.
Toward the end of his tenure, Mr. Morris invites Mr. Clinton to discuss with him the President's place in history, suggesting somewhat bluntly that he places Mr. Clinton only in the "third tier" of Presidents, and a borderline third tier at that. First tier, he suggests, a ranking he accords Washington, Lincoln and F.D.R., may be unattainable, requiring as it does crises of historic significance. Second tier -- where Mr. Morris places Jackson, Polk and Ronald Reagan -- may be possible, but in what seems an extraordinary concession for a professional pollster, Mr. Morris opines that "popularity doesn't get you on the list." Neither, he notes, does a strong economy, a nation at peace or a lower crime rate. What does? Great deeds: "Big things."
Mr. Morris doesn't say so, but the great deeds of our history -- Lincoln's freeing the slaves, Johnson's civil rights legislation, even Reagan's defense buildup to hasten the end of the cold war -- required strong leadership and a sense of underlying justice in the face of intense opposition, in many cases from members of both parties. These Presidents "triangulated," to use Mr. Morris's favorite phrase, not by moving to the center but by moving away from it, even at the risk of great unpopularity. Without benefit of hindsight, these steps took personal conviction and courage -- a quality Mr. Morris hardly mentions.
By such a standard, welfare reform, balancing the budget and preserving affirmative action, however laudable or politically astute, will not meet the test. Securing civil rights for gay people, including allowing them to serve openly in the military, might. So might overhauling immigration standards and protecting and encouraging those who immigrate. Or, maybe, to mention the politically untouchable, improving the nation's health care and extending its availability.
President Clinton can no longer be re-elected. Perhaps Dick Morris and all he represents have served their purpose.

Making Book on Oprah

BYLINE: By Gayle Feldman; Gayle Feldman writes often about publishing.

 BODY:
LAST fall Oprah Winfrey, the queen of talk television, started an on-air reading club and the book business hasn't been the same since. For 10 years publishers had watched as self-help, inspirational and celebrity titles rose to best-seller status on the tides of telegenic emotion flooding each day across the screens of Ms. Winfrey's 14 million American viewers. Think of "Simple Abundance," "The Soul's Code," "Don't Block the Blessings," "Down in the Garden" and Ms. Winfrey's own "Make the Connection," written with Bob Greene. They all got their sales starts from her.
But the book club has taken her power to sell books to a different level. On Sept. 17, Ms. Winfrey stood up, in save-your-soul evangelist mode, and announced that she wanted "to get the country reading." She told her adoring flock to hasten to the stores to buy the book she had chosen, and a month hence they would discuss it together on the air. 
 "The Deep End of the Ocean," by Jacquelyn Mitchard, was not the easy romance or thriller that might have been predicted. It was a first novel that, to be sure, was a "woman's book," but also serious fiction, the kind that has never glued the nation to its television screens.
An Oprah's Book Club segment typically consists of extracts from a videotaped dinner-party discussion with Ms. Winfrey, the author and four members of the audience; soft-focus, heartstring-tugging biographical tidbits; and a studio chat between Ms. Winfrey and the author, with the dinner participants and audience looking on.
The initial reaction was astonishing. "The Deep End of the Ocean" had been doing very nicely for a first novel; 68,000 copies had gone into the stores since June. But between the last week in August, when Ms. Winfrey told her plans to the publisher, and the September on-air announcement, Viking printed 90,000 more. By the time the discussion was broadcast on Oct. 18, there were 750,000 copies in print. The book became a No. 1 best seller, and another 100,000 have been printed since then.
A business tycoon, Ms. Winfrey is also an attentive student of popular culture and is well aware that reading groups are one of the phenomena of the 90's. The club fulfills her on-air promise to bring higher-level content to her show, and has brought her admiring media attention. The club has also made manifest that Ms. Winfrey is the most powerful book marketer in the United States. On a really good day, she sends more people to bookstores than the morning news programs, the other daytime shows, the evening magazines, radio shows, print reviews and feature articles rolled into one.
Just look at the arithmetic for the next two club selections. At the end of the Mitchard discussion, she told the waiting world to go out and read Toni Morrison's 19-year-old classic, "Song of Solomon." On Nov. 18, when the Morrison segment was broadcast, Jane Hamilton's 1989 novel, "The Book of Ruth," was anointed for January air date (skipping December). More than 985,000 new copies of each have appeared (in combined hardcover and paperback), and each selection in turn became a top-selling fiction paperback.
How does she do it? More women than men buy books, and Miss Winfrey's audience is primarily female; various marketing surveys and the Nielsen market ratings show that her appeal crosses wide educational and income levels. This is reflected in the sales surges she produces, which, booksellers say, defy regional or economic differences, apart from a slight skew in favor of the suburbs and her home base, Chicago. More important, Ms. Winfrey's book club is apparently reaching nonreaders whom nobody and nothing else can touch.
The club segments have not made for great television. Little was said about the plot or significance of the books. Some of the show's executives worried about how the club would be received. Tim Bennett, the president of Ms. Winfrey's Harpo Productions, said he feared losing viewers during the club segments in the second half of the program, but the ratings studies he commissioned proved the contrary. So perhaps the phenomenon is more about Ms. Winfrey than about books.
It is a truth universally acknowledged among serious Oprah watchers that the more intimately she is perceived to identify with a guest or book, the bigger the off-screen payoff. She is a latter-day Dear Abby who can also send women running to the bookstores.
In our brand-name culture, "Oprah" is a brand name, something that publishing houses in America no longer are -- if they ever were. Random House, Doubleday or Viking on a book's spine doesn't signify much. But Oprah signifies a lot, which is why she controls the uses to which her name and image are put, and why publishers of club selections sign contracts specifying how and when the connection can be used.
Do publishers do Ms. Winfrey's bidding? Of course. They are sworn to secrecy about her selections and tremble lest there is a leak that will cause her to change her mind. They cannot use the show's name or logo or a photograph of Ms. Winfrey in their advertisements without prior written approval from Harpo Productions. They are contractually obliged to ask bookstores not to feature displays associating the book with her show until after Ms. Winfrey announces the selection on the air. They jump through whatever hoops she sets up.
The publishers, the bookstore chains and major wholesalers all track the sales of books that she features, sometimes daily. Their shared universe has become awesomely Oprahcentric. The sales she unleashes are especially meaningful now since adult book sales have been stagnant for the past few years.
Of course publishers have long tried to harness television's marketing power to their own ends, cultivating the producers and staff, just as the producers, in this symbiotic relationship, competed to be the first to snag the really "hot" books. But the relationship gradually began to lose symmetry as television's tremendous power to jump-start book sales on a mass scale encouraged publishers' marketing plans to grow more and more television dependent.
Years before the reading club, that dependency was exploited by producers of book segments on programs like the "Today" show who demanded exclusivity, dictated the timing of author appearances and so on. Now, in Ms. Winfrey's latest variation, the relationship between the media and the book industry has reached an extreme. Moreover, Ms. Winfrey has always played by slightly different rules, which have kept her much more firmly in control than other talk-show hosts. Thus when authors appear on other shows, their travel and living expenses are paid for by their publishers, but guests of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" are flown to Chicago and accommodated there by Harpo Productions.
Her dominance has gradually been consolidated in other ways, too. It used to be that for "regular" (as opposed to book club) appearances a publisher could suggest a book to one of her producers and see a segment built around it. Now, typically, an author or publisher receives a call from a knowledgeable staffer who knows exactly what she wants. But after a segment is taped, it is never certain when or whether the edited segment will appear.
Only the publisher of a reading club selection is given a firm air date several weeks in advance. And Ms. Winfrey's club choices will not be influenced by publishers' suggestions, but will be purely personal, made behind closed doors in consultation with her staff.
So major publishers now spend even more time and energy on strategies for cultivating Ms. Winfrey and her staff, to get their authors chosen to appear with her. They are delighted by the sales she stimulates, awed by the control she exercises and obsessed by how to find ways to whisper in her ear.
But if Ms. Winfrey doesn't listen to the publishers, she is very attentive to her audience's interests. After "The Deep End of the Ocean" was chosen and viewers complained about the cost of a new hardcover book, she asked the paperback publisher of "The Book of Ruth," Anchor/Doubleday, to donate 10,000 copies to libraries. A hardcover edition of "Solomon" was repriced from $26 to $18.95.
Ms. Winfrey says the club will continue at least through August (the next selection is "She's Come Undone," by Wally Lamb). Before the club was a factor, a publisher lamented to me, "Can you imagine if Coke sales depended on getting on 'Oprah'?" That says a lot about the work publishers and booksellers need to do better, as well as the formidable problems in bringing some 40,000 new trade books to market every year.
When the usefulness and pleasure and sheer importance of reading are remote to many, Ms. Winfrey, the high priestess of self-help, has laudably reminded millions of the rewards that can come from reading a good book. She has also made herself into yet another gatekeeper for the book to pass through, and the power of that position frightens some. The feverish obeisance that she exacts and is paid by those who produce and sell books says a lot about how distorted our book culture, like so much else, has become.

THE STATE OF THE NATION
 Government and the Quest for a Better Society.
 By Derek Bok.
 483 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $35. 
 That American public policies differ substantially from those of other advanced industrialized democracies has been well documented by observers of American exceptionalism for many decades. The liberal political theorist Louis Hartz, asking why there is no socialism in America, answered that Americans were "born equal." Lacking European class distinctions, the United States had neither the radical labor movements nor the hidebound conservatives who spawned them. The absence of a serious socialist party accounted for the fact that the American welfare state developed later and was smaller than its European counterparts. American individualism and distrust of state authority left much more up to private initiative in virtually all public policy areas save education.
Much of the literature on American exceptionalism written in the 1960's and 70's assumed that the European welfare state, with its high wages and extensive social protections, constituted a norm for civilized societies and assumed that the United States would eventually conform to that standard. Derek Bok, a former president of Harvard University, has written a book that fits squarely within this tradition. Like critics of American public policies from a generation ago, he concludes that we are far behind the Europeans and need a larger, albeit more efficient, government to solve our many social problems.
"The State of the Nation" is an extensively researched compendium of statistical data on how the nation compares with other industrialized countries, in areas ranging from economic growth, competitiveness and science to education, health care, the environment, crime, occupational safety, poverty and the arts. The data, while up-to-date and admirably comprehensive, do not contain any major surprises. The postwar period during which Europe and Japan were rapidly catching up with the United States in terms of gross domestic product (measured per capita) and productivity is now over; in the 1990's, the United States has maintained and in some cases widened its competitive lead. Whereas Europe has persistent high unemployment rates but more equal income distribution, this country has nearly full employment and increasing disparities between rich and poor. But, despite the problems of inner-city communities, African-Americans (particularly women) have been closing the gap between them and their white counterparts quite impressively.
The areas in which the United States does not compare favorably are familiar: violent crime, health care, long-term disability, protection of mothers and children, and poverty. Americans, while feeling overtaxed, pay substantially less tax than Europeans, and Washington consequently undertakes much less in terms of worker retraining, maternity leave, day care, health insurance and programs to aid the unemployed and poor. Primary and secondary education, once superior in America, has deteriorated. Mr. Bok believes that these problems could be successfully addressed by more activist public policies, which the United States could easily afford.
Consider the last proposition first. A generation ago, when European unemployment rates were lower than ours, it was plausible to argue that we could trade a bit of growth for more equality. Today, with globalization, the price has risen considerably, and it will continue to do so. For Continental Europe, the rate of unemployment below which it is impossible to go without triggering substantial inflation pressures is easily double that of the United States, while rates of youth unemployment in countries like France reach 25 percent or more. European policies aimed at raising wages and increasing job security have killed new job growth. While the American economy added 18 million net jobs in the Reagan years and more than 10 million since the 1991 recession, the entire European Union has seen an employment gain of about 1 million in the same period. And the inability to hire new workers restrains European competition in fields like information technology and biotechnology, dominated by small American start-up companies.
Mr. Bok counters that the relationship between the size of welfare states and unemployment in Europe is still being debated among economists. Not to be deterred by uncertainty, he advocates stronger unions and German-style works councils. Other proposals -- better state-financed preschools and day care, longer maternity leaves, more support for the arts -- are unobjectionable, but their value has to be weighed against future growth and employment.
Apart from economic concerns, there is a broader question about what government can do in America. Mr. Bok would have done well to consult Seymour Martin Lipset, the most thoughtful contemporary authority on American exceptionalism, on the way in which our public policies are deeply rooted in basic American values. Mr. Bok misunderstands their role when he says Americans don't value crime, poverty or expensive health care. What Americans do want is consumer choice, social mobility and freedom from authority -- not just of government but families, neighbors, clerics and bosses. So it is not surprising that they get a wealthy, entrepreneurial, dynamic country -- but also more crime, litigation, broken families, job insecurity and unnecessarily legalistic regulation.
Mr. Bok notes that individual liberty, underwritten by an activist judiciary, is more advanced in the United States than anywhere else. He also notes that the decline in personal responsibility, as measured by factors like broken families, deadbeat fathers and cheating, is correspondingly more severe. He briefly entertains the notion that the two phenomena might be related, and should perhaps have pondered this question more closely. The sphere of individual liberty has expanded dramatically in a couple of generations at the expense of community and of institutions from the family to the state, and the rights revolution has been both cause and consequence. Mr. Bok's work, for all of its statistics, provides less insight into what is really bothering Americans than a book like "The Lost City," by Alan Ehrenhalt, which describes in rich detail the decline of community life in Chicago. These conflicting demands for ever-increasing liberty and stable community are key to present-day American discontents, and as value issues are largely beyond the reach of any public policy.

HEADLINE: Now Refashion U.S.-Caribbean Economic Tie

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 30 front-page article on the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement on the Caribbean and the failure of the United States Government to enact legislation to remedy this situation underscores an urgent problem. 
 In the past few years, American-Caribbean relations have been squeezed as foreign and trade policies have shifted American resources elsewhere.
Foreign aid levels to the region have dropped by more than 50 percent since 1985, and last year Congress eliminated a provision in the United States tax code that generated more than $2 billion in low-interest loans for the region over the last decade.
More recently, the United States and the European Union agreed to eliminate tariffs on American rum imports from non-Caribbean countries. Yet when Caribbean countries ask for similar treatment on some of our most valuable exports -- like apparel made from American fabric -- our requests were rebuffed.
As you note, the United States has benefited significantly from its relationship with the Caribbean.
The Caribbean is now the United States' 10th largest market for exports. Any economic dislocation of the region will have severe repercussions across many American communities.
Rather than allow the erosion of this relationship to continue, the United States and the Caribbean should find ways to fashion a new partnership.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Fallon McElligott drops McDonald's and Leap moves deeper into the Los Angeles market.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TWO prominent Midwestern agencies surprised Madison Avenue with significant moves late last week.
One, Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, is abruptly ending its relationship with the McDonald's Corporation, in part to solve a potential client conflict. The other, the Leap Partnership in Chicago, is raiding the executive ranks at TBWA Chiat/Day for an ambitious expansion into the Los Angeles market. 
 The decision by Fallon Elligott came only 13 months after McDonald's added the agency to its roster to create campaigns for the Arch Deluxe. That sandwich, introduced in May, was the object of the biggest advertising and promotional blitz in fast-food history, with spending estimated at $150 million to $200 million.
It was quite the coup for Fallon McElligott to join the McDonald's roster alongside far larger shops like the Chicago offices of the Leo Burnett Company and the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. Fallon McElligott subsequently landed additional blue-chip clients like the Miller Brewing Company, part of the Philip Morris Companies, and the United Airlines unit of the UAL Corporation.
Why, then, has Fallon McElligott parted with McDonald's? The agency decided to take part in a review for another fast-food account, Domino's Pizza Inc., with billings estimated at $75 million.
Six agencies were invited into the review to pick a successor to Grey Advertising Inc. in New York, which resigned rather than participate. Fallon McElligott is one of three that face conflicts with existing clients, the trade publication Advertising Age reported last week.
"We're grateful for our time with McDonald's," said Pat Fallon, chairman of Fallon McElligott. "It has been a rare professional privilege to represent one of the world's most brilliant brands."
"But we have the opportunity to pursue a prospective client," he added, "where if victorious, we would be able to manage their entire consumer voice in a single agency-brand partnership." In other words, if Fallon McElligott wins, it would be the sole Domino's agency.
"We have been in a quandary about how our role for McDonald's has evolved," said Mark Goldstein, president for integrated marketing at Fallon McElligott. "We signed on as the brand stewards for Arch Deluxe, and at this point we're one more vendor of commercials."
Though "we were working on a whole different assignment in addition to Arch Deluxe," he added, Domino's "was the trigger for a decision that was made anyway."
Fallon McElligott was initially the sole agency for Arch Deluxe. In August, DDB Needham Chicago created an Arch Deluxe commercial, which was followed by one from Burnett. Since September, when McDonald's added three more Deluxe sandwiches, commercials have been produced by all three agencies.
"Certainly one of the disadvantages of being a McDonald's agency is that you might have more agencies involved than you'd like," said Brad A. Ball, senior vice president for United States marketing at McDonald's in Oak Brook, Ill. "But as we asked others to participate on Arch Deluxe, Fallon very much participated in that and understood it."
"I love having Fallon as part of our team," he added, but "when Pat called to tell us about a better business and economic opportunity, I had to understand that as a former agency guy myself." Mr. Ball joined McDonald's in 1995 from Davis, Ball & Colombatto in Los Angeles.
As for whether the Deluxe line has stimulated sluggish sales at domestic McDonald's restaurants, Mr. Ball said: "We've succeeded in our kickoff efforts in attracting awareness and generating trial. It's settled back down to about where we hoped it would be."
Turning to the Leap Partnership, the advertising unit of Leap Group, the expansion will mark its first, well, leap outside Chicago. The new office, named Leap Partnership/Los Angeles, will have seven creative and account executives from the New York and Venice, Calif., offices of TBWA Chiat/Day. The office's genesis echoes the founding of Leap by executives leaving DDB Needham Chicago in 1993.
"To service our accounts properly and recruit new global clients, we needed an expansion plan" that would include West Coast, New York and international offices, said R. Steven Lutterbach, chairman and chief executive at Leap Group. The goal is to land accounts in categories like automobiles, consumer electronics and fast food, he added, to complement clients like Nike Inc. and the U. S. Robotics Corporation.
As for luring a large group from TBWA Chiat/Day all at once, Mr. Lutterbach said, "They decided they wanted to do it together, which made it easier for us." The catalysts, he added, were Steve Rabosky, a creative director in Venice, and Carisa Bianchi, an account director there.
Ms. Bianchi, 38, said: "We've all worked together as a group on a number of projects. It was kind of spontaneous combustion with everybody." She and Mr. Rabosky, 43, will be creative partners and co-managers of Leap/Los Angeles in Santa Monica, Calif.
Three colleagues joining them, all as creative partners, are also from Venice: Steve Erich, 29, an account supervisor there; Chris Graves, 35, a senior art director, and Erik Moe, 32, a copywriter. Two will join from the New York office, also as creative partners: Lorraine Ketch, 33, and Steve Le Neveu, 39, who had been managing partners and executive directors for account planning.
The defections occur as TBWA Chiat/Day plans a reorganization to come after Bob Kuperman, president and chief executive in Venice, is promoted to president of the agency's four North American offices. That promotion is expected soon, the trade publication Adweek reported last week.
"I don't think these people were, how shall we say, satisfied with what we were going to do," Mr, Kuperman said, "so they've decided to go out on their own. We wish them all a lot of luck." There was no thought of modifying the reorganization to accommodate them, he added, because they "had decided to leave."
Mr. Rabosky offered this response: "Nothing made me want to leave. I wanted to do something entrepreneurial, with people I could build a good partnership with."
"If I was that miserable at Chiat/ Day, I would've left a long time ago," he added, laughing. "God knows I've had my opportunities."

HEADLINE: Telemarketing Finds a Ready Labor Market in Hard-Pressed North Dakota

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: LINTON, N.D.

 BODY:
The driving on the Lawrence Welk Highway had deteriorated into whiteout conditions as another blizzard scoured the North Dakota plains. But in a well-heated former tractor showroom, Susan Horner was booking vacations to Hawaii and Florida.
"People ask, 'How are you surviving it up there?' " Mrs. Horner said of the guilt pangs of people who telephoned a reservations center in North Dakota to book sunny vacation trips with Rosenbluth International, the third largest travel company in the world. 
 Calling America's Arctic to book tropical travel may seem incongruous, but for the dairy farmers of this small town the arrival of Rosenbluth on the wings of fiber optic telephone cable has been an economic godsend.
"When this office opened, every fourth business place on Main Street was closed, Linton was headed to becoming a ghost town," said Mrs. Horner, whose husband now milks their 50 cows on his own. "My paycheck makes our house payment and our farm payment."
Telecommunications businesses are transcending geography, searching the outback for pockets of hard-working well-educated people to make hotel reservations, take orders for catalogue companies, process corporate expense accounts or handle panicked calls from owners of new computers.
Omaha has become the "toll-free capital" of the nation, with tens of thousands of people there working in telemarketing. In South Dakota, 5,000 people process credit-card transactions, making that the state's largest industry.
In North Dakota, the explosion of the telecommunications industry has been so sudden, with thousands of jobs added in the last two years, that planners say it may be the way to stop a long-running brain drain.
"A fundamental shift is occurring," said Philip M. Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, a policy and research group in Denver. "For the first time in modern history we have jobs chasing people instead of people chasing jobs. In remote areas like the Dakotas or Montana, you start looking at levels of educational attainment or work ethic, and you find that those states rank among the highest. So companies move out there."
Traditionally, North Dakotans have complained that they have exported their education tax dollars, as well-educated young people leave for jobs elsewhere.
Although the state ranks 49th in teacher pay, the Scholastic Assessment Test scores of high school seniors rank the highest in the nation, according to a study last year in The Harvard Educational Review. The state also boasts an 87 percent graduation rate for high schools, among the nation's highest.
But the population of 638,000 is virtually the same size as it was in the 1920's. One measure of the lack of growth is seen in statistics kept by United Van Lines, the largest moving company. Last year, for every family that the company moved into North Dakota, it moved at least two out.
"We have to create jobs where the younger people can stay and make a good living," said Chuck Stroup, a former banker who is the state's economic development director.
Fiber-optic cable, 4,600 miles worth in the state, may level the playing field, bringing faster and higher quality communications to the northern Plains. In the past two years, telecommunications companies have announced that they were starting or expanding 40 businesses in North Dakota.
In Minot, previously a town known for its Air Force base, 225 people handled 6 million incoming calls last year at a reservation center for Quality Inns. In Minot and Bismarck, 735 people work for Sykes Enterprises, handling troubleshooting calls from buyers of computer equipment and software.
"People here have a real pride in their work, they are generally very well educated, and our absenteeism rate is 2 percent," said Paolo Narciso, who helped open the two Sykes centers last year. "We want to keep this place quiet."
But the secret has leaked out. In 1995, the telecommunications boom contributed to a 1.6-percentage-point drop in the unemployment rate in Bismarck, the second sharpest drop in metropolitan areas.
As North Dakota enjoys the lowest unemployment rate in the country, 1.9 percent, companies move through the countryside searching for the hidden unemployed, largely farm wives or Indians who stopped formally looking for work long ago.
In White Shield, on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, 100 people work as data processers. Thirty people work as telemarketers in Bowbells, a county seat of 498 people near the Canadian border, and dozens more do the same work in Hazen and Beulah, two old railroad towns on the Knife River.
The impact of Rosenbluth International, which has headquarters in Philadelphia and recorded $3 billion in sales last year, can be seen in Linton, seat of Emmons County, where it set up shop in 1988.
In the past the only activity in the area came in the summer, when occasional visitors came through the remote expanse to fish for walleye on the Missouri River or to view the wrought-iron cemetery crosses fashioned by Germans who had earlier settled in southern Russia. Some ventured to Strasburg, 10 miles south, which holds the county's biggest claim to fame, the Lawrence Welk Homestead.
In the 1980's, a punishing cycle of drought and farm foreclosures helped drive down the population by 20 percent. Now 4,800 people remain, scattered over a county that is slightly larger than Rhode Island.
"Rosenbluth came at just the right time," said Duke Rosendahl, a restaurateur who also runs the town development office. "People had to go out and find jobs or lose their farms. We had block after block of 'for sale' signs."
Hal Rosenbluth, the president of the company, said it had put half its reservation centers in North Dakota largely because of the hard-working character of the people there.
"People who have grown up in rural America have participated in self-management," Mr. Rosenbluth said. "They know about getting a job done."
While some outsiders may sniff at the company's $5.15- to $11-an-hour wages, the income goes far in a county where the median monthly rent is $266 and the average monthly mortgage payment is $600. Now the county's largest employer, Rosenbluth also provides family medical insurance, a major cost to self-employed farmers.
"With four girls in braces and glasses, the health benefits have been a big help," said Mrs. Horner, the reservations agent. "It's given us more financial security. We have been able to take the kids on some very nice vacations -- horseback riding in Colorado, flying to Florida."
The company's $2.5 million annual payroll has helped fill empty storefronts in Linton, put late-model cars on the streets and helped turn around a depressed residential real-estate market.
"People have come back to Linton," said the Rosenbluth payroll coordinator, JoAnn Humann. "People are moving here from other parts of the state."

HEADLINE: White House Had Ended System of Checking Foreign Guests

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Ten years ago the Reagan White House adopted a rule about foreign businessmen, lobbyists and consultants who wanted to get in to see the President without the blessing of their embassies: they shouldn't.
But President Clinton's aides did not follow that rule. In their eagerness to raise campaign money, they invited friends of the President's fund-raisers -- including China's biggest arms merchant, favor-seeking Indonesian businessmen, a reputed Russian mobster and other dubiously credentialed dealmakers -- to meet with Mr. Clinton. Nor did the White House check the suitability of Americans invited by the Democratic National Committee to meet the President, allowing, among others, a twice-convicted felon to sip coffee with Mr. Clinton. 
 A senior Administration official now calls the unexamined invitations to foreigners "a huge mistake." That mistake would not have happened had a system set up in 1987 remained in place after Mr. Clinton took office, according to nine present and former White House and National Security Council officials.
When the Iran-contra affair erupted in November 1986, the White House became "a glass house," a Reagan Administration official said. In that fishbowl the National Security Council erected barriers in January 1987 to keep foreign agents away from the President and out of the White House. After years of being beset by favor seekers from abroad -- President Reagan had welcomed a billionaire Japanese war criminal and other questionable visitors during his first six years in office -- the President's aides worked "like a hockey goalie," as one put it, to reject foreigners who sought meetings with the President to further their political or business agendas.
The system evolved in the Bush Administration, former White House aides said. One said that the White House and the National Security Council staff all recognized that "this is a common problem -- people trying to get in to see the boss -- and by getting in to see him, they can represent to others that they got something out of him."
The system was straightforward. The White House chief of staff and the White House counsel's office would notify the National Security Council staff when foreign visitors without introductions from their embassies asked to see the President. The staff would vet the potential visitor, sometimes seeking help from the Central Intelligence Agency.
The questions asked, according to a former Bush Administration official, included: "Who is this guy? What does he want? Is this an appropriate meeting? The value for a foreign individual of saying, 'I just met with the President of the United States,' was substantial and subject to a great deal of mischief." In the end, the visitor might win an appointment to see a member of the National Security Council staff -- but almost never the President.
"I was like the fish in the tank at a Chinese restaurant," recalled one former National Security Council aide. "I was supposed to absorb all the evil."
President Clinton's top aides did not follow that practice. Sometimes the White House would ask the National Security Council staff to check out a foreign visitor -- but more often, it would not.
"The N.S.C. staff was dependent on those in the White House to bring these issues to our attention -- usually the political staff," said David Johnson, a spokesman for the National Security Council. "I'm unaware of anyone from the White House counsel's office bringing those issues to us."
So the National Security Council staff, according to one of its more prominent members, ceased to function as a screening system to prevent potentially embarrassing visitors. By 1994, a year after Mr. Clinton took office, the gatekeeping system erected over the past six years was gone.
Clinton aides now concede that the lack of scrutiny was an error. In retrospect, "the missing link in the system here was some kind of enforcement to make the system work," said a National Security Council official. A system that once had been rigorous became "ad hoc," a senior Administration official said. On Jan. 21, on orders from the new chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, the White House began to re-establish the old system.
All involved now recognize that, as the senior Administration official said, abandoning the old system "was a huge mistake."
And that is why nobody on the White House political team saw fit to ask the National Security Council staff a year ago about a man named Wang Jun, who showed up on a guest list for a White House coffee with the President. The question of exactly how Mr. Wang got into the White House has a simple answer: "Nobody ever asked anybody," a National Security Council official said.
So, at the behest of a tireless political fund-raiser from Arkansas, Charlie Yah Lin Trie, Mr. Clinton wound up sipping coffee with Mr. Wang, who runs the Chinese Government's weapons manufacturing and procuring agency, which is involved in secret arms deals around the world. These coffees for fund-raisers and donors began as a way to raise morale among party loyalists after the Democrats' disastrous showing in the 1994 election. By 1995, they became a way to reward big donors and prospect for new ones, according to Democratic fund-raisers.
It was a personal coup for Mr. Trie to be able to introduce one of the Chinese Government's most powerful officials to the President.
Mr. Wang gained incalculable esteem by seeing the President, said former White House aides knowledgeable about Asian affairs. "Any Asia hand would tell you that is a truly rare commodity -- it's not just face and stature, but the appearance of being extraordinarily well-connected internationally," one said.
The meeting never would have happened in President Bush's Administration, contends one of Mr. Bush's aides. "The guy would not have passed the smell test," he said. "I don't recall a situation where a political contributor was bringing in a foreign national to see the President. An appearance of a White House connection or influence could be misunderstood in business or diplomatic terms. And the campaign element -- it would look like this kind of access was being bought and paid for."
Another former Bush Administration official said that in his day, "there was an ethos or an ethic that this was a potentially perilous situation to place the President in."
"Discretion required that such a meeting not take place," the official said.
Under such a rule an invitation would not have been extended to Carlos Mersan, chief economic adviser to the President of Paraguay, whose economy is in large part based on the smuggling of high-tech goods. He was invited to the White House by Mark Jimenez, a Miami computer executive who has raised and contributed three-quarters of a million dollars to Democratic Party campaigns and causes. Nor would an invitation to meet the President have been extended to Grigori Loutchansky, an Israeli citizen whose company, Nordex, was described by the C.I.A. last year as "an organization associated with Russian criminal activity."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Agenda and Budget Will Test Tone of Amity

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
After months of invoking bipartisanship, President Clinton this week formally presents his legislative agenda and his budget, beginning the long struggle that will determine whether the Republican-controlled Congress and the Democratic President can really enter a season of cooperation.
Mr. Clinton starts off this debate in a stronger position than in years, given new legitimacy in his re-election and the highest public approval ratings of his Presidency. Indeed, Republicans are no longer pronouncing his proposals dead on arrival, though that is in part because Mr. Clinton has moved so far in their direction since the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. 
 He has used two recent speeches, an appearance before the centrist Democratic Leadership Council and his inaugural address, to give an ideological coherence to the small-scale campaign proposals that positioned him in the political center. He has said he advocates a Government "humble enough not to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves." Now, his aides say, he will demonstrate what he means through concrete programs.
White House officials say the President will seize the moment in his State of the Union message on Tuesday by first calling on Congress and the nation to complete the "unfinished business" of balancing the budget, finding jobs for welfare recipients and overhauling campaign finance laws. To give urgency to the campaign finance issue, he is expected to call for action by July 4.
As he has increasingly since the Republicans won control of Congress, Mr. Clinton will not just urge legislative action but will also call for individuals, communities and states to take steps on their own to grapple with the nation's social ills.
Returning to the family-centered themes of his campaign, Mr. Clinton plans to make education a cornerstone of his agenda for the next four years. He is expected to call for schools across the country to test whether their students are performing up to nationally recognized standards and to explain how the Federal Government can help create the climate for such rigor.
Mr. Clinton also plans to tackle the issue of health insurance once again, this time with a series of initiatives intended to help the 10 million American children who lack coverage.
Many of the other proposals that the President made during the campaign will be fleshed out, among them plans to offer $3.4 billion in grants and tax relief to simulate job creation for those who will be forced off welfare under stringent new time limits; proposals for tax credits and tax deductions to help pay for higher education, and a proposal to help maintain health insurance for unemployed workers.
Two days after his speech, Mr. Clinton plans to provide further detail by announcing his budget proposal for the 1998 fiscal year. Although the outlines of the program -- which call for balancing the budget by 2002 while making $100 billion in tax cuts for specific social purposes -- are almost identical to the proposals Mr. Clinton made last year, this time the Republicans are not dismissing the plan out of hand.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said today that Republican leaders would invite Mr. Clinton to come to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the day after his State of the Union message, for talks on the budget and a range of other issues.
On the ABC News program "This Week," Mr. Lott said the invitation would send this message: "Mr. President, it's time that we stop the little pigeon steps around here and let's begin to see what we can really do for the American people."
Josh Silverman, a White House spokesman, said that the President had not yet received an official invitation and noted that Mr. Clinton had plans to be in Georgia on Wednesday as part of an effort to speak about education issues across the country. But the spokesman left the door open for a meeting soon, saying, "As always the President looks forward to meeting with the Senate majority leader and bipartisan leadership."
Yet despite the tone of amity and the desire of both Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders to show that divided government can work, serious stumbling blocks could emerge as the two sides start negotiating on how to erase the Federal deficit.
One of the most bitter fiscal issues dividing Republicans and Democrats in the 1996 campaign was how to find savings in Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly. Last month Mr. Clinton made a conciliatory gesture to the Republicans by announcing that his budget plan would trim the growth of Medicare spending by $138 billion over six years -- more savings than he was willing to entertain in the past.
Republicans welcomed the move but have since expressed reservations about the fact that Mr. Clinton would make the roughly $20 billion in additional savings largely by reducing payments to health maintenance organizations, not by asking the elderly to pay more.
Tax cuts are also shaping up as a struggle. The Republicans want nearly twice the number of cuts proposed by Mr. Clinton, with more reductions for upper-income people and a drop in the top capital gains rate. His proposals are largely focused on middle-income families and education, like offering a $500-per-child tax credit and proposals on a $10,000 tax deduction for post-secondary-school tuition or a $1,500 tax credit for each of the first two years of higher education. The education tax breaks would not apply to families earning over $100,000 annually.
Within his own party, Mr. Clinton is likely to face pressure for more social spending. Senate Democrats have already outlined an assortment of plans to extend health care coverage to the 10 million uninsured children. One proposal sponsored by Senators John Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts goes beyond anything Mr. Clinton is expected to call for. Their plan, at a cost of $25 billion over five years, would buy vouchers for low-income families to buy insurance.

HEADLINE: Global Phone Pact Appears Near But U.S. Conditions May Block It

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Trade negotiators from more than 100 countries are close to reaching an agreement on opening up government-protected telecommunication monopolies to competition, but the United States is still threatening to block the pact if it does not go as far as American officials would like.
With only two weeks left before a deadline set by the World Trade Organization, 10 countries have come forward in the last week with new or improved offers to open their domestic communication markets. And thanks in part to pressure from the Federal Communications Commission, officials at the trade organization say that considerable progress has been made on persuading many countries to start reducing their fees for completing international phone calls, which are often wildly expensive compared with American rates. 
 "I think we will have an agreement by Feb. 15," said Renato Ruggiero, head of the trade organization, in an interview here this weekend. "You can never be sure, but we have made a lot of progress. It is very encouraging."
A global deal would commit countries to move toward the same kind of competition in telephone and cable television services that is being opened up in the United States and the European Union. It would threaten the sky-high prices charged by many foreign telephone monopolies, by allowing rivals to set up new networks. And it would also open new opportunities for giants like AT&T, British Telecommunications or Sprint to build or buy their way into Latin America, Asia and Africa.
But the key to reaching a deal is the United States, which essentially vetoed an agreement last April on the ground that not enough countries had committed themselves to truly opening their markets.
In the last two weeks, officials of the trade organization said, 10 countries have submitted new proposals to open their markets and another 12 have said they will follow suit. But a critical question is whether, on close scrutiny, these offerings are as significant as they purport to be.
For the United States, the biggest obstacle to a deal may turn out to be Canada, America's biggest trading partner. Officials in Geneva, where the W.T.O. is based, and in Washington say that Canada has refused to agree to scale back tough restrictions on foreign ownership of telephone companies. That is a subject of intense interest to the likes of AT&T, MCI Communicationsand British Telecommunications, which is hoping to buy MCI before the end of the year.
"We are not there yet," said Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the United States trade representative.
The United States and the European Union are already knocking down protective barriers in their telephone, cable television and data markets. But a global trade agreement would provide a powerful new weapon, by allowing rivals to go to international court under the W.T.O. if individual governments stalled competition for the benefit of their traditional telephone monopolies. And it would commit most of the world to the same principles of competition being put into play in the United States and Western Europe.
Mr. Ruggiero and others at the W.T.O. say that there are solid reasons for being optimistic about completing a final deal. One is that many countries are grudgingly giving up their determination to maintain extremely high "accounting rates" for international telephone calls. Accounting rates cover the price of completing international calls into and out of a country, and these prices are often many times more than their true cost in many countries because governments count on the revenue to subsidize other services.
The issue has been a source of contention between the United States and other countries for nearly a decade. But that issue has slipped into the background, in part because the F.C.C. recently imposed new regulations that block American carriers from paying their counterparts in other countries more than certain prescribed amounts per minute.
That, together with the fact that European countries are already well on the way to cutting their rates and introducing competition, has defused tensions over the issue at the World Trade Organization.
Because the American telecommunications market is so immense, and access to the American market is so crucial, the United States has what amounts to a veto on any global trade pact.
American officials have alternatives to a global agreement. The F.C.C. is putting in place policies that essentially set the stage for bilateral deals in which United States restrictions on foreign carriers are dropped if the other country has opened its market to American companies. The United States and Britain are close to establishing that kind of relationship, which is why British Telecommunications has a very strong chance of winning regulatory approval for its deal to buy MCI.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
'The British Genius'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
In the run-up to the British election, now likely to take place in May, it seems increasingly difficult to tell the two major parties apart. Two weeks ago Labor's shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, went so far as to promise that Labor would not raise income-tax rates for five years if it won, or increase public spending for two years.
The political logic of the move is plain. Labor is generally thought to have lost in 1992 because it planned to raise taxes. Like Bill Clinton last year, party leaders want to anticipate and neutralize attacks from the other side. 
 Are there still real differences in what a Labor government would do? I put the question to Mr. Brown, and got a passionate answer.
He began with Britain's relationship to the European Union. Under pressure from Conservative anti-Europeans, Prime Minister John Major has sounded increasingly negative about the E.U., distancing himself in particular from its project to create a single European currency.
Mr. Brown reiterated Labor's position that it will decide about joining the single-currency plan in terms of the national interest. But he saw the increasingly xenophobic tone of Conservative opposition as the signal of a move toward leaving the E.U. altogether -- which would be disastrous for Britain.
"Right-wing Tories are trying to recreate a past that cannot be," he said, "in a world of free trade. They talk of sovereignty, as if NATO didn't exist. They talk of Britain's role in the world as centered on the special relationship with America, but with the end of the cold war that is not the only means by which we can play a part."
There has always been an insular element in British thinking, reflected in the famous newspaper headline "Fog in Channel, Continent Cut Off." Could a Labor government persuade the public that Britain's interests are wholeheartedly in Europe?
"I think people see the Conservatives on the sidelines of Europe," Mr. Brown replied, "carping, half in and half out, always wanting to blame Europe for everything that goes wrong.
"We can lead in Europe, and express our national identity better that way. I think people want to see the British spirit and character in the Community: openness, tolerance, a strong sense of fair play, inventiveness.
"The British genius lies in qualities that are wider than self-interest. That is why it is not anti-British to be internationalist. It is why we can express our sense of being British by being in Europe."
Mr. Brown tied those views to domestic policy, too. He said he had pledged not to increase public spending or income taxes because a modern left-of-center party could not be a tax-and-spend party. But it still could have a principled program, he said, to undertake government initiatives for community purposes.
More education and training are Britain's great needs, he said -- to equip people for more sophisticated work. As it is, the country has a high level of long-term unemployment despite being in a rosy economic period. Official unemployment statistics do not count single-parent families headed by women and certain other categories. Altogether, he said, 19 percent of British families now have no one bringing in wages -- compared with 11 percent in the United States.
"You can't continue supporting a fifth of the population," he said, with unemployment and other benefit payments. To make work more attractive than welfare, he would like when he can to cut the starting income-tax rate in half, from 20 percent to 10. "You need to equip people for work, and you need reform of taxation and benefits to make the work ethic more important.
"We can't be reduced to the notion that self-interested individualism is all Britain is about. A country also needs to have a sense of community, of trust."
Those themes may show up in the campaign when Mr. Major finally calls the election. Right now Labor has to beware of overoptimism. The latest poll gives it a 25 percent lead -- a figure that may reflect not so much approval of reformed Labor policies as a widespread public feeling that the Tories are exhausted after 18 years in power.

HEADLINE: New TV Law in Colombia Provokes Complaints of Censorship

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The Colombian Congress has granted a regulatory commission broad authority to take television news programs off the air on the basis of their content. Many journalists see the move as an attempt to punish programs that have investigated suspected ties between drug traffickers and prominent politicians, including President Ernesto Samper.
The measure, part of a new broadcast law canceling television news concessions that were to have run until 2003, was signed by Mr. Samper in December. 
 Six months earlier, Congress exonerated the President in a scandal stemming from charges that his 1994 election campaign had knowingly accepted contributions from major drug dealers.
"It's a very direct measure against news shows that have been critical of Samper over the last two years," said Enrique Santos Calderon, a columnist for the daily El Tiempo and part-owner of QAP, a television news production company.
Daniel Coronell, an investigative journalist and news director of New Colombian Television, agreed. "It assures the President that he won't be criticized for the rest of his term," he said.
The new law creates regional stations and two private networks in addition to the two public stations currently on the air and grants Congress its own channel. Its most controversial provision allows the two-year-old National Television Commission to review the contents of television programs every six months to determine whether they comply with the Constitution, which promises Colombians the right to their "honor" and demands that the news be "truthful and impartial."
Although news organizations have filed suits challenging the new law, the Constitutional Court is not expected to rule on it for several months.
But the televison commission, four of whose five members are appointed by the Government and Congress, will begin reviewing the contents of news programs this month. Programs can be taken off the air before the court has a chance to issue its findings.
In its annual human rights review, released on Thursday, the State Department in Washington criticized the broadcast law, which it called "an obvious effort by the Samper administration to eliminate troubling television news coverage of a scandal-ridden administration and to reward its powerful backers for remaining loyal."
Supporters of the law argue that it is not intended to censor news shows, but to open the airwaves to a wider range of sympathies. They dismiss the criticism from the United States as part of a campaign in Washington to undermine Mr. Samper.
Complaining that reporters were overwhelmingly hostile to the President during the inquiry into suspicions that he had drug connections, one of the bill's sponsors, Congressman Carlos Alonso Lucio, called it a way to broaden access to the airwaves. "Undoubtedly, during this last crisis in Colombia the news shows went beyond the mission of informing people to assume a defined political position," Mr. Alonso said. "Anybody who was a friend of the Government was a crook, and whoever was against the President became the great ethical saints of the country."
Mr. Alonso, a former member of the M-19 guerrilla organization who reportedly has made frequent visits to imprisoned leaders of the Cali drug cartel, Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, co-sponsored the section of the new law requiring twice-yearly reviews of news programs with another lawmaker, Martha Catalina Daniels. The reviews mean that news programs -- with their employees, leases and millions of dollars in studios and equipment -- are threatened every six months with being shut down and barred from broadcasting for five years.
Mr. Lucio and Mrs. Daniels have been strong supporters of President Samper, and have been highly critical of news coverage of the investigation of possible connections between drug dealers and politicians.
Mrs. Daniels is herself being investigated for corruption by the Supreme Court, and her husband, Hernando Rodriguez, is being sought by the authorities on charges that he stole $13 million from a longshoremen's pension fund.
Mrs. Daniels said the owners of the news programs, who she estimated earned $35,000 for every half-hour broadcast, were defending not so much freedom of the press as "their own economic interests."
Monica de Grieff, the chairwoman of the National Television Commission, said the commission was studying other countries "that have no connotation of censorship" to figure out how to measure program content.
Last year, Mrs. de Grieff broke off a transmission from Congress when then-Senator Maria Izquierdo took the microphone to confess that she had accepted money from drug dealers to help Mr. Samper's election campaign.
Mrs. de Grieff said the commission did not like the mandatory reviews, "but we have to do it, and that's why we're trying to do it as carefully as possible."
Maria Isabel Rueda, news director of QAP, said the production company was already feeling the effects of the new law. Defense Minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez, who is reputed to have ties with a drug trafficker named Pastor Perafan, has complained to the commission that QAP was persecuting him and his family when a reporter questioned him about the allegations. More disquieting, she said, was that her news program stood alone.
"My competition never asked him about the charges at all," she said.
In the face of criticism, most recently from the Inter-American Press Association, President Samper said recently that he did not agree with the twice-yearly reviews, but signed the law because of its overall content. He said that if the Constitutional Court upheld the television law, he would propose a bill to modify it. But a minister in his Government has said publicly that the law is precisely the one the Administration hoped for.

HEADLINE: Private Help for Public Woes

 BODY:
Despite America's robust economy, unemployment remains stubborn in the inner cities. Millions of urban residents are not only jobless. They are growing increasingly out of touch with potential employers. At a time of reduced government spending, salvation lies increasingly with the private sector. Two recent developments offer glimmers of hope.
Henry Kravis, founder of the legendary buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, rounded up more than 50 companies that invested $1 million each in a new and exciting vehicle known as the New York City Investment Fund. Either as partner or lender, the fund will provide money to firms that locate in blighted neighborhoods or hire large numbers of low-skilled workers. 
 The fund will not provide grants. It expects to back companies that can survive on their own and fully repay the fund so the money can be recirculated to other deserving ventures. The fund also says it will back companies that cannot attract traditional sources of money. Exactly what projects will fit these two criteria is unclear. No doubt the fund will learn as it goes along.
If the goal of the Kravis fund is to create jobs, the goal of the Rockefeller Foundation is to prepare long-term unemployed workers to find and keep jobs. In nine cities, not including New York, the foundation, in partnership with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will set up programs to put residents of public housing to work. Employment rates in public housing projects hover around 20 percent, which the foundation intends to triple. The program will train these residents for entry-level jobs, provide job-search assistance and, most important, provide support services after residents find jobs -- including child care and participation in peer advisory groups.
In cooperation with Chase Manhattan Bank and HUD, Rockefeller will also create 6 to 10 demonstration projects, including two in New York, to find jobs for residents of low-income, high-unemployment neighborhoods. The projects will build on the experience of the New York City Partnership, a business advocacy group, that is already working with private purchasers of city-owned rental properties in Harlem and Brooklyn to create jobs for their tenants. The Rockefeller-Chase Manhattan project will expand the reach of the jobs programs beyond tenants to other disadvantaged workers in the neighborhoods.
The Kravis fund and Rockefeller Foundation projects could provide guidance for programs that soften the blow of the new Federal welfare law, which will end cash aid, food stamps and other Government assistance for millions of families. Welfare-to-work programs nationwide have boosted earnings and employment only modestly and no program has worked anywhere near the scale that would be needed in urban centers like New York. One answer is for private firms to create jobs, and then for the long-term unemployed to find and keep jobs.
The Kravis fund seeks to do the first. The Rockefeller-Chase Manhattan projects seek answers about training the disadvantaged for jobs. If the programs yield positive results, the next logical step would be to convert the lessons learned into blueprints for ordinary profit-seeking businesses.

HEADLINE: UNLIKELY ALLIES -- A special report.;
The Bill That Fell From Grace

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Almost a year ago, the Rev. Tom Grey recalled, a rumpled, gruff-voiced man approached him at a convention of evangelical Christians in Rochester and gave him his card. "We have a common interest," the man said.
For Mr. Grey, a Methodist minister and the director of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, that interest was singular: to prevent New York State from legalizing casinos. He thanked the man, David E. Langdon, took his card and they stayed in touch, sharing newspaper articles, political gossip and lobbying tips. 
 It was not until months later that Mr. Grey discovered the nature of Mr. Langdon's interest: he was one of four lobbyists retained by Donald J. Trump to fight the spread of high-stakes gambling into New York.
Mr. Trump, who owns three Atlantic City casinos, had of course long been the enemy for gambling opponents. But Mr. Grey, a former chaplain in the Vietnam War who is fond of military analogies, gladly welcomed the alliance.
"This is combat," he said last week. "This is a guy who you want in your camp."
Thus was formed the backbone of one of the oddest, most disparate coalitions in recent Albany memory. Before long, Mr. Langdon and Mr. Grey, an Illinois resident who is on special assignment from his church to travel the country fighting casino proposals, joined ranks with the Roman Catholic Church, environmentalists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Christian Coalition, groups representing Broadway theaters and New York City hotels, Skidmore College in Saratoga, the New York State Council of Churches and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Last week, their efforts bore fruit as the State Senate resoundingly rejected a constitutional amendment to legalize casinos. As votes were being cast, a glance into the Senate gallery told the story of the public relations fight: the seats were filled with Mr. Grey's allies and their lobbyists.
It was a stunning turnabout for a measure that, just a few weeks ago, had been widely expected to pass. The vote ended years of public debate and backroom intrigue, and dashed the aspirations of business owners and elected officials from the Catskills to Niagara Falls who had envisioned casinos as a golden remedy for their regions' ailing tourist economies. A state study had shown that casinos would have brought $2.6 billion to the economy and created 38,000 jobs.
Had the Senate approved the amendment, it would have gone to the Assembly, which was expected to pass it, and then to voters for a November referendum. So last week's vote also prevented what was expected to be a multimillion-dollar campaign by opponents and supporters to sway the electorate. Now it will probably take two years, at least, before the issue will come before voters, Senate leaders said.
By all accounts, the resourcefulness, size and diversity of the opposition caught casino supporters by surprise. But there were other important reasons behind the measure's failure.
The lobbyists and publicists for big casinos whom opponents had expected to descend like locusts on Albany never arrived. Casino executives in other states said they were either skeptical about the measure's chances or fearful that their intervention might hurt it.
Within the state, supporters complacently expected the measure to pass and were slow to mobilize. A Brooklyn developer who wanted to build a casino at Grossinger's resort in the Catskills did not make his pitch to Democratic senators until 15 minutes before the vote.
Political machinations also helped kill the measure. The five Nassau County Republicans voted against the measure at the behest of their county chairman, who also happened to be president of the local Offtrack Betting Corporation. Sixteen of 17 New York City Democrats opposed it, partly because they thought it did nothing for their districts.
And the two supporters who might have saved the measure, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and Gov. George E. Pataki, did not want to twist arms, apparently fearing that the political fallout from pushing it significantly outweighed the benefits.
But as soon as the measure failed, both sides were predicting that it would return, and both were already preparing for the next battle. "I don't think anyone is going to rest on their laurels," said Joe Dalton, president of the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce, one of the opposition's leaders. "We'll be ready for a fight next time."

The Players
Pastors and Bishops Ally With Trump
A constitutional amendment must be approved by two consecutively elected Legislatures before it can go before voters in a referendum. In 1995, the first time the casino measure was adopted, there was only scattered opposition from groups largely working independently of one another.
But that vote spurred Mr. Grey to begin patching together a grass-roots operation to block a second passage in 1997.
He found a Chinese-American minister in Manhattan who had been fighting a proposed Offtrack Betting parlor in Chinatown. Mr. Grey hooked up with an antigambling group in the Catskills led by a retired clinical psychologist. He persuaded liberal Protestants in Buffalo to join forces with the Christian Coalition. And he began communicating with Senator Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican who is the Legislature's leading opponent of casinos, which he says foster gambling addiction and political corruption.
By last month, their pool of resources was growing deeper by the day. Roman Catholic bishops in Buffalo and Albany began calling their senators. Skidmore College donated use of a phone bank that would eventually place 3,000 calls to lawmakers in a week. A Saratoga Springs church set aside $10,000 for the cause and recruited teen-agers and widows from its Bible study classes to stuff envelopes.
"Instead of doing First Timothy, we turned into a political action committee," said the Rev. John A. Eckman, pastor of the Presbyterian and New England Congregational Church in Saratoga Springs.
While ministers were running the public campaign, Mr. Trump's team of lobbyists was working the back rooms of the Capitol. Mr. Trump, who contends that casino gambling would hurt his real estate holdings by draining money from the local economy, had carefully selected lobbyists with access to key legislators. Mr. Langdon and a second lobbyist, Francis J. Sanzillo, were former top aides to the Senate Democrats, the largest bloc of swing votes. Brian Meara had strong ties to Assembly Democrats. And the fourth, Albert Pirro, was close to Republicans in both Houses.
In addition to the $855,750 Mr. Trump invested on lobbying last year, he and his wife also gave at least $400,000 in campaign contributions to both parties, including $100,000 to the Senate Democrats.
Though there has been much debate over the role Mr. Trump's money played in killing the amendment, it is clear that his lobbyists helped formulate some of the opponents' strongest arguments. For instance, the lobbyists contended, and many Democrats ultimately agreed, that the Legislature should establish a system for licensing and regulating casinos before passing the amendment. The Republicans refused, prompting many Democrats to vote against the bill.
"I think Donald Trump and OTB on Long Island probably called a lot more of the shots than we did," Mr. Eckman said.
Tensions were inevitable, of course, given the enormous philosophical differences among the opponents. Mr. Eckman, a self-described liberal, initially refused to work with the Christian Coalition, whose leaders he once likened to fascists. And more than a few ministers were unhappy about rubbing elbows with Mr. Trump's team.
Mr. Grey even sent a playful note to Mr. Langdon that paraphrased scripture to sum up their unease: "The lion shall lie down with the lamb, but the lamb shall not get much sleep," it read. Mr. Langdon wrote back, "But who is the lion?" Mr. Grey replied, "You'll know when we come after Trump."
But then Mr. Bruno unwittingly gave the opposition more reason to unite: He announced in early January that the Senate would vote on the amendment within a month. Opponents viewed the move as an attempt to ram the amendment through before they could organize. Fueled by anger and anxiety, they quickly set aside their differences.
"Desperation breeds effectiveness," said Damaris McGuire, director of the New York State Episcopal Public Policy Network and a leader of the coalition. "They did us a favor by putting it on such a fast track."

The Lawmakers
Democrats Play Coy, Bruno Rebuffs Deals
By mid-January, as opposition was building outside the Senate, support for the measure was quickly eroding within.
Part of the problem was that Senate Republicans had never been enthusiastic about the amendment, with many expressing moral qualms about gambling. Indeed, when the measure first came to a vote in 1995, fewer than half of the 36 Republicans were initially willing to support it.
When Democrats said they would not help pass the amendment in 1995 because they had not been given a role in shaping it, it appeared certain to fail. But Mr. Bruno took the Democrats' refusal as a personal challenge. He stormed into a private meeting of the Republicans and demanded that they support him by voting yes. They did, and the measure passed on an almost straight party-line vote, 34 to 21. (Thirty-one votes are needed for passage.)
This year, Mr. Bruno -- who faced stiff opposition to the amendment from Saratoga, which is part of his own Senate district -- promised not to pressure Senators. That meant that at least a dozen Republicans would probably vote no.
Things worsened for the amendment when the Nassau County Republican chairman, Joseph N. Mondello, told the five Nassau Republican senators to vote against the amendment. Mr. Mondello is also president of the Nassau Downs Offtrack Betting Corporation, which stood to lose wagering income to casinos. All five complied.
Mr. Mondello has insisted that he was motivated purely by the concern that casinos would cause an epidemic of compulsive gambling.
"You're talking about a situation where a man who can't control himself has tremendous temptation," he said in a recent interview. "The pay check is never going to make it to the doorstep."
Knowing that their votes were needed to pass the amendment, Democrats played coy, publicly saying that they were undecided while privately hoping that Mr. Bruno would offer concessions on sundry issues.
Some wanted assurances that a portion of tax revenues from gambling would go to New York City, which was prohibited from having casinos under the measure. Others wanted Mr. Bruno to soften his hard-line stance against rent regulations. And still others wanted virtual veto power over the legislation that would establish the system for regulating casinos.
Mr. Bruno refused to deal on all those things. Seeing nothing in it for them, the Democrats overwhelmingly voted no.
"They were always ready to go for it if they got anything for it," the Senate minority leader, Martin Connor of Brooklyn, said after the vote. "I could have pushed them to yes if there was a reason to. There wasn't."

The End Game
Last-Ditch Scramble Fails to Save a Bill
Until early January, the campaign for casino gambling had largely been handled by one man, Lester Shulklapper, an influential Albany lobbyist with strong ties to Republicans who represented Catskills resort owners.
But with the measure clearly in trouble, business leaders and mayors from other communities that stood to gain casinos -- Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Lake George -- finally began pressing their cases.
Some hired lobbyists at the last minute. Others began making weekly trips to Albany to buttonhole legislators. But they never broadened their support outside their communities. It was too little, too late, many supporters acknowledged.
"It came up so fast, we didn't have an opportunity to really get out and lobby," said John Kaczorowski, president of the Buffalo Central Labor Council, which along with the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., supported the amendment because they believed that it would create jobs.
Moreover, except for Circus Circus Development Corporation and a few other casino owners, big gambling interests never joined the fray. Executives for several companies like Mirage Resorts, which spent millions on a failed effort to build a casino in Bridgeport, Conn., said they had decided months ago that lobbying state legislatures can be a tremendous waste of money.
"You become a target," said Stephen Wynn, Mirage's chief executive. "If somebody wants to legalize, they can do it on their own time and then come get us."
By last week, the only person clearly powerful enough to save the amendment was Mr. Pataki. But he, too, faced political problems: cajoling senators to vote yes would have angered powerful interest groups that he has often courted -- Catholics, environmentalists and the state's Conservative Party.
On the morning of the vote, Mr. Bruno called Mr. Pataki, told him the amendment did not have enough votes to pass and asked him if there was anything he wanted to do. "He said he was satisfied with whatever the result might be and wasn't going to get involved in interfering," Mr. Bruno later said.
The amendment was defeated, 41-19.

HEADLINE: Absent Arab Peace Partners

 BODY:
The first weeks of 1997 brought clear evidence that the political leaders and people of Israel are ready to push ahead with the next moves toward building a Middle East peace. So too are the Palestinians and their leader, Yasir Arafat. The question now is whether Egypt and Syria have the courage and wisdom to join them.
In recent weeks Israeli troops withdrew from most of the West Bank city of Hebron. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Mr. Arafat established a pragmatic working relationship and Israel's two main parties began to bridge their differences over peacemaking. Egypt mustered little enthusiasm for all this, and Syria, as is its custom, remained coldly aloof. Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, and Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, need to reassess their positions. By easing the path to regional peace, they could help bring increased security and prosperity to their countries as well as their neighbors. 
 There are some signs Mr. Mubarak may recognize that the peacemaking effort in Israel has reached an important new point. After weeks of urging Mr. Arafat to stiffen his bargaining position on Hebron, Cairo switched gears at the last moment and contributed to the final compromise. Yesterday, Mr. Mubarak met Mr. Netanyahu at the World Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland, and encouraged expanded peace efforts. But that is not enough. Egypt's largely negative role in the Hebron talks, along with an ugly anti-Israeli campaign in the Government-influenced Cairo press, has badly strained relations with Israel.
Mr. Mubarak apparently concluded last year that the new Israeli Government intended to freeze peacemaking efforts indefinitely. Since then Cairo has turned away from its earlier helpful role as a diplomatic bridge between Israel and other Arab countries. Instead, it has seemed intent on promoting Egypt's Arab leadership role at Israeli expense.
This may serve Mr. Mubarak's domestic political purposes, but it has damaged Egypt's standing with Israel and with the United States. Cairo has also lost touch with the more realistic positions of Jordan and the Palestinians. Egypt should recognize that as the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, its natural leadership role is to lead the way to a wider regional peace.
Syria is now the focus of the Clinton Administration's efforts to build on the Hebron agreement and will be high on the agenda of President Clinton's meetings in Washington with Mr. Netanyahu and other Mideast leaders over the next few weeks. It has never been clear whether Damascus actually wants to reach a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel or simply feels a need to assure Washington it is prepared to pursue negotiations. But talks between Israel and Syria have been suspended for nearly a year, and with progress resuming on the Palestinian front, President Clinton has committed himself to make a new push to get peace talks resumed.
Mr. Netanyahu has been less willing than his Labor predecessors to talk about returning the occupied Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for full diplomatic and economic ties and reasonable security provisions. He also rejects Mr. Assad's unreasonable insistence on binding him to informal understandings reached between Syrian representatives and negotiators from the previous Israeli Government.
Still, Israel seems prepared to reopen talks with Syria that could also include discussions of the Israeli military presence in southern Lebanon. If Syria made a show of good will by acceding to Mr. Netanyahu's plea to restrain Hezbollah units in Lebanon from their attacks on Israeli positions, progress on other issues could follow.
While Egypt and Syria worry about maintaining their leadership roles in the Arab world, they risk being left behind by political and economic forces that are reshaping the region. At some point they may find it impossible to catch up.

HEADLINE: Top Institutions Heat Up Drives For Arts Funds

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Though it has not been officially announced, the New York Public Library is embarking on a $430 million capital campaign to refurbish its structures, expand its programs and create a new $12 million humanities center, the largest fund-raising drive in the library's 102-year history.
The library is not alone. Spurred by a soaring stock market, huge increases in the number of wealthy patrons, tax incentives and the need to keep pace with new technology, several of New York City's leading cultural institutions are also planning to raise, or have already begun raising, tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. Campaigns for capital funds and endowments by institututions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and Carnegie Hall are without precedent in scale or ambition, say arts experts, fund-raisers and donors. 
 At the same time, the campaigns' impact on smaller arts groups in New York City is being fiercely debated within the arts world. Spokesmen for some groups said they feared that the campaigns, coming at a time of reduced public support for the arts, might further diminish money available for smaller organizations.
"There is a just a finite amount of money out there," said Norma P. Munn, who heads the New York City Arts Coalition, which represents small as well as larger institutions.
But a majority of experts said the campaigns would invigorate the city's aging cultural infrastructure and produce a resurgence of the arts in New York unparalleled in recent history, a boom that would benefit smaller and large institutions alike.
"We've entered a period of institutional excitement comparable only to that which occurred after the Civil War until World War I when several of the city's great civic and cultural institutions were built," said Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., the city's former Corporation Counsel. "We are on the verge of another huge leap in the city's cultural life, a new renaissance."
Michael I. Sovern, president emeritus of Columbia University and president of the Shubert Foundation, agreed. Larger institutions, he said, tend to compete for funds against one another, not against small ones. "The effect of these campaigns," he said, "is to increase the size of the philanthropic pie."
The competition itself, said Glenn D. Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art, spurs ever greater giving. "It seems counter-intuitive," said Mr. Lowry, whose museum is planning to announce a multimillion-dollar capital and endowment campaign later this year. "But that is the psychology of philanthropy, which is different from the psychology of commerce."
While universities and hospitals are accustomed to waging virtually permanent capital campaigns, said Elizabeth McCormack, a senior board member of two major foundations and an adviser to the Rockefeller family, she could not remember a time when so many of the city's cultural institutions had initiated major capital drives. "The danger is that they will all go to the same people for funds," she said. But so far, she noted, astonishing sums were being given, from wealth controlled not just by a few families but in many hands.
Charitable giving has steadily risen along with the number of the city's new millionaires, who have tripled in number in the past decade, according to Treasury Department figures. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, which has already raised $240 million of its three-year-old $300 million campaign, has received gifts of $1 million or more from 60 donors.
Giving to the New York Public Library, which is supported by both public and private funds, reflects the breadth and depth of support for an institution that includes 87 libraries spread over 130 miles, a collection of 54 million items and 14 million reader-visits a year, including an average of 40,000 city children who come to the branch libraries a day. In addition to the 29 donors who have given the library $1 million or more and the trustees, who have pledged $100 million, some 42,000 "Friends" gave between $1 and $1,250 last year, of whom 20,000 donated between $40 and $125; some 15,000 supporters gave $100 or less. Contributions in all categories, but especially from the "Friends," have risen steadily.
Paul LeClerc, the president of the library, said his institution had no choice but to begin its ambitious "Second Century Campaign." "If we fail to expand and refurbish," he said, "we risk betraying Ben Franklin's commitment at the founding of the American library movement to bring the book, and now the database, to all people, free of charge."
The city's cultural needs are immense. The library alone plans to raise $145 million for capital expenditures at the main library on 42d Street and its branches, $100 million for technological improvements and $185 million to increase its endowment and operating expenses. Computerizing and digitizing essential research documents, that is, scanning images or texts and converting them into digital formats that can be called up and sent electronically, is hugely expensive, Mr. LeClerc said.
A centerpiece of the new campaign is the creation within the library of a $12 million Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers, which Mr. LeClerc hopes to make a hub of humanities scholarship and discourse. The center will occupy renovated space made available at the main library by the transfer of the library's vast collection of science and business books last year to the new Science, Industry and Business Library branch, known to library aficionados as "Sibl."
Mr. LeClerc said that making the collections available through computer technology, a challenge faced by virtually all the city's cultural institutions, is also expensive. "It costs $4 to $8 to digitize one slide of a painting or a page of a book," he said. "Digitizing 'Moby-Dick' costs $4,000; digitizing the research library collection would cost $8 billion."
The library, like so many of the city's great cultural buildings from the turn of the century or even those built in the 1960's, now requires extensive renovation. Renovating the main library alone will cost more than $50 million, he said.
Faced with similar needs, more than half a dozen major cultural institutions have already begun, or will soon unveil capital drives. They include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which in 1994 announced a $300 million campaign; Carnegie Hall, which has raised $70 million of its two-year-old, $75 million campaign, including $15.3 million last Tuesday night from its gala tribute to Isaac Stern; the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has raised $14.5 million of an eight-year, $70 million campaign started in 1992, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, which has raised 83 percent of its $40 million campaign from the museum's trustees and may now increase its campaign goal to $45 million. The Museum of Modern Art, the New York City Opera and the American Museum of Natural History are all considering campaigns to raise funds.
"Everybody is doing it," said Betsy Gotbaum, the executive director of the New-York Historical Society, which has decided to defer a campaign until her institution is on firmer financial ground. "I would also hope for a time when there is slightly less competition," she said. But few foresee such a time soon.
Most arts experts attributed the proliferation of capital campaigns to the strong economy and rising stock market. "You go hunting when the ducks are flying," said Leonard A. Lauder, chairman of the Whitney and of its campaign and a major donor to the museum and other New York cultural institutions. "You must raise money now as a hedge against leaner times."
Andrew Heiskell, a former chairman of Time Inc. and of the New York Public Library said: "It would be criminal not to take advantage of the current economic climate. Besides, giving is the best way to avoid taxes."
There is little doubt that tax avoidance has encouraged ever greater generosity among New Yorkers. Elliot Levine, an accountant and partner in Levine & Seltzer, which has advised many clients to form private family foundations for tax and philanthropic purposes, said that giving now has been encouraged by a provision in the tax code which, since July 1996, has permitted individuals to donate publicly traded stock at its fully appreciated value to foundations and nonprofit institutions. "But the ability to front-load a deduction at its appreciated value will expire on June 1, unless Congess extends it," he said.
Denis Azaro, the development director at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, said that the provision had been "hugely helpful" in prompting stock gifts to his institution, and that failure to extend the provision would probably mean "significant" reductions, "particularly troublesome when the Government is cutting back on arts funding."
Loren Renz, the vice president for research at the Foundation Center, in New York, said that giving to philanthropic groups by individuals and the now 39,000 private family foundations (15,000 of which were created since 1980) has risen steadily in recent years, although the tax provision now set to expire in June had expired once in 1994 "without a stampede of giving." But the economy in 1994, she added, was not as strong as it is today.
Most fund-raisers and donors agreed that private giving, no matter how generous, could never compensate for the loss of public funds, a loss that has helped prompt several medium-sized and smaller institutions to step up fund-raising efforts.
A key factor in any capital campaign, they agreed, is timing. Rita E. Hauser, a patron on the board of the New York Philharmonic, said that sometimes a campaign started in heady financial times runs into a recession, as the orchestra's did briefly several years ago. "That's when you can get into big trouble," she said. "But for the moment, everyone is very upbeat. I've never seen such optimism, or such giving."

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Textile Trade Pact Signed in Time for Albright Trip

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 2

 BODY:
A broad agreement reached by China and the United States today on textile trade is likely to further increase a sector of cross-Pacific commerce already worth billions, American officials said.
The accord, signed in Beijing today after a deadline on Friday was extended into the weekend, also clears away a politically sensitive obstacle to better diplomatic relations in time for Madeleine K. Albright to make her first visit to China as Secretary of State later this month. 
 American officials portrayed today's agreement as a breakthrough that allows American textile-sellers better access to China, in exchange for loosening restrictions on the volume of textiles and garments that China exports to the United States, its largest market.
"China has the largest share of the U.S. market and we now have a share of the China market," Rita Hayes, chief negotiator for the United States, told reporters in Beijing. "Now it is a two-way street, a level playing field."
That upbeat assessment may be aimed at Washington, where China's growing trade surplus with the United States -- $39 billion, by American estimates; $10 billion, by the Chinese count -- is becoming an issue of concern among members of Congress.
Yet calling textile trade "a two-way street," may be a bit premature. In 1996, China exported about $6.5 billion of textile and apparel to the United States, about 1,000 times the $6 million that the United States sold to China in the same category.
Ms. Hayes said that her team won a greater right to sell home furnishings, drapes and designer garments in China, but she was reluctant to describe exactly how. It is not clear how much demand exists for such items in China, even if import restrictions were actually loosened.
Of far greater importance, dollar-wise, is how much the United States will expand the quotas that have been aimed at limiting Chinese textile and apparel exports to the United States. Ms. Hayes and other officials declined to say, but suggested they would be enlarged.
Textile quotas were originally put in place to limit Chinese exports to the United States, in order to protect the higher prices charged by American textile makers and, arguably, the jobs of American textile workers. Chinese trading companies compete with each other hard to obtain quotas, which are allocated by Chinese officials who sometimes favor their friends and acquaintances.
But China's enormous production of clothing, and the seemingly insatiable consumer demand in the United States, has also led many Chinese and Hong Kong companies to find ways around American quotas, on an immeasurable scale, by mislabeling garments or shipping them through third countries. The problem has existed for years, so when the United States decided to impose penalties last September, some Chinese officials accused them of doing so simply to gain leverage in trade talks.
Many trade experts argue that textile quotas are now outdated, and some point out that the United States' membership in the World Trade Organization requires it to abandon all such quotas within 10 years anyhow.
Today's agreement, which formally takes effect in January 1998 and lasts for four years, replaces a 1994 agreement. As is often the case, the accord was negotiated in an atmosphere of down-to-the-deadline brinkmanship, with final negotiations held in a series of tense and drawn-out meetings that included two all-night sessions.
"I think this morning at the beginning we were unhappy with each other but now we have become friends," said Li Dongsheng, China's chief negotiator and a senior official at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. "This agreement eloquently demonstrates the common interests of the United States and China in developing trade and economic relations."
But a separate trade-related obstacle remains, since American complaints that Chinese companies are improperly transshipping some apparel through third countries, to avoid American quotas, prompted the United States to impose $19 million in textile penalities last September. Ms. Hayes said the penalties were still in effect.
That is a drop in the bucket, when compared with the $6.5 billion in textiles and apparel that China sold to the United States.
Another American trade official, Lee Sands, held two days of talks in Beijing last week to gauge the status of China's effort to join the World Trade Organization. American officials have said they will support China's application if Beijing takes steps to cut tariffs and treat Chinese and foreign companies equally.

HEADLINE: GOVERNORS LIMIT REVISIONS SOUGHT IN WELFARE LAW

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Under pressure from Congressional Republicans, leaders of the National Governors' Association today decided not to seek wholesale changes in the new Federal welfare law. Instead they issued a cautious appeal to Congress and the Clinton Administration to work with them to meet the needs of a relatively small group of legal immigrants who will lose Federal benefits.
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, was in the vanguard of governors urging Congress to restore benefits for legal immigrants. He made a strong statement of those views nine days ago, and at the time the association seemed poised to follow his lead. But today, in the interest of getting an agreement, Mr. Pataki and a fellow Republican, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, joined other governors in supporting a compromise statement of policy. 
 The compromise came on the same day that the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said he wanted to see how the law worked before any major changes were made.
The compromise, approved today by the association's human resources committee, expresses concern about the effects of the new welfare law on one group of legal immigrants, those who are already in the United States, but who cannot become citizens because of age or disability.
The statement as originally drafted by the staff of the association said that such immigrants "should not be barred from Federal Supplemental Security Income benefits and food stamps."
Republican Congressional leaders and conservative Republican governors objected to that wording. So the human resources committee softened the language.
The governors now urge Congress simply to "meet the needs of aged and disabled legal immigrants who cannot naturalize and whose benefits may be affected."
Their statement goes on to say that "an equitable solution to this issue could be achieved without reopening" the welfare law. Governor Wilson acknowledged that there was an apparent contradiction here because most legal immigrants will lose food stamps and Supplemental Security Income benefits unless the welfare law is revised.
Comments by Mr. Pataki and other Republican governors, like Jim Edgar of Illinois, had created expectations that the association would call for more extensive changes in the welfare law.
In the last decade, the governors association has become an influential voice on domestic social policy, and governors helped shape the new welfare law. While they welcome the transfer of authority to the states, they also worry that the law will impose financial burdens on those with large numbers of immigrants.
More than 40 percent of the law's savings, $24 billion of $55 billion over seven years, result from restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants.
That curb was hotly debated in 1995 and 1996 as the welfare bill moved through Congress. But at a news conference today, Governor Pataki said, "We were unaware of this provision."
Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a Democrat, repeatedly expressed alarm about the likely adverse effects on states like Florida with many immigrants and refugees.
Mr. Pataki has now concluded that the law will shift $240 million a year in costs from the Federal Government to the State of New York, which intends to provide assistance for 80,000 immigrants who lose Federal benefits.
"I don't think that it's appropriate for states to have to pick up the tab," Mr. Pataki said today. "These legal immigrants are here in the United States, and their status is legal, because of the policies of the Federal Government."
In his new budget this week, President Clinton will ask Congress to restore benefits for some legal immigrants. Some Republican governors said they did not want to be seen as siding with the President on this issue or calling on Congress to reopen the bill.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, has cautioned Republican governors not to press for changes in the welfare law. And Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican majority leader, said today that he saw no prospect of such changes.
Asked whether Congress would revise the law to assist legal immigrants, Mr. Armey said: "The answer is no. We will not change that." Immigrants are welcome to work in the United States, but "we do not want to encourage people to come here for benefits," Mr. Armey said on the CNN program "Late Edition."
Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who helped Congress write the new welfare law, defended his work today. "We cannot be seen to say, 'Here's the deal we negotiated a year ago, and now here are all the things we want to change in it,' " Mr. Engler told other governors.
But Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, said the restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants were not a trivial part of the new law. "In my state," he said, "we have a large population of legal immigrants who have paid local, state and Federal taxes. To deny them coverage is contrary to what America stands for."
Mr. Gephardt said today that Congress should see how the welfare law worked before making big changes.
"I think we ought to let the bill be implemented and then see what the actual problems are and then try to solve those problems if they appear," said Mr. Gephardt, who voted against the bill.
To date, few people have lost benefits as a result of the law. The restrictions on benefits for immigrants have not yet taken effect, and few people have reached the time limits on cash assistance in any state. Moreover, the effects of the law have been cushioned by a strong economy, which has reduced the number of welfare recipients and created jobs for many people seeking work.
President Clinton says the restrictions on benefits for immigrants are not an integral part of the law, whose main purpose is to move people from welfare to work.
Several governors who agreed with Mr. Pataki said he would have been more effective if he had worked quietly behind the scenes to put the governors' association on record in favor of restoring benefits for some legal immigrants. By holding a news conference here to publicize his concerns on Jan. 24, he shone a spotlight on the issue, highlighting a split between himself and Republican leaders of Congress.
Mr. Pataki defended his actions. He said he had been invited to Washington to discuss his concerns on Jan. 24. "We were asked to outline our feelings on this issue," he said today. "That's what we did."

HEADLINE: Hispanics Suffer Loss of Health Care, Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Hispanic Households Struggle Amid Broad Decline in Income" (front page, Jan. 30) does not mention the health care implications resulting from the expansion of the working poor. 
 Hispanic children are more likely than any other group to go without health insurance for at least one month during their first three years of life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that Hispanics have the highest rate of diabetes and asthma, and the rate of AIDS cases is three times higher than for non-Hispanic groups.
At the same time, the number of Hispanic physicians is diminishing because of the anti-affirmative action climate and budgetary cutbacks in higher education. In California, the state with the largest and fastest growing Hispanic population in the nation, medical schools have reported a 19 percent drop in minority enrollment from 1995 to 1996.
Since minority physicians are 40 percent more likely to practice in low-income communities, it is in the country's best interest that we support them. Bilingual and bicultural physicians are a cost-effective way to provide health care services to diverse populations.

English Is Fundamental

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A major reason why Hispanic-Americans are falling into greater poverty (front page, Jan. 30) is the fact that they did not learn English. This reminds me of the quest to have young black students taught the broken, inner-city English that some educators want to call a language. As your article makes clear, speaking English well is fundamental to advancing in this society. 
 I am black. I received my basic education in Panama, my beloved native land. However, like many other blacks, foreign and American, I also studied in the United States.
In addition, I worked for I.B.M. for 25 years, have taught in the New York City public school system and just accepted a job as a security consultant. None of this would have happened if I had not learned proper English!

HEADLINE: Hispanics Suffer Loss of Health Care, Too;
Americans by Birth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article highlighting the decline in Hispanic household income (front page, Jan. 30) underscores the difficulties inherent with ethnic categories, specifically with the term "Hispanic." The article notes that Hispanics "range from typically prosperous Cuban-Americans of Miami to Puerto Rican Americans, largely concentrated in New York." However, there is no such official category as "Puerto Rican American." This categorization is redundant and awkward, akin to referring to "Texan Americans," or "New York Americans." 
 This issues goes right to the heart of American identity -- in this case, a misrepresentation of the relationship Puerto Ricans have had with the United States. Since 1917, American citizenship has been granted to all Puerto Ricans born either on the island or on the United States mainland. This alone differentiates Puerto Ricans from other Hispanic-Americans, who must go through naturalization and other immigration procedures to obtain citizenship.
Citizenship clearly does not automatically translate into success or inclusion in American society, nor should it. But relegating ethnic groups into categories that implicitly denote second-class citizenship only insures the continued fragmentation of our society and the further marginalization of America's ethnic minorities.

HEADLINE: An Inventive Los Angeles Music Station Will Change Format, a Casualty of Radio Economics

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
Junior Wells, a Chicago harmonica legend known as the godfather of the blues, was never a regular on the pop charts. But his remake of the singer Tracy Chapman's "Give Me One Reason" in the gut-bucket Mississippi Delta blues style, his harmonica wailing over an acoustic slide guitar, was a regular on the play list of KSCA-FM (101.9) in Los Angeles.
Since going on the air in July 1994, the station's blend of acoustic, electric, pop and roots music, along with live studio performances, never broke into the top 25 in the radio rankings. But it did develop a loyal following among listeners, including Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Springsteen. 
 "It doesn't get any better than that," said Nicole S. Sandler, KSCA's music director. "If serious musicians listen to us to hear other serious musicians, then we're doing something right."
Even so, at midnight Tuesday KSCA will sign off, to be reborn a day later as the 11th Spanish-language station in the nation's No. 2 radio market. In its reincarnation, the station, now owned by Gene and Jackie Autry, will be managed by a company controlled by Clear Channel Communications Inc. That company already owns two top-rated Los Angeles Spanish-language stations, KLVE-FM and KTNQ-AM.
"If I were them, I'd do exactly what they're doing," said Bill Ward, KSCA's general manager. "But listeners are the poorer for it."
The makeover of KSCA is, in many ways, a parable for the changes sweeping the radio business. It reflects the industry's deregulation, which allows one company to control several stations in one market, as well as skyrocketing station prices and new audience demographics.
The Autrys paid $15 million in 1985 for the 600-watt station, eventually increasing its transmitting power to 5,000 watts. On Jan. 15, the Clear Channel unit, the Heftel Broadcasting Corporation, signed an option to buy the station for $112 million on Gene Autry's death. The deal is part of the Autrys' continuing liquidation of assets; Mr. Autry is 89.
"Revenue has no relationship to the purchase price," said Allen S. Klein, a ratings consultant in Encino, Calif. "The signal is the commodity. There's a chess match going on because everyone is maneuvering for the future. In order to be a player in L.A. today, you have to match the ethnic profile of the marketplace."
KSCA's mostly white, baby-boomer audience earned the station a ranking of No. 30, or 1.1 percent of the audience tuning into the 48 commercial stations in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, in the most recent Arbitron ratings. Mr. Ward said the station had been profitable since its inception as KSCA in July 1994, but it generated no more than $10 million in gross revenue, by one estimate.
But revenue is the reason KSCA's format will vanish, Mr. Klein said.
In paying such a high price for KSCA, Heftel is hoping to better exploit opportunities for selling advertising with three stations. Spanish-language advertising represents 13 percent of the region's $550 million in annual ad revenue, and the bet is it will soon start to catch up with the growing Hispanic population.
According to Mr. Klein, low-power stations are commanding high prices "to fill in weaker coverage to make sure they cover the entire market."
Since limits on radio ownership were lifted last February, a record 2,159 stations have changed hands in deals totaling $13.8 billion, according to Radio and Records, a trade paper. Among the most voracious buyers was Clear Channel Communications of San Antonio, which spent $1.2 billion in four separate group acquisitions last year. Mark Mays, a Clear Channel executive, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
"I don't blame the Autrys," said Mr. Ward, who helped review auction proposals for the station. He said no potential bidders would commit themselves to retaining its current format and "no one came close to Clear Channel's offer."
"With prices going through the roof, larger companies aren't willing to take a chance," he said.
Steven Baker, the president of Reprise Records, went on the air last week decrying the station's loss, particularly for a stable of artists that got little air play elsewhere.
"When we go away," said Ms. Sandler, "there'll be a lot of artists who'll be homeless." 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 11, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Feb. 3 about a change in the format of a Los Angeles radio station misstated the title of Steven Baker, a record company executive who lamented the change. He is president of Warner Brothers Records, not president of Reprise Records, a Warner Brothers label.

HEADLINE: Twists and Turns in Chimp AIDS Research

BYLINE: By DAVID BERREBY 

 BODY:
IT was not easy for scientists to decide to use chimpanzees for AIDS research back in the 1980's. But as much as they hesitated to give the animals a fatal disease, researchers believed that they could console themselves with two thoughts: the chimpanzee would turn out to be a useful model for human AIDS, and the animals would come down with the disease soon after being infected, and thus would not suffer long.
Both assumptions turned out to be wrong. Years passed, grants expired and still the H.I.V.-infected chimps did not come down with AIDS. Researchers shifted to other animals. 
 Meanwhile, confined to windowless quarters and attended by caretakers in biocontainment "spacesuits," the chimps spent year after year living under conditions that were only supposed to last two or three years. Just last year, for instance, the Yerkes Regional Primate Center in Atlanta installed windows in the building where it keeps its H.I.V.-infected chimpanzees.
Now, nearly 13 years after the first infection of a chimp with H.I.V., one has died and a few others are sick, apparently from AIDS. Jerom, a 13-year-old male who was first infected in 1985, died early last year at Yerkes. Another chimp at Yerkes, a male named Nathan, received a transfusion of Jerom's blood before the first ape's death.
"We're certainly studying the effects on Nathan on a virological and immunological basis, and possibly looking at other chimps as well," said Dr. Frank Noviembre, a biologist who does AIDS research at Yerkes. "It's going to be interesting to look at what happened to Jerom and what's happening in Nathan and what possibly is happening in other chimps and try to correlate that with humans."
H.I.V. isolated from Jerom's blood was introduced into two more chimpanzees three months ago, one by injection and the other by application to her cervix. They have shown a steady decline in CD-4 blood cells, the immune cells that are attacked by the AIDS virus, said Dr. Patricia Fultz, a professor of microbiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who is conducting the study. Two more chimps will be infected anally within the month, Dr. Fultz said. The purpose of the experiment, she said, is to develop a model of how H.I.V. is acquired through different mucous membranes, which will be used to test and evaluate the effectiveness of possible vaccines.
Some AIDS researchers are focusing on factors that make the virus more easily transmitted. For example, a recent paper by Dr. Preston Marx, based on work done in monkeys at a Westchester research laboratory owned by New York University Medical School, suggests that vaginal transmission of the virus is enhanced by progesterone, a hormone whose synthetic version is used in birth control pills. Such work on methods of transmission might be another area in which chimps could prove useful to researchers.
"I think we can use long-term infected animals," Dr. Fultz said.
Not all researchers are convinced that Jerom died of human AIDS, but "there's a strong possibility that the consensus will shift," said Dr. Marx, who is director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York. "There is at least a variant of H.I.V.-1 that is causing an AIDS-like disease in chimpanzees," Dr. Marx said. "The question becomes, How different is that strain from the human strain?" The chance that larger numbers of chimpanzees could once again be used in AIDS research "has emerged," he said, "where a year ago that possibility did not exist."
The prospect that some or all of the country's 150 to 200 H.I.V.-infected chimpanzees will come down with AIDS raises a host of ethical questions. How much care, for example, should an AIDS-inflicted chimp receive? Should the animal be given AZT or protease inhibitors? At what stage of suffering, if at all, is euthanasia appropriate? If chimps with AIDS live on for decades, who will support them?
"It's a problem of economics more than anything," explained Dr. Noviembre, who said that he had not made up his mind about the question of euthanasia.
"If you have these chimps that are not progressing to disease," and another strain of H.I.V. is available that scientists want to test, Dr. Noviembre said, "but you have no other building, well, should you not do that research because you won't euthanize the chimps you have?"
He said: "When I first presented some of our results last year at a conference, I was talking to a guy from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and he said, you realize you've opened a big can of worms because the N.I.H. is about to say chimps aren't needed in AIDS research? I said, I know, but what can we do, really? We're just reporting what we're finding."

Investment Shift Cited in Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Global investments will shift from the United States and Western Europe to the developing economies of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe in the next five years, according to a French Government study.
Of those three regions, Asia is expected to be the big winner, according to the survey commissioned by the French Ministry of Economic Affairs. Africa and the Middle East will hold little appeal. 
 Fabrice Hatem, chief of the ministry's Study Center on International Investment, said yesterday that from 1985 to 1990, the United States and Western Europe received 85 percent of the direct investment by transnational companies.
Although investment in developed countries remains high, the report predicted that Asian nations would become the "favored investment destinations among developing countries during the next five years."
Former Communist countries of Eastern Europe and Latin America offer encouraging investment prospects, the report said, because of improved economies and deregulation.

HEADLINE: Officials Protest Reduced Housing Tax Credits

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The Pataki administration has sharply redirected the benefits of a Federal housing tax credit program to upstate New York, provoking protests from city officials and housing advocates in New York City, where the program has been a cornerstone of efforts to build homes for the poor.
Adding to the dispute is an audit of the program, released last week by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, which found widespread cost overruns and inefficiencies that it said had funneled off too much money for administration and investor profits instead of housing construction. 
 Statewide, the audit said, only 29 percent of the money raised through the tax credit program had been spent on housing construction, compared with an average of 50 percent across the nation. It looked at data from 1986 until July 31, 1995.
Some housing advocates, who said the program has been administered far more efficiently in New York City, said the city's share of the credits was now being reduced just as the program was taking on a more critical role for its poorest residents.
"We are very much aware of our smaller allocation, and it is creating problems in financing projects," said Cassandra Vernon, a spokeswoman for the city's Commissioner of Housing, Lilliam Barrios-Paolil. She said city officials were in discussions with the state, hoping to have the city's share of the tax credits increased.
Housing advocates said recent changes in the allocation of Federal tax credits were particularly troublesome, at least for poor people in the city, because they have come when a severe housing shortage for people at all income levels has combined with steep cuts in Section 8 rental subsidies and other Federal programs that have traditionally provided a safety net for the poor.
"No one suggests that poor people in New York City are any more deserving than poor people in Syracuse, but there is a housing crisis in the city and the tax credit program is about all we have left," said Paul Grogan, president of the Local Initiative Support Corporation, a nonprofit housing group that has administered most of the Federal tax credits made available in the city since the Federal program began in 1986.
According to an analysis by Mr. Grogan's group, the value of the Federal tax credits used by the state has been nearly constant, about $22.6 million a year, since 1992. But since Gov. George E. Pataki took office in 1995, New York City's share of the credits has declined sharply, from $18.2 million in 1994 to $11.4 million last year, the analysis showed.
A separate analysis by Mr. Grogan's group found that about 70 percent of the money generated through its Federal tax credits had been used for housing construction, far better than the national average.
Officials of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which controls allocation of the credits, challenged the analysis by Mr. Grogan's group, but acknowledged that under Governor Pataki, a smaller share of the Federal assistance was flowing to New York City
Harry Ryttenberg, a spokesman for the division, said the state had changed its formula for allocating the credits to conform to how the state's population is distributed, without regard to income levels. He said the reason for the shift was to be fair to other parts of the state.
During the state's current fiscal year, ending on July 1, he said 43.6 percent of the state's tax credits would be allocated in New York City, compared with an allocation to the city of more than 70 percent before Mr. Pataki became Governor.
Under the Federal tax credit program, developers of low-income housing can apply for the credits to help them finance their projects. Once assigned to a project, the credits are sold to corporations or wealthy individuals, who provide cash needed for construction and use the credits to reduce Federal personal or corporate taxes owed.

HEADLINE: Trade Pacts By Regions: Not the Elixir As Advertised

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
When efforts to liberalize world trade stalled in the early 1980's, Washington turned its attention to opening trade on a regional basis as the second-best choice. That produced the North American Free Trade Agreement and a dozen similar pacts among other nations. And most economists, who hold that free trade is close to heaven on earth, widely applauded. The regional agreements, they argued, would not just prod reluctant nations like Japan and France to drop their opposition to open markets to global trade, but they would also help developing countries lock in free market initiatives and improve the climate for foreign investment.
But this pragmatic consensus is fraying as the Clinton Administration's drive to create preferential trade areas reaching across the Pacific and Atlantic, as well as throughout the Americas, takes on a life of its own. Some economists are no longer convinced that all roads to open markets really do lead toward the economic Valhalla of a world without trading barriers. 
 "It's time to raise the warning flag," said Claude Barfield, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
The latest evidence that regional trade pacts like Nafta can have harmful effects on those excluded from the zone comes from the Caribbean Basin, where a World Bank study recently warned that Mexico could grab as much as one-third of the Caribbean's $12.5 billion in exports to the United States.
But the impact could be considerably broader. An unpublished study by a senior economist at the World Bank suggests that Mercosur, the preferential trade agreement intended to eliminate national barriers at the southern end of South America, has diverted substantial trade from more efficient producers outside the region.
The result of preferential trade areas, said Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economist, has been a "spaghetti bowl of tangled, inconsistent trade standards that just can't be good for efficiency."
It's a safe bet that the doubters will not remain on the sidelines much longer. For while much-ballyhooed trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade initiatives have met considerable resistance both overseas and in Congress, President Clinton is asking lawmakers for the right to pursue "fast track" negotiations toward a preferential trade area for all the Americas, starting with Chile. Moreover, some Administration officials still hope to extend Nafta to the Pacific, admitting, say, South Korea, in hope of putting pressure on the rest of Asia to join.
Every college text on international trade offers grounds to be skeptical of regional trade agreements. If, for example, Mexico trades freely with the United States but maintains barriers against imports from Japan and Europe, it may lose more from the loss of access to Toyotas and Fiats than it gains from easier access to Fords and Chryslers.
But most economists put aside such worries almost four decades ago to celebrate the creation of the European Economic Community, now the European Union. "Economic integration was seen as a bulwark against Communism," Mr. Bhagwati recalled. And while the rationale has changed, economists continued to defer to political strategists on issues of economic regionalism.
When Nafta was being negotiated, policy strategists for President George Bush and Mr. Clinton were never very serious about the argument that a regional pact with Mexico was needed to foster exports of American corn and computers. But they agreed that the pact would commit future Mexican governments to economic modernization that would reinforce the political stability of the continent. And history, they say, has proved them right: "The Mexican currency crisis in 1995 would have had catastrophic consequences" if Mexico had not been treaty-bound to keep its borders open to trade and investment, said Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.
C. Fred Bergsten, the head of the Institute for International Economics, argues that the Administration still sees regional zones as advancing world trade: "The idea has always been global liberalization initiated by regional agreement."
Why, then, have many other economists grown skeptical? For one thing, they worry that President Clinton's casual but often repeated equation of trade and warfare is tilting American policy toward economic nationalism -- a kinder, gentler version of what Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot have advocated, to be sure, but still a subtle form of mercantilism that threatens to undermine efforts to knit the global economy together.
The new mantra of opening foreign markets while defending our own, they suggest, points toward a "hub and spoke" trading order in which the United States dominates numerous regional preferential trade areas, rather than a worldwide system in which the American economy is merely first among equals. Within Nafta, for example, Washington can muscle preferences for Florida tomato growers that would never pass muster with the more independent bureaucrats at the World Trade Organization.
"People have begun to wake up to the U.S. policy of pressing regional arrangements as an end in themselves," said Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan.
The skeptics are also influenced by new research examining the risk that productivity-sapping trade diversion will outweigh productivity-enhancing trade creation. In the study that the World Bank has thus far refused to release, Alexander Yeats, principal economist of the organization's International Trade Division, draws disturbing conclusions about Mercosur, the preferential trade pact linking Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The most- traded products within Mercosur "generally are highly capital-intensive goods which members have not been able to export competitively to outside markets," he wrote.
Arvind Panagariya, co-director of the University of Maryland's Center for International Economics, voices related concerns about the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. Even if it would help other Latin American countries and Caribbean islands avoid excessive losses to Mexico, virtually all the gains would go to the United States, he concluded. And South American countries with high barriers against imports would risk serious losses from reduced trade with Europe.
Mr. Summers dismisses such doubts, suggesting that the Administration's aggressive pro-regionalism is a kind of policy maker's jujitsu -- one that redirects dangerous protectionist impulses into benign market-opening initiatives. "Regionalism is not just good mercantilism, it's good economics," he said.
Trouble is, Mr. Barfield of the American Enterprise Institute said, is that the argument is no longer so convincing to economists themselves.

HEADLINE: Unlock Family Planning Funds

 BODY:
Responding to pressure from anti-abortion activists, Congress has put so many restrictions on spending for international family planning programs that, according to the Clinton Administration, millions of people in developing countries are being denied access to contraceptives. America's role in population planning has thus been transformed from generous benefactor to parsimonious scold. The new Congress has a chance to turn matters around.
The United States helps to underwrite family planning programs in more than 60 countries, offering contraceptives like condoms and birth control pills and providing technical assistance to local family planning organizations, including training of health-care and family counselors and demographic research. 
 Many foreign groups that provide these services also offer information about abortions or actually perform abortions in countries where they are legal. As a matter of law and policy, no American money can be used for these purposes. That is, foreign organizations can only spend the money on contraceptives and other preventive programs. Even so, anti-abortion activists in the U.S. have managed to scare so many legislators that funding for even non-controversial birth control programs has suffered a dramatic decline, from $548 million in 1995 to $356 million in 1996.
Congress compounded the problem by putting a big chunk of this money in escrow. Only $72 million was actually released to foreign organizations last year, amounting to an effective decrease of 87 percent from the previous year. For 1997, Congress appropriated $385 million but delayed disbursement from the start of the fiscal year last October until July.
Congress promised to reconsider some of the restrictions if the Administration could show that the cuts had caused harm. The Administration now confirms that 17 of 95 overseas programs may have to shut down and that the reduced funding will result in "increased unintended pregnancies, more abortions, higher numbers of maternal and infant deaths and, of course, more births."
These arguments are echoed in a recent report from the Rockefeller Foundation. The foundation argues that family planning programs have reduced average family size and improved the health and survival of women and children, resulting in better economic and environmental prospects in developing countries.
Congress is expected to vote later this month on whether to allow the funds allotted for 1997 to be released starting March 1, instead of waiting until July. That vote is supposed to be yes or no, with no amendments. But Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and an outspoken opponent of these programs, wants to offer a separate measure requiring overseas recipients of American money to promise not to perform abortions or give abortion counseling.
Neither the White House nor the Senate is likely to find that acceptable, leading to a stalemate that would keep the funds locked up until midyear. House leaders should ignore Mr. Smith's divisive tactics and abide by their original agreement. Worthy international family planning programs have already been punished enough. They deserve a fair vote on the merits.

HEADLINE: Dow Edges 6.93 Lower to Finish at 6,806.16

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stocks put in a mixed performance yesterday after the release of a report showing that manufacturing activity weakened last month.
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 6.93 points, to close at 6,806.16 in a lackluster day of trading, but the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.57, to 786.73. And bond prices rose as the market reacted favorably to the economic news, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.73 percent from 6.78 percent on Friday. 
 Analysts said that many investors were already looking ahead to today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. While few expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates this week, investors usually keep an eye on such meetings for any signal about the economy.
"Today's market really says very little about investors' state of mind," Alan Ackerman, an executive vice president at Fahnestock & Company, said. "I.B.M. took some of the starch out of the Dow, but the bond market performed very well."
Most of the Dow's loss was attributed to I.B.M., whose shares fell 2, to 154 7/8, in light trading. Du Pont also fell, off 1 1/2, to 108 1/8. Texaco, Exxon and Chevron also lost ground. Texaco fell, 5/8, to 104 3/8; Exxon was down 1 3/8, to 102 1/4, and Chevron fell 1/8, to 66 1/4.
The Dow's best performers yesterday were Philip Morris, General Electric and Coca-Cola, all of which have had strong runs this year. Philip Morris rose 3 1/2, to 122 3/8; G.E. was up 1 3/4, to 105 1/4, and Coca-Cola was up 1 5/8, to 59 1/2.
Broader market indexes were also mixed. While the S.& P. 500 was up, the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.80, to 1,376.05.
Several technology stocks took a drubbing yesterday, but Intel continued to rise strongly. Its shares gained 1 5/8, to 163 7/8, another high. For the year, Intel has risen 25 percent, and in the last 52 weeks, the world's largest semiconductor company is up 191 percent. That has been enough to push its market capitalization into third place among American companies, at $134.5 billion, behind G.E. and Coke.
While small-capitalization stocks -- as measured by the Russell 2000 index -- have risen just 1.9 percent this year, the Nasdaq's index of its 100 largest stocks, which include leading technology companies, has gained 11.8 percent.
On Nasdaq, Dell, Intel and Microsoft have all gained more than 22 percent this year. Apple Computer, which is in a major revamping, continues to perform dismally, however. It lost 5/16 yesterday, to 16 5/16. For the year, Apple has lost 22 percent. Apple shares have not traded this low since 1986.
Some analysts say technology stocks continue to benefit from a market that is flush with cash. Portfolio managers, the analysts say, are eager to put their money to work, and foreign investors are hoping to participate in one of the longest bull runs in history. Consequently they invest heavily in the best-performing stocks.
"This market's being driven by liquidity," Gail Dudack, a market strategist at UBS Securities, said. "We have a new buyer in the foreigner, and you can see his footprints when the market moves early and late in the day. That's classic foreign buying."
But Ms. Dudack, who says she has been bearish since August, warns that the market is overvalued, noting that the S.& P. 500 companies have been trading close to 20 times earnings.
In August, she said that UBS Securities trimmed its equity holdings to 45 percent from 55 percent, with 25 percent in cash, up from 15 percent. "That's the highest cash I've had since 1990," she said.
Asked whether the market has taken notice of high valuations, she added: "We've disconnected from valuation. It's going to take something that really shoots the whole Goldilocks economy full of holes before the market gets any meaningful correction."

HEADLINE: First Lady Talks of Mice and Men on 'Rosie' Show

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
"This is getting too nice," Oscar the Grouch finally grumbled on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" today, after Hillary Rodham Clinton had finished warbling about "goin' steady," and chortling about getting kissed on the cheek by Tom Cruise, and showing off a picture of herself in ponytail and pink poodle skirt at a White House 50's party in the arms of "my handsome husband."
Mrs. Clinton amply demonstrated today the quality that her old friends and White House aides universally ascribe to her: complexity. On the same day that she made her confectionary appearance on Ms. O'Donnell's syndicated show, which was taped last week, she delivered a speech at a development conference here, declaring: "Microcredit is an invaluable tool in alleviating poverty, promoting self-sufficiency and stimulating economic activity." 
 On the television show, Mrs. Clinton sat smiling in an easy chair, occasionally reached over to pat Ms. O'Donnell's hand and dropped the policy wonkery altogether.
"Sometimes I'll look at my husband," she confided, "and he'll be doing something really official and important, and I'll think, my gosh, he's the President, and we live in the White House."
It is safe to say that Hillary Clinton is no longer hiding her light under a bushel. Since just before President Clinton's second inauguration last month, she has made several high-profile public appearances and granted a series of interviews, generally in cozy formats.
Ms. O'Donnell is known more for warmth and enthusiastic if off-key singing than for withering interrogation of her guests. There was no talk today of Mrs. Clinton's role in setting health care policy or her success in trading cattle futures. The only frightening visitors to the Lincoln Bedroom that the two women discussed were ghosts -- not the big Democratic financial donors who, since the campaign, have come back to haunt the Administration.
"We run a very open house," Mrs. Clinton said, describing sleepovers held by her daughter, Chelsea, and her own visits from friends.
The only hint that there might be a mailed fist beneath the velvet came when Mrs. Clinton revealed which traps were used to catch mice in the White House. "We have the humane ones until we get really tired of them," she said. "Then it's: Nuke 'em."
Mrs. Clinton entered to the theme music from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," and the two women fell quickly to chatting about their shared passion for the comedy. Mrs. Clinton said she particularly enjoyed "anytime when she would get into one of those great snits with Lou Grant. She'd go" -- Mrs. Clinton faced the audience and squinched her eyes shut -- "Ahhhhhhh!"
She added, "I feel like that all the time."
Mrs. Clinton provided Ms. O'Donnell with some White House M&Ms, explaining her weight-watching theory that "if you eat these quickly, they don't count."
There was much digging of elbows and winking at the audience. Mrs. Clinton said at one point that she would reveal that the White House had mice if Ms. O'Donnell would "promise not to tell anybody."
Mrs. Clinton seemed happy to talk about family life at the White House, showing off pictures of herself at parties, including one in which she dressed as Dolly Parton in gingham skirt and abundant blond wig. Mr. Clinton is a Dolly Parton fan of long-standing, and kept a life-size poster of her in his private bathroom when he was Arkansas state attorney general, according to the biography "First in His Class," by David Maraniss (Simon & Schuster, 1995).
Among syndicated talk shows, Ms. O'Donnell's program is second only to Oprah Winfrey's in popularity, drawing an average of 5.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.
Those viewers were treated today to the First Lady's rendition of "The Telephone Hour," a number from "Bye Bye Birdie," which Mrs. Clinton performed in as a girl.
She perhaps punned by accident, when, in describing how a teacher ordered her to lip-sync during the performance, she referred to the musical duo Milli Vanilli. "I was the original Milli Vanilla," she said.
"I can't carry a tune at all, not even in the shower," she confessed.
But Mrs. Clinton launched into the song anyway, trading lines with Ms. O'Donnell like a couple of Pink Ladies from another musical, "Grease," which starred Ms. O'Donnell during part of its Broadway run.
"Did they really get pinned?" Mrs. Clinton inquired in song. "Did she kiss him and cry?" She finished laughing along with the audience, and exchanged a high-five with Ms. O'Donnell.
Mrs. Clinton closed out her 40-minute appearance with a chat with Oscar the Grouch, who, nervously fingering the edge of his trash can, confessed to a crush on the First Lady. "You have brains," he said. "Grouches like that."
Mrs. Clinton kissed Oscar -- though not on the lips, as he has none -- and presented him with what she called "real honest trash from the White House," including a coffee filter.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing and Design Links Are Encouraged

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
New York City's failure to link its designers and manufacturers is costing the city jobs and marketable products, a new study says. To solve the problem, the two sectors should create a design center and a trade council, and foster more communication, the report suggests.
The work, by the New York Design/Production Project, is a joint effort of the Municipal Art Society, a nonprofit group dedicated to urban design and planning, and the Industrial Technical Assistance Corporation, a nonprofit organization seeking greater manufacturing productivity. The report, follows a six-month survey of design and manufacturing capabilities. 
 To be released tomorrow, the report is meant to strengthen the bond between designers and manufacturers and enhance New York's status as a design hub.
The city may be missing an important chance for growth, the report says.
It gave examples of missed opportunities, including one of a sign designer working for a New York architect who ordered $50,000 worth of stainless steel signs from Toronto, while there are 80 companies in New York that supply architectural metal work. And some major merchandisers, the report said, are more familiar with Far East producers than those in New York.
The report, "Designed in New York/Made in New York," does not quantify just how much money New York may be losing, but it does list a number of concerns about the lack of communication.
Some steps to remedy the situation are already planned, though, including a symposium tomorrow to discuss the report, an exhibit mounted by the Municipal Art Society to profile local products and a manufacturers' database called NYConnect, to be developed by the Industrial Technical Assistance Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed as Some Traders See Pressures to Halt Its Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday, reflecting growing nervousness over whether the leading industrial nations would act to halt the currency's rise at their meeting in Berlin this weekend.
Traders said the dollar was supported by more evidence of a healthy American economy and by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's reaffirmation that the Clinton Administration favored a strong dollar. 
 Nonetheless, the will among traders to bid the dollar higher was noticeably absent for the first time this year, and some used the opportunity to lock in profits from the dollar's strength. In January alone, the dollar rose nearly 5 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 6 percent against the German mark.
Traders said concern that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and the United States -- might take action to stop the dollar's ascent played a major role in the market's behavior. The group is holding a two-day meeting, starting Saturday.
In New York yesterday, the dollar cost 121.68 yen, up from 121.38 yen on Friday. The dollar cost 1.6400 marks, up from 1.6383. The pound reached $1.6189, up from $1.6007.
The dollar's mixed showing began in Asian dealings, reflecting the impact of official Japanese comments that suggested that Japan would seek help from its Group of Seven counterparts to stop the dollar's appreciation against the yen.
The dollar showed further weakness as an indirect result of strength in the mark and the Swiss franc, partly because of new doubts whether Europe's efforts to establish a single currency in 1999 would remain on schedule.
George Soros, the financier who has often been successful speculating in currencies, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, over the weekend that he was skeptical of the single-currency plan. Kenneth Clarke, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, also repeated his doubts about the plan.
The dollar began to strengthen in American trading after the bond market rallied when the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly report on the economy depicted moderate growth and little inflationary pressure.

U.N. Plaza Hotel Is Back on Market

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Amid a surge in tourism and growing demand by investors for New York City hotels, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday brought one of the city's choicest business assets, the 427-room United Nations Plaza Hotel, back onto the market following a failed attempt to sell it in 1995.
The hotel is considered a centerpiece of the Mayor's campaign to sell off city assets, particularly those that cast it in the role of landlord or property manager. It occupies about a fifth of the space of the United Nations Plaza, a complex of two 39-story towers across the street from the United Nations at First Avenue and 44th Street. "The Mayor has always said the city should not be in the hotel business, and this is an excellent time to sell," said Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. 
 J.P. Morgan, the city's financial adviser, was to begin circulating documents spelling out the terms of the sale today among several large international hotel concerns, including Hyatt International, which already has a management contract to operate the United Nations Plaza complex. People close to the transaction said the city hopes to receive several bids by the end of March. Mr. Millard declined to say what price the city was seeking. Although the United Nations Plaza has been consistently profitable since it was built -- the first tower in 1975, the second in 1983 -- its sale is complicated by its complex ownership structure, which involves the city and the United Nations Development Corporation, a separate legal entity.

HEADLINE: South Korea's Growing Pains;
Despite a World-Class Economy, a Nation Senses Decline

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
During the dirt-poor years after the Korean War, South Koreans were exhorted to extend the lives of pencils by attaching sticks to stubs that had become too short to grip.
Four decades later, the Seoul Education Office is reviving the slogan. "It's time to grasp the used-up pencils again," it said in a recent newspaper advertisement that called on students and their parents to "take the lead in saving our economy." 
 "Let's turn off the lights, even a single lamp, and save water, even a single drop," the ad said. "Let's correct the habit of showing off by wearing expensive clothes or using imported stationery."
Such penny-pinching might seem out of place in a nation of 45 million people that is now the world's 11th-largest economy, with a per capita output that has quadrupled in the past decade to more than $10,000.
But though it has performed an economic miracle, South Korea is now gripped by a deep unease about its future. Economic growth is slowing, the stock market is near a four-year low, the Korean won has sunk to its lowest exchange rate against the dollar in a decade, and the trade deficit has more than doubled in the last year. Banks are hobbled by bad debt, businesses are strangled in red tape, and wages are soaring, weakening industrial competitiveness.
Suddenly, it seems to Koreans, the era of fast growth is ending, endangering hopes that their country will make the leap from industrialization to a high-technology economy on a par with the United States and Japan. The sense of crisis has been punctuated by two events in the last month -- a nationwide strike in reaction to a new labor law that threatens job security, and the stunning collapse of Hanbo Steel, flagship of the nation's 14th-largest conglomerate, under nearly $6 billion in debt and a cloud of corruption.
"Most people don't think it's a cycle but that structurally something is wrong," said Kim Pyung Koo, a professor of economics at Sogang University in Seoul. "South Korea is being sandwiched between fully industrialized economies and less developed, low-cost economies like China."
In fact, though, some of the gloom is unwarranted. Yes, the pace of growth has faltered from 9 percent two years ago to an expected 6 percent this year, but that is still more than twice as fast as expected growth in the United States. And while a recent newspaper editorial was headlined "Soaring Unemployment," the jobless rate it lamented was 2.4 percent, a figure most other countries can only dream of.
Moreover, some problems are cyclical. One reason for the surging trade deficit, for instance, is that prices of computer memory chips, which make up 16 percent of South Korea's exports, have collapsed to a fifth of their levels a year ago because of oversupply, not because South Korean companies are losing competitiveness. The fall of the Japanese yen in the last year has made Japanese products more competitive, hurting South Korean exports.
What is happening is that South Korea's economy is maturing. And the development model the country has used -- heavy Government direction of business, tightly closed markets, export-led growth and the funneling of resources to industry at the expense of consumers -- is running out of steam, just as it is in Japan, where the model was first perfected.
The Government has announced plans to embark on economic changes -- deregulating the financial system, opening markets, chipping away at the power of the family-owned conglomerates known as chaebol as well as at lifetime employment, seniority-based pay and other workplace practices that seem ill suited for a more competitive age.
But the changes so far have been gradual and sometimes half-hearted, just as they have been in Japan. And some critics say that the Government of President Kim Young Sam seems adrift. Rather than taking bold measures, they say, it is offering half-measures or symbolic gestures, like exhorting against the consumption of expensive foreign goods.
The issues at the heart of South Korea's economic malaise are such serious ones as:
*A quadrupling of wages since 1987, a faster rise than in other Asian "tigers" like Taiwan and Singapore. That has forced a mass exodus of light industries, such as shoe manufacturing, to lower-wage countries in Asia. Such a migration is now starting for cars, electronics and other heavier industries as well.
*Banks weighed down by bad debts and a lack of business acumen that stems from their longtime role as little more than agents of the Government, funneling loans to favored industries run by chaebol. Bribery of Government officials and bankers by businessmen wanting loans is common.
*A near-monopoly of credit by the chaebol that has allowed them to expand so fast that industry is swimming in overcapacity. It has also frozen out the sort of small entrepreneurial companies that in the United States have often been the pioneers in new technologies. Additionally, South Korea lacks the base of small, nimble parts suppliers that undergird the success of Japan's manufacturing giants. "Korea's industrial structure has an Arnold Schwarzenegger upper body on Woody Allen legs," said Stephen E. Marvin, head of research at Ssangyong Investment & Securities Company.
*A current account deficit, the broadest measure of trade, that more than doubled in 1996, to about $23 billion. Part of the problem is the dearth of small companies and the technological laggardness that force South Korea to import Japanese components and production machines for the cars, videocassette recorders, computer chips and ships it makes.
Now, the need for financial reform seems most urgent. With the financial system nearly closed to foreign capital, interest rates exceed 12 percent and the economy is starved for cash, said Park Ungsuh, president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute. Companies typically take six months to pay bills, meaning that smaller firms live from hand to mouth. "Stronger corporations survive; weaker ones simply collapse," Dr. Park said.
The Kim Government has lifted some restrictions on bank lending and raised the ceiling on foreign ownership of a South Korean corporation's stock to 20 percent from 15 percent. The President has promised further sweeping changes in the bloated financial sector, but since that would lead to mergers and layoffs, most analysts do not expect drastic action with a presidential election coming up at the end of the year.
One potential sticking point is that if banks are to be strengthened, it might be necessary to end the ban on chaebol ownership of them. But that would only strengthen these conglomerates that many people believe are already too powerful.
Once again President Kim appears to be vacillating. He came into office in 1993 pledging to force the conglomerates to concentrate on a few key businesses. But the Government then permitted the Samsung Group to enter the automobile business (though it did block the entrance of Hyundai into steelmaking).
On Mr. Kim's watch, in fact, the share of gross national product accounted for by the 30 largest chaebol actually rose, to 16.2 percent in 1995 from 13.5 percent in 1992, according to the Korea Economic Research Institute.
Some Government policies strike some analysts as silly or self-defeating. The push to use pencils down to the nub and other clarion calls to frugality -- like requesting that nightclub owners stop serving imported whisky and that vacationers stop spending so much on foreign travel -- are unlikely to have the desired effect of cutting the trade deficit and might only produce charges of protectionism by South Korea's trading partners. Besides, far from being profligate, South Koreans have one of the highest savings rates in the world.
The Government has taken one decisive move to raise the country's competitiveness: a new labor law that makes it easier for companies to lay off workers and tame breakneck growth in wages. But that has led to labor strife, and many economists think the move was unnecessary.
In many cases, companies are offering bonuses to workers, particularly higher-paid managers in their 40's and 50's, to retire "with honor," though it is usually anything but. News reports and television dramas characterize these humbled men as "fathers with bowed heads."
The seniority system, in which everyone's wages advance together with years of service, is also starting to give way to merit pay, a concept that does not sit well in a nation that prides itself on egalitarianism.
"I don't necessarily like the Wall Street system either," said Milton S. Kim, president of Ssangyong Investment & Securities, referring to the huge salaries paid to Wall Street stars. "But if our market is opening up and Morgan Stanley and Goldman, Sachs are poaching our best people, what choice do I have?"
For all South Korea's travails, other fast-growing nations of Asia, where export growth and economic growth have slowed in the last year, are in the same boat. And for South Korea, at least, the boat isn't about to capsize.
In most industries now at the core of the Korean economy -- steel, shipbuilding, cars and electronics -- the major rival is Japan, where wages are much higher. South Korea can still sell products that are less expensive, if lower in quality, than the Japanese.
"Korea is midpriced, midtech capital and intermediate goods," Mr. Marvin of Ssangyong Securities said. "Midpriced, midtech goods are exactly what China needs, it's what Eastern Europe needs and Latin America needs."
Some analysts are even hopeful that the forces of global competition and deregulation will force the chaebol to reform on their own. The Ssangyong Group, for instance, is now negotiating to sell its money-losing automobile business to the Samsung Group, so it can concentrate on areas like cement and oil where it is stronger.
Sakong Il, a former finance minister who is now chairman of the Institute for Global Economics, a Seoul research organization, said that, amid all the economic turmoil, South Koreans must accept that they are moving a notch up the international economic pecking order. That means, he noted, they cannot expect the breakneck growth of old.
"It's like you're doing 80 miles per hour and suddenly you have a speed limit and have to drop to 60," Dr. Sakong said. "You have to get used to it."

HEADLINE: In Address to Governors, Lott Opposes Medicaid Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Even while pledging to work with President Clinton in a bipartisan spirit, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said today that he opposed Mr. Clinton's proposal to set firm limits on Federal Medicaid spending. He also said there was little money available to fix the new welfare law in ways sought by the President.
Mr. Lott told the National Governors' Association that he agreed with its position on Medicaid, adamantly opposing a limit on Federal spending in the program. Governors fear that such a limit would shift costs to the states, which already pay 42 percent of Medicaid costs nationwide. 
 "I never have liked the idea of a per-capita cap," Mr. Lott said. "Your policy statement is right on target."
To be sure, Mr. Lott said, "we're going to have to find some ways to control the increasing cost of this program," which finances health care for 37 million low-income people. But neither he nor the governors specified how that should be done, except to say that state officials should be given more control over design of the program.
Since its creation in 1965, Medicaid has been an open-ended program, providing health insurance to people who meet eligibility criteria set by Federal and state laws. While preserving the entitlement, Mr. Clinton would, for the first time, impose a firm limit on Federal Medicaid spending to guarantee that per-capita Medicaid costs rise no faster than the nation's per-capita economic output.
In the budget he announces this week, Mr. Clinton will also ask Congress to restore food stamps and disability benefits for some legal immigrants who lose such assistance under the new welfare law, which he signed on Aug. 22.
Vice President Al Gore, in a speech to the governors today, said that "it is just plain wrong" to deny benefits to legal immigrants who "work here, live here legally, pay taxes, even serve in the military." Referring to the immigrants' plight, he said: "It needs to be addressed. And it can be addressed without 'opening up welfare reform.' "
Governors of New York, Florida, Illinois and other states with large immigrant populations have sought such relief, and the governors' association is poised to adopt a cautiously worded resolution calling on Congress to meet the needs of legal immigrants who are too old or disabled to become citizens.
Rahm I. Emanuel, a senior adviser to the President, said, "We're pleased to see bipartisan agreement that the restrictions on benefits for immigrants are extraneous to the welfare law and welfare reform."
But Senator Lott said that "it would be very hard for us to come back and open up" the welfare law. "If you open that barn door, a lot of horses will run out," he said, alluding to the desire of Democrats to change other parts of the law.
Mr. Lott promised to work with the governors but said that even their proposal to restore benefits for a limited number of immigrants would erode the savings achieved by the new law. "You're talking about taking away maybe a quarter of what we had in terms of savings in our welfare bill," he said. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law would save the Federal Government a total of $55 billion over seven years.
Mr. Clinton met with governors at the White House this morning. After the meeting, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, said he welcomed the President's effort to restore benefits for some immigrants. Asked if Republicans in Congress would accept the idea, Mr. Pataki said: "It's going to be part of the totality of the budget negotiations. I hope that, as the process moves forward, they would accept it."
Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a Democrat, said the President recognized that there would be "a lot of resistance" to his proposal on benefits for immigrants. But, Mr. Chiles said, the President indicated that "as we get further down the line, it might be part of an overall settlement."
On Medicaid, the governors spoke with one voice. Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, said the President's proposal to set a limit on Federal Medicaid spending would not be acceptable unless states had much more power to design the program and control costs.
"If the Medicaid cap is not accompanied by the kind of flexibility that would allow us to set eligibility, benefit levels and the rate of reimbursement for health care providers, then it virtually handcuffs us," Mr. Wilson said.

HEADLINE: Reports Show U.S. Economy Is Moderating

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Several economic reports issued today suggested that growth was moderating, which could persuade the Federal Reserve to refrain from raising interest rates at its meeting this week.
A survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that the previously robust manufacturing sector had slowed in January, while a Commerce Department report showed that construction spending fell in December for the first time in six months.
The Commerce Department also reported that personal incomes outpaced consumer spending in December. Consumer spending represents two-thirds of economic activity.
The reports suggested that Fed officials, when they meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, would not feel compelled to raise interest rates to keep the economy from overheating and igniting inflation.
"The reports seem to show the economy is not accelerating as we begin the new year and, in fact, may be showing more moderate growth," said Lynn Reaser, an economist with Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla.
"The message seems to be that the economy is doing well, but price pressures in general are going to remain relatively subdued," she added.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin agreed, telling reporters as he left a Congressional hearing that the economy was "on the path of solid growth and low inflation."
On Friday, the Government reported that gross domestic product rose at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, considerably more than economists had expected, but that inflation remained subdued.
Today, the purchasing managers said their index, based on a survey of corporate executives, fell to 52 points in January from 53.8 a month earlier. While indicating a slowdown in the growth rate, a reading of more than 50 suggests that the industrial economy continues to expand.
"The manufacturing sector grew, but less rapidly in January than in December, with production and new orders indicating a decline in growth," said Norbert J. Ore, head of the association's survey panel.
A price index in the purchasing survey rose for a second consecutive month, but Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said the increase chiefly reflected higher natural gas prices and a temporary pickup in copper and aluminum prices.
"We don't see much inflation risk in the report," he said.
The Commerce Department said construction spending on residential, nonresidential and government projects fell seven-tenths of a percent in December, holding the year's growth to 4 percent, little changed from the 3.8 percent gain of 1995.
Analysts attributed some of the drop at the end of the year to severe weather in the West, but predicted that residential activity would level off this year and nonresidential construction would grow more slowly.
In December, spending on single-family homes -- more than 25 percent of total outlays -- slipped three-tenths of a percent, the fourth consecutive decline. Spending on apartments and condominiums fell 1.4 percent.
Spending on nonresidential projects like factories and office buildings fell 1.9 percent. Government outlays were down 1.3 percent in December, the first drop in four months.
The department also reported that personal incomes shot up eight-tenths of a percent in December, the biggest advance since an increase of nine-tenths of a percent last June. As a result, incomes in 1996 were 5.5 percent higher than in 1995.
At the same time, personal spending rose five-tenths of a percent, after gains of four-tenths of a percent in November and nine-tenths of a percent in October. For the year, it was 4.6 percent higher than in 1995.
"The income data point to buoyant demand in the first quarter," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "While consumer spending in the fourth quarter was quite strong, consumers kept some of their money in the bank."
"As a result, the savings rate actually increased, to 5.4 percent," he added. "This additional liquidity will buffer the effect of high consumer debt loads and keep spending growing at 2 to 2.5 percent in the first few months."

HEADLINE: January Car Sales Up 2.3%; Foreign Makers Have Surge

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Foreign auto makers showed the biggest sales gains in the American auto market last month as the strong dollar continued to help them offer generous lease deals and low prices.
Among the nine auto makers reporting January results today, sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago. Foreign auto makers reporting results today saw their combined sales rise 10.9 percent, while the combined sales of the two American auto makers reporting results today dropped a tenth of 1 percent. 
 The Chrysler Corporation said today that its sales rose 1.5 percent in January, while the General Motors Corporation's sales dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent in the month, compared with 1996. The Toyota Motor Corporation and the Ford Motor Company are expected to announce their January results on Tuesday, with Toyota's January results expected to be strong and Ford sales to be flat or up slightly.
Japanese manufacturers reporting results today saw their January sales rise 11.1 percent. American executives said that the strong dollar had given their competitors an unfair advantage.
The Japanese have the ability to offer subsidized leases, "cut prices and provide incentives because the yen is as weak as it is," said Steven A. Torok, Chrysler's executive director for sales and marketing operations. "The industry over all is concerned about it; we don't think it is a fair situation."
The dollar has risen 52 percent against the Japanese yen and 20 percent against the German mark from its lows in April 1995. A strong dollar makes it cheaper for auto makers to ship cars here from overseas, and even to build cars here with a lot of imported parts. Their profits on the substantial numbers of cars built in the United States become stronger when they are translated into yen or marks.
Foreign auto makers have lured customers by passing on some of those gains, leaving prices unchanged at the beginning of the current model year on Oct. 1 while American auto makers raised their prices roughly in line with inflation.
The weak yen amounts to a "tailwind on a very good set of products," said Nicholas J. Colas, an auto analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The market share of Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Mitsubishi combined is likely to reach 21 percent in January, Mr. Colas said. Their share of the United States market in January 1996 was 19 percent, while the Big Three had 73.5 percent.
Among foreign auto makers, the Honda Motor Company and Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, set the pace, with Honda's sales up 21.1 percent and Subaru's up 24.5 percent. Trailing them today were the Nissan Motor Company, up 10.7 percent, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, down 4.2 percent, and Isuzu Motors Ltd., down 28.5 percent.
But with overall sales up just 2.3 percent so far, today's results could provide yet another reason for top Federal Reserve officials to keep short-term interest rates on hold when they begin meeting in Washington on Tuesday. Some dealers said past labor strife hurt their sales. Raymond J. Scarpelli Sr., a Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealer in Antioch, Ill., complained of a shortage of sport utility vehicles, like the Chevrolet Blazer, and pickup trucks, a lack he attributed partly to G.M.'s four strikes over the last year.
"Sales have been pretty good; if we had more inventory, they would be fine," Mr. Scarpelli said.
Ronald L. Zarrella, head of G.M.'s North American vehicle sales, service and marketing, predicted that overall sales would pick up during the second half of the year. "Late model-year changes and a strong January a year ago affected the percentage comparison this January," Mr. Zarrella said.
G.M.'s competition might soon be crimped. Toyota's ability to ship more cars and trucks to the United States over the coming month might be affected by a fire at an auto parts factory in Japan today. Marjorie Schussel, a Toyota spokeswoman, said the company would have to close eight of its nine assembly plants in Japan on Tuesday for lack of brakes and clutches normally produced at the factory.
She added that Toyota hoped production would be back to normal by early next week, and that there would be no immediate effect on assembly operations in North America or car shipments here. The parts factory belongs to the Aisin Seiki Company, which is 22.6 percent owned by Toyota.
Many auto makers reported slower truck sales after a year in which buyers could not get enough pickups, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans. G.M.'s truck sales fell 6.7 percent, while its car sales rose 4 percent.
Chrysler said its car sales rose 8 percent while sales of its mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickups fell 1 percent. Mr. Torok said the decline might have been related to weather.
That was the conclusion reached by Kelly Rooney, sales manager at Hampden Dodge in Springfield, Mass., who said that pickup truck sales were slower than a year ago. "The lack of snow has kind of set it back a little," he said.

HEADLINE: Job Search Lures Mexicans to Far Corners of U.S.

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: GUADALAJARA, Mexico

 BODY:
Few places in the United States would seem less likely to attract Mexican migrant workers than Alaska.
But that's where Dr. Martin D'Giesecke Garcia headed after the peso devaluation wiped out his medical practice here and tripled his mortgage payments in 1995. He boarded a plane for Kodiak Island, where in a growing community of Mexican workers he found a job gutting cod on a trawler in the Bering Sea. 
 Rigoberto Ayala provides another example of how Mexico's migrant labor patterns are changing. Starting in 1984, Mr. Ayala traveled back and forth each year between his hometown, 50 miles east of Guadalajara, and Stockton, Calif., where he harvested sugar beets. But since 1991 he has been traveling instead to Hawaii to work in the pineapple and cane fields.
Over the decades, millions of Mexicans have headed from Guadalajara, and the vast agricultural region that surrounds it, north to traditional work sites like the lettuce fields of California, the cattle ranches of Texas and the restaurant kitchens of Chicago. But now Mexican workers are finding new frontiers, responding to a demand for cheap labor in parts of the United States far from its southwestern border.
Growing numbers are traveling not only to Alaska and Hawaii, but also to cultivate mushrooms in Pennsylvania, build offices in Atlanta, milk cows in Idaho, harvest tobacco in North Carolina, slaughter pigs in Iowa, manicure lawns in New Jersey, wash dishes in Michigan, clean fish in Maryland and bale hay in South Dakota.
As Jorge Durand, a University of Guadalajara demographer who has studied migration since 1980, put it: "Mexican workers are traveling to new areas, crisscrossing the United States in ways that break dramatically with traditional patterns."
The dispersion of Mexicans into virtually all 50 states has increased since 1986, when passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act legalized the status of more than two million Mexicans who had been working in the United States without documents. The law enabled them to migrate to remote regions without risking arrest, Mr. Durand said.
The trend has accelerated since the 1994 peso crisis, when many middle-class Mexicans began traveling north in search of work, demographers say. Those more affluent workers have found it easier to migrate into areas previously unexplored by their countrymen, because many have tourist visas and can afford air travel.
Not counting migrant workers, there were 6.7 million Mexican-born people living in the United States in 1996, according to Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer at the Urban Institute in Washington, a nonprofit research organization. The number of workers who travel seasonally between Mexican homes and American work sites can be only roughly estimated, he said, but it may be as large as two million. Mexicans are now America's largest immigrant group by far, he added, constituting 28 percent of the foreign-born population, up from 7 percent in 1970.
"There's an identifiable presence of Mexicans in all kinds of states where there's never been any before," Mr. Passel said recently at a Mexican Government-sponsored conference on Mexican migration. "This has really exploded since the 1990 census."
Ever since Mexican migration to the United States became institutionalized during World War II, when a Government-sponsored program brought thousands of farm workers north, California has been Mexicans' main destination.
But since California's economy plunged into recession and anti-immigrant fervor spread, many Mexicans have gone elsewhere, said Rudolfo Figueroa, a diplomat who directs a Mexican Government program to provide health, education and other services to Mexicans in the United States.
The new patterns are reflected in the increasing number of Mexican Government offices in the United States. They now total 54, many in unexpected places like Charlotte, N.C., and Buffalo. Since 1991, four consulates have been opened, in Orlando; Portland, Ore.; Santa Ana, Calif., and Douglas, Ariz.
"Many Mexicans who worked in California have gone east and north," Mr. Figueroa said, "provoking the growth of new Mexican communities in the center of the country and on the eastern seaboard. And that's obligated us to expand into areas that we didn't work before."
A consular office has also opened in Honolulu to serve the estimated 15,000 Mexicans now working in Hawaii. One is Mr. Ayala, 31, who said in a telephone interview from Maui that after migrating between his hometown of Ocotlan and Hawaii for six years, he had obtained American residency documents.
But he is not sure where he will settle. "That depends on whether I get married in Mexico or Hawaii," he said, adding that he had been laid off by a sugar company and was unemployed.
Anchorage has a new consular office as well. Some 20,000 Mexicans have settled in Alaskan cities including Juneau and Fairbanks, where most work in hotels and restaurants. There is also a contingent on Kodiak Island, where many clean fish in the 11 canneries, said Hugo Abel Castro, the Mexican consul in Seattle, who supervises the Anchorage office.
Among the Mexicans traveling to Alaska to work have been many unemployed teachers, lawyers and other professionals. One was Dr. D'Giestecke, who concluded after reading help-wanted advertisements placed by American fishing companies in a Mexican magazine in 1995 that a trip to Alaska might help him pay off his debts.
There were five American crew members on the Kodiak Island fishing vessel where he found work. The three others were Mexican: one experienced seaman, an agronomist and an accountant. The latter two had lost their jobs in Mexico.
After cleaning cod on the open sea for two months, Dr. D'Giestecke returned home with about $3,000 in savings, which helped him reduce his debts, he said. Will he go back?
"If I need money I will," he said. "I have friends in Alaska now."

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Warns Rhode Island About Water Quality Efforts

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency has warned Rhode Island that unless the state increases its spending on water pollution programs, the Federal agency might revoke its authority to carry out the Clean Water Act.
If that were to happen, the E.P.A. would assume the responsibilities. 
 John P. DeVillars, the E.P.A.'s northeast regional administrator, issued the warning on Friday in a letter to Gov. Lincoln C. Almond. He said his "grave concern" over how the state had been carrying out the Federal law was "caused by a history of cuts and the disturbing prospect of future reductions."
Peyton Fleming, a spokesman for the state's environmental agency, said today that state officials were still considering how to respond to Mr. DeVillars.
The Federal agency has never revoked the authority of a state to issue and enforce water pollution permits. The agency is reluctant to do so because it lacks the staff and budget for direct control of these permits, which are at the heart of the nation's water pollution control program. The permits regulate all discharges of waste water into streams, lakes and oceans.
If the E.P.A. were to take back control of water quality permits from Rhode Island, the Federal agency would administer current permits, applicants for new or renewed permits would have to apply to the E.P.A., and the agency would become the primary enforcement authority.
Those functions were all assigned to the state in 1984, as is the standard practice under the Clean Water Act.
But in recent years Rhode Island has repeatedly reduced the budget at the state Department of Environmental Management, and staffing dropped by more than 100 employees, or 17 percent, in the last two years. Additional cuts are planned.
The full-time staff of state employees who manage waste-water permits has dwindled to just two people, Mr. DeVillars complained. Meanwhile, permits have expired for most of the largest treatment plants that discharge waste water in the state, and many permit holders are temporarily discharging more pollution than their permits allow while they improve their treatment plants.
"All of this has resulted in closed shellfish beds, loss of habitat and lost recreation opportunities in many of the state's surface waters," Mr. DeVillars said.
Save the Bay, an environmental group in Providence that works to protect Narragansett Bay from pollution, said today that the state already was losing Federal matching grants because it was not spending enough on the environment.
"This situation is outrageous," said Curt Spalding, the group's executive director. "A clean bay is worth millions of dollars to the regional economy."

Imported Cars Show Gains, But Domestic Models Ebb
Foreign auto makers showed the biggest sales gains in the American market last month as the strong dollar continued to help them offer generous leasing deals and low prices.
Seven foreign auto makers saw their combined sales rise 11 percent, while those of General Motors and Chrysler dropped by a tenth of one percent. [Page D4.]
 
Reports Indicate Slowing of Growth
The Commerce Department said construction spending fell seven-tenths of a percent in December, holding the year's gain to 4 percent, in one of several reports that suggested a moderation of economic growth. A survey of corporate purchasing managers found that manufacturing slowed in January. And personal income outpaced consumer spending in December. [D4.] 

The signs of slowing growth buoyed the Treasury market. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.73 percent from 6.78 as expectation of an immediate increase in interest rates by the Fed diminished. [D17.]
 
Trading was lackluster in the stock market, however, with the Dow industrials dipping 6.93 points, to 6,806.16, though the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index eked out a gain of 0.57 point, to 786.73. [D10.]
 
Another AT&T Executive Quits
In yet another high-level defection from AT&T, Richard W. Miller, the chief financial officer and an architect of the company's three-way split, resigned unexpectedly. [D7.]
 
Shanghai Trader Is Sentenced
Two years after Shanghai's leading securities firm was brought down by a trading scandal, authorities said the central figure in the case, Guan Jinsheng, who was the firm's president, had been sentenced to 17 years in prison. [D8.]
 
Taco Bell Plans Account Review
Taco Bell said it would review the creative part of its account, with billings estimated at $200 million. The review, which will include the incumbent shop, Bozell Worldwide, is the second for Taco Bell in less than three years, and comes as a number of fast-food companies are making changes in their agency rosters. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]
 
Icahn Names Aides for RJR Fight
Carl C. Icahn named his investment advisers for a proxy assault on RJR Nabisco, reiterating his intent to seek an immediate spinoff of the company's food businesses. [D7.]
 
Perils of Privatization in Venezuela
The future of Viasa, Venezuela's flagship, and currently grounded, airline will hinge on a vote by its workers on a $55 million rescue effort. In the process, one of its major owners, Iberia Air Lines of Spain, has learned hard lessons about investing in troubled foreign enterprises. [D8.]
 
China Eastern Airlines, the nation's most profitable and best-managed airline, is becoming the first to list American depository receipts on the Big Board. But investors looking to climb aboard will find it hard to confirm the flight plan. Market Place. [D10.]
 
Producer of On-Line Guide Is Sold

HEADLINE: Barry Offers Budget (Some See Politics Between Lines)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. today unveiled his proposed budget for 1998, a $3.3 billion spending plan that he said would balance the capital's budget for the first time in years while still invigorating the local economy.
But while the budget proposal maintains the effort to eliminate thousands of municipal jobs, as required by the Federal control board that oversees city finances, the head of the control board and the city's chief financial officer questioned the way the balance would be achieved. 
 In addition, some elected officials said they viewed the budget as a strong indication that Mr. Barry intended to seek a fifth term in 1998 -- an inference Mr. Barry strongly discouraged at an afternoon news conference at which he presented the budget.
"I'm not even thinking about 1998," he told reporters. "If you're thinking about that, you're thinking about something that I'm not thinking about."
To prevent overspending, Mr. Barry proposed for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 that the city renegotiate its debt repayment, a step he said would preserve $50 million for programs that have already been slashed in efforts to restore the city to solid financial footing.
Arguing that cities restructure debt all the time, Mr. Barry said that if the control board did not approve the step, he would be forced to cut millions more from the Police Department, the Fire Department and the public school system, even though the control board has made public safety and education its highest priorities. By terms of the 1995 law that created the control board, an agreement on a budget must be reached by the Mayor, the City Council and the board before the budget is sent to Congress for approval.
"This community has already taken a tremendous amount of pain and suffering," Mr. Barry said. "I suggest very strongly that they do the restructuring."
But Andrew F. Brimmer, the chairman of the control board, said that restructuring the debt to solve short-term problems "is not a good idea" and that he had told Mr. Barry as much in a recent conversation.
Anthony A. Williams, the city's chief financial officer, said stretching out the city's debt "only drives us deeper into junk bond status."
"But I'm up here in the anchor booth," he added. "I'm not an elected official who has to come up with $50 million, $50 million in real dollars."
Mr. Barry said the main thrust of the budget was economic development throughout the city but with a special emphasis in areas that are east of the Anacostia River, which Mr. Barry said he would designate as an empowerment zone, with $10 million in plans to create tax incentives for businesses, job training programs and assistance in home buying.
While these areas are typically the poorest in the city, they have also formed Mr. Barry's political base through the years, including 1994, when he returned to office for a fourth term after serving six months in prison for drug possession. His widest margins of votes came in Wards 7 and 8, which are entirely east of the Anacostia.
Some elected officials said that by focusing his economic development plan on those wards and on Ward 6, which straddles the river, Mr. Barry was laying the groundwork for a re-election campaign.
"By this budget, was he kicking off his re-election efforts? That did occur to me," said Kathy Patterson, a City Council member who represents the wealthiest section of the city. "Anyway, it was the chitchat in the halls today among some of my colleagues."
Charlene Drew Jarvis, the president pro tem of the City Council, said, "I always read the budget, such as one proposed by the Mayor, as a political document."
But Mr. Barry flatly denied he was playing to his political base, asserting that the budget was intended to attract business to all corners of the city. He defended efforts to help Anacostia because of its high unemployment and lack of neighborhood businesses.
Referring to Ms. Patterson's ward, where the unemployment rate is 2.3 percent, he said, "If the economic indicators were as severe in Ward 3 as they are in Ward 8, I'd do it there."

Signs Growth Is Slowing Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday for the fifth consecutive session, as investors saw further evidence of moderate economic growth.
Reports yesterday on manufacturing and construction spending were weaker than forecasts, bolstering expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers would leave interest rates unchanged when they meet today and tomorrow. 
 Still, many investors expect the Fed to raise short-term rates in the coming months, and the market's focus is now on the Fed's next policy meeting in March.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32, to 97 30/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.73 percent from 6.78 percent on Friday.
Bond prices received a lift after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of January manufacturing fell to 52 from 53.8 in December, lower than the 53 reading expected by most economists. The report suggested that manufacturing was expanding at a slower pace.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities Inc., said the report helped dispel any remaining fears of an overheated economy. But she noted that a reading of 52 in the purchasing managers' index was still consistent with solid growth.
Other data also supported bond prices. Construction spending fell for the first time since July, dipping seven-tenths of 1 percent in December, after a four-month surge. Analysts, however, noted that construction-related expenditures were up a solid 4 percent last year, a further sign that business confidence remains buoyant.
And data on personal income and consumption for December came in about as expected. Personal income rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, while consumption posted a decent gain of five-tenths of 1 percent.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc., said the market was able to rally because market participants continue to discern a silver lining in every economic report.
For example, he said, the purchasing managers' report reaffirmed the view that the economy was slowing after the strong advance reported last week in fourth-quarter gross domestic product.
"The next test of this rally will be the 6.50 percent yield level on the long bond, with anything out of the 6.50 percent to 7 percent range a major signal for the bond market," Mr. Guild said.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data, said, "It is important to remember that investors still have a lot of cash and that foreign investors still like Treasury securities for their yield pickup and the fairly strong dollar."
At the Treasury's bill auction yesterday, rates fell sharply on better-than-expected demand, particularly for the three-month maturity. The average discount rate for the three-month issue was 5 percent, down 6 basis points from last week. The six-month bill also improved, dropping 4 basis points to 5.08 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Following are the results of the Treasury auction:

Inflation at 2.2% In European Union

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The European Union's annual inflation rate was 2.2 percent in December, down from 3 percent a year earlier and matching the low set in November, the trade bloc said yesterday. The November rate was the lowest since the 15-nation group began compiling the figure in 1983. 
 The inflation rate in December compared with 3.3 percent in the United States and two-tenths of a percent in Japan.

More Jobs, More Seekers

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent in December, up from 8.5 percent in November, the State Department of Labor said. The state's unemployment rate also inched up, climbing from 5.7 to 5.8 percent over the same period.
James Brown, a labor market analyst for the department, attributed the increase to the growing number of job seekers encouraged to look for work because of a gradually improving economy. 
 Meanwhile, business activity in the New York metropolitan area started 1997 at a more sluggish pace after a surge in December, according to a report for the New York Purchasing Managers Association. The purchasing managers' index dropped to 61.9 in January from 72.9 the previous month. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the local economy.

HEADLINE: Unneeded Lab Chimps Face Hazy Future

BYLINE: By DAVID BERREBY 

DATELINE: HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, N.M.

 BODY:
Hands and feet gently slapping concrete, Chandra and Shasta come loping down their sunny outdoor run at the complex operated by the Coulston Foundation here. The little apes do not look up when the black triangle of a Stealth fighter knifes across the sky above them and banks for a landing at a nearby runway.
Born on this base, where the Air Force used chimpanzees four decades ago to establish that human beings could go into space, they are used to jets and buzzards wheeling high above thorny tumbleweeds. 
 But these toddling one-year-olds will probably live until the middle of the next century, and what their long futures will be like -- where they will live, who will care for them, and what experiments, if any, will be performed on their bodies -- are questions at the center of a mounting political and ethical dispute.
They are among the newest members of a captive population of about 1,800 chimpanzees in American biomedical research, each of which costs roughly $15 a day to maintain throughout a 50- to 60-year life span. Many of these chimps, including most of the 150 to 200 that have been infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, are essentially unemployed -- no longer used in experiments.
When they are not caged alone temporarily for an experimental protocol, most of the chimpanzees pass their time in small groups housed in cell-like cages at a handful of sites around the country. Many play with toys and devices designed, as required by Federal law, to make their lives more interesting. Some watch television. "They like programs about chimps, like National Geographic specials," said Kate Baker, enrichment coordinator at the Yerkes Regional Primate Center a federally financed center in Atlanta that holds some 200 of the apes. "They like shows on how to use tools. And they like to see people arguing, so Oprah is a show they like."
The surplus has helped some researchers, like Bill Hopkins, who has plenty of animals available for his Yerkes study of traits like handedness and the ability to recognize faces in chimps.
It has also encouraged speculation about odd-sounding projects that might not be considered if biomedical chimps were regarded as scarce -- a proposal, for example, to use female chimps as surrogate mothers for bonobos, a closely related and much rarer species of ape, or a suggestion that a few chimps be fed meat tainted with mad cow disease, to see if they can become infected.
The debate over the "chimp surplus" extends from the top levels of the National Institutes of Health -- whose director, Dr. Harold E. Varmus, appointed a committee of experts last year to issue recommendations on the handling of the research chimp population -- to Congress, which is being lobbied in this session with at least two proposals for legislation. "It's a tough issue," said Dr. Thomas Insel, the director of Yerkes. "A lot of us are looking to this committee for direction." The chimp committee, after conducting hearings last fall, is expected to produce a report for Dr. Varmus this spring.
The surplus is partly a result of a surprisingly successful drive begun in 1986 by the health institutes to breed chimps for AIDS research (wild chimps have not been imported for research since 1975). The result was a chimp baby boom that unfortunately exploded just as researchers were deciding that infected chimps apparently did not come down with AIDS, and hence could not be used as animal models for the disease. (Now, it seems chimps can contract AIDS.) Nowadays, most chimps in biomedical centers are on some form of birth control, though the breeding program has not been completely stopped. The health institutes, for example, have renewed a grant for breeding at the Coulston Foundation.
The surplus also derives, though, from a cultural change. The very similarity to humans (genetically, they are more than 98 percent identical) that makes chimpanzees attractive subjects for research on H.I.V., hepatitis, malaria, respiratory diseases, Lyme disease and parasites has also made their use troubling to more and more people, including some scientists.
"There is a generational change in researchers," said Frans de Waal, an ethologist who studies social behavior in two bands of especially lucky chimps that live in large toy-filled enclosures at Yerkes. "The younger generation doesn't feel the same right to do whatever they please."
The chimpanzee also has powerful allies in animal rights organizations, some of which have inside sources of information in the primate centers as well as excellent access to news organizations and politicians. Using chimps now invites especially intense scrutiny and it is expensive. "My concern is that a lot of people have been put off from studying chimpanzees in particular because they feel it's too expensive and they'd get beheaded," said Joe M. Erwin, a specialist in captive chimps who has run sites for both zoos and biomedical centers. "Ending all research is just terribly threatening to the animals. What we really need is to find more support."
The surplus debate has attracted groups, like the Great Ape Project and the British-based People Against Chimpanzee Experiments, which sense a chance to remove large numbers of chimps from biomedical research for good. Proposed legislation in Congress, for example, would create a system of "sanctuaries" to which research chimpanzees could be "retired."
At the other end of the philosophical spectrum is the Coulston Foundation here, which is lobbying the New Mexico Congressional delegation for a bill that would direct millions of Federal dollars to support research on aging in chimpanzees. "We don't have enough chimps for what we want to do," said the president of the foundation, Dr. Frederick Coulston.
Dr. Coulston, an expert in toxicology and infectious diseases, likes to taunt his opponents with talk of using the apes as living blood and organ banks. "I wouldn't even rule out in the far future having a colony of chimps providing blood for human transfusion," Dr. Coulston said in an interview in his Alamogordo office near the base. "How many chimps do you want? You can raise them like you do cattle. In 10 years you could have half a million."
Dr. Coulston is a garrulous moon-faced man of 82 who is disconcertingly prone to assert that various commonly feared chemical agents are not dangerous at all.
"Lead?" he remarks. "Lead levels in the blood have no effect on intelligence." Or, "DDT is one of the greatest inventions of mankind, and it doesn't thin bird eggs." He is widely respected in this small town (with 150 employees, he is the surrounding county's third-largest employer) and carries himself as one who is seldom contradicted.
His Coulston Foundation, spun off from his privately held manufacturing company, Coulston International, in 1993, will soon control more than 650 chimpanzees, by far the largest colony of captive chimpanzees in the world. The foundation has about 400 chimps now, and about 100 are being added from the Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Surgery in Primates, a Westchester research lab owned by the New York University Medical School. (The Coulston Foundation agreed to take over the Westchester facility last year, but the deal appears to be stalled.)
Coulston also has a contract with the military to care for the Air Force's 150 chimpanzees. The foundation runs the state-of-the-art three-year-old chimp center at Holloman, as well as a complex of its own in nearby Alamogordo.
Dr. Coulston has long worked with the military, dating back to his work on malaria during World War II, and he was in charge of the Air Force's chimpanzee colony from 1970 to 1980, when he ran the complex for the contractor, Albany Medical College.
In May 1995, a clause in a military appropriation bill that would have given Coulston ownership of the Air Force chimpanzees was killed after Dr. Jane Goodall, the researcher and advocate for chimpanzees, objected. The bill passed instead with a provision requiring the Air Force to solicit bids for a contract to care for the apes. The California-based animal-rights group In Defense of Animals is among those that will compete with Coulston for the contract when it is opened for bidding later this year, says Eric Kleiman, the group's research director.
Dr. Coulston has long been reviled by animal rights groups as a throwback to days of cruel and indifferent treatment of apes. "His record of animal care is extremely troubling," said Suzanne Roy, president of In Defense of Animals.
Some of the accusations have led to action by regulators. For example, on Oct. 31, 1993, three chimpanzees at Coulston-run buildings died after being left overnight with a space heater that malfunctioned, raising the temperature in their holding area to more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The Department of Agriculture charged the Coulston Foundation with violating the Animal Welfare Act in connection with that incident, and last summer Coulston settled the charge and others by paying a $40,000 fine and agreeing to make improvements that would prevent recurrence.
More recently, on Jan. 21, an 11-year-old male chimp named Jello, recently arrived from the N.Y.U. laboratory, died after being sedated for transfer from one cage to another. In Defense of Animals promptly filed a complaint with the Agriculture Department charging that a necropsy had revealed that the ape had food in its trachea. "Everybody knows before you tranquilize an animal you fast him," Mr. Kleiman said. He said the group's account was based on reports of three sources within Coulston, whom he would not name.
The foundation responded with a statement denying that Jello had been fed and calling the allegation a "distortion of fact." It said Jello died after another chimp, which was not yet fully sedated, "placed his foot and some of his weight" on the back of Jello's neck. "This was seen to restrict Jello's ability to breathe," the foundation said, pledging that "the final results of the necropsy confirming the cause of death will be available at a later date." The statement, echoing a complaint often made by researchers, also denounced "irresponsible accusations by people such as these (I.D.A.) who would not know how to take care of a chimpanzee." Indeed, Mr. Kleiman concedes, he has never seen a chimp in the flesh.
It would be wrong to describe all of Coulston's detractors as animal rights absolutists and disgruntled former colleagues. "We get snubbed at conventions," said Elaine Struthers, Coulston's enrichment coordinator. "When I go and hear myself disparaged by somebody who has never been to our facility, I have to think, this is exactly what a scientist is not supposed to do: show contempt prior to investigation."
Some primatologists, though, say they are puzzled about what use Coulston could have for chimpanzees in the current climate. "I'm amazed that anybody would be trying to expand a chimp empire," said Dr. Insel, director of the Yerkes primate center. "He's interested in having more, and more chimps and we're interested in having fewer and fewer."
And others express anxiety about the Coulston Foundation's holding such a large proportion of the chimpanzees used for research. "Can the health of the U.S. population come to depend on a private entity?" asked Dr. Thomas L. Wolfle, director of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources at the National Research Council and study director for the health institutes' chimp committee. Coulston Foundation research on chimps is 55 percent federally financed biomedical research and 45 percent testing for pharmaceutical companies and other private enterprises, said Don McKinney, the foundation's spokesman.
On the other hand, Coulston also has plenty of defenders among researchers. "Coulston is an approved facility for primates," said Dr. Patricia Fultz, a microbiologist and a member of the chimpanzee committee. "I've been there and the facilities for the chimps that I have there are just as good elsewhere. I don't think there's a big difference."
In any event, Dr. Coulston is the major player in the chimp debate, even though he declined to join the health institutes' chimp committee because "he said it was a witch hunt," Mr. McKinney said. (The other side has a similar disdain for the panel. Ms. Roy, the president of In Defense of Animals, said the committee "has no one who is a true advocate of chimpanzees on it." )
The debate leaves many different experts and animal advocates speaking the same words -- "surplus," "retirement" and "sanctuary," for example -- but differing about precisely what the words mean. While there are plenty of chimpanzees that are not being used for current experiments, Dr. Wolfle said, there may yet be a shortage of young chimps that have not been infected with anything.
"There is no doubt that there are chimps in biomedical centers that are not being used in research," he said. "On the other hand, if you ask investigators if they have trouble finding the chimps they need, they will say yes." All of which means that many researchers' idea of a sanctuary is a place in which chimps might live relatively pleasant lives, but from which they can be taken as needed for research.
Dr. Preston Marx, a researcher at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Manhattan, who ran the Holloman chimp colony before the Coulston Foundation took over, favors maintaining a few large colonies to keep research chimps in optimal conditions -- housing them in large groups, which are not only better for the animals' mental health but also, according to a recent accounting at Yerkes, cost about $10 a day instead of about $16 for caging. These central colonies, he proposes, would run "a shuttle system, where, for instance, a chimp might go to a medical facility for six months, be involved in a protocol to test a new vaccine, and then go back home."
Such a sanctuary is anathema to animal rights advocates. In Defense of Animals, which says it will raise money and open its own sanctuary, envisions "something like an old folks home," said Mr. Kleiman, where no research or medical procedure would be conducted that did not directly benefit the chimp involved. The sanctuary bill, which is endorsed by Dr. Goodall, compromises by allowing scientists to pick the animals to be retired but then insisting that retirement be absolute and final.
Demand for chimpanzees in research has been cyclic in the past, said Dr. Wolfle of the health institutes' chimp committee. And the situation may change yet again. There was talk of a chimpanzee surplus in the early 1980's, after hepatitis research had slowed, for example. Then AIDS touched off a new boom cycle. And, in fact, part of the committee's mission, Dr. Wolfle said, is to determine how many chimpanzees need to be held "in reserve" for the next infectious agent that comes along.
One thing about which practically all biomedical researchers agree, though, is that experiments on chimps will probably continue at some level. "We do all have this feeling that there will be another two or three infectious agents coming down the pike," Dr. Fultz said. "So we're going to need chimpanzees in the future."
"There is a need to do this research," says Dr. Marx. "I'm not always sure we have the right, but we do have the need."

Dollar Ends Mostly Higher, Helped by Official's Remarks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar overcame nervousness among traders about the coming meeting of industrial countries and ended mostly higher yesterday, helped by remarks from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
Broad weakness in the German mark also helped strengthen the dollar. Traders sold marks on renewed optimism that Europe's plan for a single currency in 1999 would proceed as scheduled. 
 Although the dollar did not breach its four-year intraday high of 122.78 yen reached Jan. 29 and a two-and-a-half-year high of 165.15 marks reached Jan. 28, it closed near the higher end of its recent trading range and was broadly stronger for the first time in a week.
"Every attempt to push it down has been met by continued buying interest," said Ben Strauss, a currency trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York. "Everything for the moment is playing into the hands of a stronger dollar."
In New York, the dollar cost 122.44 yen, up from 121.68 yen on Monday. The dollar cost 1.6457 marks, up from 1.6400. The pound cost $1.6207, up from $1.6189.
The foreign exchange market remained preoccupied with the weekend meeting of financial ministers and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- the so-called Group of Seven.
Japanese officials have said they will seek help at the meeting to stabilize the yen, which has weakened sharply against the dollar.
In Tokyo, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka acknowledged the difficulty of weakening the dollar when it was supported by a strong United States economy. Later in Washington, Mr. Rubin asserted that exchange rates should not be a tool of American trade policy.
Mr. Rubin's remarks in particular helped the dollar. Traders said they were significant because American auto makers have been complaining that the cheaper yen was hurting their competitiveness.
The mark's weakness partly reflected the impact of a labor agreement reached in Italy with metal workers after six months of negotiations. The results helped resurrect optimism that Italy would be able to participate in Europe's single currency scheduled in 1999.

Firm Dollar And Rate Bet Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices closed higher yesterday for the sixth consecutive session as investors remained optimistic that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged. Fed policy makers concluded the first day of a two-day meeting yesterday.
A strong dollar kept foreign investors interested in Treasury securities, despite signs of strength in a report on new-home sales. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 97 14/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.70 percent from 6.73 percent on Monday.
The Commerce Department report on new-home sales showed that sales fell 1 percent in December. But the drop was less than expected, and sales for November were revised to show a gain of 17.7 percent, up from a gain of 14.2 percent that was reported originally. The data suggested to some market participants that strength in the economy might be understated.
Traders said they were surprised by the resiliency of the market after the new-home sales report. But analysts said that the continued rise in the dollar bolstered prices. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities attractive to foreign investors.
Still, investors moved cautiously in advance of the conclusion of the Fed's policy meeting today and the Labor Department's employment report for January, due out on Friday. Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said it was almost a given that the Fed would not raise short-term interest rates this week. The Fed's next policy meeting is on March 5, "which gives us about six weeks before the trading desks start sweating it out again," he said.
"All the news over the last five days has been good, and bond investors have only focused on the positive aspects in all the releases," Mr. Regan added. "I think the market is looking ahead to Friday's employment numbers for some sort of indication of a Fed timetable."
In the corporate debt market, the Mead Corporation and Philip Morris led a flock of borrowers taking advantage of the lowest rates in a month by selling almost $2 billion of debt securities.
Mead sold $550 million of debt in four parts through Goldman, Sachs & Company and J. P. Morgan. Underwriters priced $100 million of notes due in 2002 to yield 6.60 percent; $150 million of debentures due in 2037 to yield 6.841 percent; $150 million of debentures due in 2017 to yield 7.36 percent and $150 million of debentures due in 2047 to yield 7.58 percent.
The Philip Morris Companies sold $500 million of 10-year notes through Lehman Brothers at a price to yield 7.243 percent, while the Sherwin-Williams Company, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers, sold $400 million of debt in three parts in the public sectors and another $300 million in private sales. The three-part debt offering was priced to yield 6.28 percent for $100 million of notes due in 2000; 6.514 percent for $100 million of notes due in 2002, and 6.873 percent for $200 million of notes due in 2007.

HEADLINE: Venture Capital Discovers New York's New Technology

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Long accustomed to being overlooked in the high technology field, New York City is fast becoming a magnet for venture capital investments in start-up companies offering new-media and Internet-related services, a new national survey says.
The survey, conducted by Coopers & Lybrand and scheduled to be released today, found that the amount of money invested in New York City software, electronics and multimedia companies jumped 125 percent, to $111.3 million in 1996 from $49.5 million in 1995. The survey, which covered 600 companies, found that other economic fields received much less in 1996 than in 1995; health care companies were down 40.6 percent, and consumer goods companies 96.3 percent. 
 In all, the amount of venture capital invested in New York City increased 41 percent, trailing the national figure of 52 percent. But the totals for new-media investment show that a group of investors known to be generally cautious has increasing interest in the city's Internet related businesses.
"For decades, I've seen money leave New York, and for the first time, because New York is being recognized as an emerging technology center, it's nice to see opportunities right here," said Robert A. Fish, a partner at Coopers & Lybrand in charge of the venture capital and high-tech field in New York. "It's like, 'Hello, we're here!' "
The change can be measured in other ways, too. The number of New York conferences focusing on new-media investment opportunities for venture capital companies has increased to 25 from 5 in two years, said Stuart M. Williams, president and chief executive of Strategic Research Institute, which organizes the conferences.
The number of venture capital companies specializing in new media has grown at a comparable rate as well, said Brian T. Horey, general partner with Lawrence, Smith and Horey, one such investment firm.
In 1996, Mr. Horey's firm invested $4.5 million in Ad One Classified Network, which puts classified ads on the World Wide Web. Meanwhile, Flatiron Partners, founded last August, invested $21.5 million in three New York-area new-media companies, said Fred Wilson, a managing partner.
Surveys of venture capital investments should be looked at cautiously, since the commitment of money by a larger company does not necessarily insure success, said Larry Buchsbaum, project manager of the survey, called the Coopers & Lybrand Money Tree.
Venture-capital funds offer money for start-up companies, and if the new companies eventually issue stock, it can yield big payoffs for the investors. It is a risky proposition, for only 1 of every 5 or 10 companies backed by venture funds makes it that far, some analysts say. "It would be unfair to say that New York is at the level of Silicon Valley in terms of investment opportunities," said Alessandro Piol, managing director of Chancellor LGT Asset Management, an investment management firm.
In 1996, there was $700.8 million in venture capital investments in New York City. In the San Francisco Bay area, the comparable figure was $2.365 billion.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Declined 1% in December

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell in December and an index of future economic activity rose only slightly, providing further evidence yesterday of moderating growth as Federal Reserve officials began a meeting on interest rate policy.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new homes fell 1 percent in December, a decline that was smaller than had been anticipated. 
 And the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, reported yesterday by the Conference Board, rose a tenth of 1 percent in December, after a revised increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in November and no change in October. It was the 11th consecutive month with no drop in the index. The slight gain in the December figure was about what Wall Street had expected.
Wall Street generally expects the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged when the two-day meeting of its policy making committee ends today. Recent economic data suggest that the economy is growing at a moderate pace, without signs of increased inflation.
Between the leading indicators and the housing report, "the home sales data carry a little bit more weight here; it's a surprising number," Kathleen Stephansen, a senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said. Wall Street had expected a decline closer to 5 percent.
"Is it a worrisome number from the Fed's standpoint? At this point, it is not," she said.
Both sets of data were in line with other reports this week, which indicated that growth in the first quarter of 1997 might slow from the 4.7 percent rate of the fourth quarter of 1996.
On Monday. the National Association of Purchasing Management index suggested that growth in the manufacturing sector slowed in January. Also, the Government reported on Monday that personal incomes and consumer spending rose in December and that construction spending fell. The moves, however, were modest and generally in line with market expectations.
The small advance in the index of leading indicators, which is intended to predict economic activity six to nine months ahead, suggested that the economy would remain under control through summer.
Of its 10 components, 4 were positive, 3 were negative and 3 were unchanged in December. The biggest positive effect came from money supply and the average factory workweek. Components hurting the index most were weekly unemployment claims and manufacturers' orders for consumer goods.
The index's December reading of 102.8 compares with a revised November level of 102.7 and an October reading of 102.5. The index operates from a base of 100, which was set in 1987.
Regarding the home-sales report, the decline in the year's final month was not enough to damage a strong year in the housing market. Last year, 756,000 new single-family homes were bought, up from 667,000 in 1995.
The yearly sales level was the highest since 1978, when 817,000 new homes were sold.

HEADLINE: American Air Pilots Offer Concessions as Labor Dispute Escalates

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
With a week and a half to go before a possible strike by pilots at American Airlines, the war of words -- or, more accurately, numbers -- heated up yesterday between the company and the pilots union.
In a presentation to Wall Street analysts, leaders of the union, the Allied Pilots Association, drew a clear line in the sand. The pilots said they were willing to make work-rule concessions worth $212 million in savings to the company over five years. The pilots' proposal also includes a 3 percent raise this year as well as in 1998 and 1999, and a 2 percent raise in 2000. 
 They also want 7.25 million stock options granted to them at $10 below market value, and to prohibit the company's American Eagle subsidiary -- at which pilots are represented by a different union and now fly only turboprops -- from flying small jets. The union said such a shift would cost their members jobs.
The pilots said their proposal would increase American's total pilot compensation costs by 8.9 percent by the year 2001.
The cost of giving them what they want, the pilots said, will most likely be exceeded by the loss of business American is going to suffer even if there is no strike; the threat alone is prompting many travelers to book on other airlines. "If American's profit slows, it won't be the result of this contract," said Adam Blumenthal, a financial adviser to the union.
The leaders of American's pilots union tentatively agreed to a contract last fall, but it was voted down by members last month. If American accepted their new proposal, it would cost the company an additional $285 million, the union said.
Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American Airlines, said yesterday that the company had not had time to study the pilots' analysis.
But, he said, "no matter how you add the numbers, the contract that they rejected, by their own admission, would have maintained their status as the best-paid pilots in the industry."
Although American and its parent company, the AMR Corporation, have generated strong profits of late, the airline has a lot of ground to make up, Mr. Chiames said. Since 1990, the company's net profit totaled $136 million, while pilots received $136 million in profit sharing, he said.
"Their talk of not sharing in the fruits of a good year is just overshadowed by the realities of their compensation and our very generous profit sharing," Mr. Chiames said. The airline also said yesterday that according to a study it had conducted, a 60-day strike would cost the United States economy $5 billion.
Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley, said he saw some flaws in the pilots' analysis. For example, he said, their comparisons with other airlines did not account for the savings and flexibility that airlines like United and Delta enjoy from their United Shuttle and Delta Express divisions.
Shares of AMR dropped $1.125 yesterday, to $80.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day that the stocks of other carriers also fell.
Efforts to predict the likelihood of a strike occurring are little more than guesses at this point. The pilots plan to make their presentation to the airline on Thursday. The two sides then go into so-called super-mediation talks on Monday. Under deadlines that govern such labor disputes, a strike could happen as early as Saturday, Feb. 15.
"The atmosphere is one of mistrust on both sides," Mr. Murphy of Morgan Stanley said. "Unfortunately, that is the kind of atmosphere that foments a strike."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says 1996 Film Making in City Set Records

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Television and film production in New York City rose in 1996 to record levels for the third consecutive year, according to figures released by the Giuliani administration yesterday, though the figures in at least one category -- number of shooting days -- are in dispute.
"There is no place in the world that can match the creative vitality, spirit and energy of New York City," said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at a news conference at City Hall, where he was joined by Patricia Reed Scott, the city's Commissioner of Film, Theater and Broadcasting; the actor Michael J. Fox, star of an ABC situation comedy "Spin City," set in City Hall, and Gary David Goldberg, the show's producer. 
 The Mayor presented charts showing these statistics:
*Feature films shot in New York last year totaled 201, up from 175 in 1995 and 157 in 1994.
*Motion-picture-shooting days have risen 142 percent in three years, from 1,715 in 1993 to 4,147 last year.
*Overall shooting, for feature films, television shows, commercials, music videos and student films, rose to 21,286 in 1996 from 15,262 three years ago.
*Film production companies and crews spent $2.2 billion in New York City last year, up from $1.4 billion in 1993, an increase of 55 percent. The spending figure is linked to the growing number of feature films -- the most lucrative projects for the city -- made here.
The figures do not include pre- or post-production work. Therefore, said Ms. Scott, the amount of work generated by film projects is even larger than the figures show.
"We couldn't be happier about being in New York," said Mr. Fox, who was introduced by Mr. Giuliani as the Deputy Mayor, the character he plays on the show. "We feel like we're part of a trend."
Film production has been on the rise in New York since 1991, when a labor impasse resulted in a seven-month boycott of the city by Hollywood studios. After that, film activity in the city began to bounce back. In fact, it has been such a noticeable trend that some city residents say they are inconvenienced by the trailers, boom operators and high-powered lights that increasingly disrupt neighborhood life. Mr. Giuliani acknowledged the complaints yesterday, but said "the contribution to the city's economy more than offsets" the inconvenience.
Some of the city's figures are disputed. The claim of a record year for shooting days -- the days crews were actually filming -- does not hold up when compared with 1990. In the year immediately preceding the Hollywood boycott, the city reported 31,746 shooting days, a 33 percent increase over 1989. The high 1990 figure is attributed to a rush to film projects in New York before the beginning of the boycott.
Ms. Scott, who has been Film Commissioner since 1994, said in an interview that she did not trust the 1990 figures. She also held the post from 1983 to 1989.
Jayne Keyes, who held the position in 1990, said the numbers were accurate. "I trust my figures," she said.
Another inconsistency was in the list of films that the Mayor's office said were shot in New York in 1996. At least one on the list, "Touch," was filmed entirely on location in Los Angeles. Directed by Paul Schrader, it has not yet been released.
"Most of the post-production work was done in New York," said Stephen Peoples, Mr. Schrader's assistant.

HEADLINE: Company's Rescue Expert Once Falsified Credentials

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 4

 BODY:
William A. Brandt Jr., the turnaround specialist chosen on Monday by the Mercury Finance Company to try to salvage the troubled company's credibility with lenders, lied about his credentials in a Federal bankruptcy court in 1988.
Mr. Brandt, who was named Mercury's chief executive and president, acknowledged today that he had been found in contempt of court and fined $500 in a bankruptcy case in Milwaukee for making false claims about his education and early experience in corporate turnaround work -- the rehabilitation of troubled companies. 
 Mr. Brandt falsely testified in Milwaukee that he had obtained a master's degree from Harvard University and master's and doctorate degrees in international economic development from the University of Chicago. His actual master's degree, obtained in 1972 from the University of Chicago, is in sociology. He also falsely said that he had learned the basics of the turnaround trade as an "on and off" contract worker for the Central Intelligence Agency in Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, Washington and at the University of Chicago.
The testimony and the contempt finding were reported in February 1995 by The Pittsburgh Business Times and Journal as part of its coverage of controversy over Mr. Brandt's handling of efforts to revive the Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company, best known for its Clark candy bars.
In an interview today, Mr. Brandt attributed the misrepresentations to a sarcastic attempt to overshadow the claims of an opposing expert witness at the end of a long, hostile day of testimony. "It had no bearing on the case and it was an incredibly stupid thing to do," he said. "There was no excuse for it and I just lost sight of where I was."
Mr. Brandt said that Mercury's board was aware of the incident and discussed it with him when he was first interviewed with others who were considered for the rescue mission.
Kathleen Connelly, a spokeswoman for the company, said that Mr. Brandt had told board members about the incident and that they had decided his experience with turnarounds was more important than the contempt citation.
While corporate officials usually must disclose criminal convictions in corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a $500 contempt fine would probably not have to be disclosed, said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University and an expert in securities law.
Mr. Coffee said that reports about the contempt citation could only increase the difficulty of the task Mr. Brandt faces.
"We're talking about saving the Titanic in this case," Mr. Coffee said last night, adding that to do it, one would have to be an expert at corporate turnarounds and "have absolute credibility" to persuade banks to lend to the company.
Mr. Brandt, who is not a lawyer, has been involved in numerous bankruptcies as a trustee, receiver and consultant. His company, Development Specialists Inc., has managed or consulted for a number of financial service companies in bankruptcy proceedings.
Lawyers describe Mr. Brandt as extremely creative at devising out-of-court resolutions to corporate disasters.
Mr. Brandt's main preoccupation today was his continuing effort to obtain short-term loans to keep Mercury operating while it arranges a longer-term rescue package, the sale of assets, or, if necessary, an organized filing for protection of the bankruptcy court until its finances can be straightened out.
Mercury, which is based in Lake Forest, Ill., is the largest supplier of loans to auto buyers with credit problems. The company also has insurance operations.
Mr. Brandt, 47, replaced John N. Brincat, who resigned as president and chief executive of Mercury, after the company disclosed last week that it had overstated its profits by $90 million over four years.
The auto loan company attributed the problems to its top financial executive, James A. Doyle, and said he had disappeared. But a lawyer for Mr. Doyle said he was cooperating with Federal investigators, and on Monday, the Justice Department served Mercury with a warrant to search its financial records.

HEADLINE: Changing History -- on a Budget

 BODY:
After a lifetime of running for office, President Clinton is now said to be running for a place in history. Last night he may have set some kind of laundry-list record for State of the Union Messages by unveiling dozens of proposals to improve education, expand health care, fight crime, employ people on welfare, explore outer space, clean up rivers and carry out other projects. It was a far cry from his declaration last year that the era of big government was over, except for one fact. He pledged to do it all in a world of diminished resources resulting from his pledge to balance the budget in five years. Missing from the address was a clear outline of how he intends to pay for it.
It was good at least to see Mr. Clinton seizing the initiative again. He challenged Congress to pass the campaign-finance reform initiatives put forward by Senators John McCain of Arizona and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin by July 4. The President was right to admit that "delay will mean death," a truism illustrated when he he put off reform four years ago at the request of the Congress's leading Democrats. It remains to be seen now whether he and his Administration will match his words with vigorous action on this one issue that can do more than any other to restore Americans' faith in politics. 
 By making education a high priority and calling for a nonpartisan approach, Mr. Clinton was reaching back rhetorically not so much to the Great Society as to the Sputnik era, when education was a matter of national security. The proposal to leverage Federal money for a major school construction program was a welcome initiative for New York City and other overcrowded areas. Increasing tuition grants for poor families will also help those most in need. This page has argued that his tuition tax credits would help too many who do not need it, but a revived debate about improving education standards will be most beneficial.
Another sure sign that Mr. Clinton had his eye on history lay in his emphasis on international issues. His appeal for rapid Senate approval of the chemical weapons convention and for payment of debts and dues to the World Bank and the United Nations reflected an overdue recognition that these issues will not be acted on unless he throws his prestige behind them. We continue to have qualms about the Administration's plans to expand NATO over Russian objections and widen relations with a China unrepentant about human rights violations, but the speech signals that Mr. Clinton is prepared to educate Americans about his thinking.
Although the speech was as pedestrian in its own way as his second Inaugural Address, the President was at his best, as he always is, in appealing for a sense of community and cooperation. The swirl of events around his speech emphasized both the opportunities and the difficulties still inherent in race relations in America. Television broadcasters were clearly torn between their civic duty to follow events in Washington and the continually dismal allure of the latest O. J. Simpson verdict. A healthier symbol lay in the Republicans' choice of J. C. Watts, the black Congressman and former football hero from Oklahoma, to give the opposition response. Mr. Watts and the President both sketched visions of a Washington leadership toying with a new bipartisan ideal. That would, of course, be a state of the union worth pursuing.

HEADLINE: A Cheerless Election in Pakistan

 BODY:
The voters of Pakistan were understandably sullen about their election this week. Forced to choose between two former Prime Ministers -- Benazir Bhutto, ousted last November on corruption charges, and Nawaz Sharif, removed on the same grounds in 1993 -- they have given Mr. Sharif another chance to govern. The lack of enthusiasm was reflected in a dismal turnout of about 30 percent. Clearly Mr. Sharif's first task is to clean up the bribery and influence-peddling that have nearly destroyed the political institutions of a country ruled by the military for half its history.
Ms. Bhutto's defeat came after voters grew increasingly disappointed over her Government's performance. Educated at Harvard and Oxford and highly articulate and impassioned in her advocacy of democratic values and the needs of the poor, she came to be seen as a chaotic manager, reliant on a coterie of sycophants and tolerant of corruption in her entourage and family. 
 Pakistan has had difficulty establishing civilian institutions because of the tremendous power wielded by the army and intelligence services, the clergy and the wealthy feudal landlord families, of which the Bhuttos were one of the most powerful. Since the economy has been liberalized in the last decade, powerful business interests have also found bribery a convenient way to influence the Government. Billions flowing through Pakistan to aid the anti-Soviet rebellion in Afghanistan in the 1980's left a legacy of trade in guns, drugs and terrorism.
Ms. Bhutto's efforts to combat corruption were weak, but Mr. Sharif would be mistaken to wage a vendetta against her. The investigation and any prosecution of corruption cases should be carried out by civilian institutions, possibly overseen by the "accountability commission" created under the interim Government that has ruled the country since November. New ordinances requiring disclosure of the personal assets of officials and granting greater independence to the Bank of Pakistan should be preserved and expanded.
The new Government needs to assure Pakistanis and the country's friends, including the United States, that the military does not have undue influence in running Pakistan. Mr. Sharif should abolish a newly created advisory council, dominated by the military, which was set up after Ms. Bhutto's Government was dismissed.
Pakistan faces great problems of poverty, illiteracy, crime and tensions with its neighbors, especially India. The United States should do what it can to help Pakistan establish honest and independent civilian institutions. But if it is to serve as a force for stability in South Asia, long its ambition and that of Washington, the country's leaders must eliminate the corruption that has so badly undermined public support for democracy.

HEADLINE: Budget Amendment Shuns Democratic Principle;
Better Off Without It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Simon's "Balance the Budget, Once and for All" (Op-Ed, Jan. 30) contains several misconceptions.
The issue of a balanced budget is a red herring. The fundamental question to ask is: What factors cause productive capacity to expand and thereby increase economic well-being? 
 More important for economic growth than a balanced budget are the government programs that get financed. If programs that stimulate economic growth are curtailed for the sake of achieving a balanced budget, personal income growth is likely to suffer.
Mr. Simon cites a Government study predicting that once the budget is balanced, "within 20 years the average per capita income would rise by 26 percent." Yet each year over the past two decades there has been a budget deficit and real per capita income increased by 40 percent. This fact alone suggests we might be better off without a balanced budget.

HEADLINE: Budget Amendment Shuns Democratic Principle;
The Economy, Stupid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Simon (Op-Ed, Jan. 30) looks for reinforcement of his case for a balanced budget amendment in Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations." He should rather look at the state of our global economy and what a balanced budget in the United States would or would not do for it.
Budgets throughout the world are out of balance because supply and demand, nationally and globally, are out of balance. What permits the free-market economy to function is the uncontrolled accumulation of debt, both private and public. That debt accumulation is dangerous. 
 No, it's not the budget; as the slogan once said, it's the economy, stupid.

HEADLINE: SECOND TERM;
President Clinton's Message to Congress on the State of the Union

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Following is President Clinton's State of the Union Message delivered to a joint session of Congress tonight:
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: 
 I think I should start by saying thanks for inviting me back.
I come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime history -- and a plan of action to meet that challenge, to prepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st century.
We have much to be thankful for. With four years of growth, we have won back the basic strength of our economy. With crime and welfare rolls declining, we are winning back our basic optimism, the enduring faith that we can master any difficulty. With the cold war receding and global commerce at record levels, we are helping to win unrivaled peace and prosperity all across the world.
My fellow Americans, the state of our union is strong, but now we must rise to the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better than any we have ever known. The new promise of the global economy, the Information Age, unimagined new work, life-enhancing technology -- all are ours to seize. That is our honor and our challenge. We must be shapers of events, not observers. For if we do not act, the moment will pass -- and we will lose the best possibilities of our future.
We face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy: the enemy of our time is inaction.
So tonight I issue a call to action -- action by this Congress, by our states, by all our people, to prepare America for the 21st century. Action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our people; action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology and science; action to build stronger families and stronger communities and a safer environment; action to keep America the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And above all, action to build a more perfect union here at home.
The spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference. We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans, responsibility from all Americans in a community of all Americans. And we must be committed to a new kind of government -- not to solve all our problems for us, but to give our people -- all our people -- the tools to make the most of their own lives.
And we must work together. The people of this nation elected us all. They want us to be partners, not partisans. They put us all here in the same boat. They gave us all oars, and they told us to row. Now, here is the direction I think we should take.
First, we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our country -- to balance our budget, renew our democracy and finish the job of welfare reform.
Over the last four years, we brought new economic growth by investing in our people, expanding our exports, cutting our deficits, creating over 11 million new jobs, a four-year record. Now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world.
We here tonight have an historic opportunity. Let this Congress be the Congress that finally balances the budget. Thank you.
In two days, I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002.
This plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. It will balance the budget and build on the Vice President's efforts to make our Government work better, even as it costs less. It will balance the budget and provide middle-class tax relief to pay for education and health care, to help raise a child, to buy and sell a home.
Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It does not require us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe -- I believe it is unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in time of crisis later on and force unwanted results such as judges' halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes. Let us at least agree: We should not pass any measure, no measure should be passed that threatens Social Security. We don't need a constitutional amendment -- we need action.
Whatever our differences, we should balance the budget now, and then, for the long-term health of our society, we must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the long run, so that these fundamental programs will be as strong for our children as they are for our parents.
And let me say something that's not in my script tonight. I know this is not going to be easy. But I really believe one of the reasons the American people gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next four years that will carry our country through the next 50 years. I know it is easier for me than for you to say or do. But another reason I was elected is to support all of you, without regard to party, to give you what is necessary to join in these decisions. We owe it to our country and to our future.
Our second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves tonight, before the eyes of America, to enacting bipartisan campaign finance reform.
Senators McCain and Feingold, Representatives Shays and Meehan, have reached across party lines to craft tough and fair campaign reform. Their proposal would curb spending, reduce the role of special interests, create a level playing field between challengers and incumbents, and ban contributions from noncitizens and all corporate sources and the other large soft money contributions that both parties receive.
you know and i know that this can be delayed, You know and I know that delay will mean the death of reform. So let's set our own deadline. Let's work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy -- July 4.
There is a third piece of unfinished business: Over the last four years, we moved a record two and a quarter million people off the welfare rolls. Then last year we enacted landmark welfare reform, demanding that able-bodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from welfare to work.
Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility -- indeed, our moral obligation -- to make sure that people who must work can work. Now we must act to meet a new goal: two million more people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000.
Here is my plan:
Tax credits and other incentives to businesses that hire people off welfare. Incentives for job placement firms in states to create more jobs for welfare recipients. Training, transportation and child care to help people go to work.
Now I challenge every state: Turn those welfare checks into private sector paychecks. I challenge every religious congregation, every community nonprofit and every business to hire someone off welfare.
And I'd like to say especially to every employer in this country who has ever criticized the old welfare system: You cannot blame that old system anymore. We have torn it down. Now do your part. Give someone on welfare the chance to work.
Tonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations -- Sprint, Monsanto, U.P.S., Burger King and United Airlines -- will be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, large and small, to create jobs so people on welfare can move to work.
We passed welfare reform. All of you know I believe We were right to do it. But no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience unless you are prepared to finish the job.
And we must join together to do something else, too, something both Republican and Democratic governors have asked us to do: to restore basic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came to this country legally, who work hard, pay taxes and obey the law. To do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants.
Now looking ahead, the greatest step of all, the high threshold to the future we now must cross -- and my No. 1 priority for the next four years -- is to insure that Americans have the best education in the world. Thank you.
Let's work together to meet these three goals: every 8-year-old must be able to read; every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet; every 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.
My balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals -- $51 billion next year. But far more than money is required. I have a plan, a call to action for American education, based on these 10 principles:
First, a national crusade for education standards -- not Federal Government standards, but national standards representing what all of our students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century. Every state and school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards, and train teachers to lift students up to them. To help schools meet the standards and measure their progress, we will lead an effort over the next two years to develop national tests of student achievement in reading and math.
Tonight I issue a challenge to the nation: Every state should adopt high national standards, and by 1999 every state should test every fourth grader in reading and every eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are met.
Raising standards will not be easy, and some of our children will not be able to meet them at first. The point is not to put our children down, but to lift them up. Good tests will show us who needs help, what changes in teaching to make and which schools need to improve. They can help us to end social promotion. For no child should move from grade school to junior high, or junior high to high school, until he or she is ready.
Last month our Secretary of Education, Dick Riley, and I visited northern Illinois, where eighth-grade students from 20 school districts, in a project called First in the World, took the Third International Math and Science Study. That's a test that reflects the world-class standards our children must meet for the new era. And those students in Illinois tied for first in the world in science, and came in second in math. Two of them, Kristin Tanner and Chris Getsla, are here tonight with their teacher, Sue Winski. They prove that when we aim high and challenge our students, they will be the best in the world.
Second, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers. Most of us would not be here tonight without the help of such teachers. I know I wouldn't be here. For years many of our educators, led by North Carolina's Governor, Jim Hunt, and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have worked hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for excellence in teaching. Just 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995. My budget will enable 100,000 more to seek national certification as master teachers. We should reward and recognize our best teachers. And as we reward them, we should quickly and fairly remove those few who don't measure up and challenge more of our finest young people to consider teaching as a career.
Third, we must do more to help all our children read. Forty percent of our 8-year-olds cannot read on their own. That's why we have just launched the America Reads initiative -- to build a citizen army of one million volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by the end of the third grade. We will use thousands of Americorps volunteers to mobilize this citizen army. We want at least 100,000 college students to help. And tonight I am pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call, pledging that thousands of their work study students will serve for one year as reading tutors.
This is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal: you must use these tutors to help students read. And it is especially a challenge to our parents: you must read with your children every night.
This leads to the fourth principle: learning begins in the first days of life. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally and intellectually from their first days and, therefore, how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants. The First Lady has spent years writing about this issue, studying it. And she and I are going to convene a White House conference on early learning and the brain this spring, to explore how parents and educators can best use these startling new findings.
We already know we should start teaching children before they start school. That's why my budget expands Head Start to one million children by 2002. And that is why the Vice President and Mrs. Gore will host their annual family conference this June on what we can do to make sure that parents are an active part of their children's learning all the way through school. They've done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our life, and now they're turning their attention to getting more parents involved in their children's learning all the way through school. I thank you, Mr. Vice President, and I thank you especially, Tipper, for what you're doing.
Fifth, every state should give parents the power to choose the right public school for their children. Their right to choose will foster the competition and innovation that can make public schools better. We should also make it possible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools, schools that set and meet the highest standards and survive only as long as they do. Our plan will help America create 3,000 of these charter schools by the next century -- nearly seven times as many as there are today -- so that parents will have even more choices in sending their children to the best public schools.
Sixth, character education must be taught in our schools. We must teach our children to be good citizens. And we must continue to promote order and discipline, supporting communities that introduce school uniforms, impose curfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive students from the classroom and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs.
Seventh, we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools that are literally falling down. With the student population at an all-time high, and record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair, this has now become a serious national concern. My budget includes a new initiative: $5 billion to help communities finance $20 billion in school construction over the next four years.
Eighth, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education -- at least two years of college -- just as universal in America by the 21st century as a high school education is today, and we must open the doors of college to all Americans.
To do that, I propose America's Hope scholarship, based on Georgia's pioneering program: two years of a $1,500 tax credit for college tuition, enough to pay for the typical community college. I also propose a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for all tuition after high school, an expanded I.R.A. you can withdraw from tax-free for education and the largest increase in Pell Grant scholarships in 20 years. This plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on money saved for college tuition. I ask you to pass it and give every American who works hard the chance to go to college.
Ninth, in the 21st century we must expand the frontiers of learning across a lifetime. All our people, of whatever age, must have a chance to learn new skills. Most Americans live near a community college. The roads that take them there can be paths to a better future. My G.I. Bill for Workers will transform the confusing tangle of Federal training programs into a simple skill grant that will go directly into eligible workers' hands. For too long this bill has been sitting on that desk down there without action. I ask you to pass it now. Let's give more of our workers the ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime.
Tenth, we must bring the power of the Information Age into all our schools. Last year I challenged America to connect every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000, so that, for the first time in history, children in the most isolated rural town, the most comfortable suburbs, the poorest inner-city schools will have the same access to the same universe of knowledge. I ask your support to complete this historic mission.
That is my plan -- a call to action for American education. Some may say that it is unusual for a President to pay this kind of attention to education. Some may say it is simply because the President and his wonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than they can recall. That is not what is driving these proposals. We must understand the significance of this endeavor.
One of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the cold war was a bipartisan foreign policy; because our future was at stake, politics stopped at the water's edge. Now I ask you -- I ask all our nation's governors, and I ask teachers, parents and citizens all across America -- for a new nonpartisan commitment to education, because education is a critical national security issues for our future, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door.
To prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful forces of science and technology to benefit all Americans.
This is the first State of the Union carried live over the Internet, but we have only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should be the modern birthright of every citizen.
Our effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning. Now we should connect every hospital to the Internet, so doctors can instantly share data about their patients with the best specialists in the field. And I challenge the private sector to start by connecting every children's hospital as soon as possible, so that a child in bed can stay in touch with school, family and friends. A sick child need no longer be a child alone.
We must build the second generation of the Internet so our leading universities and national laboratories can communicate at speeds 1,000 times faster than today, to develop new medical treatments, new sources of energy and new ways of working together.
But we cannot stop there. As the Internet becomes our new town square, a computer in every home -- a teacher of all subjects, a connection to all cultures -- this will no longer be a dream, but a necessity. And over the next decade, that must be our goal.
We must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars probes and the international space station, both of which will have practical applications for our everyday living.
We must speed the remarkable advances in medical science. The human genome project is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life. American scientists have discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and medication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to reverse its effects -- and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives of people with H.I.V. and AIDS.
Since I took office, funding for AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health has increased dramatically, to $1.5 billion. With new resources, N.I.H. will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an AIDS vaccine, working with other scientists to finally end the threat of AIDS. Thank you. Remember that every year, every year we move up the discovery of an AIDS vaccine, we'll save millions of lives around the world. We must reinforce our commitment to medical science.
To prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger families.
Over the past four years, the Family and Medical Leave Act has helped millions of Americans take time off to be with their families. With new pressures on people in the way they work and live, I believe we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences and a child's medical checkup. We should pass flextime so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their families.
We must continue -- we must continue, step by step, to give more families access to affordable quality health care. Forty million Americans still lack health insurance. Ten million children still lack health insurance; 80 percent of them have working parents who pay taxes. That is wrong. My -- my balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to five million of those children. Since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance do so because their parents lose or change a job, my budget will also insure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep their health insurance. No child should be without a doctor just because a parent is without a job.
My Medicare plan modernizes Medicare, increases the life of the trust fund to 10 years, provides support for respite care for the many families with loved ones afflicted with Alzheimer's -- and, for the first time, it would fully pay for annual mammograms.
Just as we ended drive-through deliveries of babies last year, we must now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from the hospital only hours after a mastectomy. I ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that women can stay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy. With us tonight is Dr. Kristen Zarfos, a Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice spurred a national movement and inspired this legislation. I'd like her to stand so we can thank her for her efforts. Dr. Zarfos, thank you.
In the last four years, we have increased child support collections by 50 percent. Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for any parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this, his or her most sacred obligation.
Finally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that endanger their lives.
To prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger communities.
We should start with safe streets. Serious crime has dropped five years in a row. The key has been community policing -- and we must finish the job of putting 100,000 community police on our streets. We should pass the victims' rights amendment to the Constitution.
And I ask you to join me in mounting a full-scale assault on juvenile crime, with legislation that: declares war on gangs, with new prosecutors and tougher penalties; extends the Brady Bill so violent teen criminals will never be able to buy handguns; requires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use, and helps to keep our schools open after hours, on weekends and in the summer so young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to.
This balanced budget includes the largest antidrug effort ever: to stop drugs at their source, punish those who push them and teach our young people that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal and drugs will kill them.
Our growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural neighborhoods. But we must do more, to empower them to create the conditions in which families can flourish, and to create jobs through investment by business and loans by banks.
We should double the number of empowerment zones. They have already brought hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment rate has been cut in half in four years. We should restore contaminated urban land and buildings to productive use. We should expand the network of community development banks.
And together we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment approach -- including private-sector tax incentives -- to renew our capital city, so that Washington is a great place to live and work and is once again the proud face America shows to the world.
We must protect our environment in every community. In the last 4 years, we cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites, as many as in the previous 12. Now we should clean up 500 more of them, so that our children grow up next to parks, not poison. I urge you to pass my proposal to mak big polluters must live by this simple rule: if you pollute our environment, you should pay to clean it up.
In the last four years, we strengthened the nation's safe-food and clean-drinking-water laws. We protected some of America's rarest, most beautiful land in Utah's Red Rocks region, created three new national parks in the California desert and began to restore Florida's Everglades. Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our land. Tonight I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage rivers, to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and clean up pollution in the rivers, proving once again that we can grow the economy as we protect the environment.
We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate.
Now, we all know that in all of our communities, some of our children simply do not have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes, or schools, or neighborhoods. And that means the rest of us must do more, for they are our children too. That is why President Bush, Gen. Colin Powell and former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join Vice President Gore and me to lead the President's Summit of Service in Philadelphia in April.
Our national service program, Americorps, has already helped 70,000 young people work their way through college as they serve America. Now we intend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of ways. Citizen service is an American responsibility, which all Americans should embrace. And I ask your support for that endeavor.
I'd like to make just one last point about our national community. Our economy is measured in numbers and statistics, and it's very important. But the enduring worth of our nation lies in our values and our soaring spirit. So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the arts and humanities, I believe we should stand by them, and challenge our artists, musicians and writers, challenge our museums, libraries and theaters. We should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join with their fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the American spirit in every community -- a celebration of our common culture in the century that is past, and in the new one to come in the new millennium, so that we can remain the world's beacon not only of liberty but of creativity long after the fireworks have faded.
To prepare America for the 21st century, we must master the forces of change in the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an uncharted time.
Fifty years ago a farsighted America led in creating the institutions that secured victory in the cold war and built a growing world economy. As a result, today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share our interests.
Already, we have dismantled many of the blocs and barriers that divided our parents' world. For the first time, more people live under democracy than dictatorship, including every nation in our hemisphere but one -- and its day too will come.
Now we stand at another moment of change and choice -- and another time to be farsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and prosperity.
In this endeavor, our first task is to help build, for the first time, an undivided, democratic Europe. When Europe is stable, prosperous and at peace, America is more secure.
To that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries that were once our adversaries can become our allies. At the special NATO summit this summer, that is what we will begin to do. We must strengthen NATO's Partnership for Peace with nonmember allies. And we must build a stable partnership between NATO and a democratic Russia.
An expanded NATO is good for America. And a Europe in which all democracies define their future not in terms of what they can do to each other but in terms of what they can do together for the good of all -- that kind of Europe is good for America.
Second, America must look to the East no less than the West.
Our security demands it: Americans have fought three wars in Asia this century.
Our prosperity requires it: more than two million American jobs depend upon trade with Asia.
There, too, we are helping to shape an Asian Pacific community of cooperation, not conflict. Let our -- let our progress there not mask the peril that remains. Together with South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge the cold war's last divide. And I call on this Congress to fund our share of the agreement under which North Korea must continue to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapons program.
We must pursue a deeper dialogue with China -- for the sake of our interests and our ideals. An isolated China is not good for America. A China playing its proper role in the world is. I will go to China, and I have invited China's President to come here, not because we agree on everything but because engaging China is the best way to work on common challenges like ending nuclear testing -- and to deal frankly with fundamental differences like human rights.
Third, the American people must prosper in the global economy. We have worked hard to tear down trade barriers abroad, so that we can create good jobs at home. I am proud to say that today, America is once again the most competitive nation and the No. 1 exporter in the world.
Now we must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin America, the two fastest-growing regions on earth -- or be left behind as these emerging economies forge new ties with other nations. That is why we need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values.
We need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy. After all, we have the best workers and the best products. In a truly open market, we can out-compete anyone in the world. But this is about more than economics. By expanding trade, we can advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world. There is no better example of this than Latin America where democracy and open markets are on the march together. That is why I will visit there in the spring to reinforce our important ties.
We should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our neighbor Mexico from its economic crisis -- and we should all be proud that last month Mexico repaid the United States, three years ahead of schedule, with half a billion dollars profit for us. And today our exports to Mexico are at an all-time high.
America must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace -- from the Middle East to Haiti, from Northern Ireland to Africa. Taking reasonable risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts later.
With American leadership, the killing has stopped in Bosnia. Now the habits of peace must take hold. The new NATO force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to accelerate. Tonight I ask Congress to continue its strong support for our troops there. They are doing a remarkable job for America -- and America must do right by them.
Fifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security. In the past four years, we agreed to ban -- we led the way to a worldwide agreement to ban nuclear testing. With Russia, we dramatically cut our nuclear arsenals; we stopped targeting each other's citizens. We are acting to rid the world of land mines, and prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands. We are working with other nations, with renewed intensity, to stop terrorists and drug traffickers before they act, and to hold them fully accountable if they do.
Now we must rise to a new test of leadership: ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention. Make no mistake about it, it will make our troops safer from chemical attack. It will help us to fight terrorism. We have no more important obligations -- especially in the wake of what we now know about the gulf war. This treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning, supported by Republican and Democratic administrations alike -- and Republican and Democratic members of Congress alike -- and already approved by 68 nations. If we do not act by April 29 -- when this Convention goes into force, with us or without us -- we will lose the chance to have Americans leading and enforcing this effort. Together we must make the Chemical Weapons Convention law, so that at last we can begin to outlaw poison gas from the earth.
Finally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges.
We must maintain a strong and ready military. We must increase funding for weapons modernization by the year 2000, and we must take good care of our men and women in uniform. They are the world's finest.
We must also renew our commitment to America s diplomacy -- and pay our debts and dues to international financial institutions like the World Bank, and to a reforming United Nations. Every dollar -- every dollar we devote to preventing conflicts, to promoting democracy, to stopping the spread of disease and starvation brings a sure return in security and savings. Yet international affairs spending today is just 1 percent of the Federal budget -- a tiny fraction of what America invested in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war. If America is to continue to lead the world, we here who lead America simply must find the will to pay our way.
A farsighted America moved the world to a better place over these last 50 years. And it can do so for another 50 years. But a shortsighted America will soon find its words falling on deaf ears all around the world.
Almost exactly 50 years ago, in the first winter of the cold war, President Harry Truman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our country to meet its responsibilities of leadership. This was his warning: "If we falter, we may endanger the peace of the world -- and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation." That Congress, led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenberg, answered President Truman's call. Together they made the commitments that strengthened our country for 50 years. Now let us do the same. Let us do what it takes to remain the indispensable nation -- to keep America strong, secure and prosperous for another 50 years.
In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the power of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as one America.
All over the world, people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic and religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror. We are the world's most diverse democracy. And the world looks to us to show that it is possible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences.
America has always been a nation of immigrants. From the start, a steady stream of people, in search of freedom and opportunity, have left their own lands to make this land their home. We started as an experiment in democracy fueled by Europeans. We have grown into an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise.
My fellow Americans, we must never ever believe that diversity is a weakness -- it is our greatest strength. Americans speak every language, know every country. People on every continent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great potential and they always will, as long as we strive to give all of our citizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their greatness.
We are not there yet. We still see evidence of biting bigotry and intolerance, in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed buildings. We must fight against this, in our country and in our hearts.
A few days before my second inauguration, one of America's best-known pastors, Rev. Robert Schuller, suggested that I read Isaiah 58:12. It says, "Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in." I placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of office, on behalf of all Americans. For no matter what our differences -- in our faiths, our backgrounds, our politics -- we must all be repairers of the breach. We may not share a common past, but surely we share a common future.
I want to say a word about two other Americans who show us the way to that common future. Congressman Frank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a proud American whose family came from Mexico. He was only 51 years old. He earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam, and he went on to serve Texas and America fighting for our future in this chamber. We are grateful for his service and honored to have his mother, Lillie Tejeda, and his sister, Mary Alice, have come from Texas to be with us here tonight. And we welcome you. Thank you.
Gary Locke, the newly elected Governor of Washington State, is our first Chinese-American Governor in the history of our country. He's the proud son of two of the millions of Asian-American immigrants who have strengthened America with their hard work, family values and good citizenship.
Rev. Schuller, Congressman Tejeda, Governor Locke, along with Kristin Tanner, Chris Getsla, Sue Winski and Dr. Kristen Zarfos -- they're all Americans from different roots, whose lives reflect our shared values and the best of what we can become when we are one America.
We may not share a common past, but we surely do share a common future. Building one America is our most important mission, the foundation for many generations of every other strength we must build for this new century. Money cannot buy it, power cannot compel it, technology cannot create it. It can only come from the human spirit.
America is far more than a place; it is an idea -- the most powerful idea in the history of nations, and all of us in this chamber, we are now the bearers of that idea, leading a great people into a new world.
A child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century. Everything that child will know of America will be because of what we do now to build a new century.
We don't have a moment to waste. Tomorrow morning, there will be just over 1,000 days until the year 2000, 1,000 days to prepare our people, 1,000 days to work together. 1,000 days to build a bridge to a land of new promise.
My fellow Americans, we have work to do. Let us seize the days and the century.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

HEADLINE: SECOND TERM: THE REPUBLICAN;
G.O.P., After Fumbling in '96, Turns to Orator for Response

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Republicans took no chances this year with their response to President Clinton's State of the Union Message.
Last year's response, delivered by Senator Bob Dole, then his party's front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, was widely panned as a political disaster. The lighting was bad. He spoke from his empty office, with no audience to enliven the presentation. And the speech's highly partisan thrust, in sharp contrast to Mr. Clinton's conciliatory tone, sent a negative image across the country. 
 Tonight, Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, a 39-year-old Baptist minister who exercises his oratorical powers regularly from the pulpit, sought to offer the nation a more positive vision of the Republican Party.
Mr. Watts gave a polished performance, much rehearsed and professionally lighted before a live audience in the stately Library of Congress. But for all his skills and the Republican Party's careful calculations, Mr. Watts still found himself somewhat upstaged, not only by the media glare from the Simpson verdict across the country, but some of the fallout from his own gaffe in a Washington Post interview this morning.
In his response, the one-time football star and father of five children spoke of an agenda based less on policy than on inner personal strength.
"Government can't ease all pain," he said, referring to racial problems in America. "In fact, Government sometimes rubs the wound raw and makes the healing harder. The Republicans know that we must, individually, all of us, accept our share of responsibility. We must decide, as we stand on the edge of a new age, if we will be a captive of the past."
Mr. Watts spoke moments after President Clinton concluded his speech and moments after the verdict was announced in the O. J. Simpson civil trial in California. While the networks switched to California immediately after Mr. Clinton finished, they returned to Washington for Mr. Watts. But a few minutes into his speech, some networks split their screens between Mr. Watts and the trial; all returned immediately to California when Mr. Watts finished.
Mr. Watts's notion that Government cannot solve racial problems created havoc today when The Washington Post quoted him in a manner that suggested that he was calling Jesse Jackson and Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington "race-hustling poverty pimps" because their careers depend on keeping black people dependent on Government.
Mr. Watts said in a statement tonight that Mr. Jackson's and Mr. Barry's names were, correctly, not included in quotation marks because he made the comments in reference to "some of the leadership in the black community but not in reference to Reverend Jackson or Mayor Barry."
Mr. Jackson, who had been invited to sit tonight in Speaker Newt Gingrich's box in the House chamber to hear the President's speech, told the Speaker earlier today that he would feel uncomfortable sitting there after Mr. Watts's remarks. Mr. Gingrich eventually smoothed the matter over and Mr. Jackson agreed to join Mr. Gingrich tonight.
But Mr. Jackson's son, Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, fired off an angry letter to Mr. Watts demanding a public apology to his father.
Mr. Watts's speech tonight included some standard Republican fare as he advocated a balanced budget amendment and tax relief and asserted that the nation's heart was in the heartland, not in Washington.
"Our mission is to return power to your home, to where mothers and fathers can exercise it according to their beliefs," Mr. Watts said.
But chiefly, the second-term Congressman offered a personal sermon that examined the matter of race from his singular perspective as the only black Republican in the House and focused, above all, on character and faith-based values.
"Our first priority is to bring values back and give them pride of place in our moral and economic renewal," he said. At another point he added: "We must be a people of prayer, a people who pray as if the strength of our nation depends on it because it does. When you come right down to it, that's our vision and our agenda."
While he generally praised President Clinton, he was sharply critical of what he described as Mr. Clinton's reliance on Government in solving racial problems.
"I am afraid that when the Administration and others talk about race," Mr. Watts said, "it sounds to me like the same old, same old -- a bunch of sermons and sloganizing that defends the old assumption that Government can heal the racial divide."
Mr. Watts, whose father was the first black police officer in Eufaula, Okla., was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula, a town of 3,000 people that is 30 percent black, 25 percent white and 45 percent American Indian. Mr. Watts grew up to be the first black quarterback at his high school and the first black to win statewide office in Oklahoma.
"I'm just old enough to remember the Jim Crow brand of discrimination," Mr. Watts said. "In my lifetime, there have been some great and good laws that took some evil and ignorant laws off the books. So, legislation has its place. But we're at a point now where we have to ask ourselves some questions: If legislation is the answer to the racial divide in our nation, then why, in our time, has the division grown?"
He went on: "The fact is, our problems can't be solved by legislation alone. Surely we have learned from our long, difficult journey a great truth: Government can't ease all the pain."
He may have been referring in part to Mr. Clinton's continued support for affirmative action programs.
Mr. Watts believes that the country has not achieved a level playing field, his spokeswoman said, but he does not support set-aside programs and quotas and says Congress should go slowly on any legislation that tries to correct the inequities.
Rather, he believes, the solutions should be found within. It was his expression of this view that led to today's dispute with Mr. Jackson and his son.
In Jesse Jackson Jr.'s letter to Mr. Watts, he defended his father, saying that he had worked extensively in the private sector to help blacks economically and first made his name as executive director of Operation Breadbasket, the private-sector economic arm of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Mr. Watts's speech was first drafted last week by Landon Parvin, a longtime Republican speechwriter, and was massaged by numerous others until Mr. Watts took over the process.
"It's 100 percent him," said Rich Galen, communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. "It's a speech no one else could give."
As he rehearsed repeatedly with a Teleprompter, Mr. Watts also reviewed tapes of Mr. Dole's speech last year and that of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who gave the response in 1995.
Mr. Galen said that House leaders asked Mr. Watts to deliver the response, normally an honor bestowed on a party leader or a rising star, because "he represents what most Republicans want most people to think the Republican Party is -- young, smart, he made his own way, he's well-educated and he works hard to help people solve their problems."
Aides to Republican leaders on Capitol Hill said he was chosen because he was a good speaker and had made a strong impression when he spoke last summer at the Republican National Convention in San Diego.
"He also gives a lot of credibility to the ethics and character issue," said one top aide, quoting Mr. Watts's favorite line, used again in his speech tonight, that "character does count, and that character is doing what's right when nobody's looking."

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM;
The Republicans' Reply: 'The Strength of America Is Not in Washington'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Following is the Republican response, delivered by Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, to President Clinton's State of the Union Message:
Good evening. 
 My name is J. C. Watts Jr. I'm the Republican Congressman from the Fourth District of Oklahoma, and I've been asked to speak to the American people in response to the President's address this evening.
Before I get into my presentation, I want to send condolences to the Tejeda family on behalf of the 105th Congress. Frank was a friend, he was a wonderful spirit, and he will be surely missed.
I don't intend to take a lot of your time -- it's late, and there has been a lot of talk already this evening. But I want to tell you a little bit about where I'm from.
I grew up in Oklahoma. My district includes the towns of Midwest City, Norman, Lawton, Walters, Waurika and Duncan, just to name a few. We raise cattle back home, we grow some cotton and wheat, peanuts, and we drill for oil.
We've got Tinker and Altus Air Force Bases nearby, and we have the Army post at Fort Sill. The University of Oklahoma is there. That's where I went to school. I played a little football and graduated with a degree in journalism.
I tell you all this because I want you to know that the district I'm blessed to represent is as diverse as America itself. It's the kind of place reporters usually call the heartland, and they're right -- in so many ways, it is America's heart.
I'm going to try to use my words tonight, and my time, not to confuse issues but to clarify them, not to obscure my philosophy and my party's but to illuminate it. Because the way I see it, the purpose of politics is to lead, not to mislead.
Those of us who have been sent to Washington have a moral responsibility to offer more than poll-tested phrases and winning smiles. We must offer a serious vision. We must share our intentions. We must make our plans clear.
That's my job tonight: to tell you what we believe -- what the Republican Party believes, and what we will work for.
We believe first of all that the state of this Union really isn't determined in Washington, D.C. It never has been, and it never will be. But for a long time the Federal Government has been grabbing too much power and too much authority over all of the people. And it is those people, it is all of us, who decide the real state of the Union.
Doc Benson in Oklahoma City decides the state of the Union. He runs a nonprofit called the Education and Employment Ministry, where he believes that you restore men and women by restoring their dreams and finding them a job.
Freddy Garcia is the state of the Union, also. Freddy was a drug addict in San Antonio, Tex. Now he has a ministry helping people get off drugs. His Victory Fellowship has success rates that the social scientists can only dream of.
I saw the state of the Union last week in Marlow, Okla. A bunch of us met at the elementary school, where we ate beef brisket and baked beans, and the Chamber of Commerce recognized the Farm Family of the Year. The McCarleys won, and their kids were oh so proud.
The strength of America is not in Washington. The strength of America is at home, in lives well lived in the land of faith and family. The strength of America is not on Wall Street but on Main Street, not in big business but in small businesses with local owners and workers. It's not in Congress, it's in the city hall.
And I pray Republicans and Democrats both understand this. We shouldn't just say it -- we should live it.
And so we have made it our mission to limit the claims and demands of Washington, to limit its call for more power, more authority and more taxes. Our mission is to return power to your home, to where mothers and fathers can exercise it according to their beliefs.
So let me tell you three actions the Republicans will take in the coming year.
First, we can help our country by bringing back the knowledge, the ancient wisdom, that we're nothing without our spiritual, traditional and family values. The Republicans will take action to give those values a bigger place in solving America's problems. After all, our values are more important to our future than any so-called bureaucratic breakthrough.
Think about your life and how you built it. I didn't get my values from Washington. I got my values from my parents, from Buddy and Helen Watts in Eufaula, Okla. I got my values growing up in a poor black neighborhood on the east side of the railroad tracks, where money was scarce but dreams were plentiful and love was all around. I got my values from a strong family, a strong church and a strong neighborhood.
I wasn't raised to be Republican or Democrat. My parents just taught by example. They taught me and my brothers and sisters that if you lived under their roof, you were going to work.
They taught us if you made a mistake, as we all do, you've got to own up to it, you call it what it is and you try to turn it around.
They taught us if you spend more money than you make, you're on a sure road to disaster.
I was taught to respect everyone for the simple reason that we're all God's children. I was taught, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and from my uncle Wade Watts, to judge a man not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character. And I was taught that character does count and that character is simply doing what's right when nobody's looking.
My parents also taught me I could do anything if I applied myself and understood sacrifice and commitment.
Now, if you agree with those things my parents taught me and that I'm trying to teach my children, then, friends, we have common ground.
It is the Republican Party that has been trying to return these values to government. And it hasn't been easy, because for a long time the Government has acted as if it didn't have any common sense.
Here's an example. For the past 30 years, our nation's spent $5 trillion trying to erase poverty. And the result, as you know, is that we didn't get rid of it at all. In fact, we spread it. We destroyed the self-esteem of millions of people, grinding them down in a welfare system that penalizes moms for wanting to marry the father of their children and penalizes moms for wanting to save money. Friends, that's not right.
Last year the Republican Congress moved to reform the welfare system, and for the first time in my lifetime we're helping people climb the ladder of economic opportunity.
Let me tell you the next step. A number of my colleagues and I, my Republican colleagues and I, are working on a package called the American Community Renewal Act. It seeks to return government to the side of the institutions that hold communities together: faith, family, hard work, strong neighborhoods. This will help rebuild low-income communities through their own moral renewal and giving them economic opportunity. It also recognizes that faith-based institutions contribute to the healing of our nation's problems.
So our first priority is to bring values back and give them pride of place in our moral and economic renewal, and in the next few weeks we will be visiting a number of communities to highlight the accomplishments of active faith-based organizations.
The second thing Republicans will do is face a problem that demands immediate attention.
We must get our Government's financial affairs in order. The biggest step in that direction is an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that demands that the Federal Government balance its books.
We are more than $5 trillion in debt. This year we will spend $330 billion on interest payments alone on the national debt. And you know what? Not one dime of that $330 billion will go to strengthen Medicare, Medicaid. Not one dime of it will go to find a cure for cancer or fight drugs and crime. And worse yet, not one dime will go toward learning, making the classrooms a centerpiece of our education.
Over $5 trillion worth of national debt is more than financially irresponsible. Friends, it's immoral, because someone is going to have to pay the piper. And you know who it's going to be? It's going to be our kids and our grandkids.
The American family is already overtaxed. Right now the average family spends about half of every dollar they earn in some type of government tax or government fee. Consider a 5-year-old child today. If things continue as they are, by the time they're 25 they'll pay about 84 cents of every dollar they make in some government tax or government fee. Friends, that's more than a shame, it's a scandal.
The balanced budget amendment will force the Government to change its ways -- permanently. No longer will the President or Congress be able to spend money we don't have on benefits our children will never see.
In a few weeks we will vote on that amendment. Republicans can't pass it on our own; it takes a two-thirds majority. So we need Democrat votes, and we need your help. We need you to write or call your representative and senators and tell them to pass the balanced budget amendment now.
And here's the good news: A balanced budget will lower your house payment, lower your car payment, lower your student loan payments. The savings could be as much as $1,500 a year. Well, to some up here in Washington $1,500 may not be much. However, it's a new washer and dryer, it's a home computer, or money toward a much-needed second car for a hard-working family.
And by the way, don't believe all those dire warnings about the amendment wrecking Social Security. That's just not true. I encourage all of us in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, to appeal to people's intelligence and not to their fears.
President Clinton was right on target tonight. He said people want bipartisanship. I believe they do. But they want the kind of bipartisanship that results in progress. They don't want phony compromise. They don't want the kind of weak, back-scratching, go-along-to-get-along bipartisanship that allows lawmakers to feel good but gets bad results.
There are some striking examples of cooperation this past year. When Republicans led the effort to reform welfare, President Clinton opposed it at first. But eventually, after we passed it, he bowed to the will of the people and signed it. We applaud the President's embrace of reform.
And Mr. President, from the bottom of my heart: We are pleased to continue this bipartisan effort.
And there was a promise of bipartisanship tonight when the President signaled his interest in tax relief. Working Americans need real tax relief, not just targeted tax cuts to help one group at the expense of another. We all pay too much in taxes.
I hope the President shares this belief with us, and works with us to bring desperately needed tax relief to America's working families.
And we must work together, Democrats and Republicans, to win the twin wars against drugs and ignorance. The war on drugs can and will be won in large measure by making sure that every child in America can walk to school safely, sit in a classroom where the teacher can really help them learn.
Third and finally, I want to say a few words about the Republican vision of how we can continue to make this "one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
You know, I'm just old enough to remember the Jim Crow brand of discrimination. I've seen issues of race hurt human beings and hurt our entire nation. Too often when we talk about racial healing, we make the old assumption that government can heal the racial divide.
In my lifetime there have been some great and good laws that took some evil and ignorant laws off the books. So legislation has its place. But friends, we're at a point now where we have to ask ourselves some questions, and I ask you:
If legislation is answer to the racial divide in our nation, then why in God's name in our time has the division grown?
Why is the healing we long for so far from reality?
Why does it seem that the more laws we pass, the less love we have?
The fact is, our problems can't be solved by legislation alone. Surely we have learned from our long, difficult journey a great truth: government can't ease all pain. We must deal with the heart of man.
Republicans and Democrats -- red, yellow, black and white -- have to understand that we must individually, all of us, accept our share of responsibility. We must decide, as we stand on the edge of the new age, if we will be a captive of the past.
America must be a place where all of us -- red, yellow, brown, black and white -- in some way feel a part of the American dream. It does not happen by dividing us into racial groups. It did not happen by trying to turn rich against poor or by using the politics of fear. It does not happen by reducing our values to the lowest common denominator. And friends, it does not happen by asking Americans to accept what's immoral and wrong in the name of tolerance.
We must make our mark on the future as a people who care -- care for our families, for one another, for our neighbors, for all the beautiful children.
We must make our mark as a people who share and help each other in need.
We must be a people who dare -- dare to take responsibility for our hatreds and fears and ask God to heal us from within.
And we must be a people of prayer, a people who pray as if the strength of our nation depended on it -- because it does. When you come right down to it, that's our vision and our agenda.
All over the country, I've often told the story of a boy and his father. The father was trying to get some work done. And the boy wanted the daddy's attention, but the father was busy at his desk with so much to do. To occupy the boy, this father gave his son a pencil and a paper, and said, "Here, Son, go draw the family." Two minutes later he was back with a picture -- all stick figures.
So the dad, trying to buy some more time, said, "Here, go draw the dog." Two minutes later he comes back with another stick figure. Now the father was exasperated. He looked around, he saw a magazine, and he remembered that he had seen a picture of the world in this magazine. In what he thought was a stroke of genius, the father tore out the picture and tore it into 20 different pieces, and he said, "Here, Son, go put the world back together."
And you know what happened? Five minutes later the little Michelangelo was back, saying, "Daddy, look what I've done!"
The father looked, and he said, "Son, how did you do it so quickly? How did you put the world back together so quickly?"
And the little boy answered: "Dad, it was easy. There was a picture of a man on the back of the map, on the back of the world. And once I put the man back together the world fell into place."
And friends, this is our agenda: to put our men and women back together, to put ourselves back together and in that way get our country back together.
I am reminded of the final words of President John Kennedy's inaugural address. He said this: "Let us go forth to lead the land we love, knowing that here on earth, God's work must truly be our own."
I say Amen to that.
Thank you for your graciousness in listening to me so late in the evening. God bless you, and God bless our children. And thank you very much.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: THE OVERVIEW;
PRESIDENT, CITING EDUCATION AS TOP PRIORITY OF 2D TERM, ASKS FOR A 'CALL TO ACTION'

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton tonight assembled the patchwork proposals of his last Presidential campaign into an agenda for his final term, issuing a "call to action" to the nation and arguing that even within straitened budgets the Federal Government could help improve education, modernize technology and provide health care.
The ideas, themes and even phrases of last year's campaign rang through his State of the Union Message tonight as Mr. Clinton strove to show how they would transcend clever electoral politics to become sound and lasting policy. 
 "Now we must rise to the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better than any we have ever known," Mr. Clinton said in a fluid hourlong speech to both Houses of Congress. [Transcript, page A20.]
Without announcing any major Federal spending initiatives, Mr. Clinton described a "new kind of government -- not to solve all our problems for us, but to give our people, all our people, the tools they need to make the most of their own lives."
He urged Congress to balance the budget without amending the Constitution to do so, and to enact changes in the campaign finance laws by July 4. He returned often to the possibilities of high technology, envisioning a country in which the Internet "becomes our new town square" and laboratories and universities communicate 1,000 times faster than they do today.
Mr. Clinton, at the height of his popularity in opinion polls, entered the House chamber tonight to a boisterous ovation, which prompted him to thank the assembled representatives more than a dozen times before they settled down. His introduction by Speaker Newt Gingrich called forth another ovation, and 10 more thank yous.
As Mr. Clinton prepared to begin speaking, it was unclear how closely Americans would listen, since the verdict in the O. J. Simpson civil trial was pending. But with the verdict delayed for an hour, the broadcast networks devoted their full attention to the State of the Union.
Singling out two eighth-grade students seated in the gallery for a Congressional ovation, Mr. Clinton dwelled tonight on education, which he called "my No. 1 priority for the next four years." He slotted his academic proposals, most of which were announced during the campaign, into a 10-point plan for improving education and expanding its reach, by plugging classrooms into the Internet, helping schools make long-deferred repairs and increasing Federal assistance to college students.
"Character education must be taught in our schools," he said.
Mr. Clinton called for voluntary testing against national standards in reading and math by 1999, emphasizing that the standards were not to be a Federal requirement, but "a challenge to the nation."
The President urged a "new nonpartisan commitment to education," rephrasing the foreign policy mantra of the cold war to declare, "Politics must stop at the schoolhouse door."
With Mr. Gingrich and Vice President Al Gore seated behind him, Mr. Clinton pounded the air periodically with his left fist, punching once for each beat as he declared, "The state of our union is strong."
He departed from his prepared text as he discussed balancing the budget, leaning confidentially over the lectern to make an appeal for comity between the parties, and between the White House and Capitol Hill. "I know this is not going to be easy," he said.
"But I really believe one of the reasons the American people gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next four years that will carry our country through the next 50 years," he continued. "I know it is easier for me than for you to say or do. But another reason I was elected is to support all of you, without regard to party, to give you what is necessary to join in these decisions. We owe it to our country and to our future."
As he did in his second inaugural address, Mr. Clinton called for racial healing, a message he underscored by recognizing several members of minority groups in the balcony.
Mr. Clinton said building "one America" was the country's most important mission.
"Money cannot buy it," he said. "Power cannot compel it. Technology cannot create it. It must rise from the human spirit."
After the speech Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, praised Mr. Clinton for a "good first step toward cooperation." But, he added, "words are nice; we're waiting for the deeds."
A close student of history eager to secure his own place in it, Mr. Clinton has analyzed the pitfalls that tripped up previous second-term Presidents. Three days after the election, he argued that a "driving agenda" was the key to success, and his aides were at pains today to present him as having seized the initiative.
Erskine Bowles, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, said in almost the same breath that Mr. Clinton would use his speech to present "a real action plan" and "a true concrete plan of action."
Mr. Clinton was satisfied with most of the speech by late afternoon, aides said -- for him, unusually early. Freed from most of his habitual last-minute fiddling, Mr. Clinton used the time to rehearse four times and to rest. His preparation showed in a smooth, often conversational delivery, without a knitted brow or head bob out of place. The speech was interrupted 70 times for applause.
Offering the Republican response, Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma also steered clear of explosively partisan fare, stressing instead the values that he said he learned outside Washington.
But Mr. Watts expressed far less optimism in the potential for Government. "Our mission is to return power to your home, to where mothers and fathers can exercise it according to their beliefs," he said.
Mr. Clinton's senior aides believe that, after the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, the President has gained the upper hand in the debate over the efficacy of Government. Rather than defensively argue that the Federal agencies under assault from the Republicans, like the Departments of Commerce and Education, should continue to exist, Mr. Clinton instead described tonight how they could be put to the best use.
But Republicans were quick to say that Mr. Clinton's speech demonstrated that their view of Government had won out.
"I am very pleased that President Clinton has so heartily endorsed the Republican agenda of a smaller, smarter Federal Government," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip.
For his part, however, Mr. Clinton apparently felt confident enough in public support for Government to defend Federal financing for the arts and humanities against the perennial attacks of conservatives and deficit hawks -- though he stopped well short of calling for more money.
"The enduring worth of our nation lies in our shared values and our soaring spirit," the President said. "So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the arts and humanities, I believe we should stand by them."
Surveying the international scene, Mr. Clinton urged an expansion of NATO by 1999, although he did not name the countries he would like to invite in. He called for a "deeper dialogue" with China but did not retreat from his policy of engagement.
"An isolated China is not good for America," he said. "Engaging China is the best way to work on common challenges like ending nuclear testing -- and to deal frankly with fundamental differences like human rights."
Mr. Clinton also firmly repeated his support for removing international trade restrictions.
"We must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin America, two of the fastest growing regions on earth," Mr. Clinton said, "or be left behind as these emerging economies forge new ties with other nations."
Mr. Clinton went on to make what officials said was a veiled appeal for Congressional assistance in expanding the scope of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"We need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values," he said.
Mr. Clinton did not linger on his economic plans at home, barely mentioning his tax cut proposals -- and not mentioning his tax increases at all. He said his budget would "provide middle-class tax relief to pay for education and health care, to help raise a child, to buy and sell a home."
Mr. Clinton's tax cuts would cost $100 billion over five years, and are roughly half of what Republicans are proposing. He did not say that he would pay for about $80 billion of his tax reductions by closing loopholes and extending expiring taxes.
Mr. Clinton explained his education proposals at length tonight, calling education "a critical national security issue for our future." But his proposals, officials stressed, were not budget busters. In all, they said, Mr. Clinton would request $51 billion for education and worker training in the next fiscal year, an increase of 20 percent from the current year. By the year 2002, that total would approach $60 billion, officials said.
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, fourth graders would be tested in reading, and eighth graders in math. But officials said the cost of the program would be minimal. The Federal Government would pay to help create the tests, officials said, and would also cover the costs for each school district of administering them for the first time.
Having long since abandoned plans for sweeping changes in the health care system, Mr. Clinton proposed more incremental steps tonight. He noted that 10 million children go without health insurance in the United States, and declared that he planned to extend insurance to half of them -- a multibillion-dollar proposal that Administration officials put no price tag on today.
Mr. Clinton also urged, as he had before, that the recently changed welfare law be amended to restore coverage to legal immigrants.
"To do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants," the President said.
Even though he judged the state of the union strong, Mr. Clinton invested his message tonight with a sense of urgency.
"We must be shapers of events, not observers," he said. "For if we do not act, the moment will pass -- and we will lose the best possibilities of our future. We face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy: the enemy of our time is inaction."

HEADLINE: Republicans Offer to Forgo Drafting Their Own Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Rather than develop its own budget proposal, the Republican leadership in Congress wants to try to reach agreement with the Clinton Administration in the next few months on the broad elements of a program to eliminate the Federal deficit, Congressional aides said today.
The Republicans had intended to spend the next several months fleshing out their own partisan plan as a negotiating counterpoint to the budget proposal that President Clinton will send to Congress on Thursday. Instead, aides said, the Republicans now want to skip that process and work with the Administration and Congressional Democrats to develop a budget blueprint that will be acceptable to both sides before trying to hash out the details later in the year. 
 The effort will not necessarily involve continuing and direct negotiations between the Republican leadership and the White House, they said. But the invitation issued on Sunday by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, to Mr. Clinton to begin talks was intended to give it some momentum, the aides said. The White House said tonight that Mr. Clinton would go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with Mr. Lott and the rest of the Republican leadership.
The Republicans said their goal would be to produce a bipartisan "budget resolution," the document that lays out the general shape of the budget and serves as the basis for detailed tax and spending legislation.
Some Republicans warned that the bipartisan process they envision could still fall apart, and it was unclear whether the effort -- led by Mr. Lott and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader -- had the support of all their colleagues, especially in the House.
Furthermore, even if the two sides can agree on a budget resolution or come close, their battles would not necessarily be over. Many of the details of spending cuts or other changes to programs like Medicare and Medicaid are complex and could be hotly debated. Similarly, agreement on the scope of tax cuts could leave open questions about whether they should be focused on specific problems, like the rising costs of college, as the Administration prefers, or whether they should benefit taxpayers more generally, as the Republicans prefer.
But the approach would allow Republicans to avoid putting forward a complete package of specific spending cuts to offset the $193 billion in tax cuts they have proposed over the next five years while also eliminating a deficit that is projected to reach $188 billion in 2002. Republicans said their leadership was eager to make progress before the commitments to bipartisanship from both sides are eroded by the political give and take of the legislative season.
"If the President's budget is very solid and lives up to the expectations the White House has prepared for it, certainly there's a chance to get things nailed down very quickly," said Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Armey.
"Two years ago, the President didn't even have a budget that balanced," Ms. Davis said. "This time, he's starting on our ground, with a budget that balances by 2002 and includes tax cuts. So why counter something that's already on your playing field?"
While arguing that it was the Republicans who had given ground, White House officials today said they were pleased that the Republicans viewed the Administration's budget as a sincere move toward reaching an agreement.
"The President's goal was to put down a serious balanced budget plan that could be the basis for bipartisan negotiation," said Gene Sperling, the chairman of the National Economic Council. "The fact that his budget is being acknowledged as a serious plan that is a good framework to build a bipartisan agreement is good news for everyone."
For the last two years, the Congressional budget resolution and the President's budget proposals have offered starkly different philosophies of government and have left the two sides far apart on tax and spending cuts.
But with both sides having moderated their positions on major issues like Medicare, and with a strong economy having reduced the size of the deficit last year to its lowest level in 15 years, Democrats and Republicans alike have been increasingly optimistic in recent weeks about reaching an agreement this year.
For Democrats, allowing the Republicans to negotiate without putting forth their own budget proposals would carry some political cost because it would deprive Democrats of the opportunity to criticize specific Republican spending cuts. Democratic aides said there would be considerable dissension among Democrats about taking the path the Republicans want.
Still, some Congressional Democrats as well as Republicans said the Republican proposal could speed the budget process along and reduce the risk that heated rhetoric would harden positions on both sides and derail chances of an agreement.
"Rather than go through the Kabuki dance where the President produces something and then we produce something, we will work off the document he sends up and proceed from there," said one Senate Republican aide involved in the budget process.

HEADLINE: THE SIMPSON VERDICT: THE REACTION;
In New York, Many People Anticipated The Verdict

BYLINE: PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
This time, almost no one erupted in ecstatic cheers or gasped in stunned dismay. This time, almost no one seemed surprised.
Many New Yorkers, in fact, were not even paying attention when the verdict in O. J. Simpson's civil trial was unveiled last night. After all, the Knicks were playing the Houston Rockets. And President Clinton had just finished delivering his State of the Union address. 
 When Mr. Simpson's acquittal in his criminal trial was announced in October 1995, reactions across the country were explosive -- and shaped largely by race. Then, many blacks pumped the air with their fists in victory. Whites shook their heads in disgust or dropped their mouths in stunned silence.
That trial, with its sensational allegations of tainted evidence and racial bias, had transfixed the country. Millions had been glued to the televised proceedings, but the verdict seemed to shock even the most dedicated viewers.
Last night, when the jury announced that it had found Mr. Simpson liable for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman, most responses also seemed to be molded along racial lines, but they were more subdued and jaded.
In the Blarney Pub, a bar in Jamaica, Queens, the largely black clientele was avidly watching the Knicks game, dancing to the jukebox or shooting pool when the verdict was announced. No one turned up the volume on the television set.
"This is no case," said Eric Gravesande, 46, an economist for I.B.M. who lives in Jamaica, Queens. "This is almost double jeopardy."
Mr. Gravesande said he had expected the civil jury to find Mr. Simpson culpable. He said he felt Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki had swayed the outcome of the trial from the beginning, by barring most testimony about allegations that the police had framed Mr. Simpson out of racial prejudice.
Others referred to the mostly white jury and the perception that the civil trial was an attempt by the white establishment to find a way to convict Mr. Simpson.
"I know once they brought him for the second trial, he would be found guilty," said Frank Burgess, 52, a high school social studies teacher in Jamaica. "He had to be found guilty to placate the white population."
At Junior's, a family-style restaurant in downtown Brooklyn, Gary Roach, a 26-year-old black minister, said, "I figured it would probably go this way because of the jury's makeup and the judge."
Sitting with him, Steve Wagmon, a 38-year-old white minister from Fort Worth, said he was "very happy about it because it brings a small amount of relief to the parents." He added, "I'm glad he's going to pay, because I think he should have been convicted in the criminal trial."
Some whites, like Anne Waldron, a restaurant manager from Cobble Hill Brooklyn, also thought the verdict was swayed by the majority of whites on the jury.
"I think the jury makeup had a huge bearing on the outcome," said Ms. Waldron, who said she was relieved by the verdict. "I'm certainly glad it's over and he's going to pay the price for what he did."
There was some tension in the eighth floor lounge of Schapiro Hall, a dormitory at Columbia University. As the counts were being read, everyone fixated on the television. Elena Nunez smiled with each yes verdict. She called the civil decision "a redemption." As the yes verdicts continued, students murmured "Uh oh, he's in trouble" and "A clean sweep?" and "Oh my God!"
Melissa Gammon, 18, a freshman, called the $8.5 million award "small peanuts compared to what they should have been compensated."
Ketsia Alexandre, an 18-year-old freshman, flashed with anger.
"People just wanted to punish O. J.," she said. "It was a way to appease the public."
People seemed more disinterested at the West End, a bar on 113th and Broadway, where the bartender had the television turned to the Knicks-Rockets game and said she did not plan to switch it to the verdict.
At Lenox Lounge, on Lenox Avenue off 125th Street in Harlem, Zebbra King said she was "tired" of the Simpson case. Neil Cole, 65, said, "quite frankly, I stopped following it after the first verdict." And Norma Campbell, a bartender, said, "To me I feel like he's being retried."
But at the Blarney Pub in Jamaica, Mr. Gravesande was thoughtful. He said the verdict would only intensify the racial wounds opened in the first O. J. Simpson trial.
"This country was polarized before this civil trial and will remain polarized after the civil trial," Mr. Gravesande said, "because black people will never accept that O. J. Simpson got a fair shake in the civil trial. To most black people, the verdict in the civil trial is immaterial."

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: EDUCATION;
President Reprises the Goals Of U.S. Achievement Standards

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
As the governor who pushed through sweeping changes in Arkansas' schools in the 1980's, Bill Clinton rode the issue of education into national prominence, which propelled his original candidacy for President in 1992.
Now entering his second term as President, Mr. Clinton has turned once again to education as his "No. 1 priority," proposing an increase in education spending and a 10-point "call to action for American education" to mobilize parents, students, teachers and volunteers across the country. 
 The proposals Mr. Clinton announced in his State of the Union address tonight sounded much like those he had advocated when he led the National Governors' Association's education efforts in the late 1980's. He had challenged states across the nation to adopt high standards and test every third grader in reading and every eighth grader in math. He called for a "citizen army of 1 million volunteer tutors" to make sure every child can read by the third grade.
Mr. Clinton announced that he would increase financing for Head Start preschool programs and for charter schools, which are free of some constraints of state and local education bureaucracy. He included a $5 billion initiative for school construction. And he proposed two tax breaks for families earning less than $100,000, to help with the often staggering expenses of college.
The intellectual impetus for Mr. Clinton's education push is clear, as are the politics of it. As the President has said often, education increasingly determines who will succeed and who will fail in the stratified post-industrial information age. Moreover, education has enormous political appeal and was one of the main issues he used in his campaign to court swing voters in middle-class suburbia and set himself apart from the Republicans even as he embraced many of their fiscal principles.
Despite Mr. Clinton's fervent appeal to make American schools "the envy of the world" and his pledge to increase education financing by 20 percent, to $51 billion in the 1998 Federal fiscal year, there is a fundamental difference between being the Education President -- as George Bush once called himself years before Mr. Clinton -- and being the education governor.
Governors, not Presidents, have direct power over education in this country, controlling much of the funding and passing the laws central to the structure and operation of the public schools. Moreover, less than a year ago, Mr. Clinton attended a conference of governors and echoed their contention that setting standards in education should be up to the states. "I accept your premise," he said then. "We can only do better with tougher standards and better assessment and you should set the standards."
In his book, "Behind the Oval Office," Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's former strategist, said the stand was a "cop-out," and that Mr. Clinton wanted to impose standards but had backed down in the face of polling.
That is why tonight, Mr. Clinton announced that the Federal Government would develop tests to measure student achievement in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math, but stopped short of requiring that schools administer the tests. Instead he plans to use his power of exhortation to rally the nation -- including 50 governors and 14,000 public school districts -- to embrace his call for a "national crusade for education standards."
Educators were expecting Mr. Clinton's emphasis on schooling and even before his address they were praising his intentions. "I certainly think a President helps to set priorities and provides a visibility through media and television no one else can," said Michael D. Usdan, president of the Institute for Educational Leadership, a Washington-based education group.
The educators also said that the development of a rigorous national test -- which would be modeled on an existing international test and an existing national one -- would be a valuable tool for localities to measure individual students and entire schools against national and international norms. Currently those tests can only be used to gauge how the nation as a whole ranks against other countries or measure achievement in a whole state. But those rankings are of limited use to a teacher.
A test, as Chester E. Finn Jr., a former assistant secretary of education in the Reagan Administration put it, "is a thermometer, not a therapy. It tells you you've got a fever; it doesn't tell you how to get well."
A crucial test for Mr. Clinton in the next few years will be whether his program really can help America's schools improve student achievement.
For it has been seven years since President Bush and Governor Clinton, along with many other governors, held an education summit and introduced six national educational goals to be reached by 2000. Some of them sounded very much like what Mr. Clinton was articulating tonight. The goals included a standard for American students to leave school with demonstrated competence in English, math, science, history and geography, as well as a call for American students to be first in the world in science and mathematics.
But even after two years in which the Bush administration was committed to those goals and another four years of commitment by the Clinton Administration, American schools still fall far short. Rather than being first in the world in science and math, American eighth graders, according to the recent Third International Mathematics and Science Study, ranked below the international average in math and somewhat above the international average in science, compared with their counterparts in 41 countries.
"There's been no change," said Mr. Finn. "And that has been pretty much the story every year since the goals were set -- that we're not making progress toward them."
Will Mr. Clinton's prescriptions help? While he is infusing money into education, Federal funds make up only about six percent of school financing at the elementary and secondary school levels. His proposals do not deal with the income disparities and huge gap in spending that exists between rich and poor school districts. It remains to be seen whether volunteer reading tutors will have the skills and perseverance to help third graders with reading difficulties become literate, and whether they will really be available for the nation's most troubled schools in the most troubled neighborhoods.
Much of the emphasis of Mr. Clinton's education program, in fact, is not on elementary and secondary education at all but is a tax reduction program designed to make higher education so affordable that a 13th and 14th year of education will become the national norm.
The $10,000 tax deduction and $1,500 tax credit for tuition costs were some of the most popular proposals Mr. Clinton offered on the campaign trail to families alarmed by soaring college costs.
But political figures and even university officials are divided about whether a program that amounts to a new middle-class entitlement for families earning less than $100,000 will have the effects Mr. Clinton desires. Some have asked whether college-based tax reductions costing the Treasury nearly $40 billion will simply lead to further inflation in private college tuition costs and cause states to reduce their contribution to state colleges on the assumption that most students will now have a Federal tax credit available.
"The President's tax credit proposals for college are likely to help some students and raise the cost of college for all students," said Lamar Alexander, Mr. Bush's former Education Secretary, who was a contender for the Republican Presidential nomination last year. "A better idea would be to put the available money into scholarships for low-income students and give middle-income families a tax-free savings account that can be used for education."
But in terms of politics Mr. Clinton had the upper hand tonight. Unwilling to be branded as anti-education, Republicans politely applauded the President and sent out news releases seeking to showcase their own education proposals. And Democrats praised the President, saying as Representative Cynthia A. McKinney of Georgia did that his education proposal "reflects his priority to address middle-class concerns."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Why Be a Temp? For Belichick, Loyalty

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Feb. 4

 BODY:
Bill Belichick stood next to the Jets' president, Steve Gutman, this afternoon and assumed the role of good soldier. Belichick agreed to accept the Jets' head coaching job and relinquish it when Bill Parcells, who was named a consultant to the team for 1997, is ready to take the helm.
In effect, Belichick fell on his first green-and-white grenade today. And the big question surrounding Belichick was why a man with five years of head-coaching experience would sublimate his ego and make himself a pawn in the Jets' risky gambit. 
 Part of the reason might be because he is the son of Steve Belichick, who was an assistant coach at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., for 33 years. As with his father, loyalty appears to be more than a watchword for Bill Belichick -- it is a way of life. Thus, given that Belichick has had a long, and successful, relationship with Parcells, it is perhaps not hard to understand why he would agree to be a caretaker for his friend during the coming season.
Gutman named Parcells a consultant for the Jets until the team is able to work out compensation for his services for 1997 with the Patriots owner, Robert K. Kraft, or until Feb. 1, 1998, when Parcells will be free and clear. Or until the National Football League possibly rules against the whole arrangement. But in the meantime, Belichick will run the team.
Belichick seemed untroubled by the highly unusual arrangement. He said he was fully aware of the fact that the Jets could conceivably work out compensation with the Patriots to free Parcells tomorrow and that he would then have to give up control of the team and become an assistant head coach. He also seemed undisturbed that Parcells would be looking over his shoulder for a year.
"It's a program and I'm part of it," Belichick said. "It's a team effort. Bill and I will run it in concert. My role may switch back and forth. It may be one way now and another way later."
Parcells and Belichick worked together for 11 seasons with the Giants and earned two Super Bowl rings. This past season, Belichick rejoined Parcells, working as the Patriots' assistant head coach, and again they went to the Super Bowl, although this time they lost, 35-21, to Green Bay.
"He's been probably as important in my career as any individual," Parcells said this afternoon.
Both Belichick and Parcells share a love of defense, so in that sense they are kindred spirits. Belichick has a brilliant defensive mind, is a stickler for details, a workaholic, a strict disciplinarian and something of a taskmaster with his players. He is not a natural with the news media.
Belichick, 44, was born in Nashville, but grew up in Annapolis. In high school he played center and tight end on the football teams and also played lacrosse. He went on to get a degree in economics from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., where he also played football and lacrosse.
In a sense he is a classic gym rat -- the kind of coach who can lock himself in a dark room, break down film all day and be very content.
"You're looking at a guy who may be the most thorough guy in football," Parcells said. "He's turning over every rock."
No one will question Belichick's ability with X's and O's, but his dour expression and taciturn nature rubs some people the wrong way. In his five years as head coach in Cleveland, Belichick turned off Browns fans, players and staff members. Some staff members complained that when they spoke to Belichick in the hallway, he wouldn't even acknowledge them with a glance.
Belichick alienated the fans in Cleveland when he benched quarterback Bernie Kosar, a local favorite, and replaced him with Vinny Testaverde. Eventually, Kosar was released. The whole episode is what Belichick is most noted for in his tenure with the Browns.
During the 1995 season, while the team was still in Cleveland, Art Modell, the Browns' owner, secretly met with the players and told them he was going to move the team to Baltimore and he was taking Belichick with him. The players groaned.
Later, one player was asked why the players didn't want to continue playing for Belichick in Baltimore and he replied: "It's very simple. He's crazy."
Interestingly, Belichick was replaced as the coach in Baltimore by Ted Marchibroda, who hired the 23-year-old Belichick in 1975 and made him the team gofer when Marchibroda was in his first stint as Colts coach. As Marchibroda's "special assistant," Belichick lived in a hotel room and worked for next to nothing, just so he could learn the game.
After stops in Detroit and Denver, Belichick landed in New York in 1979, where he began as a defensive assistant. He progressed swiftly, moving from linebackers coach to defensive coordinator in four years.
Belichick left the Giants to take the head-coaching job in Cleveland in 1990, a few months before Parcells resigned as the Giants' head coach. And when Belichick was fired in Cleveland last year, he turned down a job as the Dolphins' defensive coordinator under Jimmy Johnson in order to be reunited with Parcells.
Now, they're back together in New York, with the Jets. "For the long haul," Belichick said.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS IN TURMOIL: A special report.;
Adelphi, a Little University With Big Ideas

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I.

 BODY:
This is the story of a university that tore itself apart.
In 1985, Dr. Peter Diamandopoulos, a philosopher trained at Harvard and Brandeis who ran a small state college in California, arrived at Adelphi University. As its new president, he had a bold vision: to quickly transform a troubled commuter school best known for its vocational programs into a top-flight liberal arts institution. 
 At the time, Adelphi was close to insolvency. It was just moderately competitive: it accepted 6 of every 10 high school graduates who applied. Only one course, freshman composition, was required. Enrollment was declining.
The university's trustees thought Adelphi had to do something radical to survive in the increasingly competitive world of small, regional liberal arts colleges. And so they hired Dr. Diamandopoulos, who argued that Adelphi could be saved only by raising its intellectual sights and discontinuing or cutting back lesser programs.
He set out to adopt a demanding core curriculum like Columbia's "great books" course of study. He wanted to attract top students with an "honors college" within the university. And he set a daring goal for increased enrollment: to 15,000 students from 7,000 in five years.
He knew his proposal for change was ambitious and risky. Colleges can spend years debating much smaller questions. It took decades -- and $1 billion or more in fund raising -- for Duke University and New York University to make the difficult transition from regional colleges to nationally ranked research universities.
With annual support from a philanthropy that backs conservative causes, Dr. Diamandopoulos hired distinguished visiting professors like Robert Heilbroner, the economist; Maurice Cowling, a Briton who is an authority on intellectual history, and Edith Kurzweil, the editor of Partisan Review.
He raised about $13 million, about average for institutions like Adelphi, and saw the endowment rise to $47 million from $4 million, thanks to a soaring stock market.
The trustees rewarded him with the kind of salary and benefits not even the presidents of Harvard, Yale or Stanford received. In 1994, he was paid $523,000 in salary alone, the second highest in the country, after John Silber, the president of Boston University, who then was receiving $564,000.
Among the trustees on a select three-member panel deciding his salary was Dr. Silber. He justified Dr. Diamandopoulos's pay, saying, "It doesn't take nearly as much effort to run Harvard as it does to take over an institution like Adelphi."
Today, Adelphi has lifted its intellectual sights, refurbished buildings, balanced its budget and increased its endowment. But by many other standards, the university is in worse shape than when Dr. Diamandopoulos arrived.
Its academic reputation has declined. The student-professor ratio has increased to 12 to 1, from 9 to 1, slightly above average for universities this size. Enrollment has dropped to 4,605 last fall from 6,984 in 1985. Worse, the university has become what educators call a bottom feeder. It now accepts almost 9 out of 10 applicants.
In spring 1995, the chairman of the faculty senate, Devin Thornburg, and other faculty leaders, alarmed by declining enrollment and the overall management of Adelphi, joined with alumni and students to stage an unusual revolt. They petitioned the State Board of Regents to remove the university's leadership -- its trustees, including Dr. Diamandopoulos, who as president sits on the board -- for mismanagement and conflicts of interest.
In an unusual move, the Regents agreed to hold hearings -- remarkable in their scope and duration -- that concluded last November. The Regents are expected to announce their decision in a meeting Feb. 10.
The trustees, denying charges of mismanagement and conflict of interest, have responded with a series of challenges, including a lawsuit accusing the university faculty of defaming Dr. Diamandopoulos. It contends, among other accusations, that an Adelphi history professor, Lester B. Baltimore, stated in an article in Newsday that the university had paid for a trip to Greece by the trustees when he knew that the trip had been underwritten by the trustees themselves. Through his lawyer, Professor Baltimore denied the charge.
The trustees are also announcing several new initiatives Feb. 5, including a multimillion-dollar capital fund drive originally planned for Adelphi's centennial last year, as well as a new marketing campaign employing the phrase "because Good is the enemy of Great." The trustees are announcing an expansion of the board, a new governance committee and a new faculty recruitment campaign.
 
A Clash of Ideas
Fast Philosopher Loses His Wheels
Dr. Diamandopoulos and the trustees said Adelphi's current problems are temporary, the predictable side effects of change. "Once you stop the bleeding, we will recover very fast," Dr. Diamandopoulos said in an interview.
But one of the president's many faculty critics, Prof. Brooke Spiro of the social work department, dismissed this as unduly optimistic. "The president doesn't have an educational philosophy, but only a marketing strategy that failed," he said.
What was unusual about Dr. Diamandopoulos's program, said Linda Salamon, a professor of English at George Washington University who has studied college curricular change, was the speed with which he tried to transform the institution.
"In our trade," she said, "it takes a decade to change a reputation. He tried to reshape Adelphi overnight."
When Dr. Diamandopoulos took over Adelphi, the curriculum centered on professional programs like nursing, social work and accounting. He disparaged them as training for "the helping professions" and advocated the stronger core curriculum.
In his first two years as president, he moved quickly to reshape Adelphi's board with people who agreed with his philosophy and vision for change. He nominated three trustees -- Charles Luckman, an architect; Hilton Kramer, publisher of The New Criterion, and Dr. Raymond V. Damadian, a physician and one of the inventors of magnetic resonance imaging.
Apart from a few grumbles, most members of the faculty at first went along with the new president's ideas for revising the curriculum, which it approved in 1990, and for establishing an Honors College, which the faculty approved two years later.
The curriculum is a demanding sequence of courses in the liberal arts and sciences that include excerpts from Plato to Heidegger, Democritus to Darwin. Freshmen and sophomores take yearlong courses about issues of modern civilization and their historical roots, and the nature of knowledge, before they specialize in their majors.
One trustee, Abraham Krasnoff, a Diamandopoulos nominee who calls himself "a balance for some of the outspoken conservatives" on the board, said the way Dr. Diamandopoulos proposed to emphasize the Western canon without becoming ensnarled in the debate over multiculturalism "was absolutely brilliant."
Both sides agree that the current fight is not primarily political -- a conservative president facing opposition from a largely liberal faculty.
"I wish it were that simple," Dr. Diamandopoulos said. "It's much more complex -- psychological and philosophical. The more I have pushed the faculty to reorient the university to the intellectual development of the students the more threatening I have become to them."
Professor Thornburg and others formed the Committee to Save Adelphi in the spring of 1995. But that fall, they were galvanized by a report in the Chronicle of Higher Education about Dr. Diamandopoulos's salary and benefits. The size of the compensation package stunned them, Professor Thornburg said.
"That was like throwing gasoline on the fire," he said. "But it's important to realize that the fire was already there. It's a fight over university governance and the use of limited resources."
 
The Grand Plan
Visions of Adelphi As a Little Harvard
Peter Diamandopoulos, descendant of an ancient land-holding family in Crete, sits confidently in his baronial, mahogany-paneled office as he is asked about Adelphi. He asserts that the university is on the rise again and will emerge stronger because of the changes.
"It is one thing to have a vision and another to make it materialize," he said. "To be good is not good enough."
With a mop of white hair and lively dark eyebrows, Dr. Diamandopoulos bounced energetically on a stuffed chair and delivered pithy remarks in bursts, with a Greek accent.
"I have an incomparably demanding idea of what is suitable for an educational institution," Dr. Diamandopoulos said. "It is to reorient the souls of the students, as Plato said."
Should nursing and social work students be required to take the great-books courses?
"Are we saying these students are less?" he replied, almost leaping from his chair and thrashing the air with his arms. He then apologized for the outburst and continued:
"I cannot say to this student, you should just study accounting and nothing else. Infinite are the possibilities. Infinite are the possibilities!"
Then he leaned back in his chair and spoke softly. "I have faith that the larger world values value," he said.
Dr. Diamandopoulos's mentor, Dr. Silber, speaks glowingly of his protege: "I don't think his ideas are grandiose. They're grand!"
Dr. Diamandopoulos, who immigrated to the United States in 1948, spent a decade at Harvard receiving a bachelor's in classics, a master's in philosophy and a doctorate in the history of science. A teaching fellow during his graduate years, he wrote a dissertation on Aristotle's Nico machean Ethics, a study of the practice of morals.
After a series of academic appointments, he was named dean of the faculty at Brandeis University in the late 1960's and was profoundly influenced, his friends say, by Abram Sachar, the founding president of Brandeis who created, virtually from scratch, a liberal arts college known for academic excellence.
"That example of derring-do," Dr. Silber recalled, "influenced Peter in his conception of what an academic leader can do."
In 1977, Dr. Diamandopoulos was chosen president of the California State College at Sonoma. He is said to have alienated faculty members by intervening in department appointments and in 1983, after receiving two votes of no confidence by the faculty senate, he was forced to resign. For the next two years, he taught philosophy at San Francisco State University. In 1985, he was named president of Adelphi, recruited by the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, John Phelan, an Adelphi alumnus.
In the early years of Dr. Diamandopoulos's tenure, many faculty members, students and alumni found themselves charmed by his charismatic personality and oracular pronouncements.
In his inaugural address, Dr. Diamandopoulos made it clear that major change was afoot. He spoke of the institution's "unlimited possibilities" and the need for "a new sense of risk-oriented enterprise."
A few days later, he told an education reporter for Newsday that he intended to increase the school's full-time enrollment to 15,000 within five years, recruit students nationally and revamp the curriculum. He promised to make the school a gathering place for the world's leading intellectuals.
"We have to move, move, move," he told the reporter.
Soon, a full-page advertisement written by Dr. Diamandopoulos appeared in newspapers and magazines across the country, with the headline: "Harvard is the Adelphi of Massachusetts."
 
A Catch
Students Staying Away in Droves
The first sign of trouble came soon after Dr. Diamandopoulos settled down to work. Enrollment continued to decline, despite his goals. In 1985, total enrollment was 6,984. It fell almost every year for the next decade, dipping to 4,605 in 1995, a decrease of 34 percent.
Dr. Diamandopoulos's supporters say the problem was beyond his control. The number of high school graduates in Adelphi's primary market, the New York metropolitan area, began to shrink during the baby bust of the 1980's, and many regional colleges suffered enrollment declines.
But Adelphi's problem was worse than those of its local competitors. According to figures compiled by the State Department of Education, enrollment at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University shrank by only 19 percent in the same 10 years, Hofstra's increased by three-tenths of 1 percent and that of the State University at Stony Brook grew by almost 7 percent.
More than a few faculty members recognized that Dr. Diamandopoulos's plan to increase both enrollment and entrance standards was risky. When a college sets out to increase its enrollment, the academic level of entering students usually declines. Further, academicians say that sudden, fundamental changes in an established educational institution risk alienating its traditional students.
"The enrollment drop was dramatic," Professor Thornburg said. "The faculty senate would pass resolution after resolution questioning the administration's moves to eliminate or scale down the School of Nursing or the School of Social Work, but never received a response. The administration was changing the educational focus and allocating resources without any input from the faculty. That made us realize that we could never work with this administration and keep the University going."
Igor Webb, the school's senior vice president for academic affairs, said Adelphi lost students because it was paying the price for "being opposed to the fraud that you can take 12 courses and be guaranteed a great business career."
We say that there's no substitute for education," he added, "but that's a difficult message to get across."
By the early 1990's, another obstacle loomed. Nearly 80 percent of the faculty was tenured -- an unusually large proportion -- and many had decided to take advantage of a newly enacted Federal law eliminating the mandatory retirement age at colleges. This left little opportunity for revitalizing the faculty.
Dr. Diamandopoulos approached the John M. Olin Foundation, a frequent backer of conservative causes, for a grant to support the appointment of distinguished visiting professors whose generally conservative views would balance the liberal leanings of most academicians.
Last year, the Olin Foundation decided to stop the annual grants, which had brought the university $750,000 over five years. "Peter was under terrific attack and we didn't know what the outcome would be," said James Piereson, executive director of the foundation.
In the last year, 22 faculty members, or 10 percent, have left, most voluntarily relinquishing their tenured positions for other jobs. This has come even as administration officials point out that faculty salaries at Adelphi have risen 79 percent since 1985 -- 32 percent above the rate of inflation and 11 percent ahead of the national average for private colleges and universities, according to an estimate by the American Council on Education.
Armstrong Starkey, a former dean of Adelphi's college of arts and sciences, former chairman of the faculty senate and a critic of Dr. Diamandopoulos, said Adelphi's problems arise from the efforts to shift the focus.
"We had been successful attracting students with our preprofessional programs," he said. "This isn't Amherst or Swarthmore, and if you're going to become like them, you must have a massive infusion of funds from outside sources."
But Mr. Byrne, the former chairman of the board of trustees, said: "You have to expect this. We're shaking the status quo."

HAMILTON'S BLESSING
The Extraordinary Life and Times of Our National Debt
By John Steele Gordon
214 pages. Walker & Company. $21.
 At the opening of his useful new book, "Hamilton's Blessing: The Extraordinary Life and Times of Our National Debt," John Steele Gordon drops what at first seems an encouraging tidbit of news. The present national debt of more than $5 trillion is certainly "incomprehensible to the average American," he admits. "For the record," he writes, "laid out in silver dollars, it would be about 120 million miles long, wrapping around the equator 5,000 times."
However, "considered as a percentage either of gross domestic product (usually called G.D.P., it is the sum of the goods and services produced within our borders) or of Federal revenues," our debt "is nowhere near as high as was the British national debt in 1819, the year Queen Victoria was born and when Britain was, in the words of the late historian Cecil Woodham-Smith, 'within sight of the heights of power and of wealth from which it was, briefly, to dominate the world.' "
Whew! What a relief! By such a measurement our debt isn't bad at all. So does this mean that the current concern is overblown and that the country can now relax and go on running up deficits?
 Mr. Gordon, who writes "The Business of America" column in American Heritage magazine, thinks not. The problem, he writes, isn't the size of the debt, but instead its recent trend. "For that trend results not from a deliberate political decision to spend in deficit, but rather from nothing more than the sum of myriad decisions regarding taxing and spending that, collectively, now substitutes for fiscal policy."
To understand how the country reached its present pass, Mr. Gordon examines American history using the effects of five wars as focal points. In a chapter called "The Hamiltonian Miracle," he describes how Alexander Hamilton paid off the cost of the Revolutionary War by creating a Federal bank that assumed the debts of the various states and thereby created the first national deficit. In "Andrew Jackson Redeems the Debt," he reviews how after the War of 1812, the seventh President used the surpluses generated by a high tariff "to rid the Federal Government of debt entirely" and thereby circuitously "contribute in no small way to the country's first great depression."
In "Armageddon and the National Debt," Mr. Gordon shows how the imposition during the Civil War of the nation's first Federal income tax eventually raised the question of how the burden of such a tax ought to be distributed. In "The Twilight of the Old Consensus," he traces how fiscal policy after World War I led to the shock of the Great Depression.
And in "Keynesianism and the Madison Effect," he argues that after World War II, economists fell under the influence of the Madison Effect (so called by Mr. Gordon because James Madison said "Men love power") and exploited Keynesian deficit-spending theory to dictate monetary and fiscal policy.
Besides neatly summing up American economic history, Mr. Gordon uses these five chapters to reveal larger patterns. For one thing, as Hamilton dreamed, the national debt always reflected the cost of wars and depressions, at least until after World War II, when instead of reducing debt, economists used fiscal policy to pursue dreams that couldn't be fulfilled because of the inherent flaws of Keynesian theory.
For another thing, Mr. Gordon argues, reducing the burden of taxes on the rich has repeatedly increased revenues, at least until the tax code became too unwieldy to adjust. In short, supply-side economic theory works! The trouble is that the Congress has evolved into a body that can no longer adjust spending to revenues. In fact, he writes, "in recent years, Washington, wrestling with the budget deficit, has come to resemble more and more a drunk wrestling with alcoholism."
How to recover? In conclusion, Mr. Gordon finds four lessons taught by the history he has summed up. First, since Congress, long since democratized by the Jacksonian revolution, no longer provides the brake on spending that the Founding Fathers could count on from wealthy legislators, Mr. Gordon proposes to reverse the Constitution's intent and "give the President the power to set the limit on overall spending, subject to a Congressional override, and the power to enforce that limit with cuts in all spending, not just that specifically appropriated every year, as needed."
Second, since corruption is no longer built into the system, as it was "in the early days of the Republic" when "many sought political office precisely for the potential profits involved," Mr. Gordon wants "the PAC system of financing political campaigns" abolished. "It cannot be reformed," he writes, "any more than slavery could have been reformed and for precisely the same reason: It is inherently morally corrupt."
Third, he wants a modern system of accounting imposed on the Congress. "The effect on the country's fiscal policy," he writes, "and thus on the debt, would be considerable." And finally, as an alternative to the present tax code with its high marginal tax rates ("counterproductive at best, perverse at worst"), he endorses a flat tax, arguing that while its marginal rate is flat, its effective rate is progressive when a personal exemption is taken into consideration.
The point of Mr. Gordon's exercise in succinctness, which began as an article in "American Heritage," is not whether you agree with his proposals for a solution, or even whether you share his view of the problem. The appeal of "Hamilton's Blessing" is the broad perspective it offers in little more space than a chapbook. Mr. Gordon's subject may well be dismal, but his delivery of it is short and stimulating.

HEADLINE: City Opera Plans 8 New Productions Next Season

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
The New York City Opera is to present eight new productions during its 1997-98 season, the first one entirely planned by Paul Kellogg, who has been the company's general and artistic director since January 1996. The season will include the New York premiere of Tobias Picker's "Emmeline" and the American premiere of Tan Dun's "Voyage of Marco Polo," as well as a staging of Benjamin Britten's rarely performed "Paul Bunyan."
A fourth contemporary work, Hugo Weisgall's "Esther," is to be revived for the first time since its premiere at the company in 1993. 
 The concentration of contemporary works, mostly in accessible styles, may allay the concerns of two parts of the City Opera's audience: those who feared that Mr. Kellogg would abandon the company's commitment to modern opera, and those who found the new-music adventures of Mr. Kellogg's predecessor, Christopher Keene, too adventurous.
The new productions in the 19-week season, which the company announced yesterday, are Verdi's "Macbeth," Rossini's "Italiana in Algeri," Gluck's "Iphigenie en Tauride," Donizetti's "Don Pasquale" and Handel's "Xerxes."
The company is also moving up the curtain time of its Monday-through-Thursday performances to 7:30 P.M.
The schedule illuminates Mr. Kellogg's approach to balancing novelty and economy, both perennial concerns at the City Opera. It is unusual for a major company to offer so many new productions in a single season -- four or five is more typical -- or to devote half of its schedule to new productions.
But only "Macbeth" is being undertaken by the City Opera entirely on its own. Two productions, "Emmeline" and "Xerxes," come from the Santa Fe Opera. "The Voyage of Marco Polo" had its premiere at the Munich Biennale last May, and the others are collaborations with the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., where Mr. Kellogg is also the artistic director.
"Macbeth," which opens the season on Sept. 11, is to be staged by Michael Kahn, the artistic director of the Shakespeare Festival in Washington and the director of the drama division at the Juilliard School. John Conklin, the City Opera's director of production, has designed the sets, and the costumes are by Martin Pakledinaz. The cast includes Mark Delavan in the title role and Lauren Flanigan as Lady Macbeth.
"L'Italiana in Algeri" will be directed by Christopher Alden, with sets by Mr. Conklin and Carol Bailey and costumes by Gabriel Berry. Phyllis Pancella, Kevin Glavin and Gregory Cross are to sing the principal roles. It opens on Sept. 12.
Christine Goerke will sing the title role in "Iphigenie en Tauride," which opens on Oct. 4 in a production by Francesca Zambello with sets by Marina Draghici and costumes by Dunya Ramicova.
"Don Pasquale," which has not been seen at the City Opera since 1955, will return on Oct. 19 in a staging by Leon Major, with sets and costumes by Allen Moyer. Laura Claycomb is to sing Norina, with Kevin Glavin in the title role, Christopher Schaldenbrand as Dr. Malatesta and John Osborn as Ernesto.
The "Xerxes" staging, updated to 18th-century England by Stephen Wadsworth, introduces to the company several singers best known for their early-music performances, among them Lorraine Hunt and David Daniels. The cast also includes Amy Burton, Jennifer Lane, Susannah Waters, Kurt Ollmann and Jan Opalach. It opens on Nov. 1.
The last new production of the fall season is "The Voyage of Marco Polo," which opens on Nov. 8. Mr. Dun, one of the most prominent composers in a group of Chinese expatriates who have been flourishing in the United States, is to conduct the performances, and Martha Clarke will make her directing debut with the company. The libretto is by Paul Griffiths, a critic who contributes regularly to The New York Times, and is to be sung in English, Italian and Chinese by a cast that includes Ning Liang, Christine Abraham, Adam Klein, Dong-Jian Gong, Stephen Bryant and Shi-Zheng Chen. Debra Booth designed the sets, and Jane Greenwood the costumes.
Mr. Picker's "Emmeline" opens on March 31, 1998. The work, which has a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, is based on Judith Rossner's 1980 novel, which was itself drawn from a true story in which a woman unwittingly married her son. The production, by Ms. Zambello, with sets by Robert Israel and costumes by Ms. Ramicova, had its premiere in Santa Fe last summer, and the singers from the original cast -- Patricia Racette, Curt Peterson, Victor Lebetter and Kevin Langan -- are to recreate their roles.
"Paul Bunyan" is to open on April 9, 1998, in a production directed by Mark Lamos, with sets by Paul Steinberg and costumes by Constance Hoffmann. Jeffrey Lentz, Elisabeth Comeaux and Erin Caves are in the cast.
Besides "Esther," the repertory productions returning are Mozart's "Magic Flute" (performed in Andrew Porter's English translation) and "Le Nozze di Figaro" (sung in Italian), Verdi's "Traviata," Offenbach's "Contes d'Hoffmann," Bizet's "Carmen" and two Puccini operas, "La Boheme" and "Madama Butterfly." For "Butterfly," the company is returning to the 1906 revision of the score after several seasons of using the original 1904 version.
George Manahan, the company's music director, will conduct "Macbeth," "L'Italiana," "Emmeline" and "Xerxes." Jane Glover, an English conductor who has worked at Glimmerglass and the Mostly Mozart Festival, will make her company debut with "Iphigenie," and Stewart Robertson, the music director at Glimmerglass, is to make his debut conducting "Paul Bunyan."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Sets a Four-Year High Against Yen but Slips vs. Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surpassed 123 Japanese yen yesterday for the first time in four years as fears of Japan banking problems grew, but it ended mostly lower against other currencies.
Strength in the German mark and the British pound, as well as an abrupt drop in the American stock market late in the day, contributed to the dollar's mixed showing. The Dow Jones industrial average, up about 40 points at midafternoon, fell in the last hour of trading. 
 The catalyst for the selloff in the yen, which occurred against most leading currencies, came overnight on rumors that the Nippon Credit Bank was facing a financial crisis and possible bankruptcy. The bank's stock fell and its senior management vigorously denied the rumors. But the yen continued to weaken.
"Once you added fuel to the fire of another potential banking problem in Japan, the dollar broke through the 123 zone," said Stephen Flanagan, senior currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "The market consensus is that it continues to bring to light this debt problem that Japanese banks are all facing."
The dollar reached an intraday high of 123.68 yen, the strongest since February 1993 and its first new four-year high in a week, before settling in New York at 123.25 yen, up from 122.44 yen on Tuesday.
The dollar spent much of the day higher against the mark but settled at 1.6454, down from 1.6457 on Tuesday. The pound rallied to $1.6396, up sharply from $1.6207.
Despite the dollar's mixed performance, traders said that the underlying demand for the currency remained strong and that there seemed to be some diminished anxiety over the outcome of the meeting this weekend of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations.
Japanese officials have suggested that they will use the meeting to seek help to arrest the yen's decline. But their comments have been countered by those of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and some European officials who have suggested that a strong dollar is also beneficial.
"The growing view is that the G-7 won't be able to do much to stem the slide in the yen," said Joseph Pedone, a currency trader at the New York branch of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. "We expect the dollar to continue to grind higher."

HEADLINE: Nothing Says a Global Economy Is Inevitable

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Claims of the historical inevitability of political and economic trends merit skepticism. That was true of Communist assertions of certain triumph, and it is true of Thomas L. Friedman's contention that globalization is inevitable (column, Feb. 2). 
 People and institutions, not technologies, are driving globalization. The ability to make a telephone call from Oregon to Vietnam does not require Nike to produce shoes in Vietnam in sweatshop conditions rather than in the country where the company sells the shoes.
Multinational corporate executives are making conscious marketing and production decisions to globalize their operations. They could only make those choices in a legal and regulatory framework that permits unimpeded capital mobility, maintains low tariffs and provides stable trading rules like those set by the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Those whom Mr. Friedman labels "separatists" are actually democrats who recognize the political choice inherent in the decision to maintain the current framework or to substitute another that enhances local control and democratic accountability.

HEADLINE: 2 Top Hong Kong Officials Fault China's New Policies

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Even as China moves to revoke a range of laws protecting civil liberties here, two of Hong Kong's most senior officials have begun to speak out against Chinese interference in the territory's affairs.
Until now, none of the leading civil servants here have criticized Beijing or its policies toward Hong Kong. 
 Although China has formally promised that it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy after the British territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, there has been a growing unease here over the extent to which Beijing is forcing its will on Hong Kong.
This week, Anson C. Chan, Chief Secretary and the highest ranking civil servant in Hong Kong, accused the Beijing-appointed panel that will revoke or modify the civil-liberties laws of ignoring the apprehensions of Hong Kong citizens toward China.
"I share the community's disappointment that the Preparatory Committee has not seen fit to recognize the widespread concern that has been caused by the legal subgroup's recommendations," Mrs. Chan said, referring to the China-appointed caucus and subcommittee that are drawing up the changes.
Last month Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, who sets forth the territory's budgets and monitors the economy here, was sharply critical of the Chinese official who leads the Land Commission, the panel that releases government land for commercial development.
Mrs. Chan said the decision by the Beijing caucus to return to draconian colonial laws governing the freedom of assembly and the right of association has created doubts abroad about China's commitment to Hong Kong's way of life.
The plans to revoke existing laws, Mrs. Chan said, after returning from a visit to the United States, "sent an extremely negative signal to people in America, and there is clearly concern about whether human rights will be protected after 1997, and in particular there are doubts as to China's commitment to implementing the 'one country, two systems' concept after 1997."
The phrase "one country, two systems" was coined in 1984 by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, to describe China's intention to allow Hong Kong to maintain its own economic and political system.
American officials have expressed dismay over China's plans to repeal key portions of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights and civil-liberties laws. Mrs. Chan's comments are significant because she has agreed to remain in her post under Chinese rule and work with the leader chosen by Beijing to run Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa.
Sonny S. H. Lo, a director of a multi-university project tracking major issues during the transition to Chinese rule, said: "Chinese officials will remember her remarks very well. She will be a temporary figure in the Hong Kong Government."

HEADLINE: Network Formed to Hold Manufacturing Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Through the years, manufacturers have tried to stop the steady decline of jobs in New York City by forming trade associations and persuading the city to offer tax abatements and loans. Even so, manufacturing jobs have fallen from a peak of 950,000 in the 1950's to 260,000 today.
Now, the manufacturers are trying again. Forty-five manufacturing, nonprofit, financial and government groups have formed the Industrial Retention Network, a nonprofit organization intended to develop an early-warning system to dissuade manufacturers from leaving. Members include the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, the Bank of New York, Con Edison and Locker Associates, an economic consulting firm. 
 The network is noteworthy, because it is the first such broad-based effort in New York City. It is also important, because of a growing sense that doing nothing is tantamount to allowing certain manufacturers to die a slow death.
"I think retention is a great idea," said Rae D. Rosen, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "If you try to leverage your existing base and retain it, you have far greater potential than if you try to get more companies."
The network plans to develop a database of the city's 12,000 manufacturing companies, tracking employment, sales and other indicators. The network will also help companies improve competitiveness and find additional private investment.
Whether the network, formed last month, succeeds will be hard to gauge immediately, because the focus is on anticipating closings one or two years in advance. Its executive director, Adam Friedman, concedes he has a formidable task.
"We're not trying to save things that are not viable," he said. "We're trying to focus on finding firms that are fundamentally healthy, and looking to get private investment to help them grow."
The State Department of Labor has said manufacturing jobs fell to 260,377 in the first half of 1996 from 270,138 in the first half of 1995, a drop of 3.61 percent. This exceeded the 2.8 percent drop the previous year.
Only 8 industries added more than 50 jobs in the first half of 1996, while 16 lost more than 265 jobs. The most successful companies were smaller manufacturers specializing in household furniture (up 13.6 percent). The least successful ones, like men's and boys' clothing, which fell 29.5 percent, produced goods that could not compete with imports, said Bruce Herman, president of the Garment Industry Development Corporation.
"Old-style manufacturing is gone forever in New York, and calls to revive it are wishful thinking," wrote Mitchell L. Moss, Hugh O'Neill and John Kedeshian in "Made in New York: The Future of Manufacturing in New York," an April 1996 study by the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
Manufacturers became smaller, stressing turnaround time and specialized products. Now, 96 percent of manufacturers have fewer than 100 employees, said the Industrial Technology Assistance Corporation, a private, nonprofit group.
Smaller manufacturers, though, have been vulnerable. Only 29 percent of start-up manufacturers in the city received loans from financial institutions, mostly because they tend to be small and family-financed. About 59 percent of start-ups nationally get loans from banks. And 70 percent of family-owned businesses do not make it to the next generation.
But Mr. Friedman takes solace in what happened in Chicago. The Midwest Center for Labor Research has persuaded several companies to stay, including Brock & Brach, the candy maker.
"This is not a short-term quick fix," said Robert Ginsburg, the center's research director. "It's saying that the community and government and industry have a long-term interest in seeing that manufacturing stays there."

HEADLINE: Mitchell Goodman, Antiwar Protest Leader, Dies at 73

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Mitchell Goodman, the impassioned author who organized an antidraft protest that led to the trial of the Boston Five in 1968 and helped galvanize opposition to the Vietnam War, died on Saturday at his home in Temple, Me. He was 73.
His wife, Sandra Gregor, said the cause was pancreatic cancer. 
 It was known as the Spock trial, for its most famous defendant, Dr. Benjamin Spock. And it was another well-known defendant, the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., the Yale chaplain, who had hit on the idea that led to the trial: gathering up draft cards from young war protesters in Boston and elsewhere and turning them in to the Justice Department in Washington.
But it was Mr. Goodman who had prodded Mr. Coffin into action. It was Mr. Goodman who spent a series of 14-hour days planning and coordinating the protest, and it was he who was aptly described by the prosecutor as "the detail man" of the conspiracy to "counsel, aid and abet violations of the Selective Service law."
When the trial, in Federal District Court in Boston, was over, one defendant, Marcus Raskin, the co-director of the Institute for Policy Studies, was acquitted. The four others, including Mr. Goodman and Michael Ferber, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate student, were found guilty of conspiracy and sentenced to two years in prison.
The convictions were overturned, and charges against Dr. Spock and Mr. Ferber were dismissed, but the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, ruled that while the judge had erred in his instructions to the jury, the evidence against Mr. Coffin and Mr. Goodman was so strong that they could be tried again.
Not surprisingly, the prosecution was not renewed. The first trial had come close enough to creating antiwar martyrs, and any notion that convictions would suppress opposition to the war was quickly dispelled. Immediately after sentencing, the four convicted men left the courtroom to join a protest march.
Mr. Goodman, who was born in Brooklyn, spent two years as an artillery officer in World War II. After graduating from Harvard in 1946, he began his studies for a doctorate in labor economics.
Expecting to take his orals in the fall of 1947, he spent the summer in Europe, but after meeting a young English poet, Denise Leverton, at a youth hostel in Geneva, he was so smitten his career and life plans changed.
The couple were married that December, and Mr. Goodman became a writer, turning out dozens of travel articles for The New York Times and national magazines in the 1950's and 60's. Eventually, he became an itinerant writing teacher at a series of colleges, including City College, Hofstra, Berkeley, Stanford and the University of Maine.
In 1961 he published a novel, "The End of It," which provided such a horrifyingly vivid account of an American artillery battalion's advance through northern Italy in World War II that it seemed startling that the author, who suffered from asthma, had not served overseas in the war. Considered a classic antiwar novel by some critics, it has been reissued twice.
Although he had a finely tuned sense of justice and was attracted to liberal causes, Mr. Goodman was essentially apolitical, so much so that when his wife told him that she was going to work against the war in Vietnam, he wished her well but said he would stick to his writing.
But by the time Miss Leverton had collected signatures from hundreds of artists and writers for an antiwar advertisement that appeared in The New York Times in April 1965, Mr. Goodman had been drawn in.
Over the next two years he became a powerful force in the antiwar movement. In March 1967, for example, when Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey addressed the National Book Award ceremonies in Philharmonic Hall, now Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, Mr. Goodman led 50 people in a walkout, shouting, "Mr. Vice President, we are burning children in Vietnam, and you and we are responsible!"
Increasingly impressed by youthful protesters, Mr. Goodman made headlines when he organized a veterans' protest march down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and again when the veterans burned their discharge papers in Union Square.
By contrast, the protest at the Justice Department on Oct. 16, 1967, was virtually ignored by the news media. But the trial of the Boston Five in 1968 made Mr. Goodman and his co-defendants heroes in the antiwar movement and spurred mass protest rallies across the country.
Mr. Goodman, who continued his antiwar activities even as his marriage disintegrated, was occupying the Chair of Ideas at Mankato State University in Minnesota in 1973 when he fell in love again, this time with a 22-year-old student.
By the time they were married in 1980 Mr. Goodman had settled in Maine, begun writing poetry and found new causes, supporting unionized strikers and opposing nuclear power and nuclear weapons.
Besides his wife he is survived by a son from his first marriage, Nikolai, of Seattle; another son, Matthew, of Temple, and a brother, Howard, of St. Louis.

Bond Prices Drop Ahead Of Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities declined yesterday for the first time this week as investor concern deepened that tomorrow's employment report might come in stronger than expected and revive fears of higher inflation.
Yesterday's decision by the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged suggested that the central bank was not overly concerned that the current pace of economic growth was strong enough to increase inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. Still, traders were reluctant to buy securities before seeing the monthly employment report, which is widely viewed as the most important gauge of economic strength and of the outlook for inflation. 
 The price of the 30-year bond was down 21/32, to 96 25/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.75 percent from 6.70 percent on Tuesday.
Prices declined despite a Commerce Department report that factory orders were weaker than expected in December. The release of that report sent investors on a brief buying spree that fizzled quickly as talk of selling by hedge funds sent many traders to the sidelines.
The report probably would have been more supportive of bond prices if concerns about an increase in supply had not arisen after the Treasury announced the size of its quarterly debt refunding. The Treasury said it planned to sell $17.75 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday, $12 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10 billion of 30-year bonds next Thursday. The $39.75 billion February refunding is larger than the $38.5 billion at the last refunding, in November.
In when-issued trading, the three-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.05 percent, the 10-year note at 6.44 percent, and the 30-year bond at 6.70 percent.
The Treasury also said that instead of selling a new inflation-indexed note in April, it would sell more of the indexed notes sold in January, meaning that the terms of the sale will be the same. The January sale was the first ever of an inflation-pegged security.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco, said that while the market had viewed the risk of an interest rate increase as minimal, there had been some lingering concern among bond investors before the Fed meeting ended.
"The Fed had the patience to await a slowing in growth after a strong surge in the second quarter last year," Ms. Rupert said, "so the expectation was that they will do the same now," after a strong fourth quarter of 1996.
She cautioned, however, that growth remained robust in some sectors and that wage pressures remained a real concern.
Other economists agreed that employment conditions could prove critical to the course of the bond market. Doug Porter, senior economist at Nesbitt Burns Inc. in Toronto, said that in part because of the market's concern about how low the unemployment rate is, the yield on the 30-year bond could rise to about 7.25 percent in the second quarter.
And Bruce Steinberg, manager for macroeconomics at Merrill Lynch, said, "Because the labor market is the U.S. economy's main potential trouble spot, the future path of monetary policy is chiefly contingent on the performance of labor market indicators." Mr. Steinberg said he expected the employment report to show that 190,000 jobs were added to payrolls in January, which is lower than the consensus estimate of 210,000.
"For the Fed to remain on extended hold," Mr. Steinberg said, "payroll gains need to average a bit less than our January estimate on a multimonth basis."
The trend in the labor market, he added, is probably for gains in the range of 150,000 to 175,000 a month. For that reason, he said, he believes that the Fed will be able to keep rates at current levels longer than many economists think.

HEADLINE: Fed's Policy-Making Panel Leaves Rates Unchanged

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that a recent surge in economic growth will moderate and leave wage and price inflation under control.
The decision continues a yearlong pattern in which the Fed has kept monetary policy on hold as the economy has accelerated, slowed and then accelerated again. The Fed's last move was on Jan. 31, 1996, when it reduced its Federal funds target rate, its overnight loan rate for banks, to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, and its discount rate for loans to financial institutions to 5 percent from 5.25 percent. 
 Because the Fed's decision today not to raise rates had been widely anticipated for weeks in the financial markets, it was not a powerful enough dose of good news to stop a technology-led swoon in stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.58 points, to 6,746.90.
Since last summer the Fed's official policy has been a "bias" toward tightening, a way of signaling that it will raise rates at the first compelling evidence that inflation might be taking root. Economists said they expected that the Fed kept the policy in place today, although it would not disclose its decision until after the next meeting of its policy-making body on March 25.
By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is once again waiting for further evidence of whether growth will slow sufficiently to keep wages from spiking up and setting off an upward spiral in inflation. Despite the economy's torrid 4.7 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter, wage increases have remained muted and there is almost no sign of rising inflation.
"The inflation picture still looks pretty good to them," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities. "At the same time they are concerned that if the economy stays strong we could move from a position where we're running near capacity to where we're hitting capacity or exceeding it and therefore getting more inflationary pressures down the road. So they need to see signs that growth is moderating."
There are tentative signs that the economy was cooling off even before the end of last year. The Commerce Department reported today that the value of new orders to factories fell 1.3 percent in December, the second consecutive decline. The department said shipments of finished goods and inventories of completed products also declined.
But economists and financial markets are now looking ahead to the next major economic indicator, the release on Friday of January figures on job growth and the unemployment rate. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in recent Congressional testimony that he was watching closely to see whether an unusual period in which workers appeared to be trading job security for restrained wage increases was coming to an end.
Economists remain divided over whether the Fed will have to raise rates at its next meeting in March, or at the following one in May, or perhaps not at all.
"The pressures are going to continue to build," said William Dudley, an economist with Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The economy is going to continue to grow above trend. By March a tightening is more of an even proposition, and by May it's maybe likely."
Economists at Merrill Lynch, however, said in a report today that they did not expect a rate increase anytime soon.
They said they believed the economy created about 190,000 new jobs in January, a relatively strong performance, but that the underlying trend in coming months will be around 150,000 to 175,000 a month, a rate that it said would not threaten to reignite inflation.
"Given our growth, inflation and employment outlooks, we believe that the Fed will be able to remain on hold for longer than most probably believe," the report said. "Nevertheless we expect the next Fed move, whenever it occurs, to be a tightening."
The Fed also said today that it was changing the timing of its release of minutes from meetings of its policy- making Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed has been releasing the minutes of each meeting on the Friday after the subsequent meeting. It will now release the minutes on the Thursday after the subsequent meeting, and will move the release time up to 2 P.M. from 4:30 P.M. The change takes effect on Thursday, when the Fed will release minutes of its December meeting.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Big Brother wants to manage the broadcast spectrum again.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
ASK the nearest economist about Federal auctions of the airwaves, and you're likely to get an "I told you so." Only recently viewed by Washington "realists" as another impractical scheme from libertarian dreamers who never met a free market they didn't like, competitive sales of space on the communications spectrum have been embraced by mainstream politicians as a painless way to raise revenue. With $20 billion garnered thus far and Congress counting on an additional $2.9 billion from an auction in April, the long campaign to unleash market forces has apparently been won.
Or has it? A seemingly innocuous policy statement from the Federal Communications Commission arguing that, in general, free markets can manage the spectrum better than bureaucrats, was recently rejected by a majority of commissioners. A plan to allow winners in the next auction virtual carte blanche in how they use the spectrum is also in deep trouble at the commission. And next week a hostile majority of the House telecommunications subcommittee is planning a day of hearings on spectrum allocation, a none-too-subtle warning to deregulators that Big Brother is alive and well. "The backlash has begun," said Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. 
 For most of the F.C.C.'s 60-year history, scarce radio and television spectrum was parceled out free to those deemed most likely to serve the public interest, a phrase that loosely translated as those who knew best how to feather politicians' nests. When spectrum became so valuable in the 1980's that enough to operate a television station in a medium-sized city was worth $500 million and every high-stakes decision by the F.C.C. was challenged by competing armies of lawyers and lobbyists, the commission tried to finesse the issue by distributing spectrum licenses in lotteries. Only after the absurdity of transforming F.C.C. proceedings into Washington's own version of the Publishers' Clearinghouse sweepstakes became embarrassingly clear -- after tens of thousands of people applied in hope of winning a cellular phone franchise that could be sold the next day for seven figures -- only then did the commissioners turn to auctions.
What good-government types tend to forget, says Peter Pitsch, an economic consultant who advised the former F.C.C. chairman, Mark Fowler, is that Congress's willingness to go along with auctions had as much to do with the drive to balance the budget as with receptivity to deregulation. Indeed, it took an uneasy alliance of free-market policy wonks and politicians desperate to raise revenues to put auctions on the agenda.
But Congress did approve. What's more, it is now demanding that the F.C.C. shove spectrum out the door at a furious pace to keep the revenue flowing. So why are both Congress and the F.C.C. suddenly casting a jaundiced eye on the efficacy of the free market in managing the airwaves?
The answer is straightforward enough. While Congress and the F.C.C. no longer questions the wisdom of auctions to help balance the budget, both claim it as their duty to micromanage the use of spectrum for what is casually referred as the public interest. And both are determined to act as referees in the coming battles over the winners' attempts to move their spectrum from one use to a more profitable one.
The stakes are enormous: five years ago the F.C.C. staff estimated that a transfer of spectrum used by a single television station in Los Angeles to cellular phone service would increase the spectrum's value by $1 billion. Yet free-market types seeking to make newly auctioned spectrum licenses freely transferable cannot expect much help from President Clinton and other political pragmatists.
A first test comes later this month, when the F.C.C. sets the ground rules for the Congressionally mandated auction of spectrum that has been vaguely set aside for "wireless communications." Mr. Hundt wants to give winning bidders the right to use it as they please. But the cellular phone and new "personal communications service" companies -- some of which paid a fortune for licenses -- are lobbying hard to block added competition. And at least at the moment, the chairman does not command a majority.
At the heart of the matter, Mr. Pitsch suggests, lies a fundamental tension between consumer and producer interest. Writ large, the job of the F.C.C. is to reduce economic scarcity, allocating communication spectrum in ways that generate the most value for consumers. On the other hand, he points out, "anyone who already has spectrum doesn't want to make it less scarce" because scarcity drives up market price.
Mr. Pitsch remains an optimist. "There's a great opportunity here for unleashing competition in local telephone service and wireless communications," he argues. The catch, of course, is that the opportunity could mean hard times for those already in the business.

HEADLINE: Russia Is Selling Nuclear Reactors to India; U.S. Protests

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Russia's cash-starved nuclear establishment is planning to sell two nuclear reactors to India, a move that has prompted protests from Washington.
The United States has urged Russia to drop the multibillion-dollar sale, asserting that it violates a 1992 agreement among nuclear suppliers and will hurt international efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 The brewing dispute underscores East-West tension on nuclear issues, as Russia's nuclear energy establishment has turned to exports to try to plug a yawning budget gap.
Western experts worry that Russian exports may undermine the bold promises of cooperation on nuclear issues made at a meeting last year between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Western leaders.
Russia and the United States are already at odds over Moscow's decision to sell a nuclear reactor to Iran, which the United States insists has begun a determined effort to develop a nuclear weapon.
Russia's desire to help Cuba complete construction on a nuclear power plant has also caused worries in Florida, which fears that the plant will be unsafe.
Nor are nuclear exports the only worry. Moscow recently touched off a crisis by agreeing to sell an advanced S-300 anti-aircraft system to the Greek Cypriot Government. After Turkey threatened military action, the Clinton Administration began a furious round of diplomacy to soothe tensions in the area.
But Russian nuclear officials are unrepentant about their drive for foreign sales and say the sale of power plants to India will not enhance its military potential.
"We must expand our exports," Viktor N. Mikhailov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, told reporters last month. "We will use the export earnings to repay our debts."
The roots of the Indian dispute go back to 1974, when New Delhi startled the world by conducting a nuclear test. The Indians used plutonium from a research rector sold by Canada for peaceful purposes.
In an effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear suppliers agreed to a system of export controls, which were broadened in 1992.
The 1992 "suppliers' agreement" forbids nuclear suppliers from exporting nuclear technology to aspiring nuclear powers.
Specifically, it says that nuclear suppliers cannot sell nuclear technology to nations that are not formally recognized as nuclear weapons states and which do not allow international inspections of all of their key nuclear institutes, laboratories and plants and of the nuclear material there. Under the treaty against the spread of nuclear arms, only the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China are recognized as nuclear weapon states.
"The basic idea is that countries should not get the benefits of nuclear energy without making a comprehensive commitment to its peaceful use," an American official said.
As a practical matter, the 1992 agreement imposed an embargo on sales of nuclear technology to India, Pakistan and Israel, which are believed to have developed nuclear weapons and have refused to sign the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons and accept international monitoring.
South Asia has long been an area of special concern. India and Pakistan, both emerging nuclear powers, are bitter antagonists and have fought three wars since 1947.
American diplomats have also been frustrated by India's opposition to a nuclear test ban. India says that it is not willing to accept a ban until the major nuclear powers agreed to a timetable for disarmament.
But American officials say they believe that India's position is simply a rationale for keeping its nuclear option open. American officials became alarmed in 1995 when American spy satellites detected possible preparations for a nuclear test.
As a nuclear exporter, Russia went along with the toughened controls over nuclear supplies. But after it signed the suppliers' agreement, economic pressures began to build.
Racked by budget cuts and driven by a fervent commitment to nuclear energy, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister makes no qualms about the importance of the Indian deal and other foreign sales.
The ministry received only 72 percent of its budget allotment last year and many of its nuclear power customers failed to pay up, forcing it to delay payment of wages to nuclear engineers and workers.
In December, more than a dozen employees at a St. Petersburg nuclear power plant briefly seized the control room and threatened to shut down the plant until they were paid.
The budget crunch was so severe that the ministry it turned to commercial banks for credit at interest rates as high as 70 percent a year.
Mr. Mikhailov said his ministry is now saddled with a debt of about $285 million, and is looking toward exports to help repay its loans. Russia's nuclear exports exceeded $2 billion last year.
Yevgeny A. Reshetnikov, a Deputy Minister of Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, declined to specify the exact value of the Indian deal. But he said in an interview that the value of the sale was $1.5 billion to $2 billion for each of the light-water reactors.
The reactors are to be used as nuclear power plants in southern India and can produce one million kilowatts each. Light-water reactors use ordinary water to slow down the neutrons emitted by nuclear fission to the speed required to sustain the chain reaction.
Russian and Indian officials hope to complete their talks this month, Mr. Reshetnikov said. The talks have been snagged by disputes over credits to be provided by the Russian Finance Ministry, and some American officials have expressed doubt that the deal will be consummated.
But as Russian and Indian officials have moved to complete the agreement, the United States has made repeated, if quiet, protests. "We have made demarches to the Russians objecting to this sale," a senior American official said.
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia arrived today for several days of talks with Vice President Al Gore. American officials have used such meetings in the past to press their concern over the Russian sale of a nuclear reactor to Iran and other security issues, but officials declined to say if the Indian sale would be discussed in the confidential, informal discussions among the leader or their top aides.
Even as they acknowledge their economic motivation, Russian officials defend the sale. They argue that the reactors they sell will be subject to monitoring, unlike some key Indian nuclear research centers and plants, and thus will not directly contribute to India's military potential.
Russian officials also insist that the sale should be exempt from the 1992 suppliers' agreement because it was included in an earlier understanding between Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet President, and Indian leaders. The initial agreement to build the reactor was worked out in 1987, Mr. Reshetnikov said, though he conceded that much of the technology would be newer.
Indian officials, for their part, say they greatly need nuclear plants because of their shortage of electric power and say Washington's arms- control policies reflect a colonialist double standard.
But Washington insists that the sale is forbidden by the agreement and would be a setback for international efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.
"There are two basic problems," an American official said. "One is the Indians. We worry about what the Indians will do with the reactors. We worry about the safety culture. Even a light-water reactor produces a fair amount of plutonium."
The other problem, he asserted, is Russia's decision to breach the 1992 agreement by selling to an emerging nuclear power like India. "The Russian Federation, as signatories to the 1992 suppliers' agreement, should not be selling these controlled nuclear technologies," he added.
Other specialists say the Russian move is ill timed and appears to reward India at a time when it is being difficult on nuclear issues.
"It is an unfortunate time for Russia to be giving India a nuclear pat on the back," said Leonard S. Spector, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

HEADLINE: 4 Britons Recalled From Nigeria in Visa-Selling Investigation

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, Feb. 5

 BODY:
At least four British employees of the visa section of the British High Commission here have been sent home in recent weeks because of what diplomats suspect is a major visa-selling ring.
Some were sent home for their own protection and some because of suspected involvement in irregularities, said John Whattam, spokesman for the High Commission. He did not elaborate. 
 Four British police officers have arrived to investigate possible irregularities in the visa section of the High Commission, or embassy.
British visas are said by European diplomats to be available on the black market for around $3,000. Diplomats say they believe much of the business is run by well organized criminal rings.
The United States and European countries are reluctant to grant visas to Nigerians out of the concern that they will remain in the country they visit.
Nigerian newspapers have reported with delight the allegations that British citizens are involved in the illegal sales. A number of newspapers have been quick to take editorial shots at Britain after being the object of disparaging British statements about official corruption in Nigeria.
"Stinking British Embassy," read the banner headline Saturday in the newspaper Concord. Under the headline was the official picture of Queen Elizabeth II.
Word of the British visa scandal has spread a sense of distress through other Western embassies in Lagos. "We are being extra vigilant," said Joseph Melrose, the American charge d'affaires.
The United States Embassy said it has received reports of people from the outside claiming to be able to influence the visa process, and promising to provide visas for a fee. The Embassy said those reported to be involved have no official standing with the embassy.
There have also been reports made by people seeking visas from both the German and United States Embassies that Nigerian gate guards demand bribes just to let applicants pass.
The major concern of American diplomats is the falsification of documents. The Embassy has received reports from international airports of Nigerians traveling on doctored American passports. Embassy officials suspect that attempts are also being made to forge American visas in Nigeria.
Not only is Nigeria one of the world's major drug-trafficking points, but most public corporations have reputations of being corrupt, and fake documents of virtually any kind are easily available on street corners.
American diplomats say more than 40 percent of the documents accompanying visa application forms they receive are false, with the German Embassy saying the figure is 90 percent for its visa section.
"We can't catch them all," said one European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We're lucky if we can identify a fifth of the false papers."
An article published in a Nigerian travel journal last year gave detailed instructions how to make arrangements to get a foreign visa.
"If you want to make everything go faster, turn up for the interview panel with, say, $5,000 to $10,000," it advised, reminding applicants to bring personal documents like marriage certificates, which are available for the equivalent of $6, and to dress well for the interview.

HEADLINE: Ecuadoreans Rally in Drive to Oust President

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Banging pot covers and bearing placards calling for an end to economic austerity, nepotism and corruption, hundreds of thousands of Ecuadoreans filled streets throughout the country today at the start of a 48-hour general strike staged to force President Abdala Bucaram out of office.
Just seven months after Mr. Bucaram's landslide election, the people who delivered him the most resounding victory in Ecuador's 16 years of democracy are handing him the largest protest of the democratic era and pushing his Government to the verge of collapse. Banks, stores, factories and financial markets closed today; tires and garbage burned at intersections throughout the country. 
 In an emotional speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Bucaram pledged he would defend "the Constitution and democracy with my very life," and proposed talks with business associations, social groups, indigenous peoples and labor to build a new state.
He called former presidents who came out in support of the protests "conspirators" who had "already governed and destroyed the nation."
Cesar Gaviria, president of the Organization of American States, flew here in a show of support for Mr. Bucaram today, at the President's request.
"There is a great concern throughout the hemisphere because of the language of confrontation that's being used," Mr. Gaviria said, also speaking of "fear that this will set back democracy in Ecuador."
Since his inauguration, the vast majority of those who voted for Mr. Bucaram have turned against him, as the President abandoned his populist stance in favor of austerity measures that removed the basic subsidies that many poor Ecuadoreans depended on to make ends meet. As the cost of electricity, public transportation, cooking fuel, gasoline and telephones rose, the popularity of Mr. Bucaram, who has released a rock film called "A Madman in Love" since he took office, plummeted.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded the Congress today, demanding that legislators begin impeachment proceedings. Some protesters wore costumes or masks, and many made up their faces to resemble Mr. Bucaram, if only with a smudge of dark shoe polish in imitation of the narrow mustache that once was his trademark. Thick black smoke from burning tires billowed around the building.
Demonstrators said they were rejecting not just Mr. Bucaram but also the economic model that has become something of a new catechism in South America.
"People in Latin America are very poor, and they can't be completely oriented toward paying off the foreign debt," said Edgar Zarate, a law professor who joined the protest. "We need an Ecuadorean model adapted to the conditions in our country."
Manuel Ayala, a 65-year-old painter who cheered on the protesters as they passed him, said Mr. Bucaram's administration was "six months of corruption." He said Ecuador's economy had to be oriented toward "social justice and a fair distribution of resources, on the basis of the sovereignty of the country."
Mr. Bucaram's positions have grown increasingly erratic as the opposition to him has built. This week the President said he supported the strike, and announced plans to replace 60 percent of his Cabinet.
The Vice President, Rosalia Arteaga Serrano, accused Fabian Alarcon, the president of the Congress, of planning a coup. As the police surrounded the Congress, word spread that Mr. Alarcon and other political leaders would be arrested, and that the Congress would be dissolved.
Mr. Alarcon denied any involvement in a plot to overthrow Mr. Bucaram, noting that the Congress had the legal means to impeach the President. He showed reporters a congressional resolution to open an extraordinary session to debate the crisis. It carried 52 signatures, 10 more than needed to impeach the President.
Images of corruption and nepotism have tarnished the administration. Last week the United States Ambassador, Leslie M. Alexander, said corruption was so serious that Americans should think twice before doing business here.
Many protesters complained about a party reportedly given by Mr. Bucaram's son, Jacob, 18, to celebrate making his first million dollars, after six months in the job. He is the unofficial head of the customs service. Neither the President nor his son have confirmed that a party took place.
One protester, Alberto Zuleta, an economics student, noted that at the current minimum salary of $30 a month, the amoung earned by many Ecuadoreans, it would take centuries to earn $1 million. His own family, Mr. Zuleta said, cut back on food and medicines because of increases in the costs of fuel and other products and services. "The money we spend on food is hardly enough to maintain us," he said.

Roche to Buy Flavor Maker for $1.1 Billion

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Roche Holding A.G. said today that it had agreed to buy Tastemaker, a flavors company, in a transaction that the two sellers, Hercules Inc. and Mallinckrodt Inc. of the United States, valued at a total of about $1.1 billion, including debt assumption.
Roche, the giant Swiss drug maker, said the purchase of Tastemaker, which is based in Cincinnati, would make it the world's biggest producer of fragrances and flavors. 
 "Roche may be able to reap some economies of scale, so this should have a positive impact on group profits," said Genghis Lloyd-Harris, an analyst at Credit Suisse. "Still, flavors and fragrances is a low-margin business, and I would rather have seen Roche get out of it."
The acquisition would give Roche 16 percent of the global fragrances and flavors market, Mr. Lloyd-Harris said. International Flavors and Fragrances Inc., a New York-based rival, has 15 percent of the world market, he said.
Hercules and Mallinckrodt, each of which owns 50 percent of Tastemaker, said in separate statements that the sale would have a net value to each company of about $550 million. Mallinckrodt said the transaction would include an exchange of stock and debt assumption.
Hercules said it would use the proceeds to buy back its stock. Its board approved the repurchase of an additional 10 million of its 101.5 million shares. A previous plan aimed to buy back as many as 65 million shares.
Mallinckrodt said it planned to focus on its human health care and specialty chemicals operations.
Tastemaker had 1996 sales of about $320 million and has 1,280 employees, Roche said. Analysts estimated Tastemaker's 1996 earnings at $42 million, up from $32 million a year earlier. Roche's own flavors and fragrances division, Givaudan-Roure, had 1996 sales of 1.4 billion Swiss francs, or $980 million.
Today's announcement followed intense speculation that Roche might sell its fragrances and flavors division and expand in areas like pharmaceuticals and diagnostics.
"In terms of Roche's sales and cash position, this acquisition is peanuts," said Patrick Carisch, head of equities at CS Asset Management. "This will put an end to sale speculation, at least for now."
Roche's nonvoting stock certificates fell 95 francs, or $66.51, to 12,190 francs, or $8,534.62, on the Swiss stock exchange today. Since Jan. 13, the shares have risen about 16 percent on talk that the company could sell Givaudan-Roure.
Lifted by the sale and the additional share repurchase, Hercules stock rose 12.5 cents, to $46.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Mallinckrodt stock fell 50 cents, to $40.

HEADLINE: GIANT WALL STREET MERGER: THE IMPACT ON JOBS;
Little Immediate Effect is Seen for City Economy

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Because there is little overlap in the businesses of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Dean Witter, Discover & Company, the immediate effects of their plan to merge will be minimal for New York City, company officials said yesterday.
"They will maintain their headquarters and we will maintain ours," Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said.
Though company officials would not say whether job cuts were planned, industry experts said that because the lines of business are so different, the amount of job duplication is not expected to be large. Morgan Stanley, which has about 5,800 employees in New York City, specializes in institutional work and investment banking, while Dean Witter, with about 5,000 employees, has pursued a niche in retail investment services and credit cards. 
 But the combination also raises uncertainty about whether future mergers, with perhaps less desirable consequences for the city, could result.
Analysts said the deal could set off a scramble to consolidate, with firms buying each other to better compete with the new Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter powerhouse or merging to avoid being swallowed by a rival.
And the deal comes at a time when New York's dependence on Wall Street for its economic growth is greater than it has been for decades. As other parts of the New York economy have emerged only slowly from the deep slump of the late 1980's and early 1990's -- or continued an outright decline, in areas like manufacturing and public sector jobs -- the securities industry has boomed. That has provided huge tax revenues for the city and state budgets and resulted in the creation of thousands of jobs, especially among the businesses like accounting and law, which serve the big investment houses.
And the deal would create a giant new player in the local economy -- quiescent for now perhaps, but with the power to roil local markets in real estate and employment.
Real estate professionals say that Morgan Stanley has in the last few years emerged as a major property owner in New York, whose holdings include its headquarters at 48th Street and Broadway in midtown Manhattan. Dean Witter remains a rent-paying tenant at its downtown headquarters in the World Trade Center, with a lease that expires early in the next century.
Real estate experts are already speculating about what will happen, and who will benefit, when that lease ends. While the overlap between Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter may be minimal, some operations are bound to be consolidated.
At that point, the companies will have to decide whether to pick locations in midtown, in the financial district -- where rents are about 30 percent lower -- or somewhere else.
Nonetheless, the effects of the merger are likely to be less direct and immediate than the results of some other recent mergers. For instance, when the Chase Manhattan Corporation merged with the Chemical Banking Corporation last year, thousands of jobs were rendered instantly redundant, resulting in a flood of layoffs.
"When two companies in the same business merge, that's a negative for New York," said Don Brooks, national chairman of the securities and commodities practice at Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. "That's not this."

HEADLINE: 3 Swiss Banks Plan To Establish Fund For Nazis' Victims

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Switzerland's three largest banks announced today that they are to set up what was called a "humanitarian fund for the victims of the Holocaust," with an initial worth of around $70 million.
The gesture, coming after months of pressure from American Jewish groups, was apparently intended to head off threats from them and from New York institutions of sanctions against Swiss banks, a pillar of the Swiss economy, that would further harm their battered reputation. 
 Banking officials said it represented the first time since World War II that Swiss commercial banks had offered their own money in connection with the long-running effort by Jewish groups to seek compensation related to Switzerland's close financial relationship with Nazi Germany.
A statement by the three banks -- Credit Suisse, the Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland -- said they "trust that this initiative will clear the way for the Swiss Government, Switzerland's business and financial community and Jewish organizations to work together toward finding a just and equitable solution to the issues involved."
In New York, the World Jewish Congress said through a spokesman, Elan Steinberg, that it viewed the announcement as "a positive response" to calls by Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., the president of the organization, for Switzerland to make a "good-faith financial gesture."
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who has taken up the controversy and pressed the Swiss Government for a thorough review, called the move "a breakthrough, an acknowledgment of the wrongdoing," and added that it was "an important first step in dealing with this tragic, disgraceful period."
Switzerland's secretive commercial banks have been facing mounting accusations -- which they deny -- that they are hoarding untold wealth in unclaimed deposits by Holocaust victims who opened Swiss bank accounts in the 1930's and were then killed in the death camps.
The three banks said today that they had put 100 million Swiss francs, about $70 million, in an account with the Swiss National Bank and invited other parties, particularly the Government and the Swiss National Bank, to contribute.
Officials said the three banks had contributed roughly a third each and said the move would put pressure on both the Government and the Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, to match their contribution. Rainer Gut, the head of Credit Suisse, suggested last month that the commercial banks, the Government and the National Bank should all contribute the same amount.
The precise purposes of the proposed fund have still to be fully worked out. Mr. Steinberg said it should meet the "flesh and blood needs of Holocaust survivors in their final years," including claims on dormant accounts.
However, Gertrud Erismann, a spokeswoman for the Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said the mechanics of how the fund would be administered and distributed had still to be legally set up by the Government in Bern. She stressed in a telephone interview, however, that the proposed fund would not draw on dormant accounts or prejudice claims on them.
The amount deposited by the three banks is much lower than the figure of more than $250 million that arose in talks late last year between Swiss officials and the World Jewish Congress. Mr. Steinberg said Swiss officials had contacted the World Jewish Congress on Tuesday night and stressed that the 100 million Swiss francs was "an initial infusion" that could lead to "further contributions from other parties."
"Mr. Bronfman is hopeful that indeed both the Swiss Government and the Swiss National Bank will contribute but we have been given no commitment," he said.
Werner Abegg, a spokesman for the Swiss National Bank in Zurich, said that while it had publicly expressed a readiness to contribute an unspecified amount to a "fund or foundation," it would act in concert with the Government.
The Government has said it will consider a contribution once the function and aims of the fund have been worked out and once a Government-appointed commission of historians issues a preliminary report on wartime Swiss financial activities. The Government says the report should be ready before the summer.
A Government statement today welcoming the banks' decision said it "will now further enable taking the necessary steps to create a fund or foundation in regard to defining its purpose and form."
The announcement came two days after the United States, Britain and France agreed to freeze the distribution of $68 million in gold bars looted by Nazi Germany and said it could be used to form the core of a Holocaust compensation fund. How and when that money will be disbursed is subject to political and logistical uncertainties. In any event, Mr. Steinberg said he believed the frozen money would be kept separate from the proposed Swiss fund.
The issues of wartime Swiss gold dealings with Germany and the postwar reluctance of Swiss banks to quickly identify dormant accounts belonging to Holocaust victims are being investigated in Switzerland as separate issues.
Apart from the historians' commission looking into a wide range of Swiss wartime dealings with Germany -- including the trade in looted gold and Switzerland's treatment of Jewish refugees -- a separate panel headed by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, is inquiring into the whereabouts of dormant accounts.
Swiss banks say they have found some $29 million in dormant accounts but argue that only a small proportion can be traced to Holocaust victims. Many claimants seeking access to dormant accounts say Swiss bank officials treated them in an unsympathetic and legalistic way, demanding, for instance, that death certificates be produced for people whose deaths in Nazi camps had gone unrecorded.
"We are breaking with the past," Michael Willi, a spokesman for the Swiss Bank Corporation in Basel, Switzerland, said today. "We are not saying we are guilty. We are not saying we collaborated. We are saying that, in the past, we acted in such a legalistic way and we want to break with that past. Now we want to make a humanitarian gesture."
Previously, he said, the only sums paid out in Holocaust-related claims were from the dormant accounts, not from the banks' own funds.
Today's statement from the Swiss banks said they "stressed that investigative efforts to identify unclaimed assets belonging to victims of the Nazi regime are separate from and unaffected by this initiative."
Up until last month the Swiss Government resisted the idea of a Holocaust compensation fund, arguing that it constituted an admission of guilt in the face of what officials depicted as a broad conspiracy by the United States, Jewish organizations and the news media.
Even in early January, the Swiss said they were prepared to use only dormant accounts left by Holocaust victims to set up a fund, an idea that outraged many Jewish groups and which only served to increase demands for a boycott of Swiss banks.
Then, on Jan. 23, after a security guard discovered officials shredding archives at the Union Bank of Switzerland, the Government announced it would take the lead in setting up a Holocaust compensation fund.
Swiss banking officials said the announcement today reflected the frustration of some senior commercial bankers at the Government's fumbling of a crisis that directly threatened their ability to do business and expand in the United States. However, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, the creation of the fund had been agreed only after one bank -- the Union Bank of Switzerland -- dropped objections to the idea.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
In Evolution of Clinton, A Few Echoes Survive

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Four years ago, in his first major address to Congress at the beginning of his first term, President Clinton announced a plan that, among even more audacious initiatives, would make the Head Start education and nutrition program available to "every eligible child."
On Tuesday night, in one of his many applause lines in his State of Union Message, Mr. Clinton announced a plan that "expands Head Start to one million children by 2002." What he failed to mention is that those one million amount to only half of the children who are eligible. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton urged the nation to "rise to the decisive moment," much as four years ago he warned that "nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them."
But while much of the same language -- about offering opportunity, demanding responsibility, and preparing for the 21st century -- echoes through those two speeches, as through scores of others he gave in between, what the words add up to has changed dramatically.
Indeed, the two speeches show the evolution of Mr. Clinton as well as the influence of his master strategist, Dick Morris. Like points on a chart, they help plot the arc of the Clinton Administration from the first term to the second, revealing often consistent ends but diminished means and illustrating what has changed -- and what has not.
"I am asking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year," Mr. Clinton said in 1993, when his hair was shaggy and iron gray, not sleek and silver.
On Tuesday night, the President tried to convey a sense of decisive and coherent action, but without proposing any ambitious new Federal programs. Four years ago, he communicated the same sense. But then he called for radical changes in health care, significant increases in taxes, and $30 billion for highways and summer jobs.
Much happened in the last four years besides the arrival and departure of Mr. Morris. Asked what had changed between the speeches, one senior adviser to Mr. Clinton snorted. "How about the world?" he asked.
The sluggish economy that helped elect Mr. Clinton sped up and steadied for four years, helping sweep him back into office and allowing him to declare on Tuesday night: "We have won back the basic strength of our economy."
Four years ago, the man seated behind Mr. Clinton was a Democratic Speaker, Tom Foley, not Newt Gingrich, who in 1993 sat frowning in the audience as Mr. Clinton joked: "It is nice to have a fresh excuse for giving a long speech."
Mr. Clinton has come to recognize the limits imposed by the fiscal discipline that he has pushed, the adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
"It's painting with not as big and bold strokes," he said of Tuesday's address. "We're all shaped by events and the life we live, and he knows a lot more now than he did four years ago. It's reality-based speech."
The change in Congress forced Mr. Clinton to switch to a more rhetorical, as opposed to programmatic, approach. He began issuing "challenges" to the American people.
Further, Mr. Clinton changed the content of his message simply because he has made progress toward some of his goals, including cutting the deficit. Four years ago, he asked for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement; Tuesday night, he asked that such agreements be expanded.
But some of the specific proposals announced on Tuesday, including Mr. Clinton's call for character education and school uniforms, appeared prominently in the State of the Union address a year ago, promoted partly by Mr. Morris and thoroughly poll-tested to insure that they would buff Mr. Clinton's hoped-for image as a "good father" for the country.
Mr. Morris's influence may also be glimpsed in the way Mr. Clinton presented himself. Four years ago, to prepare his listeners for radical change in their health care, Mr. Clinton described the existing system in near-apocalyptic terms.
"Our families will never be secure; our businesses will never be strong and our government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health-care crisis," Mr. Clinton said then. "We must do it this year." (On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton said that the country must continue to increase access to health care, but only "step by step.")
Mr. Morris recounts in his recent book, "Behind the Oval Office," that he discovered it was a mistake for Mr. Clinton to mention bad economic news. "By omitting the bad news we usually gained an average of 20 points," he writes, describing how parts of Mr. Clinton's speeches were received in polls.
On Tuesday night, Mr. Clinton omitted the bad news throughout his speech. Even when he summoned the country to address what he called "my number one priority for the next four years" -- fixing the education system -- he did not describe a system in crisis. The closest he came to painting a grim picture was to say that with "record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair, this has now become a serious national concern."
His aides were at pains all day to emphasize that Mr. Clinton did not see a crisis in education.
"I don't think he feels it's a crisis," Erskine B. Bowles, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, said in briefing reporters about the address on Tuesday afternoon. "I think he feels we have a lot of opportunity."
Instead of dwelling on classrooms that are falling apart or children who cannot read or add, Mr. Clinton in his speech resurrected sunny language from his campaign to conjure images of a bright future: "Every 8-year-old must be able to read, every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet, every 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime."
To some observers of the Clinton Administration, Mr. Morris's role was to reinforce Mr. Clinton's own centrist impulses.
"There has always been a centrist tendency in Bill Clinton," said William E. Leuchtenburg, a historian at the University of North Carolina, "and I think what he has been saying -- what he said during the 1996 campaign and what he's been saying since then -- is congruent with that way of looking at the world. The departure was the health care plan."
Indeed, for all the emphasis in the last year on Mr. Morris's influence over Mr. Clinton, some of the themes in Tuesday's speech dovetailed with those four years ago.
But President has honed his language over time.
In 1993, he called for "a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community." By the campaign, and again Tuesday night, that challenge had become this familiar refrain: "We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans, responsibility from all Americans in a community of all Americans."

3 Swiss Banks to Create Fund for Holocaust Victims
Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland, the three largest Swiss banks, announced that they would set up a fund for Holocaust victims and put $70 million into it. A1
 
Russia to Sell Reactors to India
Russia's nuclear establishment is planning to sell two reactors to India. The United States has objected to the multibillion-dollar sale, saying it violates a ban on sales of nuclear equipment to India, which is thought to possess atomic capabilities. Russian officials insist that they need export revenue to maintain their own nuclear program, in which engineers often go unpaid. A3
 
Russian Nerve Gas at Issue
The Clinton Administration, which is seeking Senate ratification of a chemical weapons ban, has asked the Russian Government to stop producing a lethal nerve gas. Some opponents of the treaty say that the gas's existence demonstrates that any ban on such weapons would be ineffective. Moscow, like Washington, has signed but not ratified the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the production of poison gas. A7
 
Mexican Rebels Speak Out
Hiding in a safe house near Mexico City, military leaders of the Popular Revolutionary Army said they believed their movement was gaining support all across Mexico, especially in rural areas where corruption is rife. The rebels said they planned a longterm armed resistance against the Mexican Government, which they see as corrupt. The rebels made several dramatic appearances last year, but seemed to fade away when pursued by the army. A10
 
Israelis Ponder Buffer Zone
Israelis mourned the 73 soldiers who died in a helicopter collision while en route to southern Lebanon, and faced hard questions about Israel's military occupation of a 9-mile-wide buffer zone there. In the last three years, 70 Israeli soldiers have died in the zone. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out any change in policy. A11
 
Zaire's Neighbors Are Warned
The State Department has warned Zaire's eastern neighbors, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, to stay out of the civil war being waged between Zaire's Government and Tutsi rebels in the eastern part of the country. The conflict has flared as a Government counteroffensive has apparently stalled. A9
 
Protest in Ecuador
Hundreds of thousands of Ecuadoreans took to the streets in the first day of a two-day general strike intended to force President Abdala Bucaram out of office. Congress called a special session to consider whether Mr. Bucaram should be impeached, but it was suspended until Thursday. Mr. Bucaram ran for office as a populist but has since tried to push through austere economic policies. A10

Republicans Begin Attack On Many Clinton Proposals
Republicans went on the offensive to attack many of the proposals President Clinton made in his State of the Union Message. The attacks showed that while the President has moved toward the political center since taking office, a steep divide remains between him and Republicans. A1
 
Using oratory reminiscent of the New Deal, Mr. Clinton went to Augusta State University in Georgia and invoked the spirit of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the programs that Roosevelt used to help the region in the 1930's as reasons to support his own plans for education. B8
 
Clinton Prepares His Budget
President Clinton will give Congress his detailed proposals for balancing the Federal budget by 2002, including tax and spending cuts that Administration officials say will yield a surplus in five years. B8
 
A New Chapter for Simpson
The wrongful death lawsuit against O. J. Simpson by the families of his former wife and her friend went back to court to consider punitive damages. B10
 
Responses to the Simpson jury's verdict were expressed in ways that have come to be predictable. But regardless of their opinions, many people were just glad to see the drawn-out affair coming to an end. A1
 
15 Hurt in Amtrak Crash
An Amtrak passenger train on its way from Miami to New York with 187 passengers and 16 crew members struck a tractor-trailer, causing three passenger cars to derail and injuring 15 people. The Silver Meteor was about 13 miles north of Jacksonville, Fla., when the accident occurred about 5 P.M. Those injured were 5 crew members and 10 passengers. (AP)
 
Delays on Nuclear Waste
In 1973, the Federal Government agreed with utilities using nuclear reactors that it would dispose of the highly contaminated nuclear waste from the reactors. Fourteen years later, the Energy Department says that not only will it be unable to meet its deadline of Jan. 31, 1998, but it is unlikely to be ready to begin handling the waste before 2010. A14
 
AIDS Doctors Help Suicides
Many doctors treating people with AIDS in the San Francisco region have had patients who wanted to end their lives, and 53 percent told researchers for an article in The New England Journal of Medicine that they had helped at least one patient commit suicide. A18
 
New Abortion Fight Looms
A leading abortion opponent in Congress said he had the votes for the House to bar groups that support abortion overseas from receiving Federal money. The ban would apply even if the groups spend only private funds on their overseas activities. But the House outcome could be meaningless because the Senate seems unlikely to go along. A22

Race Concerns Crown Hts. Jury
Jurors in the Crown Heights case showed their sensitivity to the case's racial implications even before their deliberations started. The first juror chosen became forewoman by tradition, but because she is Jewish, they asked the judge whether that job should go to any Jewish or black juror. The judge told them not to worry about "public perception." B3
 
Workers Cited in Derailment
Ten months before a train derailed at a Hackensack River bridge, Amtrak employees knew that a steel part connecting rails on the bridge was cracked, officials said. The employees, who now face dismissal, made repairs instead of replacing the part. B7

HEADLINE: Nothing Says a Global Economy Is Inevitable;
In Boston or Hanoi

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Thomas L. Friedman's Feb. 2 column: Globalization is inevitable, just as is the need for safety nets. Our domestic economy is absorbing people into the two- and three-job work force as the most draconian efforts of the "let-them-eat-cakers" become law. As we continue to sponsor corporate welfare, we must sponsor meaningful efforts for the safety net. 
 The missing ingredient in Mr. Friedman's continuum is a lifting of the poor and working poor to middle-class status. Becoming more competitive is admirable. Doing so by stripping all benefits from the wage earner to sate investors is temporary and false.
If these are the only jobs left to the semiskilled, someone needs to make Nike and McDonald's deliver wages a family can live on, be it in South Boston or Hanoi.

HEADLINE: Clinton Tax Credit Plan Won't End Welfare Cycle;
New and Improved

 BODY:
To the Editor:
By linking outdated criticisms of an expired tax credit program to an initiative from President Clinton, your Jan. 30 editorial almost ignores a year and a half of bipartisan effort in Congress to create a public-private tax credit program, the Work Opportunities Tax Credit, which is just getting under way. 
 Although millions were helped by the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit program, its critics charged that many employers were rewarded yet welfare eligibility was not considered when the hiring decision was made.
The new program addresses that criticism by requiring employers to screen for eligibility during the job application process and by tightening the criteria to insure that the credit is available only for those who have a history of dependence on public assistance programs.
Employers have become comfortable with hiring credits because it provides them with the resources they need to engage welfare recipients in on-the-job training. The hiring tax credit helps to offset at least a portion of the higher costs associated with employing the hard-core unemployed.

Pioneer in Sociology, Persevering Fighter for Civil Rights

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
For generations of black scholars, journalists and advocates of black causes, W. E. B. Du Bois stood as teacher, model, inspiration. If he is not so well remembered now, tonight's elegantly produced two-hour tribute may be a corrective. It celebrates his accomplishments -- and, some viewers may add, missteps -- between his birth in Massachusetts in 1868, when black Americans were barely emerging from slavery, to his death in Ghana in 1963, a day before the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington.
"W. E. B. Du Bois: A Biography in Four Voices" divides his astoundingly productive life into manageable portions, written and narrated in turn by Wesley Brown, Thulani Davis, Toni Cade Bambara and Amiri Baraka. This being a testimonial of sorts, all are unrelievedly worshipful. Du Bois's courage and vision could have withstood more stringent analysis. 
 Before the turn of the century, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois became the first black student to receive a doctorate from Harvard University; his dissertation was on the African slave trade. He went on to pioneer empirical sociology with "The Philadelphia Negro," based on thousands of interviews he conducted. Some say that was the beginning of American sociology, but a few years later he went from academe to journalism, as editor of The Crisis, the N.A.A.C.P. magazine that quickly became the most influential black publication of its time. Along the way he wrote such enduring works as "The Souls of Black Folk" and "Black Reconstruction in America."
Relatives, acquaintances and historians, particularly his biographer David Levering Lewis, are put to good service explaining the clash with Booker T. Washington, who championed manual training as the most hopeful path for black youths; with Marcus Garvey, the black nationalist, whom Du Bois called "a lunatic or a traitor," and with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as he moved steadily to the left and away from his longtime mainstream allies.
Deftly handled by Louis Massiah, the producer, the zesty pictures and music catch the spirit of the times. The photographs of Du Bois in his prime show a sportily garbed gent, and his recorded reminiscences give hints of boyhood elocution lessons.
These two hours leave no doubt of Du Bois's perseverance in the battle for civil rights and economic reform in the United States and self-rule for the peoples of Africa. The founding of the United Nations and the movement toward independence in the former colonial world seemed to promise the realization of causes he had long fought for, but with the coming of the cold war he was hounded for his associations with left-wing organizations and movements. Acclaiming even Du Bois's years as an ornament of groups devoted to the interests of the Soviet Union, Mr. Baraka shows a talent for agitprop pamphleteering, but the Government's campaign against Du Bois was cruel.
In the last isolated years of his life, possibly as a gesture of defiance, Du Bois applied for membership in the American Communist Party and then fled from an America to which he had contributed so much. A sad ending, perhaps for him, certainly for his country.

HEADLINE: On Benefits, Just Do It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Greenspan Urges Action to Curb Cost-of-Living Rises in Benefits" (front page, Jan. 31): The Clinton Administration says that it will consider changing the Consumer Price Index if there is a consensus among economists as to how to do it. But consensus could only come from a biased set of experts. This ritual would be an obvious fib, decreasing confidence in government and adding (to unemployment and poverty rates, for example) still another manipulated statistic. 
 If Mr. Greenspan and company want to cut Social Security benefits, why not just admit it? Take off, say, 1 percent from the existing C.P.I. and just accept the political consequences.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
German Fashion Art as Serious Art

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
GIVEN the current crazes for fashion-related art and photo-based art, the growing interest in one of their intersections, fashion photography, comes as no surprise. The latest indication is "Zeitgeist Becomes Form: German Fashion Photography, 1945-1995," an ambitious if uneven survey organized by F. C. Gundlach, a former fashion photographer and writer, at Pat Hearn and Morris-Healy, neighboring galleries in Chelsea. Sponsored by the German Government as part of a series titled "Photography in Germany From 1850 Until Today," it is one of several exhibitions of German photography in the downtown area right now.
As a relatively new esthetic cross-over, fashion photography follows a number of other marginal art forms, like furniture design or ceramics, that have come in from the cold of commerce and function to be taken more seriously as art. It may have the advantage of being a subset of photography, already taken plenty seriously, but its history has only recently begun to be examined with any thoroughness. "Zeitgeist Becomes Form," which includes the work of 35 artists from several generations, is one of the first exhibitions to focus exclusively on German fashion photography. 
 How German is German fashion photography? Many of the nearly 160 images here have been published in non-German magazines; some of the photographers were born elsewhere, while others born in Germany now live in Paris and New York. Still, the exhibition's answer is clear: German enough.
One of the show's salient characteristics is a strong sense of the national Zeitgeist of German history and even German art (Expressionism, Neue Sachlichkeit, Neo-Expressionism). It is overly inclusive and thus indiscriminate, especially in its middle section; it lacks a high frequency of truly resolved, breathtaking images, and offers plenty of reminders of how pretentious, gimmicky and vacant bad fashion photography can be. But it also says as much about Germany as about fashion or photography, thoroughly living up to its title (which rather cheekily echoes that of a groundbreaking exhibition of Conceptual art, "Live in Your Head: When Attitude Becomes Form," held in Bern in 1969). Along the way the show also offers a reasonable explanation for the current fascination with fashion photography, which simply, almost dumbly, touches on a fairly long list of overheated art issues: the body, clothing, gender, theater, not to mention style, beauty and, of course, sex.
The exhibition begins in the late 1940's, in the early years of Germany's economic recovery, when Christian Dior's "New Look" was all the rage and German photographers, like their colleagues in New York and Paris, took models out of the studio and into the street, contrasting their hothouse beauty with real-life backdrops. Some, like Willy Maywald, who worked for Dior and Jacques Fath in Paris, achieved a sharp-edged, ethereal elegance similar to Richard Avedon's.
In Germany, however, the backdrops often, possibly deliberately, conjured up the war's devastation, or the country's economic recovery. Herbert Tobias places a model in a lavish evening dress in front of the ruined arches of an imposing building in Berlin. Norbert Leonard positions his subject, wearing a day suit, in an automobile factory. More ambiguously, Hubs Floter places a sleek gowned model in the wooden bleachers of a stadium with a flock of blond schoolchildren grouped behind her.
Years later, in 1979, Helmut Newton continues the theme, placing a blond model wearing a black lace camisole in front of the Berlin wall, with the neglected Brandenburg Gate looming in the background. A darker cousin of the innocent tourist snapshot, it also summons something of Marlene Dietrich's "Blue Angel" and the grim satire of Grosz and Dix. Peter Lindbergh evokes his country's Nazi past, and fascism in general, when he places models in uniformlike suits by Comme des Garcons amid the monumental forms of a bridge that is, as it happens, in France. (More of his efforts are on view in a solo show at the James Danziger Gallery in SoHo.) A more esthetic backward glance is cast by Jurgen Teller's 1991 photographs of the stylist and model Anna Pawlowski for Comme des Garcons, especially one in which Ms. Pawlowski, wearing a cone-shaped skirt, clings to a tilting chimney like an escapee from "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet."
In recent years, the style of fashion photography has become both more international and more individual, a vehicle of personal expression that disregards clothes in favor of the mundane, the narrative or the overall effects of the image. Mr. Gundlach himself, whose images are remarkable for their seeming casualness and their stark graphic quality, may have contributed to this trend. (His fashion work from the 1950's and 60's is the subject of a show at American Fine Arts in SoHo.)
These tendencies give this exhibition a strong finish, especially in the "slacker" images of Wolfgang Tillmans, the sexually charged scenes of Ellen Unwerth, the isolating portraitlike treatments of Ulrike Schamoni and Rainer Leitzgen's luminous, almost painterly portrayals of Issey Miyake's designs in which the garments all but consume their wearers. In the end, this exhibition convinces one above all of fashion photography's unusual malleability, its continual oscillation between art and cinema, history and fantasy, reportage and seduction.
Still, when confronted with Ute Mahler's recent photographs -- especially one in which a black model in an overcoat runs across an old courtyard clutching banged-up suitcases in either hand -- a slight chill is unavoidable. Germany's past is always lurking just beneath the surface, ready to be exploited by the photographer or read into the image by the viewer.
Another exhibition that attests to the strength of German photography is a display of Karl Blossfeldt's elegant turn-of-the-century close-ups of plants, "First Forms of Art," at the Friedrich Petzel Gallery in SoHo.
Less direct corroboration is offered by "Someone Else With My Fingerprints," at David Zwirner, also in SoHo. An eclectic exhibition organized by Wilhelm Schurmann, a German collector and dealer, it offers images by numerous German photographers but also ranges throughout the world, from artists' works to film stills, with an encyclopedic fervor that is in some ways yet another expression of Germanness.
"Zeitgeist Becomes Form: German Fashion Photography, 1945-1995" remains at the Pat Hearn and Morris-Healy galleries, 530 West 22d Street, Chelsea, through Feb. 22.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Leap in German Joblessness Helps Buoy the Dollar's Value

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday, bolstered by a report showing record unemployment in Germany.
And newly released minutes of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee meeting in December helped the dollar, as well. Although the Fed took no action to raise interest rates then or at its two-day meeting that ended on Wednesday, the minutes showed that members were biased toward a rate increase. 
 Higher interest rates would bolster the dollar's attractiveness at a time when rates in Germany and Japan have been at longtime lows for several months.
Although uncertainty about the Labor Department's January unemployment report today contributed to some profit taking as the day progressed, the dollar settled in New York broadly higher, and traders said it was likely to keep rising.
"The dollar is undervalued, and there are significant problems in Germany and Japan," said Robert Nelson, managing director for foreign-exchange sales at Westdeutsche Landesbank in New York. "At the end of the day people ask: 'Where do I want my money? I don't want it in Japan, and I don't know what's going to happen in Europe, so that leaves the dollar.' "
After passing 123 yen for the first time in four years on Wednesday, the dollar reached an intraday high yesterday of 123.99 yen, then ended at 123.54 yen, up from 123.25 late Wednesday and up 6.6 percent in the first five weeks of 1997.
Against the German mark, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.6547, the strongest since June 1994, before settling in New York at 1.6504 marks, up from 1.6454 and up 7.1 percent in the first five weeks of the year. The British pound slipped to $1.6359 from $1.6396.
The dollar rose on a German Government report showing an unexpectedly large surge of jobless people last month, bringing the total number out of work to a postwar high of 4.658 million. The national unemployment rate rose to 12.2 percent from 10.8 percent. The new figure was not seasonally adjusted.
Although the Bundesbank took no action on interest rates at a meeting yesterday, traders sold marks on the assumption that the central bank would have to ease rates further to help stimulate the German economy.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: THE PROSPECTS;
Even With Agreement, A Goal Remains Elusive

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The most important words about the budget today were probably ones unsaid.
President Clinton did not revive proposals like a sweeping health-care plan or a tax increase on the wealthy that Republicans would be bound to dismiss out of hand. 
 And the Republicans in control of Congress did not declare the President's budget "dead on arrival" as they did in 1995 and 1996 and as the Democrats did all those years when they ran Congress and Republicans were in the White House.
What this means is that both sides are starting the year with the attitude that they can strike a deal to bring the Federal budget into balance by 2002 and are treating the President's submission today as his opening bid.
The prevailing view in the capital is that the negotiations will succeed. But that does not mean the budget will ever be balanced. With the best intentions, Presidents and Congresses have been promising and then reneging on balancing the budget for 20 years.
Three strong pieces of evidence embedded in the President's budget lead to the view that this is not a document that would actually lead to a balanced budget:
*Mr. Clinton never concedes that balancing the budget requires anyone in particular to give up anything specifically.
*More than three-quarters of the deficit reduction he is proposing would come in the years 2001 and 2002, when he is no longer in office.
*The President's figures showing a budget surplus in 2002 are predicated on the questionable assumption that no recession will occur in the next five years.
In broad terms, the two sides are not all that far apart this year. Both want substantial tax reductions, with tax credits for families with children as the centerpiece and new tax breaks for capital gains and retirement accounts. Both propose savings in Medicare and Medicaid. Both say they favor limits on spending for domestic programs.
Even more important, the strong economy resulted in a deficit of only $107 billion in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. That is $40 billion less than what was anticipated just a year ago, making the task of reaching balance much easier.
Furthermore, as a political matter, the Democratic President and the Republican Congress seem to agree that it is in their interest to reach an agreement. Their standing with the public rose last summer after they put aside a year and a half of bickering and began enacting some legislation like the welfare bill and a health insurance measure.
But promising that the budget will be balanced, as a deal between the President and Congress would do, is much easier than actually doing it. The best evidence is the reluctance of the President and Congress to say who would bear the pain.
Starting in 1978, when legislation was adopted stating that spending "shall not exceed" receipts, the politicians have enacted one measure after another promising a balanced budget. Every one eventually foundered on the point that the only way to reach the goal was to raise taxes, cut spending or both.
That would have required actual families and companies and interest groups to sacrifice something. But every time people have been threatened with having to give up Government services, the politicians have abandoned the goal of putting the budget in balance.
Mr. Clinton told reporters today that his budget contained "detailed, difficult cuts in hundreds of Government programs."
But in the thousands of pages and hours of briefings that accompanied the release of his budget, there is no list of what those programs are. Some spending cuts, tax increases and new fees do appear in the fine print. But it would be hard for any specific voters to discern that they would have to relinquish Federal benefits or services they now enjoy.
When the President's budget director, Franklin D. Raines, was asked about this today, he ducked the question. "It's all boring," Mr. Raines said of the specific budget cuts. "They're all boring."
Republicans have hardly been more forthcoming about the dislocations their proposals might cause. They spent the entire election year, for example, arguing that they did not propose to cut Medicare, just slow the rate of growth, never once conceding that retirees might be faced with substantially reduced medical services.
On the matter of backloading the spending cuts, consider this: Over five years, the President proposes $252.1 billion worth of deficit reduction. Of that, $190 billion, or 75.3 percent, is scheduled for the last two years. In the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, tax cuts would actually exceed spending reductions, making the deficit more than $1 billion higher than it would be if no changes in policy were made.
For the programs other than the military that receive annual appropriations from Congress -- called domestic discretionary programs -- the budget envisions saving $58 billion over five years. Only $600 million would come in the first year, the only year for which the cuts must be specifically identified.
Administration officials argue, rightly, that the savings in later years appear greater in part because of annual compounding. But according to Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, a steady pace of cuts would result in 62 percent of the savings occurring in the last two years, not 75 percent.
Perhaps, come the turn of the century, the promised spending cuts will be enacted, but hardly anyone who has followed the last 20 years of budget politics would bet on it.
As for the state of the economy, maybe business cycles are passe, and maybe the country can go another five years without a recession. But if that happens, this would be the longest economic expansion since economists started keeping records on such matters around the turn of the 20th century.
If the economy were to falter, tax revenues would drop, and balancing the budget under the prescriptions Mr. Clinton and Congress are considering would be out of the question.
In the view of some economists and politicians, this is why a constitutional amendment is needed to require a balanced budget. But many others say that focusing on whether the budget is actually balanced misses the point. What is most important, they say, is that the President and Congress seem to be committed to keeping the deficit from growing out of control the way it did in the 1980's.
Mr. Reischauer, for one, is in this camp. He thinks the President's budget and the impending negotiations with Congress are a strong signal that the politicians are on the right course.
"We shouldn't sacrifice the good for the best," he said.

HEADLINE: Gore and Chernomyrdin Meet; Agenda Includes a Wider NATO

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore sat down today for two days of talks here with the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, hoping to inject movement into an American-Russian relationship that has been stagnant for six months because of President Boris N. Yeltsin's infirmity.
Mr. Chernomyrdin told reporters a summit meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin would be held in March as scheduled, in the second half of the month; American officials cautioned that a date was not yet fixed. While it is Mr. Yeltsin's turn to come to Washington, American officials have offered to meet in Moscow or elsewhere in Europe. 
 The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission meets every six months and incorporates Cabinet-level committees on scientific, technological and economic issues. But with Mr. Yeltsin ill, the meetings have become the main formal channel for high-level bilateral discussions.
Asked today about Mr. Yeltsin, who turned 66 on Saturday, a senior American official said: "He is running the show and is on top of his brief. We are encouraged by what we're hearing."
But other officials said they had no independent confirmation of Mr. Yeltsin's health and stressed, as they often do, that American relations are "with Russia and its Government, not with any one individual."
The officials also emphasized that Mr. Chernomyrdin has a broad brief, able to talk authoritatively about security issues like NATO enlargement. Until Mr. Yeltsin's heart operation last autumn, when Aleksandr M. Lebed was dismissed as head of the National Security Council, Mr. Chernomyrdin's purview was almost purely domestic.
But it is still Mr. Yeltsin who is likely to call the shots on big decisions.
Mr. Chernomyrdin today called the March summit meeting "very important," and no American officials, frustrated with ambiguous and negative signals from Moscow on issues like NATO's enlargement and the ratification of an arms reduction treaty, would disagree.
A NATO summit meeting is set for early July, when a few new members are to be named. By that time, Washington wants to have a parallel understanding between NATO and Russia on security in Europe.
American officials say those negotiations could go down to the wire, even dominating the summit meeting of major industrialized nations in Denver in late June, to which Mr. Yeltsin is invited. But they said that in meetings with Mr. Gore and with President Clinton on Friday, Mr. Chernomyrdin has the authority to talk seriously about security issues. In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Mr. Chernomyrdin said Moscow wanted "a binding treaty, with verification" between Russia and NATO. Washington rejects a "binding treaty" but wants "a political commitment," like the Helsinki Accords, to provide venues for discussion and cooperation on security.
Washington also offers talks to update the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, to assuage Russian concerns about troop movements in new NATO members and concerns about any Russian troop movements from countries that will be left out of the first round of NATO expansion, like Ukraine and the Baltic nations.
Ambassadors of the 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also agreed today in Paris to begin a process leading to Russian membership of the group, which coordinates economic policies. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are already members. Full Russian membership will require accords on capital movement, financial transactions and other issues.

HEADLINE: German Unemployment Soars, Worsening Choices for Kohl

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The number of jobless German workers soared by nearly half a million last month, to 4.66 million, an unexpectedly steep rise in what had already been Germany's highest unemployment since World War II, according to Government data released today.
The new figures startled economists and posed new problems for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose popularity has slumped to new lows in recent months and whose Cabinet ministers have plunged into open warfare with one another. 
 The overall unemployment rate in Germany climbed to 12.2 percent from 10.8 percent in December, and it was nearly 19 percent in the formerly Communist eastern region. Neither those figures nor the total number of jobless workers, which was up from 4.15 million in December, reflected seasonal adjustments. But even after accounting for seasonal factors, the increase in the number unemployed -- 160,000 -- surprised analysts because it was three times the rate of increase in the last four months and was three times higher than expected.
The data raised new doubts about rigidities built into the German economy, Europe's largest, and its ability to shake off several years of stagnant growth. Germany, like some other European nations, is in the midst of an anxious debate over how to modify its social-benefit system and whether to emulate the American model of growth with insecurity. And, like the other European nations, Germany faces pressure to maintain fiscal discipline as the planned introduction of a single currency gets nearer.
Though the Government said that the sharp increase in unemployment last month had been caused in part by cold weather, which shut down construction sites, it was also a symptom of the steps that German companies are taking to slim down in hope of regaining competitiveness. Industrial giants like Daimler-Benz and Hoechst have aggressively cut costs.
The revamping of German industry has helped keep the stock market at record levels, and the markets apparently took the news of higher unemployment in stride, reaching new highs today.
The economy is also getting a lift from a surge in exports, thanks in part to an increase in the value of the American dollar against the mark, which makes German products cheaper in the United States.
Germany's central bank decided not to give economic growth a further stimulus in the form of lower interest rates, leaving them unchanged at a regular meeting today. Most economists expect growth to increase from a paltry 1.4 percent in 1996 to more than 2 percent this year.
All that is cold comfort to German workers who have been put out of work. "This provides a shining example of how economic growth does not necessarily translate into new jobs," said Holger Schmiedling, senior economist at Merrill Lynch here. "We are beginning to see German business restructuring and regaining the competitiveness that it lost in the early 1990's, but it still has a long ways to catch up."
This sharply higher unemployment is likely to place Chancellor Kohl in a fiscal and political straitjacket. It will force the Government to pay billions of extra marks in unemployment costs, at a time Mr. Kohl is trying to slash billions in pension and health care programs to meet the fiscal requirements for taking part in the European currency planned in 1999.
An extra 160,000 jobless workers translates to about $5 billion in Government costs, or two-tenths of 1 percent of Germany's gross domestic product, according to Mr. Schmiedling. To qualify for the European monetary union, a priority for Mr. Kohl, Germany must keep its budget deficit to less than 3 percent of the G.D.P. this year. In 1996, the deficit reached 3.9 percent of output, largely from continuing huge expenditures to integrate eastern Germany into the broad economy. The Government says it can cut the deficit to 2.9 percent, but most independent economists were skeptical of that even before today's news.
"It is quite a problem for Kohl, because his popularity is extremely low right now," said Michael Lewis, senior economist at Deutsche Morgen Grenfell. But he noted that the Chancellor's party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union, is still more popular than the main opposition, the Social Democratic Party.
In recent weeks, Mr. Kohl and members of his Cabinet have been pilloried by critics, and have appeared in increasing internal disarray, as they tried to push through measures to cut social spending and change a byzantine tax system.
Members of the center-right governing coalition are fighting on a wide range of fronts. The Free Democratic Party, a centrist group that is the junior coalition partner, has repeatedly attacked what its members described as feeble-hearted attempts at tax reform. Now, two of Mr. Kohl's Cabinet members, Labor Minister Norbert Blum and Finance Minister Theo Waigel, are quarreling over Mr. Blum's proposal to overhaul the nation's underfinanced pension system. Mr. Blum proposed reducing a number of benefits and raising new money through an increase in the value-added tax, a kind of steep sales tax on each stage of production and distribution.
Free Democrats angrily assailed the proposed tax increase, while Mr. Waigel insisted that the Government start taxing some pension benefits.
Amid this rising pressure and open disarray, politicians and business executives have begun speculating that the Kohl coalition could falter or that Mr. Kohl might be pushed aside as leader in favor of others in the Christian Democratic Union.
The one big bright area in the German economy is exports. For all the complaints about the high costs and inflexibility of doing business here, the demand for German goods abroad grew rapidly last year and the country continued to enjoy a huge trade surplus.
Economists expect that trend to accelerate in 1997, thanks to the rise of the American dollar in relation to the mark. That rise is expected to be discussed at a meeting in Berlin this weekend of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, as officials of several nations have questioned whether the dollar's value has increased too steeply.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increased 5.8% in January

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
The sales increases that retailers were counting on for Christmas came too little and too late for many of the nation's stores.
From swanky department stores to deep discount chains, merchants reported strong sales increases for January for items ranging from women's apparel to household furnishings. 
 But January is considered one of the least important months of the year for retailers, and any comparison with sales figures reported last January must take into account the dreadful weather that hit much of the nation that month.
The Goldman, Sachs retail composite index, which tracks same-store sales ---- or sales from stores open at least a year -- increased 5.8 percent in January. That is well above the combined 2.9 percent gain in December for the nearly 60 retail companies in the index and a sharp climb from the 1.1 percent increase in January a year ago.
"It is actually the best single month since January of 1995, when the same-store sales composite rose 7.2 percent," Richard N. Baum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said.
That said, January sales are typically increased by markdowns of merchandise that did not sell in the holiday season, and sales for that month only represent about 5 percent of most retailers' overall sales for the year.
Even so, some analysts said the sales gains portend strong retail sales this year.
"We continue to believe the luxury goods category remains the strongest in retailing," Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said. "In addition, consumer demand for apparel remains relatively favorable, as better fabrics, more exciting colors and fashions more reflective of an aging baby-boom generation have made this sector more appealing."
The improved numbers showed up across industry segments. Saks Holdings Inc. of New York, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, had a 14.3 percent increase in January same-store sales, while the Charlotte, N.C., deep-discount chain Family Dollar Stores Inc., reported a 23.3 percent gain. Pier 1 Imports Inc. of Fort Worth reported a hefty 19.6 percent gain, while sales for the Limited Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, rose 17 percent.
Over all, retailers benefited because sales for the holiday season a year ago were so dismal and from deep markdowns of merchandise that did not sell during the recent holidays, according to Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard Retail Marketing Report, a forecasting firm in Scotch Plains, N.J. The mild weather in much of the country last month was also a factor, as was a sustained high consumer confidence level and a continued upbeat economy.
And in New York City, several retailers attributed higher sales last month to increased business generated by a program that suspended sales tax for a week in January on clothing selling for less than $500. The state and city agreed to drop their respective sales taxes on apparel for a week as part of an experiment to determine whether consumers would shift their spending to the city rather than shop in New Jersey and other nearby areas with little or no tax on clothing.
"Our January sales results were particularly strong, in part, because our New York retail operations benefited from the weeklong sales tax exemption," said Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Federated Department Stores Inc., the parent of Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Stern's. He said half of Federated's 9.4 percent comparable-store sales gain for the month can be attributed to the tax exemption.
The real losers among retailers last month were home electronics companies. Best Buy Company, the Minneapolis electronics retailer, reported that its January sales plummeted 15 percent compared with a 4 percent gain in the same month a year earlier. Its competitor, Circuit City Stores Inc. of Richmond did not fare any better with an 11 percent drop compared with a 2 percent gain in the same period a year ago.
Lack of new products, price cuts and lower personal computer sales hurt electronics retailers, said Jack D. Seibald, a retail analyst with Blackford Securities.
Other winners included the Hills Stores Company of Canton, Mass., which reported an 11.4 percent increase and the J. C. Penney Company of Plano, Tex., which reported that its numbers were up 19 percent.
Some retailers, though, reported only minimal gains. The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation of New York reported just a 2.5 percent increase, while Builders Square, the troubled home-improvement retailing unit that the Kmart Corporation is in the process of unloading, had flat results with a three-tenths of a percent gain.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: INCOME TAXES;
Clinton and G.O.P. Are Distant on Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Although both sides say they are optimistic about reaching a compromise, President Clinton's proposal today to cut taxes by nearly $100 billion over the next five years is distant, both in size and composition, from the tax-cutting demands of Congressional Republicans.
The President's plan renews his calls to provide tax relief to middle-class families, make college more affordable and stimulate savings through an expansion of the Individual Retirement Account. 
 Although Mr. Clinton said his proposals would save taxpayers $98 billion, they are paid for in large part by other tax measures, including the closing of loopholes and the extensions of expiring taxes.
Republicans contend that those revenue-raising measures, which total $76 billion over five years, are simply tax increases, and that they therefore view the President's net tax cut as being only $22 billion. And Republicans noted that the Administration's plan would cancel its tax cuts after 2000 if the economy did not perform as well as it expects.
"The budget offers the American people what may be temporary tax relief, combined with permanent tax hikes, adding up to an excessive tax burden," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Republicans also characterized the Administration's plan to impose $10.9 billion in new "user fees" as tax increases by another name. The fees cover activities ranging from meat, poultry and egg inspections to mining on public land to applying for permits to dredge wetlands. The Administration is also proposing to charge airlines $300 million in new user fees next year, and to replace the current system of airline excise taxes with user fees in 1999.
By contrast, Senate Republicans have already called for $193 billion in tax cuts over five years. They have not yet specified what offsetting revenue increases they would seek, but senior Republican aides said they were aiming for a net tax cut over five years of at least $125 billion.
Moreover, the two sides are going into budget negotiations with a deep philosophical divide over what types of tax cuts to enact. Republicans have made a broad-based reduction in the capital gains tax one of their top priorities, arguing that lower taxes on the sale of stocks and bonds, real estate, small businesses and other assets would spur more investment and create more jobs.
The latest Republican plan calls for halving the current top 28 percent rate on capital gains. The Administration's plan only nibbles at the capital gains tax, allowing the exclusion of profits up to $500,000 on the sale of a home.
"While I am pleased that President Clinton addressed the issue of capital gains relief, I think we should go much further," said Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee.
Administration officials, recognizing that they will not get a budget deal without some compromise on capital gains, have made it clear that they consider the issue negotiable.
Some Administration officials have suggested they might be willing to trade concessions on capital gains for Republican acceptance of the President's plan to give tax breaks for college tuition.
The White House is also at odds with Republicans over the shape of income tax cuts. Republicans have taken a firm position that taxes should be lower across the board, while the Administration has kept its tax proposals focused on specific groups -- in this case middle-income families and families sending children to college.
Specifically, Mr. Clinton's plan offers families with incomes under $60,000 and children under the age of 13 a $300-per-child credit. The credit would be phased out for families whose incomes range from $60,000 to $75,000. In the year 2000, the credit would rise to $500 per child. The Republican proposal would offer a $500 credit starting next year for children under 18 for families with incomes up to $75,000. The credit would be phased out for families with incomes from $75,000 to $110,000.
The President's plan would also provide a $1,500 per-student tax credit for the first two years of college. Or families could deduct up to $5,000 for college tuition and job training expenses, with the maximum deduction rising to $10,000 per family in 1999. The deduction would be fully available for families filing joint returns with incomes of up to $80,000 ($50,000 for single filers), and would phase out for those with incomes up to $100,000 ($70,00 for single filers).
Another hurdle to an agreement is the difference in the economic assumptions being used by the White House and Congress to determine how large a tax cut the Government can afford. The White House uses slightly more optimistic assumptions, but has agreed to rescind some tax cuts and call for an additional 2.25 percent across-the-board cut in all spending except Social Security after 2000 if the economy does not perform as well as expected.

HEADLINE: Car-Loan Crisis Forces Jayhawk Into Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The Jayhawk Acceptance Company said today that its bankers had cut off access to new money, forcing it to file for bankruptcy, the latest in a series of financial crises in the auto-loan industry.
Fleet Financial Group told Jayhawk that it was in default and ordered it to pay back its loans, leading Jayhawk to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Jayhawk, based in Dallas, assured Wall Street last week that it expected to work out problems with its bankers, so news of the bankruptcy stunned analysts. 
 "Last week, they told us Fleet would work with them," said Tim McMennamy, an analyst at Stephens Inc. in Atlanta.
Jayhawk's bankruptcy comes as the business of making car loans to people with poor credit crumbles. The Mercury Finance Company has been on the brink of bankruptcy -- defaulting on $61 million in debt payments -- since revealing last week that it overstated earnings for four years.
In an effort to save $13.3 million, Mercury today eliminated its quarterly dividend, which would have been paid on March 3. Meanwhile, state regulators in Missouri have moved to restrict Mercury's control of its insurance subsidiary, the Lyndon Life Insurance Company, based in St. Louis. Missouri officials instructed Lyndon Life to inform regulators if Mercury, based in Lake Forest, Ill., requested any unusual money transfers.
And another company in the auto-loan industry, First Enterprise Financial Inc., based in Evanston, Ill., was forced today to delay releasing earnings because of unexpected charges for bad loans.
"With Mercury and Jayhawk back to back, that was enough to scare the industry," said Henry Coffey, an analyst at J. C. Bradford & Company in Nashville.
The bankruptcy of Jayhawk comes a week after the company took a $15.5 million charge for bad auto loans, resulting in a fourth-quarter loss. Jayhawk warned its investors last week that the charge put it in violation of its agreement with Fleet Financial .
The two incidents have driven down shares of other finance companies that make auto loans to customers with poor or no credit records.
Trading in Jayhawk's shares was halted after falling 12.5 cents, to $4. Shares of Mercury fell 37.5 cents today, to $2.25, down about 85 percent since its problems were revealed. First Enterprise Financial shares fell $3.375 today, to $8.875, a drop of 27.6 percent.
"The events at Jayhawk reflect a classic case of management who thought they knew what they were doing and obviously did not," said Dennis Telzrow, an analyst with Principal Financial Securities in Dallas.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Are Steady Ahead of Jobless Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were almost unchanged yesterday as traders waited for the release this morning of the employment report for January.
The 30-year bond slipped 1/32 to a price of 96 24/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, remained at 6.75 percent. 
 Early yesterday, a report of a decrease in new claims for unemployment benefits caused prices to fall slightly. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that claims fell by 12,000, to 325,000, last week.
The decrease in claims could signal a tightening labor market, which might cause inflation to pick up, eroding the value of bonds. But yesterday's report is less significant than the monthly report.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, described the market as taking a break after the Federal Open Market Committee decided earlier this week not to raise interest rates. "While the F.O.M.C. undoubtedly kept its bias toward tightening," he said, "the economic evidence pointing toward accelerating inflation simply wasn't compelling enough to persuade it to lift the Federal funds rate." That rate is what banks charge each other for overnight loans.
Mr. Fine said that in the employment report, the market would pay particular attention to data on average hourly earnings, in light of recent sharp jumps. The number of jobs added to payrolls, which is usually the most closely watched figure in the report, may overstate the strength of the labor market for last month, he said, in part because the blizzard in the Northeast last January caused the payroll figure to be skewed downward. The Labor Department has also made changes in the process it uses to adjust for seasonal variations.
As a result, Mr. Fine said, economists' forecasts for the increase in nonfarm payrolls have varied far more widely than usual, from 115,000 to 400,000. Though there is clearly no consensus, the average prediction is for a gain of about 232,000, he said, though it is unclear how the bond market would respond to such a figure. "Needless to say, any overestimate in January will likely be revised in February, and because of the seasonal adjustment difficulties both the January and February payroll figures should be viewed together in order to better ascertain the trend," he said.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said that bond prices were close to a peak, but with some room left for gains.
Because the payroll number could be affected by special factors, it is possible that the market will largely disregard it, he said, especially because there will be one more report on the job market before the Fed meets again on March 25 to decide on interest rates.
"Also," Mr. Palash said, "we are expecting some of the other components within the report to be market friendly."
He said he expected average hourly earnings to be unchanged and the average work week to decline, both of which would be noninflationary indicators. Mr. Palash said he expected the overall jobless rate to fall to 5.2 percent from 5.3.

HEADLINE: TRACK AND FIELD;
Determination Keeps Kostadinova Atop High Jump Field

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
For a decade now, the high jump bar has not nudged higher than 6 feet 10 1/4 inches for women, just short of a landmark for the metrically challenged. Javier Sotomayor of Cuba has reached 8 feet in the men's competition, but the world, at least that part of it that measures in feet and inches, is still waiting for the first woman to jump 7.
"For some woman it is possible," said Stefka Kostadinova, 31, the Olympic champion from Bulgaria who holds the world outdoor record. . 
 "Is it possible for you?" she was asked yesterday.
Kostadinova (pronounced costa-DEEN-ova) looked at her coach and husband, Nikolai Petrov, who was translating.
"She didn't say yes," Petrov said with a laugh.
"She can do it," Charles Austin, the men's Olympic champion from San Marcos, Tex., said later. "I've seen her jump 6-8 and 6-9 with plenty of room. Seven feet is all in her head."
The likelihood of a 7-foot jump is extremely remote at tonight's Chase Millrose Games, with Madison Square Garden arranged in its tiny, noisy track configuration. But the women's meet record of 6-5 1/2 is in peril. Surpassing it would give Kostadinova no small satisfaction, considering that the woman who holds it, Louise Ritter of Dallas, defeated the favored Bulgarian for a gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Kostadinova will be one of six 1996 Olympic gold medalists competing at Millrose, joining Austin, the 110-meter hurdles champion Allen Johnson, the 400-meter hurdles champion Derrick Adkins, the 4x100 relay member Gwen Torrence and the pole vault champion Jean Galfione of France.
The mile events feature the baby boomers Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland, who has broken the 4-minute mark 47 times indoors, and Mary Slaney, who at 38 is trying to break her 15-year-old indoor American record of 4:20.50.
An offer yesterday by the Mobil Corporation to pay the combined $35,000 appearance fee of Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Gail Devers was declined by the athletes because of previous commitments and training conflicts. But even with the tarnish of their withdrawal, the 90th Millrose Games retains considerable Olympic luster.
Perhaps no track-and-field athlete, except Sergei Bubka, the Ukrainian pole-vaulter, has been as dominant as the 6-foot-1-inch Kostadinova, who owns the outdoor world record and 20 of the top 25 women's high jumps, thanks to an explosive liftoff and flawless technique. Her best leap indoors, 6-9, is half an inch off the world record.
"She is very confident," said Austin, a friend of Kostadinova and Petrov, her husband. "She approaches the bar as aggressively as the men. I wish my technique was as sound as hers."
Kostadinova's determination has equaled her confidence. She prevailed at last summer's Olympics in Atlanta after bitter disappointment in 1988; the fall of Communism and her state-supported training system; repeated injury; the birth of a son, Nikolai, two years ago, and continued upheaval in the Bulgarian economy. Now there is another distraction. Recently, Austin said, her father was involved in a serious automobile accident.
"I was very happy to win the gold medal," Kostadinova said. "I waited eight years."
She set the current outdoor record of 6-10 1/4 in 1987, and by the Seoul Olympics a year later, Kostadinova had 11 of the top 12 jumps in history and had won 73 of her previous 77 competitions. But Ritter had defeated her twice; more important, Ritter had Olympic experience and Kostadinova did not. In Seoul, both jumpers missed all three attempts at 6-8 and went to a jump-off. Ritter cleared 6-8 on her fourth attempt in sudden death, while Kostadinova missed, producing one of the biggest upsets of the Games.
"One comment she made was that she felt I was lucky," Ritter said in a telephone interview from Dallas. "That was an indication of her confidence at the time."
However, her explosive liftoff was to be grounded by a knee injury and a broken bone in her foot. At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, the best Kostadinova could accomplish was fourth place with a mediocre jump of 6-4 1/4. She essentially took an 18-month maternity leave in 1994 and '95 and returned to competition in July 1995. After only two preparatory meets, she won the world championship in Goteborg, Sweden. Last year, at her third Olympics, Kostadinova finally won a gold medal, breaking Ritter's Olympic record with a leap of 6-8 3/4.
"She's extremely competitive," Ritter said. "She doesn't like to lose. After a personal defeat like Seoul, it didn't surprise me that she won in Atlanta."
Upon returning home with her gold medal, Kostadinova was given a $25,000 reward by the Bulgarian Government. But state support has largely gone the way of Communism in the Eastern bloc. A two-week training trip in Italy now costs $4,000, Petrov said, without the Government to pick up the tab. There is only one hall for indoor training, and the track is in poor condition, Petrov said.
An economic crisis in Bulgaria has led to mass protests, bread lines, spiraling inflation and an agreement by the Socialist government to hold general elections by April 20. Kostadinova's money is protected from inflation, Petrov said, asking for discretion about her finances for fear that "very bad people" could make trouble for them. Asked whether anyone had tried to extort money from Kostadinova, he said, "We have friends that protect us."
"For Stefka, food, training, it is no problem," Petrov said, adding that she is now sponsored by Nike. "For others, the economic crisis is bad. People cannot buy medicine. The old people have enough money to buy bread for one day. Everybody is looking for change, for a nice new day."

HEADLINE: The Ultimate Fighter For Ultimate Fighting;
Seasoned Lobbyist Gave No Quarter In Quest to Legitimize Bloody Sport

BYLINE: BY DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 6

 BODY:
A clue to the power of the lobbyist for ultimate fighting, James D. Featherstonhaugh, can be found on his sleeves. There, clasping the cuffs of a crisp shirt, are silver links embossed with the state seal.
Mr. Featherstonhaugh says the cuff links symbolize only admiration for his home state. But given his success in influencing the public debate to benefit his clients, the fashion statement also reflects the lobbyist's stature in the halls of the State Legislature. In the parlance of politics, he is "connected": once a strategist for former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, he is friendly with top Republican leaders and is a business partner of Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. 
 Ultimate fighting -- the melange of kickboxing, wrestling and free-form brawling that is also called extreme fighting -- continues to draw fire. Although the Legislature sanctioned the sport a few months ago, a Federal judge today refused to stop the State Athletic Commission from imposing strict regulations on it. Rather than hold a bout scheduled for Friday in Niagara Falls, where they said the essence of the sport would be diluted, the promoters have moved the event to Alabama.
But the fact that the ultimate fighting debate reached even this level of legitimacy in public discourse is a measure of Mr. Featherstonhaugh's political skills. Just ask state Senator Roy M. Goodman, who last year proposed a bill to ban the sport he calls "human cockfighting," but wound up sponsoring the bill that eventually sanctioned it through regulation.
The reason, he says, is one word: "Lobbying." And the Senator makes clear he is referring to that man of slight build and bald pate, that man called Feathers.
Mr. Featherstonhaugh, 52, attributes his overall success to the 28 years he spent in the halls and courts of Albany. His firm was recently ranked third in fees collected by the State Lobbying Commission; its 41 clients last year included the bottling and beverage industries, AT&T, and several insurance companies.
But the relatively insignificant matter of ultimate fighting posed a rare challenge, he says. It had virtually no political charm, and therefore required him to draw heavily on the lobbyist's arsenal of timing, psychology and perseverance. "This would make a case study for how to lobby on a piece of legislation," he said. And, he noted with a hint of pride, "I don't think we bought anyone so much as a lunch."
To appreciate Mr. Featherstonhaugh's primer on lobbying, one must understand who he is. First, that name: Featherstonhaugh is an English surname (pronounced FAN-shaw in England but FEATHER-stun-ah here). He grew up in nearby Duanesburg. His father was an Albany newspaper reporter who died when his son was 8; his mother worked in a bookstore.
After graduating from Albany Law School in 1969, he got a job with a law firm that had an extensive lobbying practice; his major client was the Civil Service Employees Association. By 1982, he was a partner in his own law firm and had emerged as a prominent Republican. Nevertheless, a Queens Democrat named Mario Cuomo asked him to be the upstate coordinator for his gubernatorial campaign.
"He was the attorney for the C.S.E.A., and the C.S.E.A. was the first union to endorse me," Mr. Cuomo recalled. "It was a natural segue for him to go from the C.S.E.A. to the campaign."
Mr. Cuomo won, and the political capital of Mr. Featherstonhaugh rose, as did his wealth. Now a millionaire, he vacations every July with his family in a summer house in Nantucket -- after the end of the legislative session.
His rise has not been without controversy. In 1990, he joined the First Grafton Corporation, a real-estate company started years earlier by Mr. Bruno, a Republican Senator from Rensselaer County who is now the majority leader. Several years ago the company began to clear some rural land it owned for a subdivision, but was stopped by the state for disturbing wetlands; the matter has been in court ever since.
Mr. Featherstonhaugh said he never considered the propriety of a lobbyist being in business with a legislator. "It was probably a mistake not to think about it," he said.
For his part, Mr. Bruno said that after the ethical considerations were pointed out to him, he went to the Legislative Ethics Committee for advice and at its suggestion, placed his interest in First Grafton in a blind trust.
Mr. Feathestonhaugh made headlines again in 1995 when he gave a $100,000-a-year consulting job to Ralph Marino, shortly after Mr. Marino's ouster as Senate majority leader. Mr. Featherstonhaugh said at the time that Mr. Marino would strengthen his firm's representation of the bottling industry. But he now acknowledges that the hire probably made life easier for Mr. Marino's successor, Mr. Bruno.
"I don't know if I would categorize it as a favor," he said. "But I think the majority leader was pleased that Senator Marino left. Of course I was aware of that. To which I say, so what?"
The so-what, of course, is that these episodes provide a glimpse into the closeness between Mr. Featherstonhaugh and the state's decision makers. "What I do requires me to get my clients a fair hearing," he said. "And my relationship with all these people helps me to do that."
Blair Horner, a lobbyist for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said he would place Mr. Featherstonhaugh in the "800-pound gorilla category" of lobbyists. "He's one of the longtime lobbyists here, with extensive contacts deep into the Democrats and Republicans," Mr. Horner said. "But you don't see Feathers that much. He tends to fly under the public radar screen."
In late 1995, that reputation for access and effectiveness earned Mr. Featherstonhaugh another client: Semaphore Entertainment Group, producers of ultimate fighting.
Semaphore's president, Robert B. Meyrowitz, needed help. A recent attempt by another producer to stage a contest in Brooklyn had enraged city and state leaders, and they chased the promoter out of the city. Mr. Meyrowitz believed that ultimate fighting was much safer than its bloodsport reputation, and he wanted to counter plans by the Pataki administration and Senator Goodman to ban the sport in New York.
In a Dec. 5, 1995, letter to Semaphore, Mr. Featherstonhaugh laid out a strategy "to derail such an effort." He wrote that he would arrange meetings with key legislators; first on his list was his business partner, Senator Bruno. Then he would develop "our own legislation requiring regulation" -- which is what eventually happened.
Here is the psychological approach, as explained by Mr. Featherstonhaugh: "We thought that the way to deflect this ban was to allow them to regulate it. We wanted to give people a vehicle, a place to go other than a ban."
But first things first. The lobbyist and his staff put together an informational packet that included a videotape of an ultimate fighting match. Then they targeted several legislators, including Joseph T. Pillittere, then the chairman of the Assembly's tourism and sports development committee.
Mr. Pillittere recalled this week that he and his daughter, a professional wrestling fan, watched the videotape, and they both found the event boring. "But since they allowed certain kicking in the groin," he said, "I asked them if they would accept legislation that would put them under the auspices of the Athletic Commission."
Of course, came the answer. "Pillittere is where we got our first success," Mr. Featherstonhaugh said.
As the lobbyist continued to work the issue, he emphasized the economic benefit of offering ultimate fighting events to the distressed cities of upstate New York. The argument was blunt: "You could set off a bomb in your downtown at 11 o'clock at night, and no one would be hurt."
Meanwhile, Mr. Featherstonhaugh worried that Gov. George E. Pataki, who supported a ban, might reach the Republican Senate leadership before he did. He arranged a meeting between Semaphore's president and Senator Bruno, who saw no need for a ban. "He indicated that we were the first people to raise it," the lobbyist said, "which is what I wanted."
In fact, for the first two months of the 1996 legislative session, Mr. Featherstonhaugh lobbied virtually without opposition. Senator Goodman submitted his bill to ban the sport on Jan. 30, 1996, but his investigations committee did not hold a hearing on the matter until April 18.
"Often, if you get to make your case first and it's persuasive, you win," Mr. Featherstonhaugh said.
His early work weakened Senator Goodman's lobbying position. "Several senators mentioned that he had spoken to them," the Senator said. As a result, he added, "I was encountering resistance from senators and from leadership."
After three decades in the Senate, Mr. Goodman did not need a lobbyist to explain the political landscape. In June he proposed that the Athletic Commission oversee ultimate fighting; regulation, he reasoned, was better than to allow the sport to continue unchecked. By July, both houses had passed a bill that Mr. Featherstonhaugh says included some language that he had drafted.
"After it passed, we worked on the Governor," the lobbyist said. Letters of support rained on Mr. Pataki's office. But Mr. Featherstonhaugh said his most persuasive tool was the argument that if the bill were vetoed, "It was clear we could do these events without any regulation."
The Governor reluctantly signed the bill in October. Mr. Featherstonhaugh's work appeared to be done.
Since then, however, the Athletic Commission approved regulations that are anathema to the true ultimate fighter, like a prohibition against head kicks. And Governor Pataki, Senator Goodman and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver all support a ban. Mr. Featherstonhaugh attributed the move to the outcry brought on by sudden media attention and vowed to continue the fight for the ultimate fight.
And to those who might portray him as one of those cigar-chomping power brokers who make decisions in back rooms, he has a sly reply. "We represent the cigar manufacturers," he said. "So we applaud cigar chomping."

HEADLINE: A Gesture From Swiss Bankers

 BODY:
Self-interest rather than a humanitarian impulse has led three Swiss banks to establish a $70 million fund for the victims of the Holocaust, but the action is still a promising move. The motive in this case is less important than the signal that the Swiss banking industry belatedly recognizes it cannot brush off claims that it mishandled the accounts of Jews who died in the Holocaust.
Until the opening of the special fund this week, Swiss bankers had rudely resisted assertions that money, gold and other valuables placed in Swiss vaults in the 1930's by Jews had been looted or diverted by the banks after the war. The Swiss Government seemed equally intransigent, even entertaining the crude notion that organizations like the World Jewish Congress were engaged in a conspiracy to undermine Switzerland's economy. 
 The Jewish organizations are seeking something much simpler. They would like a complete and honest accounting of the old deposits and repayment to people who can establish legitimate claims. The best mechanism for auditing the accounts is in place, under the direction of Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. If the bankers give the Volcker commission full cooperation, bank ledgers can be examined and accounts traced and in some cases probably recovered. Mr. Volcker should promptly and publicly complain if the bankers balk. The potential loss of American banking business is a powerful incentive for the Swiss to cooperate.
No one knows the precise number or value of accounts opened by Jews hoping to safeguard their assets as the Nazi threat developed. The sum could easily run into hundreds of millions of dollars. The $70 million fund, which is expected to grow with additional contributions from the Swiss Government and the Swiss central bank, is intended to help satisfy old claims, but the Swiss have not settled on exactly how it will be administered.
To insure that some money is available to cover old deposits, the United States, Britain and France agreed earlier this week to freeze the distribution of $68 million in gold bars, some in storage in Manhattan, that were stolen by the Nazis from European central banks. However, competing national claims and legal tangles make it uncertain that this gold can be used to compensate Holocaust victims.
The larger issue confronting Switzerland is its overall conduct during the Nazi era. Though the country was ostensibly neutral and not a combatant in the war, there is a growing documentary record showing that Switzerland served as Germany's banker and financial outlet to the world. Overcoming the myths of national identity is not easy for any country, and it will not happen overnight in Switzerland. But squarely facing the question of the Jewish claims is the place to begin.

HEADLINE: Making the Budget Bearable

 BODY:
The basic outlines of President Clinton's budget for 1998 were largely set the moment he made election-year concessions to the Republicans to balance the budget by the year 2002, cut taxes and ax welfare spending. But now that he must live within these tight confines, Mr. Clinton has mostly made sound, compassionate decisions to mitigate the worst harshness.
His budget plan would remove the cruelest parts of the welfare law by reinstating the right of childless adults to collect food stamps if they are unemployed and unable to find work. The plan would also allow legal immigrants who become disabled after they arrive in the United States to collect cash assistance and Medicaid coverage. It would provide health coverage for many uninsured children and extend health insurance for millions of workers between jobs. 
 In education, the area he highlighted in his State of the Union address, Mr. Clinton would raise spending by a hefty $50 billion over five years. The budget would put one million children by 2002 into Head Start, the effective preschool program for low-income families. That needed move would still leave another million eligible children out of the program. Unfortunately, the bulk of Mr. Clinton's education spending would be doled out indiscriminately to families in tuition tax credits totaling about $35 billion. These will not boost college enrollment very much, and will not even leave money in the pockets of middle-class families once universities react, as they almost certainly will, by raising tuition.
By contrast, Mr. Clinton would spend less than $2 billion next year in additional funding for Pell grants, the proven way to help poor families send young people to college who could not otherwise attend. Now that the election is behind it, the Administration should not resist if some in Congress want to skip the tuition tax cuts and apply the money to tuition grants.
The President offers an important reform of Medicaid, proposing to control future spending by placing a cap on the amount of Federal spending per enrollee and allowing states to place enrollees in managed care without going through the frustrating process of begging for Washington's approval. But if Mr. Clinton's fiscal record is measured largely on the basis of what he does on Medicare, he risks a failing grade. He has proposed no long-term solution, rejecting an emerging consensus for turning Medicare into a competitive system like the one that provides a choice of health plans for every Federal employee.
Mr. Clinton's five-year plan concentrates about two-thirds of its spending cuts in the last two years, thus ducking difficult decisions. But for next year he has made mostly sensible calls. His budget would pay some of the money that the United States owes the United Nations and the World Bank for assistance to poor countries, boost money for lending institutions in urban ghettos and maintain spending on scientific research. These and other proposals look like a politically realistic basis for compromise with Congress in the year after budget parameters were set by a foolish competition to promise both a quick end to deficits and broad-scale tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Even Before Their Completion, Plans for Lilco Are Opposed

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: WESTBURY, L.I., Feb. 6

 BODY:
Even before state officials have completed their plan to cut Long Island's high electricity bills, opposition emerged today from an unusual coalition of business organizations, environmentalists and civic groups.
The critics said they feared that the plan being negotiated by the Long Island Power Authority would not make big enough cuts in electric rates, which are the highest in the continental United States. 
 The critics also doubted that the plan would foster the entry of competing energy suppliers, and they said the proposed merger of the Long Island Lighting Company with Brooklyn Union Gas would create a bigger monopoly.
And they objected to a public refinancing of the abandoned $4.5 billion Shoreham nuclear plant, calling it a bailout of Lilco stockholders. The refinancing, using tax-exempt bonds, would be the biggest factor in cutting electric rates, enabling a drop of about 12 percent. The critics contend that Lilco should absorb more of Shoreham's cost.
"We smell a rat" in the state's plan, said Gregory A. Palast, an economist advising the Hauppauge Industrial Association, representing 1,300 companies with 55,000 employees. He said his group opposed significant parts of the plan.
Another speaker, Ernie Fazio of Long Island Mid-Suffolk Business Action, said the plan "would be the biggest scam perpetrated against the people."
In reply, the Power Authority's executive director, Seth D. Hulkower, said his agency "is dedicated to promoting competition on Long Island as the way to lower rates long term."
"We are working to negotiate a good deal for ratepayers to achieve a significant rate reduction immediately," he said.
Coalition leaders left open the possibility of endorsing the final plan and said they were developing a strategy to mobilize public opinion and pressure the Power Authority, Public Service Commission and state and local legislators.
The coalition, called the Initiative for Competitive Energy, has 21 member groups. They include the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer group; the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council; Action Long Island, representing businesses with 200,000 employees; the Long Island Neighborhood Network, and the Energy Rate Reduction Council, representing 275 stores.
Richard M. Kessel, a Democratic minority member on the Power Authority, said of the coalition: "We're going to listen to their ideas and all the other interest groups and accommodate them where we can. Our goal is to get these rates down, and get them down now. I continue to believe that a LIPA takeover and Brooklyn Union merger are the best way to get the rates down."

HEADLINE: Bull Market Worried Fed In December

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unusually concerned about stock prices during their December meeting, about two weeks after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, questioned whether "irrational exuberance" had inflated valuations.
Though members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously on Dec. 17 to keep interest rates steady -- a course they continued this week at their most recent meeting -- minutes of the December meeting showed that the deliberations had been made more difficult by the long boom in stock prices to levels they called "extraordinary." 
 The meeting took place 12 days after Mr. Greenspan's comments, which touched off a sharp but fleeting skid in the stock market on the fear they were a precursor to higher interest rates.
"The behavior of the stock market," the minutes stated, "injected an additional note of uncertainty into the forecast for consumer spending and the economy more generally. The rise over recent years had been extraordinary and had brought market valuations to fairly high levels relative to earnings and dividends."
As a result, "members recognized the need to monitor with special care price movements in the stock market and asset markets more generally for their implications for consumer and other spending."
Not only was this the most extensive discussion of the stock market by the Fed since the crash of October 1987, analysts said, but it also represented a new, sustained focus on it.
"This is the first time you really get a specific sense there's a monitoring process" in place, one inclined to regard the stock market as a source of economic stimulus, said William V. Sullivan, chief money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds.
The Fed also sought to account for a lack of a consumer spending spree driven by stock-market profits. It cited rising debt burdens, tighter lending standards and insecurity over jobs as possible reasons.
But Mr. Sullivan said the Fed's focus on stock prices indicated concern that the market gains could fuel spending to the point that inflation would increase, requiring the Fed to raise interest rates.
After the minutes were released at 2 P.M. today, stock prices briefly sagged, but they then recovered, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished the day with a moderate advance.
The Open Market Committee has kept the Federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans among banks, unchanged since it cut it one-quarter point, to 5.25 percent, in January 1996 to head off a possible business downturn.
In August, after rapid economic growth during the second quarter of the year, the panel adopted a policy that leans toward credit restraint but that has not so far led to a tighter policy of higher interest rates. This week's meeting ended with no announcement of policy change, and economists and market operators assume that the bias toward tightening remains, given the increase in wages, continued low unemployment and the strong economic growth of the final months of 1996.
"Some members emphasized that it would be especially important for the committee to act promptly to counter any tendency for price inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more generally," the minutes said.
Beginning today, minutes of Fed meetings are being published at 2 P.M. two days after the subsequent meeting, an interval of about six weeks. Publication had been three days after the next meeting at 4:30 P.M., or after most American markets had closed, usually for the week.
The Fed said the change was an attempt to be more forthcoming and to give American investors the chance to respond first. Previously, because of differences in local time, some overseas investors could act first. One analyst also suggested that the Fed might be seeking to make the markets more aware of its closer focus on them.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
40-Year Variable Mortgage Returns, in Strong Market

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
In another signal of the growing strength of the New York region's housing market, lenders are resurrecting the 40-year adjustable rate mortgages that were popular among first-time home buyers during the mid-80's.
Since it began offering such loans last month, the Greater New York Savings Bank in Manhattan said the 40-year loans represented 11 percent of its loan applications. Executives of other banks also reported increased interest in recent months from borrowers seeking such long-term mortgages. 
 Bank officials said the increase has been largely driven by the rising prices in the city's housing market that have made it harder for young people to buy. At the same time, rents have risen, encouraging more people to buy.
"The last time the 40-year mortgage was popular was at the height of the real estate market in the mid-80's," said Jeanne Lutfy, senior vice president at the Greater New York Savings Bank. "The reasons people used it then are the same as why they use it today. The longer term lowers the monthly mortgage payments and extends their purchasing power."
The 40-year mortgage "gets relegated to a dusty back shelf or pulled to the forefront, depending on certain market conditions," said Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, which tracks mortgage activity. "They include high-priced home areas or times of increasing home prices or high personal debt loads, or a combination of both. Some of those conditions are being seen today."
Longer-term loans "are just one more variable some banks have chosen to offer," said Margaret S. Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services Inc., a mortgage brokerage in Manhattan. Ms. Scott said such loans are not offered by all banks, but they fill a niche "for those borrowers looking to reduce their monthly cash flow."
Ms. Lutfy said a person taking out a $200,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at the current rate of 8.81 percent would carry a monthly payment of $1,484. With a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage at 6.875 percent, a rate that would be recalculated after three years and every year thereafter, the monthly cost would be $1,314. That type of loan with a 40-year term would have monthly payments of $1,224.
The rate for adjustable loans starts out lower, but it fluctuates later. Banks are offering the 40-year term on mortgages that adjust annually by two to three percentage points after 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years, with 3 or 5 years the most popular. There is usually a 5 to 6 percent cap above that initial rate over the life of the loan. Some banks also offer more liberal income qualifying ratios.
"Combine all those factors with the extended term of these mortgages and the average borrower can get into a house sooner rather than later or buy more house," said Richard S. Kemp, regional vice president of the mortgage division of the Long Island Savings Bank in Melville, L.I.
Thirteen percent of the loans given in December by its Queens branch, which serves Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, were for 40-year adjustable rate mortgages, Mr. Kemp said. Like the other bank officers interviewed, he would not disclose the number of such loans, giving only the percentages of total mortgages.
Mr. Kemp of the Long Island Savings Bank said he knew of a couple in their late 20's with a combined annual income of $85,000 who wanted to buy a $300,000 home with 10 percent down in Kew Gardens Queens. He said with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 7.75 percent, the couple -- he is a lawyer, she works in the marketing department at a corporation -- could only qualify for a $225,000 loan.
But he said they were able to buy the house with a three-year adjustable rate loan because of the lower initial interest rate of 6.625 percent, the 40-year term and the more liberal income qualifying requirements.
Mr. Kemp said the couple were the kind who would seek such mortgages: "generally young, just starting out in their careers and they anticipate their salaries will go up." Others include corporate transferees, who do not plan to stay long, and the affluent, who are not as concerned with the fluctuations in the interest rate.
But such loans have drawbacks. With any adjustable loan, the borrowers must be diligent rate watchers, Mr. Gumbinger said. Also, the longer a loan, the greater the total payment and the longer it takes to build up equity.
"The bottom line," Mr. Gumbinger said, "is that a 40-year mortgage is a good way to get into a house, but unless borrowers are careful it could come back and bite them."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: FOREIGN AID;
$1.3 Billion Rise Would Halt Decline in Spending Abroad

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The budget proposed today by President Clinton would stop the steady decline in spending on diplomacy and foreign aid in his first term. It included an increase in aid to the independent nations of the former Soviet Union and a plan to repay the United States' debts to the United Nations and other international bodies.
The President's budget would spend nearly $19.5 billion on foreign affairs, an increase of nearly 7 percent over the $18.2 billion authorized by Congress this year. The new budget, however, represented only a modest increase over Mr. Clinton's request last year, which withered under resistance from Republicans. 
 Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that even with the proposed increase, spending on foreign affairs still fell short of the peaks of more than $21 billion in the early 1990's. In a news conference, Ms. Albright said the United States had to stop the decline in foreign affairs spending if it intended to preserve its international influence, a theme she has repeated often since assuming office last month. The budget, she said, would pay for "not the extravagant, but the essential."
In sharp contrast to the situation last year, the proposals received a relatively warm reception on Capitol Hill. Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, the Republican from upstate New York who heads the International Relations Committee, said it would be the basis for "a bipartisan consensus."
Part of the proposal, however, could face opposition. The President proposed repaying slightly more than $1 billion in back dues to the United Nations, $100 million in the coming fiscal year and $921 million the next year on the condition that the United Nations take still unspecified steps toward restructuring. He also proposed repaying over the next three years $860 million in back dues to other international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Some Republican lawmakers have resisted paying back dues without concrete steps by the United Nations to cut its budget and bureaucracy.
Most of the proposed $1.3 billion increase was for foreign aid, including $900 million for nations of the former Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Geography and Class In 2 Simpson Verdicts

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Stand on the infamous corner where the beatings and burnings of the 1992 Los Angeles riots began and ask Carl Wilson, a 27-year-old plumber who readily acknowledges that he joined the melee, why he is not moved by the verdict against O. J. Simpson.
"He's really not part of our community," Mr. Wilson responded, pausing at the intersection of Florence and Normandie Avenues in South-Central Los Angeles. After four white policemen were acquitted in the videotaped beating Rodney G. King, the city erupted, Mr. Wilson said, but this time, when another verdict went against a black man, "nobody really cares." 
 A few blocks away, at a Ralph's supermarket that was looted in the riots, Shirley Sims, a 41-year-old cashier, offered a geographical view. "This is where we live -- this is the ghetto," Ms. Sims said. "He lives in Bel Air and Brentwood, where it's all beautiful. The lawyers, those are his people. Not us."
Mr. Simpson's tribulations are seen by many across the nation as a classic "L.A. Story" of celebrity, money and race, so deeply associated with Southern Californian life that Gov. Pete Wilson declared after the verdict on Tuesday that he was "sick of California being known for little other than one Simpson trial or another." But the reaction here, after the verdict in the wrongful-death civil lawsuit against Mr. Simpson, highlights the topographical truth that his world consisted of only one corner of Los Angeles: the wealthier swath nearer the Pacific known as the West Side.
Though the racial divide over Mr. Simpson remains strong here, with blacks evincing more sympathy for him than whites, there is an additional gap at play, one that splits the second-largest American city based on class. It is the yawning distance between the West Side, where Mr. Simpson lives on charming streets where loafered lawyers lunch, and what some call the "other L.A.," where the vast majority of the metropolitan area's nine million residents spend their lives working much harder than they play.
Many compare the concentration of wealth of the West Side to the relative affluence of much of Manhattan. But the sprawl of Los Angeles isolates it even more, with some West Side residents never, ever venturing eastward into the rest of the city, especially since the riots.
"The geographical separation makes L.A. radically different from New York," said Jon Wiener, a professor of American history at the University of California at Irvine.
"The gap between the West Side and the other side of town is immense: the West Side really has no idea what the other millions of people in L.A. do every day, and O. J. is in many ways a quintessential West Sider. He lives on a fancy street in Brentwood and hangs out at the upscale restaurants and plays golf at the upscale clubs, and the only thing that is different about him is that he's a black man."
Rodney King, by contrast, has been seen by many minority groups as an Everyman victimized by the Los Angeles police. The support for Mr. Simpson after his courtroom defeat appears correspondingly tepid, and the tactical alert called by the Santa Monica police when the verdict was expected came across looking a little silly, given the low-key crowd of mountain-bikers, joggers, passers-by and a few protesters at the courthouse. The West Side does not riot.
"The one thing I've heard over and over from people in my community is, 'Let's get on with our lives," said John Mack, the president of the Los Angeles Urban League . "Given the daily survival issues that the average black person on the streets of South-Central has to contend with, this two-and-a-half-year obsession of most white Americans and many in the media is not shared by the average welfare mother whose check has been reduced and who will soon be booted off the rolls."
The demographic difference between the West Side and the rest of Los Angeles appears to have played a role in the contradictory outcomes of Mr. Simpson's two trials. In his criminal trial, the proceedings were held in downtown Los Angeles, where the mainly black jury was drawn from a heavily minority population.
But the civil trial was held in Santa Monica, among mostly white and better-heeled West Siders. The contrast between the two venues and two juries was among the starkest that could have been found in Los Angeles County, which is only 10 percent black and only 36 percent white; and neither reflected the region's demographic reality: which is predominantly middle class, 40 percent Hispanic and 11 percent Asian.
The Santa Monica jury, almost entirely white, found Mr. Simpson liable in the deaths of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman.
"The geography of the two trials dramatized the gap, the gulf," between regions and races, Mr. Wiener said. "I can understand why black people would say, 'Well, what do you expect of a trial in Santa Monica?' "
In the verdict's aftermath, again, the particular demographics of the West Side come into play. Home to a large Jewish population and known as a center of liberalism and feminism, it has been the West Side where people have seemed to applaud the verdict against Mr. Simpson most loudly.
"It was a West Side issue, and the people most excited about this I've run into are women and Jews on the West Side," said Joel Kotkin, a fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy. "Ron Goldman was like your brother. In a way it's just like Rodney King was like a brother for many African-Americans."
Mr. Kotkin, a researcher on urban economic issues, defined the West Side as encompassing nearly two million people on a swatch of land running from Malibu in the north to Torrance in the south. Statistics show that it is among the most educated and privileged pockets in the country, he said, and has been rebounding much faster from the latest recession than the rest of the region.
Others define the West Side more narrowly as the parts of Los Angeles proper that are west of Interstate 405. It is far from homogeneous and contains pockets of poverty as well as great chunks of middle-class neighborhoods, but there is little dispute about its overall status in a city where status is supreme.
Mr. Simpson's Bentley and his $3.5 million house, his plane-hopping and confessed bed-hopping all fit the image that Angelenos see as West Side, especially north of Sunset Boulevard, and that the rest of the country sees as Los Angeles, as Hollywood.
Some try to bridge the gap between West Side wealth and the rest of Los Angeles, like Michele Prichard, the director of the Liberty Hill Foundation, a Santa Monica-based group that finances community efforts to fight poverty and racial tension mainly in the inner city. But Ms. Prichard and many others say they believe that the Simpson case has deepened the very gaps it brought to light, in relations between the races, between men and women, and between the rich and the poor.
"I think it has been a polarizing course of events" in a city already polarized, she said, adding: "I don't think we're learned any positive lessons out of this in Los Angeles as a whole. This city is already very segregated, And it's been one more thing to drive a wedge between people."

HEADLINE: North Korea Agrees to Take Taiwan Atom Waste for Cash

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Facing famine and desperate for hard currency, North Korea has agreed to accept up to 200,000 barrels of nuclear waste from Taiwan, in exchange for tens of millions of dollars.
The deal has enraged South Korea, which is less than 40 miles from the reported disposal site in North Korea. As a result, the arrangement is adding new hostility to the tensions between North and South Korea. 
 South Koreans have traveled to Taiwan to protest the shipments, and a group staged a demonstration in South Korean waters on Wednesday to protest the shipping of the waste.
The idea of exporting nuclear waste has surfaced before. Japan and other countries currently send spent fuel from nuclear reactors to Europe for reprocessing, mainly to separate out the plutonium, which Japan can then try to use as a new energy source. But this is quite different from an outright export of nuclear waste.
Taiwan and North Korea do not belong to international treaties governing the disposal of nuclear waste, but experts say that if the Taiwan deal goes through as planned, then it could pave the way for other countries seeking refuge sites for their nuclear waste. "This might be a precedent for the practice of international exporting of waste," said Junizaburo Takagi, a nuclear chemist and executive director at Citizen's Nuclear Information Center.
Japan has reportedly considered the possibility of paying the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific, in exchange for storing waste there. Some residents of the Marshall Islands objected, and Japan quickly dropped the idea. The waste reportedly is mostly low-level garbage, like old gloves or clothing that have been used in the presence of radioactive material.
The United States has said that since the waste material contains no uranium or plutonium, the deal does not seem to raise any concerns about proliferation.
Still, the South Korean Government has been playing diplomatic hardball on the issue, threatening to refuse Taiwan the recognition it seeks in international organizations. And South Korea has also suggested that it will be less likely to arrange aid for North Korea if the North goes ahead with the deal.
The main concern of South Korean officials seem to be safety. They assert that North Korea does not have the proper installations to store the nuclear waste safely. The nuclear wastes, which would apparently be disposed of in an area with old coal mines close to the demilitarized zone that separates the North and the South, could leach into the ground water and harm the environment in South Korea as well.
Some officials quietly add that North Korea may collapse soon, and then South Korea will inherit responsibility for a nuclear garbage heap.
In any case, Seoul argues, Taiwan's move threatens to break an international practice of disposing of one's own nuclear waste at home.
"It could have a great environmental effect on the Korean Peninsula," said Lee Kyu Hyung, the South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman. "This is like dumping waste. And dumping waste is prohibited by international practice."
According to reports in Taiwan about the deal, which was signed with North Korea by Taiwan's state-run power utility, the island is expected to begin shipments of low-level radioactive waste within a month. In exchange, it will reportedly pay about $1,135 per barrel, with an initial shipment of 60,000 barrels.
Taiwan then apparently has an option to turn over another 140,000 barrels of waste, which would amount to a total cash payment of about $227 million to North Korea.
Foreign Ministry officials in Taiwan would not comment on details of the transaction. North Korea officials were not available for comment.
In fact, the current deal solves pressing problems in both countries. North Korea is desperately in need of cash. Its economy is in shambles, and repeated bad harvests have left the nation's 23 million people on the verge of starvation, by some accounts.
Likewise, in Taiwan, a bitter debate has been growing over where to dispose of nuclear waste. Taiwan Power Company, the state-run utility, has run into opposition from communities near its proposed disposal sites.
Several months ago, North Korean officials approached Taiwan officials to discuss the possibility of selling access to disposal sites in North Korea, according to Taiwan news reports.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Presents '98 Budget, and a Goal

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton today proposed a $1.69 trillion budget for 1998 that he said would cut taxes on the middle class, increase spending on education and health care and lead to an end to deficits by 2002 -- and for almost 20 years after that.
The Administration said it would achieve its deficit-reduction goals over the next five years with a $350 billion bundle of program cuts and tax increases, including slowing the growth of Medicare and extending some taxes, like those on airline tickets, that are set to expire. 
 Indicating that he was ready to compromise even as he unveiled his proposal, Mr. Clinton argued that the progress of his Administration and Congress in cutting the deficit so far, together with the politics of the hour, presented "the best chance in a generation" to balance the budget.
"Some of the differences we have are truly principled differences," the President said at a midday briefing with reporters, "and we'll have to work hard to have an honorable compromise. But I believe that we can do it as long as the Republicans and the Democrats agree that we have to achieve this goal."
Citing its economic projections, the Administration held out the prospect of balanced budgets until the year 2020.
"We believe we can keep this budget in balance for a good long time," Mr. Clinton said.
But there is no guarantee that today's deficit-cutting zeal will extend to future administrations or Congresses -- or even endure the current ones. In a sign of how politically sensitive even small budget cuts can be, Administration officials today were at pains to avoid talking much about what Mr. Clinton called his budget's "detailed, difficult cuts in hundreds of Government programs."
The most important words about the budget were probably ones unsaid, with both the Administration and the Republicans starting the year with the attitude that they can strike a deal on balancing the budget. [News analysis, page A24.]
Republican Congressional leaders reacted frostily to the proposal, the formal start of a months-long negotiating process. But they did not dismiss it out of hand, as in years past.
"I suppose that you could say it's alive, but it's definitely not kicking," said Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican who is majority leader. Still, he said, negotiations could produce a balanced-budget agreement "within six weeks or so."
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee, called the proposal "a very good starting point."
But some derided the proposal almost instantly. Representative Tom DeLay, the Texas Republican who is the majority whip, said: "The Administration has embarked on a journey to Shangri-La, a mythical place where spending goes up, where the future is of no consequence, where the world is at peace and where budgets magically balance with a wave of the hand."
It is true that Franklin D. Raines, Mr. Clinton's budget director, wore a tie today that showed rabbits leaping out of hats, but Mr. Raines said he chose it only because it was red.
In fact, the two sides have already taken significant steps toward each other. The stark differences between them of two years ago -- like whether the Departments of Education and Commerce should exist -- boiled away after the two Government shutdowns over budget negotiations in 1995 and 1996. Mr. Clinton turned those fights to his advantage last year in his campaign by presenting himself as a bulwark against proposed Republican cuts in Medicare and other popular programs.
For his part, by declaring in December of 1995 that he would seek a balanced budget by 2002, Mr. Clinton was able to inoculate himself against accusations of being a big spender. But he also committed himself to achieving what was originally a Republican goal.
Still, much distance remains between Mr. Clinton and the Republican Congress. For example, Republicans have long sought a deep cut in the capital gains rate, the tax on profits from investments. Mr. Clinton's budget proposal does contain such a cut -- but one that is narrowly drawn, affecting only the profit from the sale of homes.
While the Administration projected a $17 billion surplus in 2002 with its plan, Republican Congressmen predicted a $50 billion deficit. In all, the budget proposal for 1998 amounts to a 3.5 percent increase over this year's projected Federal spending of $1.63 trillion.
Administration officials defended their projections as conservative, pointing out that they underestimated their progress against the deficit throughout Mr. Clinton's first term.
The budget proposal assumes steady economic growth over the next five years. Mr. Raines acknowledged that a recession would force the Administration, or its successor, to push back the deadline for balancing the budget. But if deficits loom, the Administration has incorporated a provision to automatically phase out $22 billion in tax cuts and to apply an across-the-board reduction in spending of 2.25 percent, excepting only Social Security.
Administration officials repeatedly stressed today that, as Mr. Raines put it, "we have already done much of the hard work necessary to balance the budget by 2002," pointing to the drop in the deficit from $290 billion in 1992 to $107 billion in 1996.
Still, whoever succeeds Mr. Clinton, if his plan is enacted, would have to grapple with the effects of deep reductions in Federal spending, compared with today. More than three-quarters of the deficit reduction the President is proposing would bite in the years 2001 and 2002, after his term. Some of his proposed programs, such as to provide money to help renovate schools, would simply cease to exist in 2002.
And to balance the budget in 2002, the Clinton Administration is counting quite literally on pennies from heaven, $22 billion that year alone from the auction of rights to broadcast frequencies whose value is hard to predict today.
One politician who hopes to occupy the White House then, Vice President Al Gore, was standing expressionless behind Mr. Clinton's right shoulder as he made his presentation today. Compared with Mr. Clinton's more conversational remarks, Mr. Gore followed with what sounded like a stump speech.
"We all know that the Government of yesterday cannot meet the challenges of tomorrow," he declared. Mr. Gore detailed the Administration's efforts to reduce the size of the bureaucracy without explicitly noting that he led them, saying, "We can balance the budget by 2002 because we're creating a Government that is fit for the new century."
Most of the proposals in the four-volume budget released today were sketched out by Mr. Clinton in the campaign, and again in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night. But in many cases he had not attached price tags to them.
Mr. Clinton is asking Congress for $21 billion over five years to restore benefits for legal immigrants, to reverse cuts in the food stamp program and to create jobs for welfare recipients. He is also requesting $2.8 billion next year, and $18 billion by 2002, to provide care to half of the 10 million American children who have no health insurance, and to finance medical care for several million people between jobs.
The President also hopes to spend nearly $19.5 billion next year on foreign affairs, a nearly 7 percent rise over the $18.2 billion authorized by Congress this year. He proposed to start paying off slightly more than $1 billion the United States owes the United Nations, starting with a $100 million payment in 1998.
Among his more expensive proposals, Mr. Clinton is seeking a 20 percent increase in spending on education and training, to $51 billion. He is proposing a combination of tax credits and deductions to help pay college tuitions.
Mr. Clinton hopes to cut taxes by $98 billion over the next five years. But his cuts are mostly paid for with $76 billion in new tax measures. He is seeking to raise $10.9 billion through "user fees" for everything from meat inspections to applying for permits to dredge wetlands. And he hopes to close certain loopholes benefiting corporations and investors.
But Administration officials caviled at the suggestion that such changes represented tax increases. "I don't know if I would call them a tax increase," said Robert E. Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury. "What I would call them is an elimination of loopholes and unwarranted subsidies."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Urges Moratorium On Revenge

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Confessing that the partisan slights and squabbles of Washington had sometimes made his heart "a little harder," President Clinton urged politicians at a prayer breakfast today to "rid ourselves of this toxic atmosphere of cynicism," forswear efforts to "get even" and instead work together for the common good.
"We're in a world of hurt, we need help, we are in the breach, we are in the hole here," Mr. Clinton told several thousand politicians and community leaders at the annual National Prayer Breakfast at the Washington Hilton. Later, speaking to the same group, his wife, Hillary, lamented her own shortcomings and reflected, "We have, in our country, spent a lot of time in the last several years demonizing people with whom we do not agree politically." 
 Since taking office, Mr. Clinton has used the occasion of the breakfast, sponsored by Congressional prayer groups, to condemn hateful speech, call for more humility in politics and reflect on man's flawed place in a fallen world. Today, he took as his text a passage from Isaiah that he first cited in his inaugural address last month, exhorting the faithful to be "repairers of the breach" and asking the bipartisan group, which included Speaker Newt Gingrich, to help educate the poor, find jobs for welfare recipients and aid the needy in strife-torn countries.
But the President, whose speeches often echo a preacher's cadences, saved his harshest comments for himself, other politicians and the reporters who cover them.
"This town is gripped with people who are self-righteous, sanctimonious and hypocritical," he said. "All of us are that way sometimes. I plead guilty from time to time."
Indeed, Mr. Clinton has often been accused of just such vices, and for four years, he and Mrs. Clinton have been the targets not only of intense political and policy criticism but also of several investigations into their personal and political finances. They would be prominent beneficiaries of any moratorium on blame and revenge in the capital.
Later today, Mrs. Clinton picked up the theme, recounting a parable of a man, whom she did not identify, who approached her on Wednesday night at a dinner sponsored by the prayer group.
"I had a man say to me, 'Mrs. Clinton, I want your forgiveness because for the last four years I have worked very hard to destroy you,' " Mrs. Clinton said. "And I said to him, 'You know, I very much appreciate your saying this, and I certainly will remember forever that you have, and, of course, I forgive you.' "
Mrs. Clinton added that only when she got home did the man's full meaning sink in.
She said, "What I should have said is, 'I don't know you and I don't know anything about you, but I want you to forgive me also, because I am sure that in my moments of frustration and anger I have said terrible things about people like you -- and I have thought even worse."
In his own remarks, Mr. Clinton at one point talked in terms that at first seemed self-pitying but soon turned self-critical, recalling how, early in his term, he got "so mad at our friends in Congress and the Republican Party because they were real mean to me over something."
Later, he said, an old Washingtonian had told him it was "payback time" for years of acrimonious dealings between Republican Presidents and Democratic Congresses.
"Pretty soon, I was behaving that way," Mr. Clinton said. "I'd wake up in the morning and my heart was getting a little harder: Now, who can I get even with? This happens to you, doesn't it? Who can I get even with? And sometimes, you can't get even with the person that really did it to you, so you just go find somebody else, because you've got to get even with somebody. Pretty soon, everybody's involved in this great act."
Mr. Clinton said politicians had "now become just as cynical about the press" as he said the press was about them. He said, "Cynicism and all this negative stuff is just sort of a cheap excuse for not doing your best with your life, and it's not a very pleasant way to live, frankly -- not even any fun.
"I try to tell everybody around the White House all the time, I have concluded a few things in my life," Mr. Clinton added. "And one of them is that you don't ever get even. The harder you try, the more frustrated you're going to be, because nobody ever gets even."
Since his re-election, Mr. Clinton has called over and over for a spirit of renewed cooperation and bipartisanship, interpreting that as the will of a divided electorate that gave Democrats the White House and Republicans control of Congress. Today he thanked Mr. Gingrich for cooperating on a fiscal rescue package for Mexico two years ago.
Later, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, was asked how Mr. Clinton thought the Republicans had been "mean" to him, and Mr. McCurry replied, "He was talking about a period in which there was a fair amount of partisan rancor," for example, when Mr. Clinton won no Republican votes in 1993 for his economic plan.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: CORPORATE TAXES;
Encore for a '96 Proposal To Raise Business Taxes

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is looking to Wall Street and corporate America to help underwrite its proposals to cut middle-class taxes and finance higher education, a strategy that met with little success last year.
Undeterred by failures to enact many of the same provisions, the Administration issued today a lengthy list of changes in tax and accounting law intended to raise $34.3 billion over five years and to end what the Administration called abuses of the tax code by business and wealthy individuals. 
 The proposal would increase taxes on multinational corporations, end the favored tax treatment of extra-long-term bonds and raise capital-gains taxes by changing the rules for computing the cost basis of securities when they are sold at a profit.
In soak-the-rich language seen nowhere else in the otherwise conciliatory budget submission, the Administration said the plan to increase taxes "cuts unwarranted corporate-tax subsidies, closes tax loopholes, improves tax compliance and adopts other revenue measures."
Wall Street revolted over those proposals last year, and the Republican chairmen of the tax-writing committees in Congress sided with their corporate constituents. The proposals never went to a vote.
This year, however, the Administration apparently hopes that Mr. Clinton's stronger political position and a new, if temporary, bipartisanship will allow the provisions to be considered on their merits.
The tax law now "costs the Federal Treasury revenue and makes the economy less efficient," a senior Treasury Department official who insisted on anonymity said today. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, said in an interview that he would carefully review the proposed increases. "When we feel there is abuse, we will take action," Mr. Roth said.
The largest of 36 proposals, and the only major one not carried over from last year, would change the taxation of foreign sales of multinational corporations. The law now allows American companies that do business overseas to assume for tax purposes that half their income from foreign sales is generated overseas, even if the products are wholly made in the United States. That lets companies take advantage of tax differences between the United States and other countries.
The Administration proposes to tax foreign sales based on the site of activity, which in most cases would increase exporters' United States taxes. The Administration said it expected to to generate an additional $7.9 billion in corporate taxes from the change over the next five years.
Industry is expected to fight the change, as it did when it was proposed in the tax package of 1986, said Harvey B. Morgenson, an international tax specialist at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.
"This is the sacred cow that was spared in 1986," Mr. Morgenson said. "It's very easy to attack from a technical point of view, but it's very important to U.S. multinationals and exporters. It'll be down and dirty in the trenches when it comes to enacting it."
The Administration also proposed, as it did last year, to force taxpayers to use the average purchase price of a bundle of stocks bought at different times when computing capital gains. Current law allows taxpayers to choose among three methods to compute the cost basis of stocks, in many cases lowering taxes. Officials estimated that the change would bring in an additional $600 million a year.
The budget also attacks several maneuvers intended to delay or avoid taxes on the sales of securities like "short sales against the box" and various asset swaps.
Although unknown to most Americans, they are popular with corporate treasurers and wealthy individuals. None are projected to yield big dividends for the Treasury.
The proposed ban on certain short sales, for instance, would generate $300 million from 1998 to 2002.
The budget plan also tries to clarify a long-standing dispute over the distinction between debt and equity, which the tax code treats differently but which have become increasingly blurred with the large volumes of bonds with maturities of more than 40 years and zero-coupon convertible debt. If the proposals are adopted, the law would treat those products as equities, rather than bonds, eliminating favorable tax treatment.
The proposal would also limit the deductibility of loan interest in direct proportion to a company's holdings of tax-free municipal securities.
The executive vice president of the Bond Market Trade Association, Micah S. Green, said, "They will simply increase the cost of capital to corporations around the country and make it more expensive for local governments to raise money."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: HEALTH CARE;
President Moves to Protect Half of Uninsured Children

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton moved today to provide health care coverage to half of the 10 million American children who have no health insurance, and proposed a new program to finance medical care for several million people between jobs.
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said these initiatives would cost $2.8 billion next year and $18.4 billion over the five-year period from 1998 through 2002. 
 Mr. Clinton would cover half of the cost by curbing the growth of Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for the poor. Over strenuous objections by governors of both parties, he proposes to set firm annual limits on Federal Medicaid spending, which is not subject to any such limit now.
"Even though the growth in Medicaid spending has fallen in recent years," Mr. Clinton said, "aggregate Medicaid spending still will grow at an average annual rate of 7.2 percent from 1997 to 2002. To insure that Medicaid's explosive growth of the 1980's and early 1990's does not resume, the budget would set a per-capita cap on Medicaid spending."
The President would not set any limits on state Medicaid spending, and governors fear that they wouldhave to pay costs incurred after the Federal Government reaches its limit, which would be tied to the nation's economic output.
In contrast to his 1993 plan to redesign the nation's health care system from top to bottom, Mr. Clinton now proposes a series of incremental changes to expand health insurance coverage step by step.
The President's proposals do not go as far as some members of Congress want. Under separate proposals offered by the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, the Federal Government would help pay health insurance premiums for working families with low and moderate incomes above the official poverty level (now $12,517 a year for a family of three).
Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, said tonight: "The President's proposal is a step in the right direction. But it still leaves millions of children without health insurance, particularly in working families." Mrs. Edelman said she hoped that Congress would build on the proposal and pass bipartisan legislation to cover all 10 million uninsured children.
Mr. Clinton said one million children could receive insurance coverage under his proposal to give Federal grants to the states for "innovative programs," to be designed by state officials working with health care providers and employers. The grants would total $750 million next year and $3.8 billion from then through 2002.
Mr. Clinton also wants states to make aggressive efforts to locate some of the three million children who are already eligible for Medicaid but are not yet enrolled. The Administration estimates that such efforts will find about half the eligible children, providing Medicaid to 1.6 million.
Under another proposal, Mr. Clinton would allow states to guarantee Medicaid coverage to children for one year at a time, rather than requiring them to re-certify eligibility every six months. This proposal would reduce paperwork and encourage health maintenance organizations to invest in children, knowing that the children would be enrolled at least a year.
The President said this proposal would help one million children keep Medicaid coverage that they might otherwise lose because of fluctuations in family income.
In addition to all these steps, Mr. Clinton estimated that one million children would become eligible for Medicaid over the next five years under provisions of current law.
Mr. Clinton said his proposal for workers between jobs would finance as much as six months of coverage for them. It would assist 3.2 million families, including 700,000 children, at a cost of $1.7 billion next year. The cost is estimated at $9.8 billion for the period from 1998 through 2002.
The President announced his major proposals on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, two weeks ago, and he provided additional details today. The proposals are intended to save $100 billion over five years, mainly by curbing payments to hospitals, doctors and H.M.O.'s.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposals, the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills would remain solvent through 2007. Under current law, the trust fund will run out of money in 2001 if Congress takes no action.
As for H.M.O.'s, Mr. Clinton said there was "substantial evidence that Medicare pays too much for managed care plans and, in fact, loses money" whenever beneficiaries enroll in such plans. Since H.M.O. enrollment is increasing rapidly, these losses may become a major expense for Medicare, even though many experts see managed care as a way to control the program's costs in the long run.
Medicare now pays H.M.O.'s 95 percent of the average cost that it pays for beneficiaries in the standard fee-for-service program. But Federal officials say elderly people who voluntarily enroll in H.M.O.'s are on average healthier than those in the standard program. Were these healthier people in the fee-for-service program, officials say, they would be costing the Government less than they do now. Mr. Clinton would pay H.M.O.'s only 90 percent of the standard program's average cost.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET: THE NEGOTIATIONS;
Between Budget Line Items, Horse Trades in Invisible Ink

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Long before the Clinton Administration sent its budget tables, its pie charts and its five-year projections to the printers, it was already hinting at answers to the one question that dominates budget debates in Washington: where is the deal?
The first part of any deal, Mr. Clinton's budget aides told Congressional Democrats earlier this week, probably lies in the one concession Republicans say they want most in life: a cut in capital gains taxes, presumably one that could benefit the millions who have reaped big paper profits in the stock market. 
 "They have already told us to be ready to have a capital gains proposal or to respond to one," Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said today. "That should tell you something."
Part two of any meaningful deal, both Democrats and Republicans say, is finding a way to change the Government's calculation of inflation, which would greatly slow increases in the Government's Social Security payments and other entitlements linked to inflation.
But unlike most budget problems, that is not a battle between parties. Instead, it is a problem, as one of Mr. Clinton's top advisers said recently, "of finding a way to do this that allows everyone to deny paternity" for the idea, which already has Social Security recipients and other powerful interest groups screaming.
Solving those two problems, of course, is hardly the end of the battle. Mr. Clinton's chief budget negotiators -- the White House chief of staff Erskine B. Bowles, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the budget director, Franklin D. Raines -- will spend the next few months wrangling over the Administration's proposal to restore money for welfare programs and commit new funds to rebuilding schools. There are still major arguments ahead over how to reduce the costs of Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, and over Mr. Clinton's insistence that discretionary spending must rise and that military spending, at least in the short term, must shrink.
But those are increasingly arguments around the margins. What is perhaps most striking about the statistics this year is not how much the Republicans and Democrats disagree, but on how much they agree.
Consider this: the budget the Democrats say would be balanced in 2002 is the same budget that the Republicans, using different economic assumptions, say would run a $60 billion deficit. Sixty billion dollars, of course, is a lot of money by anyone's measure, and no politician can risk sounding cavalier about it. But it is also roughly 3 percent of the Federal budget that year, and one half of 1 percent of the overall economy.
And the number itself could be a total fiction: the Congressional Budget Office, in estimates published just 14 months ago, predicted the fiscal 1996 budget deficit would be $173 billion. In reality, it came in at only $107 billion -- $66 billion less than estimated -- because of a surge of unpredicted revenue.
"We are down to the point where we are arguing over insignificant figures that no one could accurately project a year ahead, much less five years ahead," said Stanley E. Collender, the managing director of Burson-Marsteller's Federal Budget Consulting Group.
In fact, some economists say there is reason to wonder whether the whole argument about balancing the budget is still worth the enormous expenditure of political energy on all sides. They point out that this year, the United States has the lowest budget deficit, as a percentage of gross national product, of any of the world's seven largest industrialized nations -- lower than Japan's, lower than Germany's. Yet only in Washington is it a subject of daily preoccupation.
"Balancing the budget, the actual precision of reaching balance, has become as much an issue of public trust as it has one of economics," acknowledged Gene Sperling, the new chairman of the National Economic Council. Indeed, in budget politics, symbolism is often more important than the numbers. And that is certainly true when it comes to fashioning a compromise.
So in the selling of the fiscal 1998 budget, capital gains taxes are the first symbol. Mr. Clinton made the first move, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, when he proposed eliminating virtually all capital gains taxes on the sale of a home.
"That opens the door for us to talk about it," Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the other day. Today Senator Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, added: "I think we just have to start with the proposition that this is the time to change the capital gains permanently, not just for houses but for assets held for business purposes and equities."
The Republicans have something grander in mind, however, than do the Democrats. They have called for halving the 28 percent tax on capital gains, which hits most investors when they sell winning stocks and mutual funds. It is highly unlikely such a sharp cut would happen, but there are occasional hints that the tax rate could eventually fall to, say, 20 percent or 21 percent.
On the record, Clinton Administration officials say this is bad economics, and they would not trade a capital gains cut for winning new funds for education, one of Mr. Clinton's big new priorities. Speaking not for attribution, however, they say that a capital gains cut is an issue they have to take seriously.
Recalculating the consumer price index is a different kind of problem altogether. Both sides concede it must be done, both because they believe inflation rates are significantly overstated, and because they know that correcting the statistics would save billions of dollars in Social Security payments and in other programs in which benefits are guaranteed to all who meet eligibility criteria. "This is where the real money is," a leading Democrat said the other day.
But neither side can figure out how to cast this change as a statistical fix, rather than a midnight maneuver to balance the budget on the backs of the elderly.
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the budget master of the House Republicans, said today that the inflation measure "ought to be changed," adding, "But we can't go and change it on our own because the President -- we risk the possibility that our political enemies will not only not change it, but then they'll scare people again."
Those are problems of spin, not differences of ideology. But that may be what the next six months of budget arguments are chiefly about. The two sides have almost reached a statistical middle ground; now the question, as one Senator said, "is whether we can give each other the political cover to stand there."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 BUDGET;
Clinton's Budget Holds Few Clues on Exactly How to Lower Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to lower Government spending over the next five years by $252 billion, even as he increases spending -- sometimes dramatically -- on some of Government's most popular programs, from welfare to education to the environment to tax relief.
So how does he do that? 
 The budget Mr. Clinton released today offers some answers but not with great clarity. Sometimes it postpones a reply for years.
The White House would get some of its savings by reining in Medicare, the second-biggest Federal benefit after Social Security, shaving $100 billion over five years. But some of that is illusory; Medicare is cut in part by shifting some expenses to the general treasury.
The budget also saves $22 billion by applying a new spending formula to Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor. But $13 billion of that savings would be reapplied to other programs like health care for children, leaving $9 billion for deficit reduction. Military spending would fall by almost $80 billion from current projections, perhaps the single biggest cut, barring any new wars or peacekeeping duties.
But the handful of larger, highly visible cuts do not begin to offset the costs of expanded programs and wiping out the deficit. Mr. Clinton appears to get the rest from increases in Federal fees, better management, one-time sales of Government assets like the broadcast spectrum and unnamed cuts years from now.
And so, in the bowels of the 2,000 and more pages of tables and numbers handed out today, the White House says it would raise $700 million next year by auctioning off the rights to toll-free "888" telephone numbers, and $118 million by "increased attention to integrity activities in state unemployment insurance operations," in other words, cutting waste, fraud and abuse.
It would collect $350 million over the next five years by raising the fee companies pay when they submit merger proposals to antitrust experts for Federal approval. And it would scrape up $13 million, in $3-and-$4 million-a-year increments, with a "test employment strategy for the disabled" at the Social Security Administration.
The savings and profits in those and other "mandatory" programs -- benefits like Medicare, and other activities whose spending is determined mostly by fixed formulas -- total almost $159 billion. Mr. Clinton would spend $37.5 billion of that on new mandatory programs like child health care, leaving about $121 billion for deficit-cutting.
The remainder comes from changes in military spending and the other so-called discretionary programs, like roads and schools, whose budgets are set each year by Congress. And it is there that the Administration's intentions are least clear.
The budget trumpets its new programs. With contracts about to expire for 1.8 million housing units for the poor, elderly and disabled, Mr. Clinton seeks $24.8 billion next year for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an increase of almost 30 percent.
Education and job-training spending would jump by almost 12 percent in 1998 alone, to $36.2 billion. The Environmental Protection Agency would reap a 12 percent increase over the shrunken budget that the Republican Congress approved for this year. Energy conservation spending would rise by one-quarter. Spending on Indian health and housing programs would rise by 6 percent.
And the Justice Department, whose budget has already swelled by 69 percent under Mr. Clinton, would get another 5 percent increase next year, to $19.3 billion. Much of that would go to programs to reduce juvenile crime.
All of those increases, and billions of dollars worth of others, must be balanced by cuts elsewhere in the budget for domestic discretionary spending, which is walled off from the military and mandatory budgets. But spending cuts are harder to find.
Mr. Clinton plans to shave his previously planned spending on nonmilitary discretionary programs by $58 billion. Of those cuts, about $600 million -- or about 1 percent -- would be made in the fiscal 1998 budget submitted today. Barely 6 percent would occur in fiscal 1999.
The new budget only hints at those proposed cuts in the 1,000-page book that outlines the 1998 spending plan. The remaining 93 percent of domestic spending reductions are left to future Congresses, and in some cases a future President.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;
Easing Food Stamp Rules

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The State Department of Human Services will ask for a waiver of job requirements for some food stamp recipients in an effort to help people living in places with high unemployment rates, officials said yesterday. The new Federal welfare law requires people who apply for food stamps to have held a job or been enrolled in a training program for at least three months of the three previous years. In November, the state received a waiver of the work requirement for 15,000 food-stamp recipients living in 24 areas where unemployment exceeded 10 percent. If the new waiver is approved, an additional 5,000 people would benefit, John McKeegan, a department spokesman, said.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Rise on Release of Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Investors who have kept to the sidelines of the bond market this week returned en masse yesterday after the Labor Department released employment figures that indicated that growth in wages was slow.
The 30-year Treasury bond gained 20/32 , to a price of 9712/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, slipped to 6.70 percent, from 6.75 percent on Thursday. For investors, the gain was about $6 for each bond with a face value of $1,000. 
 While last month's gain of 271,000 new jobs exceeded most analyst forecasts and was higher than last year's average monthly gain of about 214,000 jobs, Labor Department officials cautioned that the gain in new jobs might have been partly exaggerated by seasonal statistical adjustments.
The report suggested that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady, as it did this week when the Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy, met in its first session of the year.
"Given that the size of the seasonal-factor handicap was so large," Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "the credit market was truly amazed to see how close the number came in relative to the consensus figures of approximately 256,000.
"Moreover, this is the first time in a long time that we have received an employment report that provided such a uniform and consistent message of growth moderation," Mr. Chan said.
Mr. Chan said that this message had been confirmed by the big declines in workweeks in the economy as a whole and in the manufacturing sector particularly, as well as by the meager increase in the average hourly-earnings data and by a slight increase in the unemployment rate.
Mr. Chan said that the data released yesterday would please Federal Reserve policy makers. The unemployment rate rose a notch, to 5.4 percent in January from 5.3 percent in December, the Labor Department said, and average hourly pay for non-supervisory workers rose just 1 cent, to $12.06, compared with a 15-cent gain during the previous two months.
"The smaller-than-expected monthly rise in wages does add more support for Mr. Greenspan's moderate stance on policy," Mr. Chan said, "and should further enhance stature among any of the other F.O.M.C. members that may have hoped for an immediate hike in rates."
Based on all the economic data available from January, Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, predicted that overall real growth in the first quarter's gross domestic product should slow to about half the 4.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 1996.
Yesterday's run-up in prices was momentarily interrupted in the afternoon following comments by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. Speaking at a news conference in advance of the meeting today of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven major industrial nations, Mr. Rubin said: "We believe we should have a strong dollar. And we've had a strong dollar for some time now."
When pressed to elaborate on whether that suggested a policy change, Mr. Rubin said he would not elaborate further.
Mr. Chan thought that investors sold bonds on the belief that Mr. Rubin's endorsement of the dollar ahead of the Group of Seven meeting was somewhat less robust than his prior statements. The comments, Mr. Chan said, also gave the impression that Mr. Rubin's stance could change if pressed by representatives of the other member nations. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more valuable to foreign investors.
Next week, the Treasury's quarterly refunding gets under way, with the sale of nearly $40 billion in new 3-year and 10-year notes and a new 30-year bond. In when-issued trading ahead of the auctions, the 3-year issue was offered at a price to yield 5.98 percent; the 10-year at a price to yield 6.36 percent, and the 30-year bond, 6.64 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Higher as Dow Gains 82.74

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
A fickle stock market soared, sputtered, and then soared again yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending sharply higher. The session showed once again how jittery the market can be in reaction to a news headline.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 82.74 points, or 1.22 percent, to close at 6,855.80, just 28 points shy of the closing high it set on Jan. 21. For the week, the Dow was up 42.71 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Broader market indexes fared even better. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.41 points, to 789.56, a new high. And the Nasdaq composite index was up 11.31 points, to 1,357.71, after technology issues rebounded from a weeklong decline.
 "If there's one word I'd use to describe this market it's resilience," said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "It's really tough to push this market down," he added, noting that strong cash flow and a benign bond market have helped bolster equities.
 While the January increase of 271,000 jobs in nonfarm payrolls was a little more than expected, the fact that average hourly wages rose by only one-tenth of 1 percent was taken by investors as a sign that inflationary pressures remain under control.
 In the afternoon, though, news that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin may have eased his support of the dollar on the eve of today's Group of Seven meeting in Berlin caused the dollar to fall. That, in turn, fed downturns in the bond and stock markets.
 Though the dollar has risen nearly 14 percent against the Japanese yen in the last six months and 12.6 percent against the German mark, analysts said that a declining dollar could drive some foreign investors out of the bond market.
"Over the past year, foreign participation has had a tremendous impact on the bond market," said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "That has helped to keep yields at this level. If that currency dynamic were to shift, you'd see tremendous selling."
 The markets turned downward yesterday, after Mr. Rubin's remarks, but stocks and bonds quickly recovered. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.70 percent.
In stocks, blue-chip issues again fueled the rally. Of the Dow 30 component stocks, 14 gained at least one point, led by American Express, I.B.M., Boeing and Procter & Gamble.
 American Express rose 3 3/8 a share, to 65 3/8. I.B.M., after a five-day decline, gained 2 3/4, to 148 3/4. Boeing was up 3, to 109 1/2, and P.& G. rose 2 5/8, to 122 1/4.
 Technology stocks shrugged off a weeklong decline with a strong finish. Intel, Microsoft, Dell Computer, Gateway 2000 and other computer stocks soared. Intel was up 3 7/16 a share, to 156 3/8; Microsoft gained 3 1/4, to 100 3/8; Dell rose 2 5/8, to 65 3/4, and Gateway advanced 3 1/2, to 60 3/4.
 Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 1,643 to 944, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. But some analysts said that the rallies were still powered by a small group of blue chips.
 "It seems every time you see a rally, fewer and fewer players participate," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "Your big, high-priced stocks are making your big moves here. It's a one-sided advance."

HEADLINE: Other Carriers Preparing for A Strike Threat At American

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
A strike by the pilots of American Airlines threatened to begin next Saturday is by no means a sure thing. Still, airlines, passengers, cruise ships and other industries heavily dependent on air travel are not taking any chances.
Some passengers appear to be booking flights on more than one airline, airlines and travel agents said. And cruise ships have already moved thousands of passengers from American to other carriers. 
 In an effort to minimize double-booking, two days ago Delta Air Lines took the rare step of making its expensive full-fare tickets nonrefundable and requiring that customers pay for them within 24 hours of making reservations, rather than at the airport just before takeoff.
So far Delta's restriction is limited to travel from Feb. 15 through Feb. 18, the busy Washington's Birthday holiday weekend, which includes the start of the threatened strike. It is also limited to 13 cities where Delta competes heavily with American, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth and flights to and from San Juan, P.R., and St. Thomas and St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.
The AMR Corporation, American's parent, said that in the event of a strike it would shut down both American and American Eagle, its commuter carrier. American recently calculated that the economic cost to the nation of a 60-day strike ran to nearly $5 billion. American itself could lose as much as $50 million a day in revenue.
"A lot of people are concerned about the strike," said Norman Sherlock, executive director of the National Business Travel Association, "and many of them are already booking away from American."
Northwest Airlines, which competes with American on only a small percentage of its routes, said it had seen a surge in bookings between the Midwest and Florida from what appear to be American passengers.
Rosenbluth International, the worldwide travel agency that specializes in business clients, has been getting in touch with customers to discuss available options, and is changing travel plans for those who request it. In addition, "Agents down on our reservations floor are starting to get questions and requests from travelers to look at alternatives," said Liz Joseph, a spokeswoman at Rosenbluth's headquarters in Philadelphia.
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines has already changed bookings for more than 8,000 passengers who had been scheduled to fly American to or from its home port in Miami next weekend, and Princess Cruises, a unit of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, has switched more than 5,000 passengers.
"We have seen some erosion, but it's not a large number," said Tim Smith, an American Airlines spokesman. "We've seen more double-booking than booking away from us."
Helping to minimize defections, apparently, is the fact that this has been a busier than usual first five weeks of the year, according to the Air Transport Association, with the percentage of seats occupied by paying passengers as much as 12 percentage points higher than the usual January and February numbers.
While double-booking is perfectly legal, the practice is uniformly detested by airlines because it often results in large numbers of no-shows -- that is, seats that fly empty.
"We decided to put the restrictions on when we saw an unusually high volume of walk-up fares for February," said Bill Berry, a spokesman for Delta. "We knew then we had to do something to protect us from the speculative passengers who might be a no-show or who would pre-empt our loyal business travelers."
Normally, only discounted tickets, used by the vast majority of leisure travelers, require advance purchase and are nonrefundable.
Because of its improved capability to monitor and detect unusual booking patterns across its entire system, Delta has identified many potential "questionable" passengers, from double-bookers to passengers who may have never flown with Delta or who have never flown at full fare.
It can also identify travel agents or large groups that suddenly show up in its computers, or travel agents who are booking Delta flights for the first time.
The carrier is already getting in touch with many such passengers to inquire diplomatically about their travel plans -- and to suggest that they would be doing other passengers a big favor if they would relinquish any extra bookings.
While airlines can require such passengers to buy tickets within a certain time or risk cancellation, that approach requires a balance of toughness and tact because fair-weather fliers are also potential frequent fliers.
Representatives of other airlines said that they were considering following suit. One even said that if an unusual surge in potential double-booked flights was detected, it would likely impose similar restrictions. That carrier, though, declined to be identified, because it did not want to scare off customers.
Trans World Airlines has not imposed restrictions on full fares, but a spokesman said that it was considering using "flight firming" -- that is, getting in touch with passengers who are booked on high-occupancy routes also flown by American and asking if they still planned to take that flight.
Continental Airlines, on the other hand, has decided not to impose restrictions on full fares, because, a spokesman said, "we didn't want to risk penalizing our loyal customers."

HEADLINE: Lott Calls for a Truce in the Budget Wrangle

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
It was Trent Lott the bad cop who went first today, as Congressional Republicans laid down some rhetorical markers before the start of negotiations with President Clinton on balancing the budget.
"I must tell you, I am gravely depressed about what I have seen," Mr. Lott, the Senate majority leader, said of the budget plan submitted by the White House on Thursday. The Administration's proposals, he said, were "disappointing," lacking in leadership and courage and loaded with "optimistic assumptions and shell games." 
 Then it was Trent Lott the good cop, assessing the outlook for the negotiations scheduled to begin on Tuesday on Capitol Hill.
"The idea there will be to just sit down and roll up our sleeves, forget what's been said, forget the campaign, and see if we can begin to actually get down to work," he said. "I'm going to urge that we not waste time talking about what we disagree on. Let's see where we can find some commonality, where we can begin to come up with agreements that will help the quality of life of all Americans."
Senator Lott's partisan criticism, juxtaposed with his call for a truce, suggests just how fine a line Republican leaders are walking as they position themselves for the budget talks.
Mr. Lott and his counterparts in the House dearly want to achieve a budget deal to erase the electorate's memories of the legislative deadlock of the past two years. To speed the process, nearly all the Republican leaders are willing to accept the President's budget proposals as a starting point, without submitting a budget of their own.
But to complete a deal they will have to control the considerable animosity within their party toward Mr. Clinton and his tax and spending policies.
So Mr. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, and other leaders of his party spent today pivoting from one audience to another, assuring their own hard-liners that they view the Administration's opening gambit with deepest skepticism, but also encouraging Mr. Clinton to come to the table prepared to deal seriously. Rather than risk poisoning the atmosphere, Mr. Lott issued orders to Republicans this week to keep their mouths closed, or at least to temper their statements, and to let him and his top lieutenants do the talking.
Because all of the House Republicans left Washington on Thursday for a two-day retreat in Williamsburg, Va., he has largely succeeded.
Among those silenced by absence from Washington today was Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. Mr. Kasich, a harsh critic of the Administration's plan, has been resisting Mr. Lott's call to forgo presenting a Republican budget alternative.
Senator Lott said, "I've been very careful to try to set up the atmosphere, as far as rhetoric goes, to try to move us toward the possibility that we could come to a budget agreement this year."
Indeed, the majority leader went so far today as to say what the White House perhaps most wanted to hear: that the Administration's education proposals, the heart of Mr. Clinton's second-term agenda, contain "a lot of good ideas."
The President, in turn, said he was encouraged by the response of House and Senate leaders, Mr. Lott's criticisms notwithstanding.
"We are just beginning this process, and I took no offense about what he said today," Mr. Clinton said. "I think he thinks maybe there's a bigger difference between us and we'll have to work harder, but we always knew we would have to work hard to reconcile the differences between us. We can do this."
But neither Mr. Lott nor his colleagues shied away from listing the substantive problems they said they have with the Administration's budget, starting with its call for $60 billion in new spending in the next five years on health care benefits for children and the unemployed, the expansion of certain Medicare and Medicaid benefits, food stamps and other welfare benefits, and school construction.
"I don't believe we can spend our way into a balanced budget," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee. "The Administration, as I see it, is stepping on the accelerator when we should be stepping very hard on the brakes."
The Administration started its effort to protect its budget priorities on Capitol Hill today with an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee by Franklin D. Raines, the White House budget chief.
Mr. Raines called the Administration's proposals a "starting point" for negotiations, and added, "We want to get your reactions to our budget, and we want to hear your ideas."
Mostly what he heard was that the Administration was ducking tough choices on spending and not supporting nearly enough in tax cuts to get a deal with Republicans. The Administration wants to slow the growth of Medicare by $100 billion over five years, trim domestic programs slightly and defer increases in military spending. It has proposed $98 billion in tax cuts for individuals, largely offset by $76 billion in new and extended taxes on corporations, investors and airline travelers.
But even those Republicans who gave Mr. Raines a chilly reception hewed to the leadership line that they had to negotiate a compromise.
"We don't have any choice but to work together," said Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma. "A repeat of last year is not acceptable to anybody."

HEADLINE: Payrolls Swell by 271,000, But Inflation Stays in Check

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
A buoyant economy created more jobs last month than economists had expected, but growth in labor costs slowed, calming Wall Street's jitters about inflation.
Labor Department figures showed today that strong demand for workers swelled payrolls by 271,000 last month, although analysts said the increase did not imply additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. 
 The report also showed that the proportion of Americans with jobs rose to a record in January.
"Pinch me because this just seems too good to be true," said Joel L. Naroff, chief bank economist for First Union in Philadelphia. "The economy keeps adding jobs like crazy, but the labor markets manage to absorb the demands without any major problems."
One sign of job equilibrium was that the unemployment rate edged up one-tenth of a point, to 5.4 percent, as a large number of people -- 509,000 -- entered the job market and all but 75,000 of them found jobs.
The employment report -- the first broad look at the economy's performance this year -- showed steady growth with low inflation, a combination that heartened investors. Both stocks and bonds surged on the report. The rally was interrupted by a drop in the dollar that was prompted by comments by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, but both stock and bond prices ended higher.
The moderation in labor costs in particular cheered investors, suggesting that the Fed could keep short-term interest rates steady. Average hourly earnings inched up just 1 cent, to $12.06, last month after increases totaling 15 cents in November and December that unnerved inflation-watchers.
The report also showed a growing confidence in the job market. The number of people who left jobs voluntarily -- presumably believing they could readily find a better one -- jumped to 890,000, or 12.3 percent of the jobless ranks compared with 11.7 percent in December.
And both the proportion of the population with jobs and the proportion who either have jobs or are actively looking for them edged up to new heights, surpassing peaks of late 1996.
These were said by officials to be the highest percentages since the two related statistical series were begun in 1943, though they cautioned that periodic changes in methodology prevented exact comparisons.
This, said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, reflected the combination of the long-established trend of more women working outside the home and an economy that has been expanding without significant interruption for nearly six years.
"You always get an uptick in the participation rate in the upswing of a business cycle," Ms. Sawhill said, dismissing suggestions that tighter restrictions on welfare had forced enough recipients into the job market to have had a noticeable effect on the statistics.
The participation rate was 67.2 percent last month, up from 67 percent in December. The rate jumped about three points in both the 1970's and 1980's to average 66.5 percent for 1990.
In another economic report today, the Federal Reserve cited further slowing in the growth of consumer credit, a trend that supported Government and private expectations that the economy was cooling off and would expand in coming months considerably more slowly than the 4.7 percent pace that prevailed in the fourth quarter of 1996.
Credit outstanding grew at a 4.9 percent clip in December to cut the quarterly average to 5.7 percent, scarcely half the pace of the first three months of the year. Revolving credit, mainly credit cards, grew at a 6.2 percent pace compared with 10.6 percent in November.
Though highly reassuring to the markets, today's employment report was complicated by extreme weather conditions that made the figures "harder to read than usual," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber.
Heavy snows that cut employment in January 1996 distorted the seasonal adjustment process for last month, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
But while this had the effect of exaggerating job growth in various industries, bad weather this January dampened the job market as did what she called "unusual movements" around the holiday season in several industries. The net effect on payrolls, she said, was "small."
Much of the 271,000 growth was in the category of help-supply, mostly temporary workers, where the increase was magnified by the weather-related factors, such as jobs shoveling snow. But health services added 43,000 jobs last month, nearly double the average monthly gain last year, and manufacturing added jobs, albeit a modest 18,000, for the fourth consecutive month.
Employment in the apparel industry, however, lost 8,000 jobs and has now lost 200,000, or one-fifth of its work force, over the last five years.
The length of the workweek fell sharply, the report also showed, but this as well as a skid in factory overtime was attributed to unusually harsh weather.
Regionally, however, the jobless rate climbed three-tenths of a point in the Northeast, to 5.8 percent, while the rate eased in the South, Midwest and West.
"Today's report contained something for everyone," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for the Chase Manhattan Regional Bank. But even strong growth, he added, "is not a problem as long as it's not accompanied by inflation pressure."

HEADLINE: Swiss Begin to Question Image of Heroism in War

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland, Feb. 3

 BODY:
This land has nurtured a wartime vision of itself as an Alpine redoubt whose young men girded to fight Hitler's armies, even as geography and neutrality left them encircled and obliged to deal with the hated Nazi enemy.
But in recent months the notion of wily heroism -- central to a generation's self-image and to the way history is viewed here -- has come under assault. For the first time, older Swiss are facing an agonizing question: did they buy their wartime survival with guile or something much worse, collaboration with Hitler? 
 Peering into this unfamiliar mirror of their wartime history, some Swiss have responded with anger at the American politicians and Jewish organizations who have in recent months forced Switzerland, its banks and its Government to reassess the past. Others feel the Swiss should no longer be captives of their wartime myths.
"It is not Jews who are our enemy," said Thomas Borer, a 42-year-old diplomat charged with defusing the crisis. "It is not Americans who are our enemy. It is the way we look at our own history that is our enemy."
And, as if the historical reappraisal were not enough, the questioning has come at a time when this land apart from both the European Union and the United Nations is laboring under six years of economic stagnation, replacing a sense of smug, postwar prosperity with that of an embattled malaise.
Suddenly, people like Kurt Bachtold, a 79-year-old Swiss Army veteran, find themselves confronting an outcry that their land not only traded in looted Nazi gold but also turned back Jewish refugees at their border and, in the postwar era, offered only a bureaucratic stonewall to family members seeking to locate money and items of wealth deposited in Switzerland by Holocaust victims.
Their response, in part, has been bewildered incomprehension.
"We did not realize that we would bring these accusations of guilt upon ourselves," said Hermann Wanner, an 83-year-old veteran and former high defense official who led a horse-drawn transport unit during the war.
But what is missing from the current debate, both men said in separate conversations, is an understanding of precisely where Switzerland stood and how its people responded to the war around them.
"In those days," Mr. Bachtold, a retired journalist and politician, said, "there was no point for the Swiss in trying to play the lion. We had to play the fox."
Back in 1940, Mr. Bachtold said, German troops were in the Black Forest across the border, Hitler's armies were on the move, and Switzerland was critically dependent on trade with Germany for its economic survival. Like other young men, he said, he was called to military service, guarding a ridge just across the Rhine from the home he lives in today.
With his light machine gun at the ready and insufficient ammunition in his foxhole, he said, he knew Germany would have no real problem overrunning the approaches to the Alps, the jagged, icy mountains that then, as now, provided the last refuge of Swiss strategic thinking.
"Every day we said, 'The Germans are coming,' " he recalled during an afternoon conversation. "We knew we might die. But we said to each other, 'When we go, we'll take five of them to the grave with each of us.' "
Even then, he acknowledged, there were signs of accommodation.
A nearby Swiss factory, Mr. Bachtold said, was producing steel for Germany to build those same tanks and artillery pieces kept across the border. In the center of this Swiss town, German railroad officials openly operated a part of the network of tracks that formed Nazi Germany's vital link straight across Switzerland to Italy, its Axis ally.
But Mr. Bachtold insists that a German invasion would have met stiff resistance. "The idea was to make the entrance fee to Switzerland so high that the Germans would not wish to pay it."
The historical record is complex and, many Swiss say, it has been distorted in the barrage against them. Certainly, historians argue, Switzerland did suggest to Nazi Germany in 1938 that the letter J, meaning Jude, or Jew, be stamped in German Jewish passports to facilitate recognition by the Swiss border police.
But many Swiss recall that Switzerland also offered sanctuary, under very ambiguous terms, to more than 20,000 Jews among the 200,000 wartime refugees it sheltered. Moreover, the Swiss role as a neutral power and financial center, many Swiss argue, was as valuable to the United States and its allies as to Nazi Germany.
Only last December, Jean-Pierre Roth, the head of the Swiss National Bank, pointedly remarked that the Swiss had bought almost as much gold from the United States as it had from Nazi Germany. American spies, the Swiss argue, operated freely from here. And in December 1944, when the war was almost won, Winston Churchill called the Swiss "the only decent neutrals in the world."
For many younger Swiss, including left-wing historians who have been challenging the nation's mythology for the last decade without much resonance, the reality is simply this: the reason Hitler's army did not invade was simply that Switzerland was worth far more as a financial clearinghouse and source of hard currency than as an occupied land.
"If the Germans had overrun Switzerland, they would have gained a few square miles of territory, but they would have lost the Swiss franc," said Gian Trepp, an author of several books about Switzerland's banks.
By this account, the tales of people like Mr. Bachtold in his foxhole on the frontier are part of a heroic mythology that was woven into Switzerland's postwar self-image to disguise the fact that its financiers and officials cooperated all too willingly with the Third Reich.
"The Swiss convinced themselves that they were without guilt in the Second World War, and that's not the case," said Jurg Schoch, a reporter covering the affair for Tages Anzeiger, the Zurich daily newspaper. "To accept the other reality is very difficult for the older generation."
That seemed clear enough as Mr. Wanner spread maps and diagrams showing just how strategically vulnerable Schaffhausen was and how advanced Nazi invasion plans were in 1940.
"It was not a myth. The decision to fight had been made," he said. The Swiss, he said, held two trump cards for deterring the German Army: the rail tunnel through the Alps that carried war materials between Germany and Italy, and Switzerland's military plan to concentrate its forces in the Alps.
"It would have been a mountain war, and Hitler was frightened of that," he said. "And on top of that the Germans knew that the transit tunnels would be blown up if they invaded."
This heroic image of Switzerland's wartime resolve underlies Swiss officials' recent reluctance to cast the crisis over Nazi gold in moral terms. It explains, in part, why the Swiss have preferred to lay the blame on other factors, like the purported willful misreading of historical realities in the United States or a conspiracy by Jewish organizations, politicians and the news media.
One diplomat, who lost his job for saying so, called it a war. Another diplomatic report helped persuade the outgoing President, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, to depict Switzerland public as a target of "blackmail and extortion."
Last month, after long delay, the Government in Bern agreed to take the lead in establishing a Holocaust memorial fund, along with the Swiss National Bank, commercial banks and insurance companies -- all institutions that did business with Nazi Germany. Still, the Government and the National Bank shied away from making firm financial commitments.
[On Wednesday, the country's three largest banks, impatient with what they saw as politicians' ineptitude and keen to salvage business interests facing the threat of a boycott, said they had put up $71 million as the basis for the fund.]
For some older Swiss, the slow process of disclosure has gradually produced finer shadings of memory.
From the beginning, Mr. Bachtold said, people like him knew the Swiss position was conditioned by his country's need to trade with Nazi Germany, trading Swiss steel and war material for German coal.
But only later did he and his men learn that the German units across the border had been deployed as no more than a feint to distract from the planned invasion of Belgium and France.
In the late 1950's, the story of Switzerland's decision in 1942 to turn back at least 30,000 Jewish refugees began to emerge and convinced him that "this was the worst chapter in Swiss history."
But for decades after, the question of dormant accounts and trade in gold with Nazi Germany was simply not an issue. "The matter was closed for us," he said.
These days, he said, he has arrived at a different conclusion. "A lot of what is said now is just. In this dark chapter with the banks, the Government reacted slowly, and we found that the Swiss banks did not behave very nicely."
As for the war years, he said, it seems now that Hitler was held at bay by a variety of factors, both economic and strategic, not just the army on the border.

HEADLINE: As Rebels Gain in Zaire, Army Morale Is Declining

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Feb. 7

 BODY:
For months after rebels invaded the border towns of eastern Zaire in October, their insurrection was confined to a long but narrow strip of land 1,000 miles from the capital. This country's vastness seemed to offer the Government here a kind of protection that its woeful army could not.
But in recent weeks, Zaire's rebels have enjoyed a stunning string of successes that have turned the tables on the Government and drastically changed the nature of the war. 
 Operating with what Western diplomats describe as strong support from Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, the rebels have advanced on widely separated fronts, stretching the Government's fragile defenses to the breaking point just as a counteroffensive led by foreign mercenaries struggles to get under way.
Suddenly, instead of merely controlling a slender buffer zone between Zaire and its eastern neighbors, diplomats, relief workers and Zairian officials say the rebels have a strong foothold in 4 of the country's 11 provinces.
They now appear poised to threaten the country's second- and third-largest cities in what could mark an outright bid to topple the longtime dictator, President Mobutu Sese Seko, and seize power.
The rebel advance raises the serious prospect of the violent disintegration of Zaire, which by virtue of its size, population and mineral wealth is one of Africa's most important countries.
Although Zaire, which is one-third the size of the United States, has never been stable, the catastrophic breakup of the country would be deeply troubling to many of the country's nine neighbors.
Western alarm at this threat has been somewhat tempered by the fact that the rebel moves have strengthened the stability of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda -- all of which have suffered in the past from insurrections based in Zaire and so have an interest in aiding the rebel forces.
In two simultaneous advances west and south, the rebels are moving toward the major cities of Kisangani and Lubumbashi. They are led by a longtime foe of Mr. Mobutu's, Laurent Desire Kabila, with considerable help from Zaire's eastern neighbors. Asked how Mr. Kabila's forces have managed to achieve so much in so little time, one Western diplomat here responded tersely: "Rwanda and Uganda."
"That's where they are getting their weapons, their transportation, their communications, their new uniforms, even some of their men," the diplomat added.
But others say that as important as the aid from outside the country has been for the rebels, the recent successes in pushing west and in swelling their ranks suggest that Mr. Kabila's forces are taking root.
While Mr. Kabila proudly reviewed a parade of 5,000 new recruits who marched through the streets of Goma, near the border with Rwanda, on Thursday, the Government's recruitment efforts have been met with little enthusiasm. Army enlistment offices in Kinshasa have remained empty in the week since a call was made for young men 15 to 18 years old to join the war effort.
Zaire's soldiers are paid as little as $1 a month, and like many citizens who are disaffected with a Government that has driven this country into poverty, they seem to see no reason to fight.
By almost all accounts, the rebels' advances have been aided by the sympathetic reception that they have often received from local populations, who are happy to see the army, which has engaged in widespread looting, chased away.
Foreign witnesses who saw the rebels arrive in the eastern town of Shabunda the other day say they were greeted with courtesy, if not fanfare, by the residents as they marched in orderly formation through the area.
The recent combat has only reinforced the impression that the Government of the gravely ill Mr. Mobutu lacks the kind of international support that it will need to prevail.
Today, Mr. Mobutu returned to his native village after a stay in France for cancer treatment and denied that he had used a stopover in Morocco to plead for military support from that country. Zairian journalists immediately speculated that it was less embarrassing to deny having asked for help than to admit that a request for support had been turned down.
In recent days, other African countries from Togo to Egypt that have aided Mr. Mobutu during past crises have publicly said they would not get involved in the current fighting, apparently because they are unwilling to risk their troops for a weak and increasingly unpopular leader.
Even people close to Mr. Mobutu have acknowledged discouragement in the ranks of the 300 or so foreign mercenaries recently flown into Kisangani. The mercenaries have complained that they lack the means to fight a surprisingly well-organized enemy in unfamiliar jungle terrain.
"The Belgian officers say that the Serbian soldiers just want to give up on this," one person close to the presidential entourage said. "Their men are getting sick in this climate, they don't speak the right language and they have never been in a war like this."
Several mercenaries have already been killed, while others have complained that they have been paid with counterfeit currency, diplomats say.
In their latest advances, the rebels have taken towns like Walikale, Shabunda and Punia, marking the beginning of a strong westward push from the eastern border region toward Kisangani -- known in colonial times as Stanleyville -- which is Zaire's second-largest city and the strategic capital of the north.
Simultaneously, the rebel troops have thrust far to the south of their de facto capital in Goma, taking the port city of Kalemie on Lake Tanganyika.
The seizure of Kalemie, at the northern terminus of an extensive network of railways, deprives the Government of a means of resupply and reinforcement for any attempt to retake the east.
Now, from Kalemie, just within the borders of the historically restive southern province of Shaba, diplomats say the rebels could march on Kamina, or alternatively on the country's third-largest city, Lubumbashi, the provincial capital.
The logistical nightmare that the Government faces, with its limited airlift capacity and shortage of men and hardware, is perhaps best illustrated by its attempts to protect Kisangani, the main operational base for the Zairian defense effort.
Flying dozens of Serbian mercenaries to the small town of Muhulu last week to hold a bridge spanning the Oso River, the Zairian military managed to stop the advance of the rebels toward Kisangani from the recently captured city of Walikale.
Undaunted, the rebels swept southwest to take the city of Punia and are now threatening the city of Lubutu, well behind the mercenary lines.
The Government announced today that it had scored several successes against the rebels in the last 24 hours, notably in the towns of Walikale and Watsa, which Defense Ministry officials say were recaptured.
But independent observers could only confirm that these towns had just been subjected to intense aerial bombing.
Unrest near Lubutu, where Government forces have reportedly been distributing weapons among members of Rwanda's defeated former army, forced international relief agencies to pull out of that town today. The move has sown panic among many of the 140,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees of the Hutu ethnic group who have gathered in the area in recent months and vastly complicated relief efforts.
Commenting on a similar rebel movement toward Kisangani from the north, one international relief official said: "This looks like a replay of just the same kind of pincer movement they used to such great effect near Goma at the start of the war. Given the way they have been moving, you have to wonder how long it will be before Kisangani falls too."
Tension is already mounting sharply in Kisangani, according to reports reaching the capital from that city. Anti-army sentiment is said to be strong after recent bouts of looting by soldiers, and the shooting of a pregnant woman by a soldier on Thursday sparked a large protest march through the city today.
From the very start of the country's independent history in 1960, Zaire has almost continually experienced powerful centrifugal tensions, including repeated attempts at secession. Time after time, Mr. Mobutu, who has governed since 1965, was able to call on Western friends to save him.
Mr. Mobutu could do this because Zaire under his rule had repeatedly proven an essential ally in the cold-war struggle against Communism on the African continent.
The last major rebellions were in 1977 and 1978, in the copper-rich province of Shaba -- known earlier as Katanga -- which inflicted embarrassing defeats on the Zairian Army. The first revolt was eventually put down by Moroccan troops airlifted with American assistance. The second was defeated by the French Foreign Legion.
Today, Zaire lacks the cold-war strategic importance that it once enjoyed. And diplomats say its army, never a reliable fighting force, has been on a steady decline for as long as 15 years.

HISTORY
Called Congo until 1971, Zaire was under Belgian control from 1885 to June 1960. A period of instability followed independence until November 1965, when Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in a bloodless coup. He has ruled as an autocrat ever since.
 
ECONOMY
While meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, chronic large Government deficits, and plunging mineral production have made the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions are conducted in hard currency as indigenous bank notes have lost almost all value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the largest cities. The estimated per capita gross national product in 1994 was $440.
 
PEOPLE
Over 44 million (1995 estimate) people are divided among over 200 African ethnic groups with the largest tribes being the Kongo, Mongo, Luba, and the Mangbetu-Azande. The languages include French, Lingala, Swahili, Kingwana, Kikongo and Tshhiluba. The literacy rate (age 15 and over) is 72 percent and the life expectance at birth is 47.5 years (1995 estimate).
 
GEOGRAPHY
The third-largest country in Africa, Zaire is about one-quarter the size of the United States. With vast forests and plenty of rainfall, Zaire has huge agricultural, logging and hydroelectric potential. (Source: The World Factbook)(pg. 6)
 
Map of Zaire: The rebel forces, pushing westward from the eastern border region toward Kisangani, Zaire's second-largest city and the strategic capital of the north, have taken Walikale, Shabunda and Punia and other towns. At the same time the rebels, have thrust far to the south of their de-facto capital in Goma, taking the port city of Kalemie on Lake Tanganyika. (pg. 1)

HEADLINE: Secretary of State Sells Foreign Policy at Home

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Madeleine K. Albright took her first trip as Secretary of State today, traveling not to some foreign capital, not even to some state capital, but rather to Texas, determined, she said, to take America's foreign policy straight to the people.
"Usually passport offices don't get this kind of attention," one woman declared as Ms. Albright waded through the Leland Federal Building in downtown Houston, becoming the first Secretary of State in recent memory to attend to one of the more pedestrian offices of the Department of State. 
 And as if she needed to do any more to distinguish herself from her predecessors, including the courtly, highly reserved Warren Christopher, Ms. Albright went on to visit a high school and delivered on her promise to speak plainly about matters of international affairs.
"Not only can foreign policy be cool," the Secretary of State told a group of earnest high school students, "but it can be awesome."
For Ms. Albright, only two weeks into the job, it was a trip short of substance but larded with symbols, almost all of them self-conscious. "It's a perfect schedule," one aide said proudly, describing her two-day visit here. "It's got everything."
In addition to the stop at the passport office (a symbol of her commitment to the State Department's workers), she met with Mexico's Foreign Minister, Jose Angel Gurria (a symbol, she declared, of the importance of its relations with the United States).
She also delivered a speech at Rice University at the institute named after one of her predecessors, James A. Baker 3d (a symbol of her desire for a bipartisan foreign policy). And as if to make sure the last point sticks, she plans to have breakfast on Saturday with former President Bush.
"As Secretary, I will do my best to talk about foreign policy not in abstract terms, but in human terms and in bipartisan terms," she told the students, professors and others at Rice. "I consider this vital because in our democracy, we cannot pursue policies abroad that are not understood and supported here at home."
In her speech at Rice, where she was introduced by Mr. Baker, Ms. Albright returned to the theme of bipartisanship, echoing President Clinton's calls for an end to partisanship on everything from the budget to foreign affairs.
She also called on Congress to approve a convention that would ban chemical weapons, which has faced opposition from some Republicans even though it was negotiated and signed under President Bush, and to approve Mr. Clinton's plan to repay the United States' back dues to the United Nations.
A day after Mr. Clinton presented a budget that included a modest increase in spending on foreign aid, she also argued that after four years of a declining foreign-affairs budget, the United States was "steadily and unilaterally disarming ourselves."
Ms. Albright's maiden voyage -- "It's a little hard to be a maiden at this age," the 59-year-old Secretary told reporters on the flight here -- precedes by a week her first trip abroad. On that trip she will circle the globe, making stops in Rome, Paris, London, Brussels, Bonn, Moscow, Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing.
But Ms. Albright herself wanted to make her first trip a domestic one, hoping to convince people of the importance of a vigilant, aggressive foreign policy to their lives. And she chose Houston -- after aides originally considered Chicago -- evidently to wrap herself in as many symbols as possible.
During her confirmation hearing before the Senate, Ms. Albright promised to spend more time articulating and defending foreign policy. While it remains to be seen whether she will have any more success than her predecessors in selling the importance of foreign policy to the public, her reception here was certainly warm enough.
As she gladhanded her way through the waiting crowd at the passport office, one man even asked her to sign a $5 bill. She declined, signing an envelope instead.
At Lamar Senior High School, Ms. Albright made her case against an isolationist foreign policy to 50 or so students studying international affairs. Ms. Albright, a professor for many years at Georgetown University, deftly fielded questions on topics from illegal immigration to human rights in China. Sitting in front of a world map, she offered as inspiration that she had failed geography as a girl. "I've tried very hard to make up for that," she said.
After the speech at Rice, Ms. Albright also made the case for increased spending on foreign affairs in a private meeting with executives from major corporations. For their part, one official said, the executives made a case against unilateral American sanctions to punish other nations for violations of human rights.
Among the companies represented was Unocal, which last month announced a gas exploration and pipeline project in Myanmar even as the United States considers new sanctions against the Burmese Government there.
Asked by one of the students at Lamar, Oneil Crosby, about the line in foreign policy between economic and humanitarian principles, Ms. Albright replied: "What we have to be careful about in foreign policy is not to make false choices. The truth is you can focus on both issues."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Focus on Schools Hits Home

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
In outlining his ambitious agenda for education this week, President Clinton tapped into a deep national yearning to improve the nation's schools, even if it might mean accepting the revolutionary notion of national standards and perhaps even national tests to compare students, schools and states.
But Mr. Clinton's plan to spend $51 billion on everything from recruiting reading tutors to repairing tumbledown school buildings runs counter to two other currents: the traditional belief that education is essentially a local rather than a national concern, and the budgetary strictures and anti-tax sentiments that will make it extraordinarily difficult to increase Federal spending. 
 So for all the surface appeal of Mr. Clinton's dramatic educational call to arms, how much will eventually go into effect, how much is sound policy and how much is affordable remain very much in question.
"He's a master communicator," said Representative Bill Goodling, the chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, "but as people sort all of this out, I think they'll have a different opinion of his plan than they do now.
"There's no question that education is the sexiest thing out there right now, and the President knows that. But I think people have to ask how much of this is new and how much is just more of the same."
The education plan, which was the centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's State of the Union address on Tuesday, was most revealing in reflecting how far the nation had come toward accepting the importance of national standards. It may have been most vulnerable in its call for increased college financial aid and its notion of volunteerism as a cornerstone of literacy.
But experts say that if one of Mr. Clinton's goals was putting education at the top of the national agenda and forcefully identifying himself with it, the speech was a major step in that direction.
After fighting off Republican efforts in the last Congress to cut Federal spending on education, he called for a record $51 billion for education in his budget proposal on Thursday.
The plan seeks to raise standards, improve the quality of the nation's teachers, improve reading, enhance early learning and offer more choices -- particularly largely autonomous charter schools -- in the context of public education.
The President also called for more character education, $5 billion to repair and rebuild crumbling school buildings, more financial aid to college students, improved adult education and a plan to connect all schools to the Internet by the year 2000.
The proposals drew their strongest support from mainstream educational groups, teachers unions and other professional educators.
"It was a home run," said Bella Rosenberg, assistant to the president of the American Federation of Teachers. "It was a coherent package of high standards for achievement and high standards of conduct."
By identifying himself so strongly with the critical importance of education and by melding diverse ideas, Mr. Clinton left most critics praising his commitment to educational innovation, though arguing over the specifcs of his plan.
"He said it was his number one priority," said Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform, which advocates choice options like vouchers and charter schools. "I think there is a fundamental misconception about what makes schools good and what makes children learn, but I think it's really important that the President spoke about education."
Many experts say the most significant aspect of Mr. Clinton's program is its enthusiastic embrace of national standards and even national tests for some grades. That reflects the degree to which a national presence -- but not a Federal one -- in standards and assessments has become perhaps the most important wave of educational change.
"What Bill Clinton has done has gone way beyond where the country was even at the Education Summit at Palisades last year," said Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy and co-director of New Standards, which has drawn up proposed voluntary standards for the nation's schools. "He's saying that not only do we need standards, we need national standards. That would have been almost unthinkable even a year ago."
The road to national standards will be long and bumpy. Some critics on the left think standardized tests are often biased and inaccurate, and many on the right chafe at a larger national role in education.
But for many analysts on both sides, Mr. Clinton's call for national standards -- and a test of the nation's fourth graders in reading and eighth graders in math -- had more potential than anything else in his proposal to improve education.
"I graded the different parts of the program, and the grades ranged from A to F, but the part I liked best was perhaps the most controversial one, which was the test," said Chester Finn, a prominent conservative critic of education and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.
Mr. Finn said that at the opposite extreme was the President's proposed program of tax credits for education. Many skeptics, on the left and the right, say financial incentives to make a 13th and 14th year of education as common as high school is now could lead to grade inflation and cause schools such as junior colleges to use the new Federal money for their own needs rather than pass the savings on to students. Such incentives would help those who go to school already, they say, not open the door wider for those who do not.
"The poor are going to be largely unaffected by this," said Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University. "It won't improve access one iota."
Republicans in Congress question the price tag of Mr. Clinton's proposal and the addition of new programs to the 760 they say exist now in 39 Federal agencies at a cost of $120 billion.
And many people are skeptical of parts of the plan with the most surface appeal, like the idea of recruiting one million tutors into a national Reading Corps. "He seems to have this screwy idea that because two and a half million teachers who are paid to do this stuff are not very good at it, that sending a million amateurs into the classroom is going to make a difference," Mr. Finn said.
Still, if the details of the plan will face withering scrutiny, many educators say Mr. Clinton artfully caught the public's mood on education and did a real service in focusing attention on it.
"He's picked an issue that's very clearly at the top of the public's mind, and he's played the specifics pretty much off the polling data that's available," said Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators. "He's going to have a tremendous amount of public support, at least initially."

HEADLINE: RUBIN HINTS AT END TO LONG U.S. PUSH OF STRONG DOLLAR

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, taking a little air out of the rapidly rising dollar, suggested today that the Administration had ended its two-year-long effort to drive up the dollar against the world's other major currencies.
Mr. Rubin has said repeatedly over that time that "a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States." Today, in a subtly worded change of policy, he said at a meeting with reporters that while a strong dollar was still in America's interest, "we have had a strong dollar for some time now," a phrase he used three more times. 
 The midday comments by Mr. Rubin, the former investment banker who has emerged as perhaps the most influential member of President Clinton's Cabinet, set off a torrent of activity on financial markets. The dollar, which had been rising sharply on strong United States jobs data, tumbled more than 3 Japanese yen, before recovering somewhat.
A rise in the dollar tends to make American goods more expensive abroad and make foreign goods a better bargain in the United States. That puts added competitive pressure on American manufacturers to keep prices low, and it can cut into their profit margins overseas. But a stronger dollar also helps hold down inflation and makes it less expensive for Americans to travel abroad.
In recent months, the Administration has received many complaints from Detroit, where American auto makers and unions contend that a weak yen is allowing Japan, with its cheaper prices, to gain a larger share of the American market.
Mr. Rubin's phrasing was calculatedly vague and might have been intended to keep speculators in the currency market at bay. "We think about these statements pretty carefully before we make them," he said today, deflecting reporters who were probing for more.
He spoke only a day before senior finance officials from the United States and the six other largest industrial economies are scheduled to meet in Germany. "The G-7 countries have expressed concern about recent declines in their currencies," Mr. Rubin said. "We look forward to discussing these issues in Berlin."
But it is unclear whether Mr. Rubin and the finance ministers of the other countries will be able to stem the rapid run-up in the dollar's value, a trend that reflects such fundamental forces as a healthy American economy, continued stagnation in Japan and increased nervousness about a unified European currency.
Today's remarks, however, sent players in the trillion-dollar-a-day currency markets scrambling. They sought the answer to a two-sided question: Was Mr. Rubin signaling a sharp turn in American currency policy? Or, as seems more likely, was he simply trying to avoid a steep, and hard-to-reverse, further rise in the dollar's value, which could worsen the trade deficit?
Mr. Rubin clearly does not want to overreach and send the dollar into a tailspin as his predecessor, Lloyd Bentsen, did in early 1993 with the flip comment: "I'd like to see a stronger yen." Traders immediately interpreted that as a license to sell the dollar against the yen.
Unlike Mr. Bentsen, a lifelong politician with a populist tinge in favor of low interest rates and a competitive currency rate, Mr. Rubin made his mark on Wall Street, where he rose through the ranks of Goldman, Sachs as a highly successful trader. If his past actions are a reliable guide, his comments today were simply an attempt to sow uncertainty among global money managers, making them fearful of betting on a further rapid rise of the dollar.
Mr. Rubin made clear two years ago that he knows how to burn speculators. In early 1995 he tried to talk the dollar up, but the markets paid no attention, bidding up the yen until it nearly touched 79 to the dollar.
Then, after a long silence, Mr. Rubin intervened in the markets -- buying dollars at unexpected times, often in coordination with the central banks of other countries -- and the speculators who had bet on a weaker dollar lost fortunes.
Mr. Rubin has not discussed that move publicly, though once, when asked about it, he smiled and said, "I'm told that's what happened."
He does not seem likely to intervene anytime soon to cool the dollar off. For one, there is hardly the unanimity among the seven allies there was in 1985, when the Plaza Accord -- reached at a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York -- led to a coordinated effort to devalue the high-flying dollar. American officials are not particularly upset at the dollar's current level, either, as long as it does not go much higher.
"It's not the level they have in mind, it's the pace," said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a consulting firm in Essex, Conn. "I think they are worried that the markets could overshoot, and they figure that if they make noises now, there is less risk of that."
Indeed, if finance ministers in Berlin issue a communique -- and there was some doubt today that they would -- it will probably refer only to the need for stability in the markets. The step beyond that would be calling for an end to the "orderly reversal" of currency values, the phrase that finance ministers started using in 1995.
If America's trading partners seem of mixed minds, that is because a strong dollar may help their export performance but tarnishes their image politically. Japan's international companies are more profitable when the yen is weaker. But the dollar has been so strong lately that investors are fleeing the sagging Tokyo stock market, and Japanese officials fret out loud that the weak yen is becoming a symbol of a weak Japan.
In Europe, the rise of the dollar has given a welcome lift to exports, too. But there are anxious rumblings, including the fear that the poor performance of several European economies could make it harder to introduce the Euro, the common currency planned for 1999.
In the United States, the loudest complaints have come from Detroit. "One would probably be naive not to look at the yen valuation as a huge opportunity for them," G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the president of General Motors' North American operations, said on Wednesday.
For the day, the dollar ended trading in New York at 122.60 yen, down from 123.54 yen on Thursday and at 1.6568 German marks, up slightly from 1.6504 marks.

HEADLINE: Capital's Police Union Chief Asks U.S. Takeover of Force

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Describing the streets of the nation's capital as a war zone where residents should fear for their safety, the head of the District of Columbia police union called on the Federal Government today to take over the Police Department and provide hundreds of millions of dollars to improve it.
Although neither step is likely any time soon, as the Government moves toward balancing its budget by 2002, Ron Robertson, president of the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, cited a series of recent violent crimes in the city, and warned: "We're in a war here, but what's happening is, we don't have a battle plan. Nothing's getting done." 
 Later in the day, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. summoned reporters to Police Headquarters to denounce Mr. Robertson's appeal, saying there was no need "for any Government takeover of any part of this problem."
Mr. Barry said he had urged the Federal Government to provide the city new money for the police as a supplement to the Clinton Administration's proposal for municipal assistance that would include taking over the District's prison system and increasing the Federal share of Medicaid payments.
"I argued that our officers need raises and additional help for new equipment," Mr. Barry said, putting the cost at about $10 million, far less than the $700 million that Mr. Robertson said the department needed over the next five years.
Calls by the District's police officers for Federal intervention are nothing new. Since the city's economy began spiraling downward in the early 1990's, increasing the pressure on the police budget, officers have frequently looked to Capitol Hill for help.
But their pleas gained a new urgency after a uniformed officer was shot to death early Wednesday morning as he sat in his patrol car waiting for a traffic light to change. The police later arrested a 23-year-old man and charged him with killing the officer, Brian T. Gibson, by repeatedly firing a semiautomatic weapon at his head through the car window.
That incident followed several others of note so far this year. In one, a 12-year-old boy was kidnapped as he walked home from school and was shot to death by a group of teen-agers. Last Sunday a 78-year-old woman walking home from church in the middle of the afternoon was killed by a stray bullet. Although arrests have been made in the case involving the 12-year-old, there have been none in the other.
While the homicide rate is falling in many American cities, it is increasing in Washington, where the police have recorded 45 killings already this year, 2 more than for the same period last year, which ended with 393 killings. That was a 3 percent increase over the total for 1995.
Detective Renee Holden said fear among officers had grown so palpable that if she were to stop a car at night for a traffic violation, she would approach it only with her gun drawn.
"It's getting significantly worse out there," Detective Holden said. "When you walk out your door in the morning, you look at your kids and think, 'I may not be home tonight.' It makes you think about any situation you might get involved in."
Officers generally attribute the rising crime rate to what they describe as the city's lack of financial support for the Police Department. Once a force of 5,100 uniformed officers, the department now has about 3,600, and illness or administrative matters keep as many as 200 from working on any given day.
The control board that oversees the city's finances approved a Police Department budget of $236.3 million for the current fiscal year. Because of the city's efforts to reach a balanced budget, that sum is expected to increase only marginally, if at all, next year.
The Police Chief, Larry Soulsby, said in a radio interview today that the department was currently authorized to have 3,800 officers and that he was in the process of hiring recruits every month. But he contended that no number of additional officers could have prevented a gunman from approaching a patrol car and suddenly opening fire at the driver.
"As long as we have people in society willing to do that," he said, "it's going to be very difficult for the Police Department to deal with it."
Mr. Robertson, the union leader, disagreed. He argued that additional financing would, among other things, enable commanders to send out two officers in each patrol car at night, rather than one, a difference that he said might have saved Officer Gibson's life. He also said the police needed more cars, better radios and station-house roofs that do not leak.
"We have a third-rate Police Department operating in what has become a third-world city," Mr. Robertson said. "Safety is a problem, and it's a hazard for us. But more important, it's not safe here for citizens."
Mr. Robertson said the department needed a huge infusion of money, far beyond what Mr. Barry suggested, just to modernize equipment and bring pay to levels comparable with those of adjacent jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia. He said the starting annual salary of District officers, $30,000 to $32,000, was about $2,000 less than elsewhere in the region.
But no matter how high the crime rate climbs, turning the Police Department over to the Federal Government appears to be an unlikely solution for now. When asked his position today, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, said, "Drastic problems call for drastic action." But he stopped well short of advocating a Federal takeover, instead calling on President Clinton and municipal leaders to meet and "have a serious discussion about what we can do to help."
Mr. Robertson said that in the absence of a Federal takeover, he would support the creation of an oversight panel to run the department, much like the one recently appointed by the city's control board to run the dilapidated public school system.
Mr. Barry said no such panel was necessary.
"We have the power and the brainpower," the Mayor said, "to tackle these problems ourselves."

HEADLINE: 3 Ecuadoreans Laying Claims To Presidency

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The morning after their President was ousted on the ground of mental incompetence, Ecuadoreans awoke to a more dizzying spectacle: three people claiming to be President.
Today the ousted President, Abdala Bucaram, remained hunkered down in the heavily fortified presidential palace, clinging to the office he won in August and deploring the congressional decision to depose him as unconstitutional. 
 In a vote that swiftly followed the decision on Mr. Bucaram, the legislators chose Fabian Alarcon, the conservative president of Congress, to serve as Interim President.
At the same time, Vice President Rosalia Arteaga, saying she was the legal successor, appealed for a plebiscite so voters, not Congress, could choose their President.
Tension grew today as all three declared their determination to protect the Constitution and democracy, while contradictory voices from the military left people uncertain about the army's intentions.
The unabashed jockeying for control of the country had one Western diplomat quoting a song from "Evita," the musical about the life of Eva Peron: "Dice are rolling, the knives are out, would-be presidents are all about."
By late afternoon, Mr, Bucaram was again addressing the nation, declaring that Congress had no medical examination or other grounds for labeling him mentally unstable, and arguing that if the Congress did not agree with his handling of the presidency, it should hold a political trial to determine his fitness.
But tonight he flew to Guayaquil, his home city, leaving behind a challenge to Mr. Alarcon to meet him there on Saturday for talks.
Mr. Bucaram, a populist candidate who won a record-breaking 20 of Ecuador's 21 provinces to become President last August, is showing this Andean nation the most precipitous political decline of any President in its unconventional history.
During his flamboyant campaign, Mr. Bucaram would croon with an Uruguayan rock band at rallies, and once elected, El Loco, as he called himself, recorded a rock song called "A Madman in Love." Last fall he met with Lorena Bobbitt, the Ecuadorean-American who had cut off her husband's penis, and hailed her as a woman who "knows how to defend her principles and values."
Soon after taking office, Mr. Bucaram, whose candidacy resounded with stinging attacks on the ruling classes, made an about-face. He adopted economic measures to reduce the protective role of the state by privatizing public companies, reducing subsidies and dismantling laws that made dismissing workers almost impossible.
The most immediate effects of his new policies -- painful increases in the cost of telephone service, cooking gas, gasoline and electricity -- were made worse by his administration's reputation for rampant corruption and nepotism.
In his numerous speeches this week, before and after the congressional vote, Mr. Bucaram responded to those charges, accepting the resignation of four of his most highly criticized Cabinet members, including his brother, Adolfo Bucaram.
He lowered the prices on gasoline, cooking fuel and electricity, which had skyrocketed during his administration. All complaints, he said, could be addressed. "The only thing that is not open for discussion is that there is a constitutional President of Ecuador, elected by popular vote." The measures did not help.
"If he was really serious about any of these steps, he would have done them before now," said Virgilio Hernandez, who led a 10-day occupation of the Metropolitan Cathedral here that effectively set off the waves of protest that swept the country. "It's just to buy time."
A 48-hour general strike led up to the special session of Congress on Thursday night. In some areas where the protests have been most overwhelming, the graffiti repeated the mocking word, "Ablablabla."
In Carondelet, the presidential palace, Mr. Bucaram reinforced a military cordon in the streets, and makeshift barricades of logs connected with barbed wire appeared by the palace entrances alongside piles of sandbags and new revolving doors that locked with each turn.
Outside, crowds that marched with congressional leaders to the presidential palace in the late afternoon chanted "Bucaram out!" Police officers threw tear gas, forcing the congressional leaders and other political figures to duck into a nearby church.
An 18-year-old student, Patricio Uyumbillo, was killed today in the streets around the palace, and as evening fell the area was covered with clouds of tear gas.
While a number of Ecuadoreans said on Wednesday that they believed the Congress should name the Vice President as the natural successor to Mr. Bucaram, Mrs. Arteaga appeared to have scuttled her chances by accusing Mr. Alarcon and other congressmen of plotting a coup d'etat, and raising the prospect of their arrest.
Mr. Hernandez, in an interview inside the cathedral shortly before his group of 60 protesters left the building, said Mrs. Arteaga had not taken steps to distance herself from the President until it was too late.
Indeed, Mr. Bucaram's presidential portrait still hangs in the Vice President's entrance to the presidential palace. In an interview, Mrs. Arteaga said she had simply overlooked the picture because events had happened so quickly.
She also said she believed that part of the reason she had not been named President automatically was that she was a woman. "I believe machismo is very strong in this society," she said, adding that in the past, male Vice Presidents had assumed the presidency as a matter of course.
With another general strike and protest scheduled for Saturday, the stand of the military -- an important factor in any political crisis in South America -- remained unclear. Early in the day, the Defense Minister, Victor Manuel Bayas, a retired general who appeared in military fatigues, read a statement declaring a state of emergency signed by Mr. Bucaram, suspending civil liberties and other constitutional protections.
But the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Paco Moncayo, said the military would not be the country's political arbiter and would limit its role to protecting the safety and security of the country's borders, officials, buildings and citizens -- a position hailed by Washington.
Though bemused by the one-upmanship among their leaders, people returned to work, buses ran and shops opened after the two-day strike.
"Everything's working fine without them," a diplomat said. "What does that tell you about the Government?"

GRAPHIC: Chart: "SNAPSHOTS: Who's in Charge?"
 
ABDALA BUCARAM, 45. Former mayor of Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, sought the presidency for years, winning it on his third try last year. Thursday night, Congress decided he was unfit for office and voted to remove him, apparently for a bizarre political style that has included singing, dancing and fiery tirades against his opponents. Calls himself "El Loco."
 
FABIAN ALARCON, 49. Selected unanimously as head of the legislature even though his party holds only three seats. After Bucaram's dismissal, Congress named him interim President and told him to call new elections this year.
 
ROSALIA ARTEAGA, 40. Founded a tiny, center-right party and ran for Congress; formed an alliance with Bucaram and became his Vice-President. Declared herself legitimate successor to Bucuram after his dismissal, rejecting lawmakers' choice of Alarcon. (pg. 4)

HEADLINE: Vallone Describes Vision Of Floating Casino Fleet

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Peter F. Vallone, the generally cautious Speaker of the City Council, is hardly the riverboat gambler type, rarely even submitting a piece of legislation unless he knows he has the votes to pass it. Yesterday, however, he instantly became New York's most prominent supporter of floating casinos, urging the city to approve a virtual flotilla of the boats while keeping a substantial portion of the pot for the municipal treasury.
Though his plans are likely to be dampened by a far more skeptical Giuliani administration, Mr. Vallone sketched out a scenario under which gambling boats could leave from waterfronts in all five boroughs, carrying passengers past the three-mile limit of state jurisdiction to spin roulette wheels, play blackjack and pull slot machine levers. 
 "There's no reason why we shouldn't consider big boats going out beyond the three-mile line and having the city franchise it out," he said in an interview. "We have the natural resources, so why not use it? People are going to gamble anyway."
One such boat recently began operating from Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, and another leaves Manhattan in the summer months. Mr. Vallone said he saw no reason to stop there, predicting that the city could make hundreds of millions in tax dollars from city gamblers who now travel to Atlantic City or American Indian casinos. He even raised the possibility of the city's operating the boats, though he did not elaborate.
Inspired by the Sheepshead Bay enterprise, a group of business leaders in the Rockaways section of Queens is already trying to lure a casino-boat operation there, hoping to inject some economic life into the depressed area.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been circumspect about the growth of ocean gambling in the city, expressing anger in December when the operators of the Sheepshead Bay boat began offering gambling cruises with no warning. After the operators agreed to pay city taxes and submit employees to background checks, the administration allowed the cruises to continue, but submitted legislation to set up a commission to regulate future ventures.
Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, said yesterday that the commission would have to review each application for a boat carefully to determine the impact on surrounding areas, the background of the operators, and the overall effect on the city.
Asked if the administration shares Mr. Vallone's enthusiasm for a fleet of gambling boats, Mr. Mastro declined to comment. But he said the commission would be empowered to limit the overall number of boats. He also expressed skepticism about the money-making potential of the boats, noting that the state of New Jersey collects only $300 million a year from all the casinos in Atlantic City.
"While we are exploring all of these options, we believe that it is unrealistic to expect that kind of tax revenue from any of these gambling boats," he said. "We have consistently said that the city should proceed with caution and prudence in this area."
Casino gambling has been banned in New York City since the 1840's, but no regulations apply once boats are three miles from shore. The Sheepshead Bay yacht, known as the Liberty I, takes about 30 minutes to reach the limit, and has proven popular with gamblers. But its neighbors are less pleased, citing concerns about traffic and crowding.
Mr. Vallone said the Council would move quickly on the bill submitted by the Mayor, and said he supported the same kind of strict regulation that Mr. Giuliani favors. With the failure of a bill to allow casinos in some areas of the state, he said, he expects that other jurisdictions will authorize offshore gambling as an alternative. New York City, he said, must move quickly to beat the rush.
"I think it's a real money-making venture," he said, "and we have to get on board before the ship sails."
The Rockaways plan, initiated by the Chamber of Commerce last week, is still just an optimistic idea at this point, but has won the backing of the development committee of the local Community Board. "We think it will be a shot in the arm for the Rockaways," said Bill Hanson, co-chairman of the committee.
While some Rockaways residents interviewed yesterday expressed reservations about the proposal, many were enthusiastic. Kerriann Daly, who owns Connolly's Bar in Rockaway Beach, said she had been on the Sheepshead Bay boat and would love to see a similar venture in her neighborhood. "Anything that will bring people to Rockaway Beach is a good thing," she said, adding, "I wish we had done it first."

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
Royal Scam

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis 

 BODY:
A FEW WEEKS AGO THE FORMER Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, became the official spokeswoman for Weight Watchers, a subsidiary of the H. J. Heinz Company, the ketchup maker. She will be paid $1 million -- with a bonus if she keeps the fat off -- for appearing several times during the coming year on behalf of Weight Watchers. The world has become so numbed to celebrity endorsements that the arrangement attracted only passing notice: If Bob Dole can hawk Visa cards, why can't Sarah Ferguson peddle diets? But the Duchess's deal is new and a bit different, a footnote to the final chapter of the epochal struggle between aristocratic values and market values.
Today only two classes of citizens in developed countries retain any trace of the old-fashioned snobbish hostility to the market. The first is the Artist. The romantic notion most clearly put by the poet William Blake that "where any view of Money exists Art cannot be carried on" is still in the air in lower Manhattan, though less intoxicating every day to people who actually have to sell what they write, paint, sculpt and compose. You're most likely to hear the sentiment expressed by the lounge lizards and cling-ons of the art world, who want to sound as if they understand art. 
 The other class of antimarket snob is the European Aristocrat. And the European Aristocrats most prone to the snobbery, at least in modern times, have been the English. England is the last place on earth, for instance, where the American bond trader who wants to talk about money is made to feel slightly second-rate; and the higher up in English society he climbs the more second-rate he is made to feel for wearing his money on his sleeve. The trick in England has long been to have money without being seen to make it. Obviously, this aristocratic pose is a shrewd and ugly strategy to demoralize energetic newcomers and to preserve one's own unearned position.
At its most extreme, which it no longer is, the conceit was both obnoxious and counterproductive, one of the reasons Britain became an economic failure. (When Margaret Thatcher set out to kick-start the British economy she first raised the prestige of enterprise by doling out aristocratic honorifics to leading businessmen: Lord Hanson of Hanson Trust, Lord Weinstock of British General Electric.) But buried beneath the pose is at least a shred of genuine moral concern about the small self-abasements and petty deceptions often required to succeed in the marketplace.
 ENTER THE WEIGHT-WATCHING Duchess. In the past, it is true, the royal family has granted British companies the right to use the royal seal on their products. But no member of the royal family, or former member of the royal family, has ever hawked products for hard cash. The Duchess is the first. (And the second. In addition to Weight Watchers, she has signed up to promote Ocean Spray cranberry juice.)
In taking the million dollars from Weight Watchers, the Duchess is selling something that doesn't belong to her: the prestige of the British royal family. (Just as Dole is selling the prestige of the U.S. Senate in taking his money from Visa.) She had nothing to do with building that prestige, though she has had a little to do with destroying it.
About this the buyers could care less, however. According to someone close to the Duchess's affairs, the market response to her deal has been to inundate her with offers to do more of the same. "We've never seen this kind of response before," says this person. "Everyone wants to use her."
No one can say whether the Duchess feels she has abased herself. But her deal with Heinz is perfectly consistent with current market standards of honesty. She hadn't ever tried the current Weight Watchers program until a couple of weeks before the deal was inked. By the time Weight Watchers got to her she had already, on her own, shed the fat that inspired British tabloids to dub her the Duchess of Pork. Weight Watchers cannot honestly imply that it helped a Duchess to lose weight, though of course the company will. Even to claim that its diet keeps a Duchess trim would be not quite true, precisely because the Duchess is taking money to stay trim.
There is only one lesson to be gleaned from the sight of the svelte Duchess stumping for customers: if you are lucky enough to sign a million-dollar deal laced with financial incentives to avoid cream cakes, you will avoid cream cakes. (Or you'll never see another penny.)
There was a time when antimarket snobbery was widely shared by the people at the top of society, to the point where even big businessmen would have been nervous about taking a Duchess to market. But now something like the reverse seems to be true: the Duchess is nervous about not having the businessmen around.
The Queen of England herself recently had to fight public opinion to get her new yacht built with taxpayers' money. As reported in The New York Times on Jan. 23, "the Queen had been concerned that a yacht not paid for by the Government would end up with commercial logos on its funnels, 'out of keeping with the ambiance of the royal yacht.' " The Queen's argument for preserving her ambiance, however, was not that a Queen deserves a yacht simply because she is a Queen. It was that she had cut $3 billion in trade deals on her old yacht. When the Queen of England resorts to the market defense, you know that the jig is up.

Lost in Space on Philadelphia's Independence Mall

BYLINE: By Thomas Hine; Thomas Hine is the author of two books about design and popular culture, "Populuxe" and "The Total Package."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
THIS CITY'S HISTORIC SHRINES are targets for drive-by patriotism -- parking and getting a peek at the Liberty Bell, and a tour of Independence Hall too if you're ambitious. Then, before the meter runs out, you're on your way to Amish country or Atlantic City.
For Independence National Historical Park, this behavior results in expensive facilities that are underused. For the city, it means hit-and-run tourists who don't stay long enough to spend any money. Both park and city are puzzling over how to present the story of the nation's creation to a jaded and impatient public, and it's not easy. 
 A few years ago, when Disney proposed a patriotic theme park near the Civil War battlefield of Manassas in Virginia, the issues seemed clear enough. An ersatz Hollywood version of the American past was threatening a real piece of it.
But suppose you have the real thing: Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and hundreds of public buildings and houses that date from Revolutionary days. How do you present all this authenticity to a public used to having its tourist destinations packaged as entertainment, with theme-park-level maintenance and security? Can the merely real compete with -- or even learn from -- the memorably mock?
Obviously, neither the problems nor their solutions are entirely about design. What Americans learn in school plays a role. As Karen Butler, executive director of Historic Philadelphia Inc. and Mayor Edward G. Rendell's chief adviser on historical tourism puts it, "We have more and more people coming here who know less and less." And no matter how cute you make Benjamin Franklin look, he's no Mickey Mouse.
Still, creating a place where people feel good, even moved, is important. Last month, the National Park Service began a search for a design team for Independence Mall, the largely empty esplanade of three superblocks that stretches nearly half a mile north from Independence Hall to the base of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
The specifications call for a site plan and design guidelines for several new buildings and public spaces that may be built there: a new pavilion for the Liberty Bell, a visitor center, a National Constitution Center and a replacement for an underground garage. But the real task is to create a transition zone that takes visitors out of their cars and gets them interested in all the real stuff the park and the city have to offer.
The plan is urgent because, after many years of neglect, money is beginning to flow into the park. The Pew Charitable Trusts is committed to providing most of the money for a visitor center that will serve both the park and the region. The garage operated by the Philadelphia Parking Authority beneath one block of the mall is to be rebuilt. The city has earmarked $1 million to design a new pavilion for the city-owned Liberty Bell, off the street and closer to Independence Hall. And the National Constitution Center, a private group chartered by Congress, is raising money for a substantial new museum filled with interactive exhibits that it is promoting as "America's project for the millennium."
All this activity has produced several generations of designs. Nearly two years ago, the National Constitution Center presented one in which its high-tech entertaining museum would take up most of the second block of the mall, with the Liberty Bell as its climax. This vision contrasted with the park service's own mall proposal, which would have changed hardly anything.
Last summer, Denise Scott Brown of Venturi Scott Brown & Associates, working for Pew, proposed a massive visitor center that would close the vista at the end of the first block, with the Liberty Bell at its core. (The third block, a little-used tree-filled square designed by Dan Kiley, is to be left alone for now.)
There are good reasons those building on the mall want to grab the Liberty Bell. It's where most tourists want to start, even though its story, a symbol of the antislavery movement during the second third of the 19th century, is chronologically the last of the stories the park attempts to tell.
Philadelphians will tell you that the current home of the Liberty Bell, an elegant though hardly monumental glass pavilion on Market Street, a block north of Independence Hall, is the historic area's biggest problem. It is not, but moving the bell will be a popular, and perhaps necessary, step.
The biggest problem is the mall itself. It offers plenty of room for the arrival and orientation of visitors without compromising any historic buildings. In fact, dozens and dozens of 19th-century buildings that would now be considered historic were razed to create it, but that all happened 40 years ago. It's hard to look at the mall, though, without concluding that it should not have happened.
The mall makes Independence Hall -- in its day one of the largest and most imposing buildings in North America -- look like a toy, an anticlimax of a baroque vista. And it is surrounded by a wall of huge, mostly undistinguished blocky institutional buildings of the 1960's and 70's.
This second-rate patch of Washington at its most inflated and imperial is wildly inappropriate as a setting to commemorate a small group of men coming together in a modest-size room who rashly and brilliantly invented a nation. The room's most precious artifact is an inkwell. But how are visitors to focus on something so small after they've been lost in space on the mall?
The plan proposed by Scott Brown last July sought to deal with the mistake of the mall largely by undoing it. Its approach was to use the visitor center to stop the vista down the mall after only one block. It also intended to relocate the only historic building left on the mall, a late 18th-century Quaker meeting house, to a site diagonally across from Independence Hall. The north side of the visitor center was to be a facade of neon and supergraphics recalling Robert Venturi's unbuilt billboard-based design of 1964 for the College Football Hall of Fame.
ALONG WITH THIS preferred design, Scott Brown proposed a second choice, with the visitor center going on the second block while the Liberty Bell stayed on the first. This formed the basis of the current Park Service plan, which the new designers are being asked to elaborate.
James Pickman, Pew's consultant on the mall, says Scott Brown's design accomplished what it was intended to do, to change the park designers' thinking and get people focused on the implications of the visitor center and the character of the mall. He said the foundation had not yet begun to select an architect for the visitor center.
Clearly, though, the desire to unmake the mall is more a polemic than a possibility. Independence Hall is what gives the mall its mystique. In theme park terms, it's the real, republican equivalent of Disneyland's fantastic royal castle. "The 'Monday Night Football' image -- the Liberty Bell with Independence Hall behind -- is really important," says Ernest Leonardo, director of comprehensive planning for the City Planning Commission, which has pressed the park to rethink the mall.
It is believed that if people can't see Independence Hall from the visitor center, they won't stop. But if a vista down a grand axis is out, will a glimpse from a second-story window be enough? And that's not the only feat the planners will be asked to perform. They are to find ways to connect the mall with the city as a whole, even though the mall is isolated by wide streets and huge structures. Will a view of an 18th-century spire from the bus drop-off do the trick?
How can the mall, an implicitly classical place, become asymmetrical, informal yet dignified, filled with tourists following their own interests yet going to all the places the park and the city want them to visit?
And assuming all these conundrums can be resolved, one large one will remain. However much visitors might want the mall to be like a theme park, it can never be one. It is a public place, one that must accommodate both Presidential speeches and the demonstrators who think the President is wrong. Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell may serve most of the time as backgrounds for photo ops, but they embody democracy, the rule of law and freedom.
The problem of Independence Mall is how to remake an embodiment of cold-war megalomania into a place where a sense of shared civic values is as real as the red brick of the buildings where America was invented.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
The Starry 'Three Sisters' Cast Reveals a Trend

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
ANTON CHEKHOV'S "THREE SISTERS" is a kind of New York perennial, popping up regularly in limited runs (a Russian production, in Russian, appeared at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on Broadway in November) and in Off Broadway experiments (Richard Schechner's version last month, with each of the four acts set in a different time, will play an encore at La Mama from Feb. 26 through March 9). But rarely is it given a Tony-eligible staging, the kind of full-scale, conventionally interpreted treatment meant to withstand the scrutiny of Broadway audiences and critics.
That is the first thing to note about the Roundabout Theater Company production that opens at the Criterion Center on Thursday. But even more remarkable is its cast, a glamorous ensemble of performers -- including Amy Irving as Olga, Jeanne Tripplehorn as Masha and Lili Taylor as Irina, in addition to Billy Crudup, Calista Flockhart, Paul Giamatti, David Marshall Grant, Jerry Stiller, Eric Stoltz and David Strathairn. Many of them have passed up considerably more lucrative Hollywood projects to appear in Chekhov's melancholy, comic masterpiece about how lives go on in one place uneventfully while life goes on somewhere else. 
 Indeed, the production is perhaps the clearest signal yet of a mounting trend: the return, in appreciable numbers, of screen actors to the New York stage. For years, New York theater producers have lamented the loss of talented actors to film and television in Los Angeles. It was where the action, the notoriety, the money were: Have you seen Lily Tomlin, Swoosie Kurtz, Joan Allen, Jason Alexander, Adam Arkin, Scott Bakula, Annette Bening or Kevin Spacey, all Tony nominees in the late 1980's and early 90's, on a New York stage recently?
But now, just as Chekhov's troubled sisters yearn from a distance for the Moscow that once sustained them, so too do many actors, it appears, for New York. And not just the megastars like Al Pacino, who swoop in to great fanfare, do their thing and disappear. Or the coterie of well-known Broadway performers who supplement their livelihoods in film and television, people like Philip Bosco, Bernadette Peters, Nathan Lane, Frank Langella, Bebe Neuwirth, James Naughton and Tony Roberts.
Rather, there is a whole new group of younger actors -- among them Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Anthony LaPaglia and Marisa Tomei, in addition to much of the cast of "Three Sisters" -- who are renewing the primacy of New York theater in the performers' firmament.
"There's a buzz," said Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors Equity, the actors' union. "I'm definitely hearing it from the membership. There's renewed interest in Broadway, and in playing in New York, which is not just Broadway." It's a difficult trend to document, though a list of crossover actors compiled by the union, "Famous Performers on Broadway, 1994-1997," runs to six single-spaced pages. "The ball is bouncing up," Mr. Eisenberg said, "and hasn't yet reached its apogee."
David Marshall Grant, who portrays Kulygin, the dullard married to Masha in "Three Sisters," said, "There's just a tremendous number of people living in actor cyberspace right now, that nonexistent, airplane-shaped place between L.A. and New York." Mr. Grant has played dozens of character roles in films and on television, but is nonetheless best known for his stage work, particularly for his role as Roy Cohn's reluctant protege in "Angels in America," for which he received a Tony nomination.
Why this is happening is also a matter of conjecture. Mr. Grant said that the ease of air travel -- "basically going from New York to L.A. is dinner and a movie" -- has had an impact. A number of performers said in interviews that a perceived revival of New York itself, combined with a perceived decline of Los Angeles, is a factor. Others cited the upsurge in film and television production in New York, the bull market on Wall Street, which has stimulated investment in theater productions, and the rise of independent film making in general.
Among Hollywood actors, "there's always been an interest," said Michael David of Dodger Productions, which produced "The King and I," starring the film actor Lou Diamond Phillips, and "Once Upon a Mattress" with Ms. Parker, both now on Broadway. The problem, Mr. David said, is that the long-term career cost of acting on stage had become untenable, "not just in terms of the money you don't make," but in the necessary time commitment.
Still, in persuading actors to come to Broadway, he said, "we found two things are compelling. One is the recent example of people who have come back and done it; not only did they feel good being here, but it turned out to be good for them to be here. The other is in creating an economic model that allows us to get our money out in a shorter period of time; that induces an actor to say yes."
The economic model almost invariably includes a nonexorbitant salary for the star; the Dodgers were able to bring "Hamlet," with Ralph Fiennes, to Broadway for 14 weeks two years ago largely because Mr. Fiennes took a salary Mr. David described as "wonderfully small."
"It's like, 'If I can do this and not give my life up entirely, why not?' " Mr. David said. "No disrespect, but if you were in the movie business, wouldn't you be looking for something else to do, at least for a little while?"
For many actors, film acting -- with the camera as the audience, scenes filmed out of sequence, hurry-up-and-wait work days and the finished product in the hands of a director and editor -- can be frustrating.
"In the theater, everything you do is about acting," Ms. Parker said. "In the movies, it's about a fifth, or an eighth."
Lanford Wilson, the playwright whose translation of "Three Sisters" is being used in the current production, added: "Actors are interested in acting, and there isn't a lot of acting going on in the stuff being made in Los Angeles."
Frustration is not limited to the set; the roles many actors are being offered in Hollywood do not provide much artistic sustenance. "You don't bother saying it anymore because everyone is saying it," Ms. Parker said, referring to the paucity of good parts in Hollywood movies. "And it's not even about being a woman any more. The choices I have are just not that satisfying."
For Mr. Stoltz, 35, whose screen work has included such films as "Mask," "Singles" and "Pulp Fiction," "Three Sisters" is his second New York play in a row. He said he turned down more lucrative film work to make $1,000 a week at the Roundabout (and considerably less in the Irish Repertory Theater's Off Broadway production of "The Importance of Being Earnest" last fall).
"It depends on how you define success," said Mr. Stoltz, an ordinarily debonair actor who plays the Baron, Irina's homely, doomed suitor, one of several actors whom the director, Scott Elliott, has cast against type. (Amy Irving as a spinster!) "Doing something like this is more enriching than doing a film. Ideally, we'd be getting $20 million to do Chekhov and people in silly movies would be getting B scale."
Mr. Stoltz was one of several in the "Three Sisters" cast who mentioned Chekhov as a compelling reason for signing on. Another is the ensemble nature of the play. "For me, the great joy is the rehearsal period," Ms. Irving said. "The interchange with the director and the other actors, the chance to come up with something you couldn't come up with by yourself. You don't get that in film. You can do a film and never meet your colleagues, and you're at the opening and it's 'Hey, nice to meet you.' "
Mr. Elliott, who was directing Off Off Broadway just a year ago, is now also represented on Broadway by "Present Laughter," and his fast-rising star proved to be part of the attraction. (He is himself testament to the new fluidity between New York and Hollywood; after "Three Sisters," he begins work on a film adaptation of Jane Hamilton's novel "A Map of the World," the first installment of his three-picture deal for Disney.)
The director said he was amazed at the ease with which he cast the play; everyone said yes right away, he said, and only one person pulled out. When Frances McDormand, who was originally cast as Masha, withdrew, she was replaced with a single phone call to Ms. Tripplehorn, who said it was equal parts Chekhov and Elliott that convinced her.
EVEN THE YOUNG STARS with burgeoning Hollywood careers -- like the 27-year-old Mr. Crudup (who plays Solyony, the eccentric soldier in love with Irina) and Ms. Flockhart (Natasha, the shrewish sister-in-law), who made a verbal, not contractual, commitment to the play six months ago -- stayed put. Ms. Flockhart, who is not yet 30, landed her first featured role last year, a plum, as the young fiancee in Mike Nichols's hit film "The Bird Cage." She has not auditioned for any potentially conflicting film since she accepted the role of Natasha in September.
But hypothetically?
"If I were offered a great commercial movie, I'd have to decide," she said, a little nervously. "But I'd have to say I'd pick this and hope the movies would still come around. Theater pays you back, not in cash but in a lot of other ways."

HEADLINE: Plan to Cut Rates At Lilco Nearing Decision on Debt

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
FOR years it has been no secret that one way to cut Lilco rates would be to refinance the staggering debt for the Shoreham nuclear power plant with low-interest tax-exempt state bonds that customers would pay off.
Now, as the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that can issue the bonds, moves closer to announcing a rate-cutting plan that would most likely have debt refinancing as a cornerstone, critics are attacking the approach as ill advised, anticompetitive, premature or simply wrong. 
 At issue is whether the State Public Service Commission, which is not directly involved in the power authority negotiations, could do more to lower electric rates on Long Island.
For many months, the power authority has been working to carry out Gov. George E. Pataki's pledge to cut electric rates on the Island by at least 10 percent. The Public Service Commission has played a secondary role during this period. The commission chairman, John F. O'Mara, said last week that the agency would await the outcome of the L.I.P.A. plan before taking action on Lilco rates.
Any L.I.P.A. agreement would need the approval of the Governor, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Brooklyn, and the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer.
Critics of the P.S.C, said the regulatory agency had failed to take steps to reduce significantly or eliminate the more than $4 billion that Lilco is owed under an agreement in 1989 to close the $5.5 billion plant. Some critics said that when interest was included, the payment under the agreement would be $7 billion.
"The Public Service Commission can order Lilco to write off its stranded asset, the Shoreham nuclear power plant, tomorrow morning, and the rates can drop by one-third," a utility economist, Gregory A. Palast of Southold, said. "They control this company. They have absolute power over it."
Mr. Palast and others said the 1989 pact was binding for just three years. A crucial part of the accord, which the P.S.C. adopted, created a regulatory asset representing the investment of the Long Island Lighting Company in Shoreham that allowed the utility to recover those costs in rates that are the highest in the country except for Hawaii.
Last week the chairman of the commission, Mr. O'Mara, said he believed that the 1989 agreement, with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, remained binding and could not be altered without exposing the state to a successful legal challenge.
"I have been outspoken in the past about how disastrous I think the Shoreham settlement was for the people of Long Island," said Mr. O'Mara, whom Gov. George E. Pataki appointed as chairman. "They are now paying about 24 percent of the rates to pay for that settlement," and would continue to pay for 30 or more years.
"However," Mr. O'Mara said, "the advice I got from our legal staff and my own conclusion is that nothing could be done short of creating liability for the state."
An expert on utility finances, Charles M. Studness, said the commission could alter rates without directly addressing the agreement, adding, "The P.S.C. has extraordinary flexibility."
Others said the commission had less latitude. "Given the legal constraints under which the commission is operating, it could not do significantly more than it has done," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association. Mr. Crosson said the business group would withhold comments on a plan by the Long Island Power Authority until after it had been proposed and analyzed. "What we don't want to see happen is that everyone on Long Island is surprised by the consequences of a deal," he said.
Some business interests reportedly have misgivings about a plan that would involve bonds that the authority would repay through electric rates. Such an approach could create a situation in which the authority would oppose new forms of competition because of the need to pay off the bonds.
The cost of the bonds would also be reflected in the cost of electricity, adding to the cost that entrepreneurs could import. The chairman of the power authority, Frank G. Zarb, has said the plan will be announced by next month.
Last week Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato said that Mr. Zarb would deliver the best plan possible to cut rates and that it was not credible that Mr. Zarb and others, including a trustee of the authority, Richard M. Kessel, would be involved with a rate reduction that ignored an opportunity for customers to save.
"I don't blame people for being concerned," Mr. D'Amato said. "I certainly want the highest possible rate reduction. I am for whatever plan will do that."
He added: "We are limited" by the 1989 agreement, which "does not permit what some of these people are advocating." He said he had been told by officials in the Pataki administration that the plan of the power authority could save customers up to $300 million a year.
A former Suffolk County Executive, John V. N. Klein, said the expected authority plan dwarfed considerations of whether the P.S.C. had done enough to lower rates.
Mr. Klein, Mr. Kessel and a number of business leaders joined Lilco in September to oppose a 5 percent rate cut that the commission was considering. They said the cuts would harm electric service and reliability. The commission postponed a vote and has not rescheduled one.
"The reality is that the rate proceedings have been totally subsumed by the prospective humongous complicated combination of the merger and some kind of a deal by the power authority," Mr. Klein said. "It's like two bugs struggling over a crumb when they are about to be run over by a steamroller."
The Energy Rate Reduction Council, a new coalition of 13 large Long Island retailers and the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' group, took a different position.
Harry Davitian, president of Entek Power Services of Setauket and a spokesman for the council, told a State Assembly committee last month that any sale of state bonds to finance a plan by the power authority should be carried out only after the P.S.C. had taken steps to lower rates, if at all.
"The commission has let this important effort fade into oblivion," Mr. Davitian said. "We are deeply troubled by the seeming unwillingness of the commission to carry through with this process it began with so much promise."
Mr. Davitian said the commission "should establish a long-term rate plan with price caps that lower Lilco's rates to levels that reflect market prices over a reasonable period of time. There is nothing sacrosanct about the 1988-1989 Shoreham settlement."
In an interview, Mr. O'Mara also dismissed a widely heard view that Mr. Pataki had directed the commission to suspend proceedings to lower Lilco rates while the power authority negotiated with Lilco.
"Because the discussions have been going forward between the Long Island Power Authority, Lilco and Brooklyn Union," Mr. O'Mara said, "it seemed to me to be just a matter of common sense that we not act precipitously to interfere with what I think reasonably holds out the promise for double-digit rate decreases on Long Island. We have not been asked to hold our proceeding in abeyance by the Governor."
Other critics contend that Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, prefer a rate reduction that would include a bond sale because that would be lucrative for their supporters on Wall Street.
"If you deliver to Wall Street $200,000 to $300,000 in various kinds of fees, certainly this is going to come back to them in nice amounts," Mr. Studness said. "That is the driving force behind this. That is why D'Amato and Pataki prefer L.I.P.A over the P.S.C."
Mr. D'Amato said that was absurd, adding: "It's horrible. It doesn't deserve comment."
Mr. D'Amato confirmed a widely held belief that he had been promoting an authority plan to cut rates. "Am I encouraging it?" he said. "You'd better believe it."
Another issue before the P.S.C. is the proposed merger between Lilco and Brooklyn Union Gas. The utilities, which announced a plan on Dec. 28, said a merger would save $1 billion over 10 years.
Mr. O'Mara said last week that "any plan that holds out double-digit rate relief" deserved consideration. He said that the merger, as he understood it, was "the first step in a process which will then have the merged companies negotiating with the Long Island Power Authority to complete the other action."
Critics said the merger, which many of them oppose, and the power authority's assumption of the Shoreham debt would weigh against electric and gas competition on Long Island far into the future, denying the region lower prices that competition could bring.
Wayne Prospect, a former Suffolk County Legislator who is an adviser to the Hauppauge Industrial Association, said his group was "opposing the proposed merger, because it is contingent on Lilco's ratepayers paying monopoly prices for electricity."
The association is a member of another new coalition of business, civic and environmental groups that opposes the merger and refinancing of the Shoreham debt.
"The best way to deal with the Shoreham debt is for Albany to force Lilco to write it off as a bad debt," Mr. Prospect said. "Don't transform it into a public debt."

The New Approach in Arverne: Incrementalism

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
HOW do you give a two-family New York City house a "beachy" look?
That is one of the problems the architects face in designing houses for the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, where the Briarwood Organization, a development company based in Bayside, has won the city's designation to develop 161 unsubsidized two-family houses -- a total of 322 housing units -- on 15 acres of vacant land. 
 It will be the first time in the 35-year history of the 302-acre Arverne urban renewal site that a market-rate development has been built -- that is, one in which no public funds will be used to reduce rents or sales prices to a level affordable to an income-targeted population. At the Briarwood development there will be no governmentally prescribed limitations on the income of buyers.
Briarwood's architect, Fakler/Eliason & Associates of Fresh Meadows, Queens, would like to satisfy the Department of Housing Preservation and Development's wish to see a house that reflects the near-the-waterfront location of the property. Complicating its task is the fact that Briarwood is a masonry-wall and concrete-plank builder, and the facade touches that might be considered beachy are harder to produce in that construction form, the architect says, than they are in wood-frame houses.
Design is in its early stages now that Briarwood has the contract to produce houses on empty land between Beach 74th Street and Beach 72d Street, as well as various infill sites between Beach 61st Street and Beach 59th Street. The houses are expected to go on the market for about $210,000 to $225,000 each, for earliest occcupancy next spring. The developer expects home prices to rise over time, perhaps to $245,000 to $250,000 during a sales period that will likely run until mid-1999.
"We'll probably have balconies on the buildings that are three stories," said Edward C. Eliason, the architect, "but we're still trying to decide what 'beachy' means." The builder has the idea that color will help. The brick on the facade is expected to be a light gray instead of dark red, and the roof shingles and building trim will probably be done in light blue.
There will also be a private road network within the enormous block -- the site runs 880 feet on 73d Street and 900 feet of 74th Street, so that the outdoor parking can be on-site -- within the block -- rather than on the street, with half the homes in clusters of separate buildings facing inward, and the rest facing the street, something like dominos placed at right angles to each other.
Complementing the housing development will be 75,000 square feet of new stores on land between Beach 73d Street, Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 69th Street, a 200,000-square-foot site, with offstreet parking. Jobco Inc. of Great Neck, L.I., and Halmar Construction Corporation in Mount Vernon are the designated developers.
ALL of this represents the new shift to incrementalism in developing the largely barren Arverne urban renewal tract. In the late 80's during the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, developers were invited to submit proposals for building out the entire site over many years, providing a minimum of 7,000 housing units, or as many as 10,000, and handling the infrastructure development costs themselves. A team headed by Forest City Enterprises, based in Cleveland, bid $90 million for the land and was selected as the developer. Its plan envisioned an eventual 7,500 new housing units.
Interestingly, the Briarwood Organization itself was part of a different development team that lost out with a bid of $60 million. "We were lucky we didn't get it," said Vincent L. Riso, president of Briarwood. Forest City Enterprises is said to have spent over $2 million in developing plans for the site, which were never used because the bottom dropped out of the real estate market in the early 90's.
Now the planning for future development has started over, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens announcing the appointment of the consulting firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, of Manhattan, to do a six-month market study to figure out what form of development should be undertaken.
On that score, local residents have already made known their preferences through the urban renewal committee of Community Board 14. It has called for a maximum of 400 two-family houses (800 units) on the west end of the urban renewal site (from Beach 73d Street to Beach 59th Street), and no housing at all on the east end (Beach 59th Street to Beach 32d Street).
Instead, the committee wants to see diversified economic-development projects -- such as a resort hotel and conference center, or an ocean museum and learning center, or an indoor amusement center. "There is a feeling that a good portion needs to be kept in its natural state," said Delores Orr, head of the committee.
Historically, there has been an enormous public investment in clearing the urban renewal land for new development. It happened mainly in the 60's and 70's. Even the earlier extension of the subway system to the Rockaways was predicated on the idea that the peninsula should undergo major development. Much public housing or otherwise government-assisted high-rise housing was also built, much of it outside the urban renewal area. But the days of public subsidies with which to build new high-rise housing exclusively for occupancy by people who cannot afford market rents or prices is past.
Apart from lengthy controversy over what form new development in Arverne should take, there was the question in the 70's and beyond of how the high cost of infrastructure development would be borne. The strong real-estate market of the 80's seemed to hold the answer -- private developers would pay. But by the time the city got around to implementing that policy, the market opportunity had passed.
THE plan was to get a development team to take on the burden of the estimated $200 million that was needed for storm and sanitary sewers, a sanitary sewer pumping station, a 48-inch-wide water main and pipes, a six-lane boulevard, 45 acres of new public parkland, a firehouse and two 600-seat elementary schools. The Forest City team planned to develop condominium housing over many years and sell at prices that would justify its investment.
Even in the 80's many builders doubted the feasibility of the city's plan, despite generally encouraging market conditions. But on the sites that have been awarded by the Giuliani administration, the infrastructure investment needed is relatively modest. And Briarwood is paying $5,000 per house (or $2,500 per housing unit) for the land.
From the public sector will come $7 million for sewer and water connections, streets and curbs for the new residences and stores. Half the money is coming from city funds and the other half from discretionary funds available to the Queens Borough President.
Her contribution calls attention to what has been a growing role by Borough Presidents outside Manhattan to use discretionary funds to boost housing production. According the the office of City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden allocated $6 million for housing over the three-year 1995-1997 period, and Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer allocated $5.1 million.
Ms. Shulman also said she was using $1.75 million of her funds to help advance relocation and property acquisition for new houses that are eventually to be built under the New York Housing Partnership program on 134 acres in the Edgemere section of Rockaway Peninsula, with sales restricted to households earning roughly $25,000 to $70,000 a year.
The site is just north of the eastern section of Arverne, between Beach 30th and Beach 50th Streets. There are to be 800 housing units in 400 owner-occupied two-family homes, mainly on infill land amid already existing housing. The plan is expected to be ready for public land-use review, following preliminary examination by the Department of City Planning, within the next month.

HEADLINE: Skepticism Over School Pledge

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
WHAT appears at first glance to be good news from Albany for the schools -- increased state aid, assurances of no cuts to districts and reduced property taxes -- has been met with cautious enthusiasm and some skepticism from Westchester superintendents.
"It sounds like we're getting all this money, but I'm still trying to understand it,"said Dr. Marjorie E. Castro, Superintendent of the Croton-Harmon School District. "Probably we're not getting more money. Districts have been getting less state aid in the last few years. We're dealing with certioraris, and our tax base is shrinking. We're going to have a difficult year, and as we prepare our budget, we're going to talk about realities and what we think we're going to get." 
 Dr. Frank Tota, Superintendent of the Dobbs Ferry School District, said, "The Governor's overall state approach is excellent, but it may not do any good for Westchester."
Among Gov. George E. Pataki's proposalsannounced last month was a provision to reduce property taxes in the next four years and increase state aid to districts to help make up the difference. State aid to schools, currently at $10.2 billion, would be increased by $302 million under the Governor's plan.
The Governor's $1.7 billion school property tax cut would be mirrored by an additional $1.7 billion in state aid, which would be phased in during the next four years. Under this proposal, Mr. Pataki called for annual school tax increases of no more than 4 percent, or the rate of inflation, whichever would be lower. There would be exceptions to that regulation in the case of enrollment increases, a two-thirds district vote and additional first-time revenue from new taxable construction.
Some superintendents are skeptical of what they perceive as a political gambit in negotiations between the Legislature and the Governor's office. "The Governor is trying to control educational costs, and thinks he is doing everybody a favor,"said Dr. Stanley Toll, Superintendent of the Ardsley School District. "Taking a number like 4 percent is ridiculous. It's a number out of thin air. My costs for health care are going to go up, and I can't control inflation."
Dr. Ronald Valenti, Superintendent of the Harrison School District, said: "I endorse any effort to reduce the burden on the local taxpayer. But much of the tax-rate increases today were caused by state aid cuts in 1990. I'd like to see the state restore us to the aid level we were receiving in 1990. The problem was caused by Albany."
To many superintendents, the package appears appealing, but most of them say they would like to see more concrete figures to justify the Governor's plan. Many districts still face the burden of repaying certiorari claims against them by corporations and local businesses and are not expecting compensatory revenue increases.
"We're pleased to see the Governor is focusing on support for education from Albany," said Dr. Donald Kusel, Superintendent in the district serving Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow. "I'm curious to see how he is going to be able to increase aid to education, reduce property taxes and give a tax cut on the state income tax."
Some superintendents are worried that residents, especially older ones, are receiving an unclear and incomplete message about the budget's perceived benefits. "The Governor is proposing a huge tax relief in general, not Rye Neck in particular," said Peter Mustich, Superintendent of the Rye Neck schools. "It's not a big windfall for Rye Neck. I'm also concerned about the difficulty we may face in presenting the budget if the Governor keeps telling senior citizens they will be seeing tax cuts."
Given the burdensome nature of the seasonal budget ritual, with such uncertainties about final state aid numbers from Albany, it might seem as if districts would be tempted to look at their nonprofit school foundations as auxiliary partners in the budget process.
Despite the increasing prevalence of the foundations, which have been established in the last few years to help provide amenities not usually included in the basic school budget, superintendents are clear about the function these foundations serve.
"We have an explicit mission statement not to substitute for money in our operating budget,"said Dr. John A. Chambers, Superintendent of the Bronxville schools. "Our foundation offers opportunities to strengthen curriculum and to act as a catalyst for new programs."
Most of the time, the line between district expenses and foundation support is clear. In Rye Neck, for example, school officials and members of the Parent-Teacher Association are not members of the foundation board. "We've been very cautious," said Mr. Mustich, who as Superintendent visits the foundation twice a year to discuss the district's goals. "None of our community-fund people have overlapping roles. We tried to get diverse community members, so the foundation would develop programs for the community at large."
Dr. Valenti said: "At no time did we suggest that our foundation assume any of the responsibilities of the district. If a district is not clear on that point from the beginning, it can be slippery. The role of our foundation is to provide seed money for projects and to complement our regular budget. The foundation will supplement what the voters provide, not supplant it."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
New Canaan Acts to Condemn Rental Complex Site

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
IN almost five years of bickering between New Canaan and Avalon Properties over the developer's proposal to build a mixed-use project on Elm Street, the state's courts have consistently ruled against the town.
Nevertheless, the town has appropriated $5 million to buy the property through its power of eminent domain and condemn it for use as a municipal parking lot. 
 While condemnation itself is not unusual, both Jay Sandak, Avalon's lawyer, and Robert W. Reeves, the lawyer representing the town, agree that this is the first time that any municipality in the state has attempted to take property that the courts have previously ruled must be allowed to be developed as planned.
Condemnation was approved in a nonbinding referendum last December by a 2 to 1 vote of some 3,600 townspeople out of a total population of 18,150.
But at a hearing last Monday in Superior Court in Stamford before Judge William B. Lewis in which Avalon sought a temporary injunction to halt the town's action, Avalon agreed not to start construction and the town agreed not to proceed with condemnation pending the results of a lawsuit by Avalon scheduled to start in April.
The suit will challenge New Canaan's effort to condemn and its ability to do so under Connecticut law requiring the exercise of good faith in condemnation proceedings. "I think this is a proper course to follow," said Mr. Sandak.
Avalon, which is based in Wilton, optioned the New Canaan site in 1991, and in the next two years it filed five proposals for rental apartments, stores and offices, each time complying with new suggestions or mandates by New Canaan's Planning and Zoning Commission.
In 1992 the commission unanimously approved a zoning change for the project but subsequently denied applications for site plan approval, based on density, height, setbacks, unsuitability to the neighborhood and other complaints.
Twenty-one of the 104 apartments in the project were to be priced about $1,000 below the market rate of around $2,000 to $2,500 in accordance with the state's affordable housing law of 1989. The law gives developers offering a fifth of their total units to buyers whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the area's median (in this case, the median is $74,000) a density bonus of 20 percent.
In addition, the law shifts the burden of proof in denying such applications to the municipality. The developer formerly had to show compliance with regulations and provide assurance that no harm would come to the community. Now the towns must prove that the development is detrimental to the community in order to deny an application.
In 1993 Avalon filed an appeal in Superior Court in Hartford. In 1994 the commission agreed to a compromise negotiated as a result of a stipulated judgment by the court, but soon withdrew its approval. In 1995 Judge A. William Mottolese overturned the commission's action, ruling that "the record fails to reveal any evidence of the nature or extent of any claimed detrimental effect on neighboring properties" and "the commission has failed to sustain the burden of proof that its decision is necessary to protect substantial public interest in health, safety or other zoning matters."
The town appealed, but the Appellate Court affirmed the lower court ruling in 1996, and the State Supreme Court refused to hear the case when approached by the town that same year.
Avalon plans to take whatever additional legal action is necessary to eventually build 104 rental apartments and 15,000 square feet of stores and offices in the project it calls Town Close. "New Canaan started out believing that they would wear us down," said Charles Berman, president and chief executive of Avalon, "but they won't."
"New Canaan is not atypical," said Timothy Hollister, Avalon's Hartford lawyer. "Being told by the state that they have to provide affordable housing has generated wrath in many towns."
HE said that an informal survey under way by lawyers, developers and municipal consultants showed that only 120 units had been completed under the law, due in part to the recession of the early 90's. But 650 units have been approved and are seeking financing, he added, and 600 more are in litigation.
"We don't think this is a case about affordable housing," said Mr. Reeves of Cummings & Lockwood in Stamford, the town's lawyer. "If the town has been slow to condemn this most important piece of property to solve its parking problems, no town is anxious to spend a lot of money to condemn someone's property."
According to Peter Murphy, New Canaan's administrative officer, more than $50,000 has been spent on legal fees, and $5.25 million has been appropriated to buy the site and develop a parking lot. "If a higher purchase price is set by the courts," he said, "the town is committed to pay it." Avalon's costs for land acquisition, architectural, legal and engineering fees have exceeded $6 million.
Opposition to the New Canaan project has been led by Citizens for New Canaan, described as a charitable trust by its founding member, Dudley C. Phillips, a local lawyer.
"I could see from the beginning that Avalon wanted to pack the property with as much as possible, not consistent with anything else in town," he said. "We raised $15,000 to pay for petitions soliciting the referendum and the campaign to persuade voters to overturn the Town Council's original vote not to condemn the property."
After the referendum the Town Council reversed itself and voted 11 to 1 in favor of condemnation. "In a democracy," said John Heatherington, a Council member who switched his vote to approve condemnation, "there's always a certain tension between the duty to exercise independent judgment and the duty to carry out what your constituents expect you to do."
Said Richard Bond, the First Selectman: "Parking is the only issue in this matter as far as I'm concerned." Referring to a 1972 study, he noted that "the town then needed 700 parking spaces."
"In 1986 the town business plan suggested that the town acquire the Elm Street property for parking," he said. "With growth in population we need 800 spaces. The Elm Street lot would give us 370."
AVALON offered to make 170 spaces available to commuters out of 309 underground spaces planned in its project; the town offered Avalon $5 million for the site. Both offers were refused.
"Those spaces would only be available if Avalon's tenants weren't using them," explained Mr. Bond.
"We are paying taxes on $6 million and a completed development would be worth millions more," said Mr. Berman of Avalon's rejection of the town's offer.
James Bennett, a lawyer and a 10-year member of the Planning and Zoning Commission, most recently as its chairman, was not reappointed at the end of his three-year term in December. "I was the only one scratched," he said. Considered a moderate voice on the commission, he said, "I don't have an answer to why a development looking so much like the rest of town was rejected."
"Parking is not the problem, there are vacant lots," said Carl Kuehner, a developer of high-end homes who grew up in New Canaan. "A number of my peers have moved away because they can't afford it. The town itself hasn't sat down and come up with a compromise. It can write large checks for appeals." During a 15-year history of the site, Earl Smith, the former owner, tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the town. His efforts to develop an office building failed to attract financing during the recent recession, and he completed a sale to Avalon in 1995 for $4.35 million, after Avalon had obtained a favorable court ruling.
Leo E. Karl 3d, whose family has owned the Karl Chevrolet dealership on Elm Street since 1927, is concerned with the rights of the private property owner. "If I put an extension on my house and the neighbors didn't like it," he asked, "could they go to the town and have my house condemned and take it?"
