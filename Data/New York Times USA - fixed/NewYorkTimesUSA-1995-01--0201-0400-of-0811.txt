Paterson Remains In Financial Crisis

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., Jan. 6

 BODY:
Paterson is not bankrupt, but it is still in financial crisis. The reason? Political infighting.
Since the start of the fiscal year here in July, the City Council has approved temporary budgets each month. This month it balked, trying to pressure Mayor William Pascrell to make more cuts in his budget, originally submitted at $134 million and trimmed to $133.1 million. 
 So, by law, the state's third-largest city cannot pay its employees or vendors even though it has the money to do so.
 On Tuesday, the council will try again to pass a temporary budget.
 If it doesn't, the Mayor will begin emergency operations, including pooling all city gasoline supplies for police use. Today, he ordered all departments to stop using city vehicles unless absolutely necessary. Even so, Mr. Pascrell said he expects the gas supply to run out by midweek.
 He also has contingency plans to close all city agencies except the police and fire departments and to shut down the city courts except for one judge to handle arraignments.
 "This is trench warfare," Mr. Pascrell said. "Welcome to urban America."

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: ISSUES AND AGENDAS -- Liberal Anger, States' Hope And a Technology Debate;
Liberals: Bitter Attacks On the President

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
While the spotlight was focused on a bit of immediate fencing between Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders, there were also a number of gatherings in Washington yesterday that foreshadowed the shape of some of the policy making -- and policy battles -- to come during the next two years.
Dazed and angry, the remnants of the political left gathered here today to serve notice on President Clinton that they would not stand by silently while he sought accommodation with Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican Congressional leaders. 
 Indeed, some prominent liberals said that unless Mr. Clinton abided by what they consider Democratic principles, he could expect increased sniping from their wing of the party, and perhaps a challenge for the 1996 Presidential nomination from a candidate like the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
The liberals met at the annual conference of the National Rainbow Coalition. In past years, the gathering was little more than a showcase for Mr. Jackson, the organization's founder, and whatever cause he chose to highlight. But the Republican sweep in the November elections and Mr. Clinton's apparent readiness to shift to the right infused this meeting with a greater sense of urgency.
Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the participants felt "marginalized, relegated to the outside," and that they were "being told that they are the biggest losers in the country."
Yet the November outcome, many of them said, has also provided liberation.
For the last two years, participants said, they have held their tongues while the Administration pursued an agenda that they had a hard time accepting. They backed the President's health care plan even though they preferred a single-payer system. They kept quiet about the crime bill even as it expanded the Federal death penalty. They accepted his deficit reduction plan even though they felt he had not fought hard enough for his defeated economic stimulus package.
Now, they say, given the new Republican control of Congress, along with the defeat of several leading centrist Democrats last November, there is no need to keep quiet.
"It was a pretty dispirited last two years, some of which was reflected in both turnout and activism in the last election," said Robert Borosage, head of the Campaign for New Priorities, which advocates the shifting of military spending to domestic programs. "Now they're free. As a minority, the Democrats can't deliver the President's program on the Hill, so they are free to make their own case."
Indeed, participants at the meeting were as critical of Mr. Clinton and Democratic moderates as of Mr. Gingrich and the "Contract With America." Many of them -- labor and civil rights leaders, members of the clergy and representatives of women's and gay rights groups -- described the President as weak, vacillating and otherwise lacking in leadership.
Mr. Jackson, who continues to drop hints that he may challenge Mr. Clinton for the 1996 nomination or run as a third-party candidate, said he would become increasingly aggressive, given what he called the President's abandonment of the liberal agenda. "In that vacuum," he said in an interview, "I've had to step up the tempo to mobilize progressive forces to fight."
Mr. Jackson was scornful of the White House's decision to invite Mr. Gingrich and his mother, Kathleen, for a visit after Mrs. Gingrich said in a television interview that her son had referred to the President's wife, Hillary, as "a bitch."
"These guys just fire away at him at will," Mr. Jackson said, "and now he's giving Newt's mother a tour of the White House while those of us who mobilized voters can't get a meeting."
The participants' attacks on Mr. Clinton were such that Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, was led to warn them against a debilitating round of wounding their friends.
"They're frustrated because things aren't going well," Mr. Frank said in an interview. "What's going to happen is after six months, more of the anger is going to focus on where I think it ought to be: on the Republicans."

Science: Agencies Defend Their Records

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
While the spotlight was focused on a bit of immediate fencing between Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders, there were also a number of gatherings in Washington yesterday that foreshadowed the shape of some of the policy making -- and policy battles -- to come during the next two years.
The chiefs of a number of the Government's science and technology agencies came calling on Capitol Hill today, pledging cooperation with the new Congress and suggesting that they were already doing much of what the Republican leaders say they want. 
 Congressional Republicans are advancing an approach in which they would try to save money by having Government agencies focus more on basic technical research while granting incentives to encourage private industry to assume more of the nation's applied-research tasks.
In testimony today before the newly renamed House Science Committee, the agency heads, while vowing a willingness to work with the new majorities, cautioned against Government research cuts that might prove too broad.
One witness, Dr. John H. Gibbons, the White House science adviser, said the Government had a vital role in promoting technologies that are critical to economic growth and new jobs but that cannot attract adequate private investment.
Another, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, said the Government should continue cooperative research with industry, an initiative, he noted, begun under the Bush Administration.
And Daniel S. Goldin, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the space agency was "committed to revolutionary change" by functioning more efficiently with less money and forming more partnerships with business to enhance the transfer of the latest technical information to industry.
Representative Robert S. Walker, the Pennsylvania Republican who is now chairman of the House panel, formerly the Science, Space and Technology Committee, acknowledged the agencies' past accomplishments but said Republicans were concerned about the Government's sponsoring research that they thought industry should be conducting on its own.
Scientific research is more than just Government programs, Mr. Walker said, and both lawmakers and the agencies should be considering incentives to spur private industry involvement and new approaches to solving technical problems.
Even as they pledged cooperation, some agency heads cautiously took issue with provisions of the "Contract With America."
For instance, Mr. Brown, saying there was no "one-size-fits-all formula for insuring that our companies lead the world in innovation," questioned a proposal that would eliminate his department's Advanced Technology Program for industrial research and other cooperative initiatives with industry. Those programs, he said, are efforts to develop general technology that would give American business a competitive edge.
Mr. Gibbons, the White House science adviser, said he as well had concerns about some Republican proposals. The United States needs science to "nourish our national soul as well as economic well-being," he said, and should move cautiously in cutting programs.
"Science and technology," Mr. Gibbons said, "is the seed corn, and we have to resist the temptation to eat that seed corn rather than plant it."
Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, pledged to continue efforts to include more scientific information in writing regulations, for example by using risk assessment to help quantify risk and balance it against the cost of regulation. But she questioned some provisions of the Republican-proposed Risk Assessment Act, which she suggested would slow decision making and perhaps prevent needed regulation.
"We don't think that under the risk provisions of the 'Contract With America' that we could have banned lead in gasoline," Ms. Browner said, "and that would have been tragic."
Ms. Browner said her agency was already streamlining its regulation process and consolidating its operations. Its research effort, she said, has been reduced to 3 laboratories and 2 national centers from a total of 15 laboratories.

HEADLINE: Mexican Workers Will Bear Brunt of Peso's Fall

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mexico's currency has fallen 30 percent in two weeks (front page, Jan. 4). Will this eliminate the trade deficit that caused the free fall? Conventional economics tells us it will. But in "Mexican Trade Won't Gain From Devaluation" (letter, Dec. 30) Jude Wanniski argues that except for short-term effects, it will not.
Conventional economics has been notoriously unable to explain the persistence of trade imbalances in the face of large movements in exchange rates. Yet Mr. Wanniski is wrong to go to the opposite extreme, for devaluations do occasionally improve trade balances. 
 He notes that the 40 percent initial drop in the dollar value of the peso led almost immediately to demands from Mexican labor leaders for a 40 percent increase in wages to offset the loss in purchasing power. If these wage demands were met, the dollar costs of Mexican products would remain essentially unchanged, so that there would be no real change in Mexico's competitive position and balance of trade -- except for short-term effects from already committed trade contracts.
There is no reason to believe that nominal wages automatically rise to compensate for losses of purchasing power. Unless they are indexed to some relevant measure of the cost of living, any sharp, sudden increase in costs (including costs of imports) will reduce the real wage and harm the standard of living of workers.
In the United States, according to the World Bank, from 1980 to 1992 real wages rose 6 percent while productivity rose 14 percent. In Mexico, real wages fell 29 percent as productivity rose a whopping 47 percent.
None of this is a secret to governments, business leaders and international agencies. The announced plan of the Mexican Government is to get business leaders to hold down prices (in return for tax concessions) and to get unions to hold nominal wage increases to a modest level (and also to agree to equivalent productivity increases).
But key Government officials have made clear, as you report Dec. 30, that the real strategy is to "require severe concessions from labor, deep cuts in public spending and a temporary slowdown in economic growth," in the hope of reducing the trade deficit.
The Mexican situation illustrates that devaluations can improve trade balance by shifting the burden onto working people -- as so often happens in the less-developed world. But this requires a sociopolitical environment in which workers are unable to maintain, let alone improve, their standard of living.
In these bleak times, when the balance has shifted so much against working people everywhere, it is easy to forget that it was not always so, and certainly need not always be so.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Politics; Everyone's Port Authority

BYLINE: By Richard C. Leone; Richard C. Leone, president of the 20th Century Fund, was chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1990 to 1994.

 BODY:
For seven decades, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has provided not only the building blocks but sometimes even the leadership that helped shape the economic destiny of two states and the nation's largest city. Its strength comes from a solid financial reputation, a willingness to plan for the long run, a capacity to build big projects -- and, not least, a tradition of nonpartisan professional competence. Today, that tradition is in serious jeopardy.
Stanley Brezenoff, the latest in a long line of accomplished administrators to serve as executive director of the Port Authority, is to resign on Feb. 2. This week, people close to Gov. George E. Pataki said the job would be offered to Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island -- who, as it happens, was the leading Republican politician from New York City to support Mr. Pataki in the fall campaign. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Molinari declined the offer, and the search goes on. Another name that keeps surfacing is that of Joseph Mondello, the longtime Nassau County Republican chairman. Mr. Mondello's background, as a professional politician and head of the county's Offtrack Betting Corporation, doesn't fit the profile of a tested public manager who will sustain the Port Authority's reputation for professionalism.
 Under the compact that created the authority in 1921, the governors of New York and New Jersey appoint the board and executive director. (By tradition, the executive director is a New Yorker and the board chairman a New Jerseyan.) Until now, governors from both states and both parties have given the agency a large measure of autonomy and insulated it from politics.
That sense of independence helped it build a vast portfolio of regional assets: three major airports, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge, the PATH rail system, the great ports of Newark and New York, and much more. While other parts of government were stretched to the limit of fiscal capacity, the Port Authority has been able and willing to invest in projects that were perceived as complex and even risky. Some of these, like the World Trade Center and Newark Airport, succeeded beyond anyone's expectations.
 To be sure, politics always had a place in the selection of the executive director. But it was kept in its place. The man who built the modern Port Authority, Austin Tobin, served for 30 years largely because he was so good at it. His successors were chosen and lauded because their professional qualities transcended their political sponsorship.
 Mr. Pataki is new to metropolitan issues, but some of his close allies -- notably Mr. Molinari and Senator Alfonse D'Amato -- have long histories of shortsighted and slashing criticism of the Port Authority. If the recent reports about the executive directorship are accurate, the voices whispering names in the new Governor's ear have neither his nor the region's best interests in mind.
 Professional competence (or lack of it) is not the only issue that threatens the Port Authority. The pressure to cut taxes is forcing elected officials into a "sell anything to get through the night" approach to public investment. Last year, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman milked New Jersey's state pension funds for $1 billion to deliver on her campaign promise of a tax cut. Even President Clinton is talking about one-shot revenue raisers, like selling the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve, to finance his proposed tax cut.
 Then there is the current mania for privatization of public services and public assets, which has led to proposals from Mr. Pataki, among others, to sell the three major airports.
This fantasy of windfalls overlooks not only the need to pay off the holders of the Port Authority's long-term bonds in any sale of assets, a hugely expensive and disruptive prospect, but also the authority's advantages, as a public agency that can issue tax-exempt bonds, over any private agency that might succeed it. And do the preachers of privatization realize that most airport operations are already in private hands? Of the 63,000 people who work at the three airports, just 2,000 are Port Authority employees and 588 of those are police officers.
 There may be a better case for selling the World Trade Center, but even that must be approached with caution, given the troubles of lower Manhattan's real estate market. And what private owner would have provided $15 million to help small business and individual workers affected by the terrorist bombing in 1993?
If privatization is going to be honestly debated and thoroughly evaluated, Mr. Pataki would do well to appoint an executive director who is well-versed and open-minded on the subject, rather than grease the skids by naming a privatization zealot. The Port Authority may be the metropolitan area's last remaining public institution that can think and act beyond the next political campaign. But to do so, it will need exceptional leadership.
That is why its top job must not be treated as a juicy political plum. If Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Whitman want to do something dramatic for the Port Authority, why don't they abandon the old system of dividing the appointments, let the board chairmanship rotate between the two states and institute a nonpartisan selection process to find the best available public servant in the region?

HEADLINE: CRIME

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
The dead, the near dead and the living dead haunt Michael Dibdin's DEAD LAGOON (Pantheon, $21). The morbid title comes from the lifeless swamps and salt marshes that Venetians call the laguna morta and that the author uses as a powerful symbol for a great city in stagnation.
Melancholy images of death and decay overwhelm Aurelio Zen when the high-ranking ministry officer visits his native Venice on a secret assignment involving the kidnapping of an American businessman. To maintain his cover, Zen pretends to look into the charges of a batty noblewoman that ghosts have invaded her palazzo. The international incident takes Zen into the contemporary underworld of drug dealers and corrupt civil officials, while the Contessa's poignant story plunges him deep into his own past and into the wartime history of the city. 
 The plots of Mr. Dibdin's four earlier Aurelio Zen mysteries were so delicately complex they might have been spun by spiders. But here the author has transcended his own superb craftsmanship by working both story lines into a structure of pure steel -- and by making it the foundation of a serious study of modern-day Venice.
"The city has turned into a geriatric hospital," an old friend tells Zen. "There's no work, no houses, and all our taxes go to line the pockets of some Mafia fat cats down south." Zen's compulsive wanderings through the working-class precincts of the city confirm this gloomy picture. But his uneasy concern for the city's depressed economy turns into real alarm when he sees the gathering strength of a new separatist party with a fascistic political agenda. To his horror, he watches his closest childhood friends marching for a new city-state, "a Venice cut off from the rest of Italy and Europe, inhabited by pure-blooded, dialect-speaking, 100 percent Venetians."
Zen does his heroic best to save the city of his birth. But like any other tourist, he has to bow his head and admit, "I'm a stranger here myself."
Jonathan Kellerman's psychologist sleuth, Alex Delaware, is always up on trendy issues in forensic medicine. In SELF-DEFENSE (Bantam, $22.95), the California shrink is treating 25-year-old Lucy Lowell for a recurring nightmare that she has been having ever since serving on the hanging jury that convicted a serial killer. "A Freudian would have loved it," Alex says of the dream, "unresolved erotic feelings toward the abandoning parent coming back to haunt her." But when Lucy's terrifying dream is complicated by incidents of sleepwalking, bed-wetting, narcolepsy and a possible suicide attempt, Alex suspects a repressed childhood memory. After putting his patient through hypnotic regression, he is convinced that she witnessed a murder and he sets out to prove it.
Mr. Kellerman does this sort of psychological huggermugger awfully well. Never mind that his villains are a whisker away from caricature and that his complicated subplots veer into melodrama. He tells an exciting story that is loaded with tension and packed with titillating insights into abnormal psychology. Alex is also on his best behavior here. Although the good doctor's bedside manner has failed him in the past with mad-dog killers and high-strung society matrons, he's as gentle as he can be with traumatized children and with childlike victims such as Lucy.
The Massachusetts seacoast around Cape Ann is up to its sea walls in pretty little villages like Mellingham, the picturesque setting of FAMILY ALBUM (Scribner, $20). As we found it in two previous cozy mysteries by Susan Oleksiw, this proud Yankee enclave is awash in scandal. The head of acquisitions at Arbella House, the showcase of the local historical society, suspects someone of stealing its treasured antiques. The Arbella Society is still reeling from that one when their richest patron announces that she is selling off the oldest building in town for cold cash. Before the horrified Brahmins can recover from this new betrayal, the would-be buyer is poisoned.
"We all know each other's secrets," a member of Mellingham's social elite airily informs Joe Silva, the Chief of Police and the likable hero of this polished series. But the upper-crust players in this neatly constructed whodunit obviously know far less about one another than they think, which allows Ms. Oleksiw to go in for close, careful analysis of the inbred characters and some tasteful satire on their obsessiveness about family history and material possessions. Without stooping to cruelty or cuteness, the author is at once admiring and critical of Mellingham's gracious but doomed way of life, "so thin, so frail, almost unable to fend off the passions and energies of a more robust world crowding up close to it."
The most effective amateur detectives are either such socially invisible nonentities that you don't pay any attention to them or such flamboyant peacocks that you're too dazzled to notice what they're up to. Miss Jane Marple or any other woman over 50 who isn't packing a gun is an example of the first. His Royal Highness Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and future King of England -- the hero of BERTIE & THE CRIME OF PASSION (Mysterious Press/Warner, $19.95) and two earlier historical mysteries in a charming series by Peter Lovesey -- is an example of the second.
The incorrigible Bertie teams up with the divine Sarah Bernhardt for this high-spirited adventure, which takes place in the risque society of bohemian Paris during the 1890's. Blessed with an insatiable curiosity and prodigious appetites, Bertie combines a hedonistic tour of the Parisian demimonde with an investigation of the shocking murder of a young nobleman during the climax of a cancan dance at the Moulin Rouge. For all his bluff and bluster, the future King is very much an innocent, which lends sweetness as well as humor to his wide-eyed impressions of Toulouse-Lautrec and the uninhibited dancers immortalized in his theater posters. For the integrity of his own research, Bertie openly attends a cancan performance, which he pronounces "exotic, acrobatic, exceedingly naughty and hugely entertaining." What a delight to share in his education.

HEADLINE: Off the Grid

BYLINE: By Philip Weiss; Philip Weiss is a contributing writer to the Magazine.

 BODY:
A warming morning late in October, and James (Bo) Gritz stands on a mountaintop in north-central Idaho, addressing the faggot press. His words. Still, look at them: a Brit with blond hair fringing his round head -- The London Times calling; a reporter from People with long hair and a goatee; the neo-beat novelist William T. Vollmann, on assignment from Spin magazine and accompanied by a friend, a birdlike woman with bright red lipstick and purple gloves. And there are three or four others, including a photographer from this magazine who has slipped his earring into his pocket to get under the faggot radar.
Gritz (rhymes with "bites") is long-winded. 
 "I don't know about you, friends, but I look at everything from my guerrilla perspective," he explains, alluding to his years as a Green Beret colonel. "The Government will do a threat analysis. They'll look and say, Jiminy Christmas, this is not Waco. We're going to have to completely encircle this whole area here if we're going to control it, and as you know there's only one road. . . . "
He turns and motions over the hills to the north, toward a dirt road that winds 11 miles to the small town of Kamiah, population 1,100.
"I know what they're going to say. 'Gritz is going to have a .50-caliber up here, he's going to have cannons, he's going to have explosives in the trees.' So they're going to have to try vertical envelopment." He's referring to helicopters. "Non-habit-forming. Five thousand helicopters shot down in Vietnam. No way! So I think they're going to leave us alone. So we don't have to shoot at them. We don't even have to have the capability. As long as they think that there is that threat."
Gritz is talking about a place he calls Almost Heaven. It will rise right here, in northern Idaho -- 200 acres that he and his partners bought and subdivided into 30 lots that they're selling, at $3,000 an acre, to people who want to escape Government tyranny and Armageddon in the lowlands. The lots are going fast, as are those Gritz is selling on higher hilltops nearby -- he calls one Shenandoah, the other Woodland Acres. Up here, with a view of the Clearwater River and Gospel Hump Wilderness Area, buyers will form a "covenant community." They will agree to stand by one another and defend one another, and maybe not pay any taxes either. "Off the umbilical," he calls it. Off the grid.
Gritz, who was briefly on the ticket with David Duke in '88 and ran for President himself in '92, is, at 55, a leader of the radical right-wing survivalist movement. He quotes Scripture, prophesying end times in the next few years, times when we shall all have to accept the mark of the beast: a bar code implant in the forehead or right hand that means the cashless society is upon us, and that every transaction an individual makes will be subject to surveillance. Just as Revelation 13 describes.
"We are going to live our lives according to our ways," Gritz is saying now. "Let's say it comes down to the fact that eventually you cannot go down to the 7-Eleven and buy bread and milk and meat. Then yes, up here there's an abundance of game, and if it did come to that -- and according to biblical prophecies there are times like that ahead -- then we would be prepared. If it never comes, hallelujah. But personally I'm going to go off the grid, because every time I've lived off the grid, like Vietnam, I've been very happy."
Gritz does what the photographers want him to do: he props one of his black cowboy boots on a barbed-wire fence and stares off squinting and box-headed. He hugs his wife, Claudia, and walks across the land. Claudia is nearly 20 years younger than he is -- she's wife No. 3 -- and doesn't seem like much of a survivalist. Pretty with Liz Taylor eyes, she wears two large diamonds rings on her fingers. She and Bo may be going off the grid, but Claudia is going to have a washer and dryer, a lawn.
"I'm hungry," she says. "I need to go to the bathroom, so do one more shot."
"There's a port-a-potty," one of Gritz's partners, Jerry Gillespie, tells her.
"No way," she says.
So, just one more shot. The top couple of buttons on Gritz's shirt are open, and sprigs of gray chest hair peek over his undershirt and catch the morning light, and the same sunlight takes in the valley of the Clearwater and the pale blue berries on the elderberry bushes. If you live off the grid you can make wine and pancakes with the crunchy, bittersweet elderberry.
GO A HALF MILE EAST. THE SAME SUNLIGHT picks out honey-colored chinking on the log-house homestead of the first people to buy into Gritz's message and move up here: the Fullers, Dan and Barb, formerly of St. George, Utah. They are prepared for end times. They have a $20,000 solar-energy system and are storing food -- stuff that looks like dried cat food and takes a long time to get used to. T.V.P.: textured vegetable protein. Taco-flavored T.V.P. Magic Barbecue T.V.P.
You get invited into their kitchen. Boy, that T.V.P. takes a while to get used to. They say Bo's got the Gospel. They say that years of study have convinced them that political collapse is a real possibility. They hand you literature from Florida that will open your eyes -- The Revelator. In which it is written that the Anti-Christ Banksters are squeezing the life out of America in preparation for the New World Order. Shrewd goldsmiths are plotting to deceive the goyim, the goy states. Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Haym Solomon. There is a long bit from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
Dan Fuller, 68, is a retired crop-duster, and he tells you: "There are two choices. Go along with the New World Order, or change your life. They're going to decide everything about your life. Where you can work. Where you can live. Where you can go for groceries. They will tell you all of that. You're not going to be a free man, you're going to be a slave."
You're skeptical. "I don't know."
"Nothing would please me more than for it all not to be true." But, he continues, "Your clothes are not going to be yours. They're going to belong to the state."
"Who will decide?"
"World bankers."
"The Queen of England," Barb says.
"Rothschild," he says.
You say, "How will it be in the middle of winter when you have to drive down 10 miles of snaking dirt road to get some milk?"
Dan shakes his head once. "Well, let me ask you this: What are you going to do when they ask you to accept the mark of the beast?
THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT MOOD THAT HAS seemingly swept the nation is nowhere more pronounced than in Idaho. This is not the state that elected Frank Church to the Senate, not any more. Idaho is sending no Democrats at all to Washington this month, and the Statehouse, which only a few years ago was roughly balanced between the two parties, now counts only 21 Democrats among its 105 members. The most powerful Democrat in the state, indeed the only Democrat holding statewide office, is J. D. Williams, the auditor. And Idaho's Republicans are not in the William Weld-Christine Whitman mold. There is Helen Chenoweth, for instance. During her successful campaign last fall to unseat Representative Larry LaRocco, a Democrat, Chenoweth declared that "white Anglo-Saxon males are an endangered species."
White Anglo-Saxons are not endangered in Idaho. The state, with a population of roughly 1,100,000, is virtually all white. The 1990 census counted about 9,000 Asians and Pacific Islanders in Idaho and slightly more than 3,000 blacks. This goes some way toward explaining why Idaho is suddenly one of the most attractive destinations for whites in flight. (A third of the state's newcomers are said to be coming from California.) So far in the 90's, only Nevada's and Arizona's population growth rates are greater than Idaho's.
"Our real estate is going nuts here because people are trying to get away from the real world," Clint Engledow, a real-estate agent in Kamiah, says. "Downtown Houston, downtown Denver, downtown Vallejo. You name it, they're fleeing. They say they're sick of drive-by shootings and 14-year-old orange-haired mall rats. They want to pick huckleberries and not be near any population base."
The appeal of Idaho is not simply its whiteness, though. There are good jobs in Boise, and affordable homes in suburbs here that still feel like small towns. And for those looking for a last frontier, there is the terrain. Idaho has magnificent scale, its dry Western air yielding long views of rugged river breaks and serried mountains. These vistas are preserved thanks in large part to the Federal Government. Nearly two-thirds of the state is publicly owned land, mainly national forests and wilderness.
Survivalists and conspiratorialists, Christian constitutionalists and New Age back-to-the-landers would seem to number in the several thousands in Idaho. Steve Willey, owner of Backwoods Solar Electric in Sandpoint, says he has 1,000 customers in northern Idaho, all off the grid. "There's a wide variety here that come from opposite ends philosophically to the same situation physically," Willey says. Jess Walter, a reporter for The Spokesman-Review in Spokane, Wash., who has done considerable reporting on survivalists, estimates that there are more than 10,000 people living off the grid, both literally and philosophically, in the hills of eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana. He has encountered a Vietnam vet who says he's hiding in the woods, a loner who shares a cabin with a grand piano, a man living in a trailer with his children and new wife, on the lam from a custody dispute, and a commune that sells food.
"If you follow a dirt road anywhere in northeast Washington or Idaho, chances are you're going to find them," he says. "They're harder to count than homeless people, because they're just gone."
In the 60's and 70's, hippies came to Idaho's empty spaces, and you can still find them growing garlic and tanning hides and holding barter fairs. And the promise of being left alone has drawn other kinds of free spirits. People like the novelist Denis Johnson, who lives near the Canadian border and who brings along bungee cords when he goes out with a chain saw so he can tourniquet himself in case of an accident.
"You come here with a vague notion of getting away from it all," Johnson says. "Then when you get out into the woods, you see how wonderful it is to be self-sufficient to any degree, how essential it is to being human. I feel I robbed myself by living in cities. The city itself is like a big baby, being supplied from outside."
Self-reliance is Idaho's byword. The landscape fosters an American romance about working out one's own fate in nature that is equal parts Thoreau and manifest destiny -- and one big part pure hatred of government. Up in the mountains of the panhandle, Idahoans bring those feelings to a high art. Local newspapers are filled with laments like the one that a husband and wife, new to the state, sent to The Clearwater Progress in Kamiah to complain about Federal policy on land use and schooling: "We eat the bitter bread of tyranny and the cake of oppression."
For people like this, Idaho offers not only a landscape but a coherent politics, a world view: survivalism, tax protest, apocalypse, conspiracy theories. A woman in Kamiah urges you to investigate sightings of black helicopters, which, she has heard, are a sign that the United Nations is about to take over America's Armed Forces. At breakfast in the Lewis Clark Motel outside Kamiah, a retiree tells you, "In California they put a meter on your well and you get charged twice, once when it comes in and once when it flows out, as sewage," then gives you information about how to build a house from tires. And the publisher of The Clearwater Progress, Bill Glenn, shows you the plastic security strip they're putting into $20 bills, and says this is a step toward one world government.
Out here, there's room for such thinking, room for everything. Bo Gritz tells you that Idaho County, Idaho, is ideal for Almost Heaven because, among other things, there is only one traffic light and the citizens have rejected all efforts to impose a building code. He tells you other things too. He says that as the global tide toward world government grows stronger, "we will need a pivotal state" -- Idaho as base camp.
Gritz's attraction to Idaho, his sense of having found a place here, also has to do with his role in an episode that, for Idaho's survivalists, has become a legend -- one about a first taste of end times. In August 1992 a 44-year-old survivalist named Randall Weaver garrisoned himself and his family and a friend in a mountaintop cabin outside of Naples, Idaho, 30 miles from the Canadian border. Federal agents were moving in through the woods with a warrant for Weaver's arrest. (He had failed to appear at a trial on a gun charge in 1991.) During an unintended encounter, a deputy marshal was killed and Federal sharpshooters killed Weaver's 14-year-old son, Sam. The next day a sharpshooter killed Weaver's wife, Vicki, 43, as she stood in the doorway of the cabin holding her infant daughter. For eight days Randy Weaver huddled in his cabin with his three daughters a few feet from Vicki's body.
A vigil gathered at the base of the mountain, known as Ruby Ridge. There were neo-Nazis, tax protesters, enraged neighbors. Children held posters saying Death to ZOG -- Zionist-Occupied Government. Skinheads shaved their heads in nearby Ruby Creek. The standoff ended when Bo Gritz showed up and forced himself on the hostage rescue team. He wore a special negotiator's outfit -- a midnight blue jacket with epaulets that he had made for him in Thailand years before, and he eventually helped convince Weaver to give up and fight the battle in court.
The destruction of the Weaver family, and Randy Weaver's subsequent exoneration on Federal conspiracy charges, is today the parable by which many living off the grid in Idaho and elsewhere understand government's relationship to the American family. The story has the same resonance for survivalists today as confrontations between the Black Panthers and the police had for the radically alienated left in the 70's.
WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE COMING from that can inflict so much pain. I don't sleep at night."
Leah Balint hugs herself as she recalls the death of Vicki Weaver.
You're back at Almost Heaven. Two horses in a field. An apple tree. Leah's husband, Stewart, 41, in a Cochise belt buckle and a cowboy hat with a piece of polished stone, malachite or something, dangling from the band. And Leah herself walking around with just gray wool socks on her feet, a 22-year-old with a fragile piping voice and clear skin and thick Venus hair. Their two small boys play with a hammer. Solar panels lean against the trailer, charging the car battery that runs their television.
They're off the grid and going further. Because Stew is engaged in the study of law. His studies began when his family lost its farm in Washington state. First he read "None Dare Call It Conspiracy," by Gary Allen, a former speech writer for George Wallace; that opened his eyes to the designs of the international bankers who, in league with the Government, fix prices arbitrarily and cripple the nation. Now Stew is renouncing all of what he regards as his contracts with government. Driver's license. Social Security. Birth certificate. Hunting license. He has torn them up.
"The Government wasn't designed for people like us," Leah says.
She goes to the trailer and comes back out with Birkenstocks. A bird tweets from a barbed-wire fence.
"You see the magpie?"
You turn and there's a magpie perched on a wire, iridescent and strange. Meriwether Lewis was enchanted by them when he traveled here 190 years ago.
"Do you sleep at night?" she asks.
LIKE SO MANY OTHER STANCES of the late 60's, the back-to-the-land movement was mostly talk. People on the coasts had visions of throwing off the traces of a sick imperialist society and making a homestead, but it took a special sort to act on those beliefs and go off the grid. It wasn't people who shouted about revolution till they were hoarse. That was first chakra energy, from the groin. The true back-to-the-lander was drawing on integrative energy, higher in the body, fourth or fifth chakra.
Greg Sempel was confused by his football coaches at the University of Montana who screamed about winning and fed him 21 pills a day to bulk him up -- but said he was wrong to smoke pot. He felt abused. He dropped out, did some ranch work -- and eventually found himself on a remote hillside near Santa, Idaho, 80 miles north of Kamiah, with other hippies. He bought five acres (at $100 down, $50 a month), and melted snow for water. He formed a tree-planting co-op. It was grueling work, it tore at your back and your knees; men tended to be better cut out for it. That was a cruel truth about going back to the land; it might be saner, but it sorted out gender in a hurry. His wife, Leah, sewed quilts to exchange at the annual barter fair and gathered with the other women for home birthing.
"Ruby was born in a tepee," Leah says now, reaching for her, a friend's 10-year-old child.
"No, I was born in a bus," Ruby says.
Sheryl and Larry Nims came out to Kamiah from Portland in 1970. The land they bought had a grove of locusts in a draw, and the trees made William Blake-like silhouettes against the darkening sky. They bought a tepee for $324. They had a son they named Asa, and after he broke a pitchfork trying to pole-vault, they got him a pole and built standards out of lodgepole pines and a crossbar from a piece of thornwood. (He would later be state champ.) Sheryl farmed with horses and their hippie friends up the hill ate puppies because the Indians had done that. The Nimses found they didn't like to kill pigs or cows but they could kill goats. Goats were stupid. When it came time Larry would lead the goats they'd raised to a hollow and throw out grain for the one they'd chosen to eat that winter, and then he'd balance his rifle on a fence post 15 feet away and aim for the head. Sheryl cooked the goat and canned it, and the dogs ate the bones.
No chain saws. Chain saws were noisy, they smelled. To use one was to be fully implicated in the economy of fossil fuels. The metal blade of a crosscut saw going through the trunk of a cedar made a bright song that filled their hearts. Sheryl rode horseback and Larry walked over their land with a pruning saw hung around his neck, and they were the last people they knew who did physical eradication of weeds, pulling, no chemicals, and Sheryl wore nothing at all in the summer, even rode the horse naked. And when a surveyor came across the land one day and asked for a glass of water, Sheryl walked calmly back to the house with him in tow, naked as Eve before the fall, and got it for him in the house.
No phone. No electricity. Their lives were harder than the lives the University of Oregon had trained them for, but they were sinewy people, they liked things hard, and they abided by the frontier ethos: tolerance and distance. Everyone is escaping something. Mind your own business. Don't crowd him. Don't come on strong. Don't drop in, don't touch. A handshake means a lot more here than it does other places. Pay attention to the No Trespassing sign.
THE HIPPIES WEREN'T THE ONLY PEOPLE IN northern Idaho who were convinced that society was out of whack.
There was Paul Palmer, tall and wry, who came from New Mexico in the 60's. He was an electrician by training, but now lives and farms with his family on Clear Creek, a remote spot 17 miles from Kamiah. "After the Watts riots our feeling was that things were not right," he says. "But you don't wait for a crisis and then put up a tent in the wilderness. You go early and get prepared." For a time he pulled two of his boys from the public schools in Idaho because, he says, "a full-fledged Communist and a sex pervert" were teaching there. Meanwhile, his studies of the law convinced him that the Federal Government had grossly overstepped its limits. The income tax was voluntary, as he read the law. His refusal to file a 1040 form made it hard for him to find work.
"After my difficulties with the I.R.S,, I was in the ragbag," he says. So he learned the ways of the land -- how to farm with horses and dry fruit and grow beans.
Steve Majors, 41, came from Illinois and settled on a hillside not far from Palmer's place. He also began to read law books. "When I was farming, I began to have a conviction from God about not being on Social Security," he tells you. "You farm your land, when you're too old to farm it your son can farm it. That's your Social Security. The Government's Social Security program just didn't make sense to me. I inwardly felt the conviction that it's wrong for me to be in the system, and I better study the law to find out how best to protect myself. I started with the Bible, the basis of law in our country. The I.R.S. doesn't like my position."
A few miles down the Clearwater River in the town of Stites, (Grandpa) John Brandt sold building supplies to the hippies and said that building codes were Communism. He hung the Governor in effigy outside his store. Grandpa John had a library of literature.
You go to his store, Stites Ace Hardware. Grandpa John's having lunch. Just a minute. He finishes up and comes into his office, a big jovial man with antic eyebrows and a little mouth. Napkins his hands, talks about history.
"Hitler didn't get started on the Jews," he tells you. "He was trying to build the country up. The reason Hitler had a problem with them, there was inflation, and everything kept falling down and the Jews picked it up, for pennies on the dollar. Did you hear the expression I'm going to Jew you? That expression didn't come out of thin air. I know a lot of people got killed, but they run that Holocaust thing ragged, and that's going to stop. Now the Indians are taking that over. The Germans got credit for killing, or blame for killing, more Jews than there were at the time. Many times over. Who do you think, when we go into debt -- who owns the Federal Reserve System? I've known this for at least 25 years. The first time people told me that, I thought, that's crazy. But they gave me books. I've spent a lot of time reading this. Roosevelt started socialism and ruined the country. I've heard one story that Eleanor shot him in the back of the head. He was with his mistress. The way this story goes -- he gave away so much to the Russians, he was sick. That's normal. We know that. But he was going to confess this and she shot him, because she was a card-carrying Communist. They said it was a cerebral hemmorhage."
THE HIPPIES HAD THEIR PROBLEMS WITH THE Government, too. When a D.E.A. helicopter dips over the trees on the hillsides around Santa and looks into the gardens, Hari Heath runs from his tepee, giving them the finger with one hand and waving his assault rifle with the other. Hari got to Idaho as a hippie. He still makes bows and arrows, but now he tells you how every commune he has seen fell apart because of inequities in power. Over the years he learned a lot from the right-wing survivalists and the local rednecks. He has learned that his ability to walk into a gun shop and buy anything he wants guarantees democracy.
Hari says: "The World Bank 10 white guys socialist economic scam U.N. one world government? They're doing it very slowly. They know they can't pull it off if we maintain an armed population."
Larry Nims has a less alienated view of politics. He sees the American Constitution as beautifully designed. Still, as self-reliant people, he and Sheryl have self-reliant fantasies of end times. They, too, imagine the crunch, a time of bank failure, riots, social collapse. What if the dispossessed swarmed up from the lowlands? What if they came for Sheryl's canned goat and canned corn and potatoes? Would Larry be willing to shoot them?
He has met a survivalist who spoke about how you could use high land to get the drop on the hordes. And there was a way to use a handkerchief to improve your accuracy with a revolver. You wrap one corner of the handkerchief around the revolver grip, then you grip it with your hand and take the opposite corner of the handkerchief and clasp it in your teeth. Now aim the gun out from your body, strain with your mouth and your arm so you have two points of support. Here, like this. . . .
IN THE 1980'S IDAHO became strongly identified with right-wing apocalypticism. This was in large part because of the presence in the panhandle of Richard Butler, a neo-Nazi from California who bought 20 acres outside Coeur d'Alene, a short drive east of Spokane, Wash., and founded the Aryan Nations. He built a compound on his land, and it became an outpost of Christian Identity thinking, which generally holds that white Christians are the true Israelis; that blacks and other people of color are mud people, soulless animals; that Jews are the mongrelized descendants of Esau, hated by God, and that homosexuals should be exterminated. Conspiracies abound: notably, that the Government is controlled by a corrupt Babylonian system that includes the Jewish Defense League, the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, the Council of Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.
Today Richard Butler is 75 and in seeming decline, but he will spend an hour or two with you in his compound (even if you have identified yourself as a Jew). A fuzzy, crocheted swastika turns slowly in the window, his German shepherd, Bonn, rests nearby and Butler lays out the finer points of neo-Nazi practice.
"We had a cross lighting down there----"
"Most people call it a cross burning."
"Well, Jesus Christ is the light of the world, he's the one who removes the darkness, so we call it a lighting. We don't burn the cross, we just light it."
"Gasoline?"
"No we use diesel oil. Wrap the cross in burlap. Light it, and the cross itself still stands."
"So it's the same cross year after year?"
"Oh yeah."
Ten years ago Butler was more puissant. He reached out to prisoners and other rootless young men with terrifying warnings about the crippling of the white race. Homosexuality is financed by the Jews, he'd say. That's why you never see a poor homosexual. . . . Pregnant black women are coming by the millions to your neighborhood, he'd say. "Want to live in an all-white area?" Idaho beckons you. Butler and other Identity spokesmen envisioned the Idaho panhandle as the center of "a territorial imperative," a nation embracing portions of five Northwestern states in which blacks, Jews and Indians would have few rights and face deportation or worse. In "The Politics of Righteousness," a study of Idaho extremists, James A. Aho says Butler's training included living off the grid: "survivalist workshops, and classes in health, diet, food storage and nuclear protection."
The growing prominence of the Aryan Nations in the early 1980's presented the Coeur d'Alene community with a dilemma: leave Butler alone or come out against him. Civic leaders spoke of the state's tradition of tolerance. Ignore him and his appeal will die away. Besides, in northern Idaho his anti-Government views were widely shared.
On the other side of the debate were some Coeur d'Alene residents who organized as the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations. They came together in 1981 after a restaurant owned by a Jewish family was daubed with swastikas. The activists wanted to publicize Butler's message and decry it. At great personal risk -- one task force leader's house was bombed as he sat in his living room -- they spoke out against the Aryan Nations. And later they supported the first prosecution of an Aryan Nations follower after the man, a devotee of Hitler's, issued biblically inflected threats to a young white man whose mother had married a black man.
Inevitably Butler seeded violence. In 1984 a group linked to the Aryan Nations and calling itself the Order went on a crime spree of bank robberies and bombings and killings, notably the murder in June of that year of a Denver radio talk-show host -- an outspoken liberal, and a Jew -- named Alan Berg. The group's leader, Robert Jay Matthews, wrote: "I realized that white America, indeed my entire race, was headed for oblivion unless white men rose and turned the tide."
By December 1984, when Matthews died in a fiery shootout with the police on Whidbey Island in Washington, the Kootenai County Task Force was no longer lonely. Developers and the owner of several panhandle newspapers were on its side. The Nazis in the neighborhood were now a quality-of-life issue. "We had three problems," Marshall Mend, a local real-estate developer, said in "Stand Up to Hate Crimes," a 1991 documentary celebrating the task force's first 10 years. "One, our community's image was being destroyed by the media. Two, we saw minorities being discouraged from moving to the area. Three, we saw these same articles encouraging racists, bigots and other hate groups to move into our area."
Law-enforcement agencies were at first rather slow to respond. The F.B.I. was "absolutely . . . behind the ball" on the Order, recalled Wayne Manis, then the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s Coeur d'Alene office. But officials were far better organized when a second Order group with connections to the Aryan Nations began a crime spree in 1986, setting off several bombs in the Coeur d'Alene area and threatening greater destruction: bombs for gay discos in Portland, cyanide for the water supply of Los Angeles.
"The F.B.I. did Order 1," says Tony Stewart, the current president of the Kootenai County Task Force. "Order 2 was F.B.I., A.T.F., Secret Service, the sheriff's office and the state police."
Stewart grows enthused describing this phalanx. Liberals are comfortable with government. And the Kootenai County task force worked closely with the state, helping legislators in Boise, for example, to pass far-reaching state hate-crimes laws in the 1980's. Incidents of racist graffiti and harassment dropped sharply, and the hive of angry young men at the Aryan Nations began to decamp to a less sensitized region 60 miles away: the flats of Sanders County in Montana.
Coeur d'Alene began to earn recognition for its achievement. Its Mayor went to New York City in 1987 to accept a civic award from the Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States. The F.B.I. was all over northern Idaho; they weren't going to be surprised again. The agency, Wayne Manis says, had run up against "without a doubt the best organized and most serious terrorist threat that this country has ever seen." That the F.B.I. itself was feeling a little apocalyptic might explain the Government's actions on Ruby Ridge, the bloody standoff with the Weavers.
OCTOBER. BLACK HOUNDS are baying outside. The barrel stove is going. Cougar and bear skins are draped over the couch. You're in the cabin of Jackie and Tony Brown in the hills not far from Naples, 70 miles north of Coeur d'Alene, not far from Ruby Ridge. The Browns were good friends of the Weavers.
"The Weavers were a curious blend of religious holy rollers and tactical soldiers of God, plus reactionaries," Tony says. "They reacted to things around them. So you're on the defensive, things aren't going the way you want them to do. Which is why I dropped out of the egomaniac-driven society in Oregon and followed a path of my own. But Weaver believes the Bible tells people of the knowledge and that they should expound that knowledge to their brothers and sisters. Form a body of true believers. Part of their life was sharing with people what they thought. They weren't pushy, but they thought a remnant or small group of people would bring about a new kingdom. Over the sheep type."
"The sheeple," Jackie says.
"Randy thought everyone was in for higher taxes, more restrictions, erosion of rights till you were a slave," Tony says. "One thing that sets his mental tone, he was a believer in absolute truth. I think the truth is pretty relative to what you know, two ideas can coexist. He was an idealist. The mission's right, we're going to do it."
Jackie says: "He was an all-American guy to the core. An angry, orientated farmer's kid."
In 1983, Randall Weaver was a machinist at the John Deere plant in Waterloo, Iowa. Vicki Weaver was an executive secretary. They studied religion but wanted no part of churches. He was a thin man with cavernous, troubled eyes and a strong jaw. He had trained as a Green Beret in demolitions. His wife was pretty and small, with dark hair and a wide face. She was more studious, she was the scripturalist. They were both intense, they both talked religion, they drew people to them. Don't believe me, Randall Weaver would say, according to later testimony at his trial. (Weaver declined to be interviewed.) Decide for yourself if this is the truth. But he knew it was the truth himself.
They learned that in the Idaho panhandle, they could find a mountaintop and live off the grid. There they could weather the chaos of martial law and the downfall of democracy. They would be there when the great tribulation came. Because in Matthew 24, it says, "When you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, then let them which be Judee's flee into the mountains."
They learned about the Great Illuminati that rules in Babylon, they learned about the Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations that are pushing one world government.
Which is spoken of in Revelation: "I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with 10 horns and seven heads. . . . One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder."
The seven heads being the G-7. And the wounded head Germany.
In the Idaho panhandle they could home-school their three children. Home schooling was illegal in Iowa. They would dehydrate food and arm themselves. Because in Luke 22:36, a man is commanded to sell his cloak and buy a sword if he have none, Randy Weaver got himself two Ruger Mini-14 semiautomatics. And a pump-action Remington shotgun. And plenty of ammo.
The Weavers bought land on a knob 4,000 feet up in the Selkirk Mountains. The road up was a steep, rocky, bulldozed strip that twirled and did switchbacks. Weaver built a cabin at the top. It wasn't built to last. Did he know something? Two-by-fours and uninsulated plywood walls. Before long the 2-by-4's began to belly. A big open room with a sleeping loft, and a shed nearby where Vicki and the girls went when they were menstruating.
They had a rocker on the rickety back porch, and, believing themselves to be true Israelites, they smeared the blood of a goat over their door frame to celebrate the Passover. They had a view from that porch that could make you weep for the power of God's hand. Washington and Montana you could see, and the plain of the Kootenai River Valley, and the shimmering golden white shanks of the Cabinet Mountains. Government land -- but the Weavers' private view.
Vicki had visions with people's faces looming in them. She wrote a booklet called "Feed Our Sheep," setting out what she believed to be the true Hebrew names for things and explaining the way that Babylon had misnamed them. Randy told people never to say God -- God was dog spelled backward. They called God Yahweh. And Jesus was Yahshua. And the sabbath was Thursday through Friday night. Only the Judas churches had their sabbath on Sunday.
When friends would listen Vicki and Randy told them of the civil war that was coming. Kevin Harris, a 15-year-old from Washington with family trouble, moved in with them, and Randy ran for sheriff of Boundary County to restore power to the locals. "The Federal income tax is the most cunning act of fraud that has been perpetrated against Americans since the introduction of paper money and the credit system," he declared.
And the former executive secretary now typed letters addressed to "the Queen of Babylon."
At least three times in the late 80's, the Weaver family drove south from their knob to Richard Butler's campground on Hayden Lake to attend Aryan Nations congresses. And under the dapply larches and alders and maples their children played with other children while men wandered about in Nazi regalia talking politics, and Butler gave out leaflets for "a nigger shoot" and hawked pamphlets about how the Jews were plotting to enslave the white man. There were always bikers at the congresses. Randy Weaver met a biker named Gus Magisono, 5 foot 11, 245 pounds, in a Harley T-shirt and black boots.
The apocalypse came to the Weavers' mountain in the shape of a burly biker.
It was the fall of 1989, and Weaver was having a hard time making it off the grid, cutting wood, doing jobs for farmers. Winter was coming on; Magisono told Weaver he could make money dealing guns. They discussed the mistakes of Order 1 and Order 2, and Magisono said he needed sawed-off shotguns. Weaver said he could get him four or five a week. He had never sold a sawed-off shotgun before in his life, but he pulled his red pickup around next to Magisono's car and got his Remington pump action from a case and pointed at the barrel.
"About here." Magisono touched the barrel at 13 inches.
A week later Weaver delivered two sawed-off shotguns, one of them the Remington. He said he hoped they went to street gangs. Magisono gave him $300, with $100 more to come.
The Government came forward. Gus Magisono was actually one Kenneth Fadeley, whom the Feds had busted for gunrunning; Fadeley was persuaded to mount a sting on Randy Weaver. The F.B.I. wanted Weaver to do the same thing: go undercover among white supremacists. Weaver refused. So he was charged with gun peddling.
Randy Weaver didn't show up for his trial. In March 1991 he became a fugitive on his mountain. Friends brought the Weavers food and gas. There came a fourth child, Elisheba, and Vicki was convinced that if Randy went down he would be killed, that they should hold the family together on top of the mountain as long as they could, come what may. The three older children carried weapons and learned to shoot them. Sam, the only boy, would shoot off his rifle in the air when strangers approached, Sam who had been home-schooled and could quote history verbatim, from the Roman era on up to the present. All the Presidents, and the Constitution too.
On Aug. 21, 1992, Sam's dog ran barking after something in the woods and Sam and Randy and Kevin Harris went after him, guns drawn. Down through the thick forest, young tamarack and larch, cartridge casings and slash. At a trail crossing the dog came on three Federal marshals with twigs stuck in their bucket helmets and camouflage submachine guns in their hands.
"Freeze, Randy----"
Weaver cursed and ran, then the shooting began. Marshals later testified that Sam had started shooting, but another Government witness contradicted that claim. The dog was shot dead, then Sam was shot in the arm and the back. And Kevin Harris killed Deputy Marshal William Degan.
That night Harris and Weaver found Sam's body. Sam, who was not five feet tall. They carried him to the menstrual shed, took his clothes off, washed him.
Vicki was killed the next day. F.B.I. sharpshooters had gathered in the trees 100 yards from the cabin. Overnight, their orders had been changed. Flying out from Washington, D.C., Richard Rogers, commander of the hostage-rescue unit of the F.B.I., had ruled that any armed adult coming out of the Weavers' cabin could be shot dead. The standard rules of engagement allowed lethal force only when the target represented a threat to another person. When Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris came out to see Sam's body, an agent named Lon T. Horiuchi shot Weaver in the upper arm. Weaver and Harris rushed back to the cabin, and Horiuchi aimed again, at Harris. This round pierced a window in the cabin's open door and hit Vicki in the head as she stood holding 10-month-old Elisheba.
Is this how the tribulation begins? A plywood cabin with three terrified girls, their mother lying dead in the kitchen, a bloody body covered with blankets.
The next day a Government robot crawled on to the crude porch. It held a loudspeaker and microphone in one claw and a shotgun in the other. Weaver refused to acknowledge it. Not till a week later did Bo Gritz talk his way in, accompanied by Vicki's friend Jackie Brown. Weaver gave her a letter signed by the family, because he thought the whole family would die. The letter acknowledged that Kevin Harris had killed William Degan, but it said the Feds had fired first.
We had run smack into a ZOG/ NEW WORLD ORDER ambush. . . . Samuel Hanson Weaver and Vicki Jean Weaver are Martyrs for Yah-Yahshua and the White Race.
Randy surrendered the following day with Gritz at his side. In the spring of 1993 at the Federal courthouse in Boise, the Government tried Weaver and Harris on charges of conspiring to kill William Degan. But for six weeks the Government was more on trial than the defendants. Lon Horiuchi said he had missed his target on both shots. The Government admitted staging photographic evidence of bullets found on Weaver's knob and was fined $10,000 by the judge for misconduct. The defense argued simply that Randall Weaver's beliefs were his own business. The jury remained out for 20 days, then acquitted Harris of everything and Weaver of everything but failing to show up for trial. Even on the gun charge, the jury concluded that the Government had set Weaver up.
Later, Janet Reno ordered an investigation of the Justice Department's conduct with regard to the Weavers, top to bottom. The department has had a report in hand for some time, but has not released it. Last month, news reports based on leaks of the 542-page document say it is highly critical of Federal officials' strategy leading up to the shootings. Specifically, the report charges that the F.B.I.'s change in rules of engagement was imprecise and violated Vicki Weaver's constitutional rights.
Randall Weaver has moved back to Iowa. Last fall he and his three daughters sued the Government for $52 million.
IN IDAHO SURVIVALISTS TALK ABOUT WEAVER'S daughter Sara, what a good homemaker she was, what a good student. She has graduated from public high school in Grand Junction, Iowa, with honors, which, they say, demonstrates conclusively that home schooling works. Randy Weaver's supporters send Sara money, and Sara sends back a letter written on a word processor.
"May our Creator bless you."
What liberals there are in Idaho also talk about the Weaver children. That was the real abuse in the case, they say: the Weavers oppressed their kids, made them hostage to a feverish and paranoid ideology. Took them to an isolated mountain, made them walk around a cold knob holstered and belted with ammo. The liberals are wary of the powers of the family. To them, home schooling instills sexism -- girls do traditional homemaking activities, baking bread, making dolls from corn husks, taking care of the children. Failure to regulate home schooling has made Idaho a haven for kooks and bigots, says one big panhandle paper, The Lewiston Tribune. The Government must step in; the Government can protect children from their families.
But what happens when the terrors of a paranoid, racist, anti-Semitic father are outdone by the violent abuses of a Government? What happens when the state shoots and kills a mother before her children? The liberal imagination fails, the liberal simply cannot conceive it.
"The Randy Weaver incident itself was not as important as the fact that people with extremist intentions were using it to make inroads into the community," a woman in the town of Bonner's Ferry, not far from the Canadian border, tells you.
"It was an aberration," Tony Stewart, the liberal activist, tells you. "He had defied a Federal court order. No one knew how the case was going to unfold. It almost had a force of its own."
Stewart gives you a videotape of Bo Gritz's last news conference up at Ruby Ridge, one he held after Randy Weaver's surrender. You play it, and watch Gritz offer a stiff-armed, slant-armed salute to the skinheads at the back. "By the way, he told me to give you guys a salute," Gritz says, referring to Weaver. "He said you knew what that is."
The skinheads heil him back.
"THAT WAS NOT A SALUTE, THAT WAS A WAVE," Gritz is telling you. "I raised my hand like" -- he gives a little wave -- "it was a wave to them, I said, 'Hey guys,' and I got their attention, 'I really wanted to thank you.' "
Late at night. A room at the Lewis Clark motel. Gritz sits in a chair wearing a leather bomber jacket. His wife, Claudia, is stretched across one of two beds.
Gritz began buying land outside Kamiah early last year. He paid roughly $1,000 an acre for the 600 acres he purchased, and after putting in roads and making other improvements he offered the lots at $3,000 to $3,500 an acre for 5- to 10-acre parcels. He told followers he was trying to be Noah in the time of Lot, build an ark before it was needed. He also quoted Second Corinthians, 6:15. "Come out from them and be separate and touch not the unclean thing, and I will be your father and you will be my sons and my daughters."
He promoted the venture at weekendlong survivalist workshops he hosted around the country. Called Spikes (Specially Prepared Individuals for Key Events), the workshops teach people to deal with social collapse: how to pick locks, tan hides, give birth at home. Among those who show up is a friend of Gritz's who sells literature saying the Jews intend to enslave everyone else. Pressed about this association, Gritz says he is not anti-Semitic. But he tells you that until a year and a half ago he "really wondered what the truth was" about the Holocaust -- whether the Jews died by premeditation or "by accident." Then he read what Hitler himself wrote about Jews in "Mein Kampf" and saw that it was premeditated.
When Gritz's plans for Almost Heaven became known last February, they caused murmured concern in and around Kamiah, even among those living off the grid. "This has been a kind of utopia," Larry Nims says. "I worried that Kamiah will become synonymous with neo-Nazism, and who will that draw?"
Seeking to allay concerns, Gritz scheduled a public meeting last August at the Kamiah High School's multipurpose room. Bill Glenn, the editor of The Clearwater Progress, collected questions ahead of time, and at the meeting Gritz answered 51. But the gathering seemed only to solidify divisions in the community. Gritz sprinkled his answers with a soldier's language -- "anal orifice," "cesspool" and "flushing your stool" cropped up in discussions of public schools, and this kind of talk bothered people. Others were upset by Gritz's comment that he hoped to work with the local members of the Nez Perce tribe, whose reservation surrounds Kamiah. The Indians, Gritz said, could teach his people how to make rope; his people could teach them how to pick locks.
Two months later, reporters from around the world gathered at Almost Heaven for an impromptu press conference, and Gritz played huckster. He talked about the occasional "light snow" the hilltop gets during the "temperate" winter. (The area gets heavy snows and the road out of Kamiah is sometimes impassable, according to residents.) Gritz asserted that he probably wouldn't make money on Almost Heaven -- that his prices were well below local prices, which he said ranged from $4,500 to $10,000 an acre for raw land. This was untrue. Comparable lots of high, timbered land in the area were listed at roughly $3,200 an acre -- about what Gritz was charging -- and likely to sell for less.
Gritz has his supporters in Kamiah. Bill Glenn, the Progress editor, praised Gritz in the paper as a constitutionalist and a patriot. "All I have heard him espouse are a) common sense, b) traditional values, c) fiscal responsibility, and d) limited government," he wrote.
Glenn advised that people take a wait-and-see attitude, and that's what a lot of people seem to be doing. It's the way of the Idaho panhandle. A certain tolerance, a certain trust in those who distrust Government.
And anyway, Bo Gritz had the myth of the Weavers on his side. He had saved Randy from almost certain self-destruction. Gritz described the scene on the mountain during the meeting at the high-school multipurpose room. He told about the girls huddled in the house, and poor Vicki Weaver's body, lying in a "puddle of blood and body fluids."
THE HIPPIES WHO MOVED TO POKEY CREEK near Santa, Idaho, some time ago realized that they could never escape the system entirely. They even came to depend on it. A boy's health threatened by serious disease, girls touched inappropriately by a friendly man living in a tepee -- their families turned to state clinics for expensive cures, to the state to put the abuser in prison.
Paul Palmer used to think about shooting marauders on his land on Clear Creek, but he has changed, too. He has come to believe in a kind of community. If people flee the cities, he imagines that his barrels of lentils and carrots stored in sand will be enough to feed them. Palmer's on the grid a little now. He got electricity from the Government, the Rural Electrification Administration. "That's socialism, yes," he says. "But you can't be a purist."
Even on the frontier, ideas of community assert themselves. The romance of self-reliance will always summon Americans, but in the end it is still a romance. Even off the grid, people find themselves connected. Randy Weaver did run for sheriff.
Sheryl and Larry Nims used to think the crunch was likely and soon. Then they got to where they felt they could handle almost any scenario, and they stopped worrying about it. Their son Asa is married now. He lives in Boise, he works in computer graphics and they're mighty proud of him.

Don't Go South, Young Man

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
IN THE TV SERIES "MURDER, SHE Wrote," the character played by Angela Lansbury was accosted by a police lieutenant about a suspect she was helping: "When I sent some guys over to your place to pick him up," the cop complained, "he'd gone south."
In the opposite direction, Adam Sandler wrote in Variety that the recent video release of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" had sold more than 17 million copies and "generated north of $300 million in retail sales." 
 Now both ways: when The Washington Post's media shoofly, Howard Kurtz, hoped that ratings of the O. J. Simpson trial would "go south," Dan Rather on "48 Hours" on CBS responded, "The ratings were going north, not south."
Rather knows how to handle a compass: North is up, South is down. (I capitalize the directions, though not southern or southward.) Obviously, up is good news, down is bad. But this metaphor, now omnidirectional on television, has deeper roots than it seems. According to Fred Cassidy, editor of the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE): "Evidently a part of American Indian (Sioux) belief included go south = to die. The sense of deterioration is not far off."
The inspiring Professor Cassidy, now 87 and still only on the letter "O" -- he and his University of Wisconsin team are working as fast as they can -- directed me to Mitford M. Mathews's Dictionary of Americanisms. In that 1951 lexicon, a 1746 citation, from David Brainerd's journal, about an aged Delaware Indian's opinion that the soul departing the body "would go southward" was elucidated in a Harper's Magazine article in 1894: "The Dakota tribes believe that the soul, driven out of the body, journeys off to the south, and 'to go south' is, among the Sioux, the favorite euphemism for death."
A sexual sense was added by whites who followed the American aboriginals. In the 1955 Broadway musical "Silk Stockings," based on the movie "Ninotchka," Cole Porter wrote, "I'd love to make a tour of you"; stops on this lyrical tour included "The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you/ The East, West, North and the South of you." On the surface, an innocent lyric, and never banned from the airwaves; still, when Don Ameche sang the word South, the sexual innuendo about the nether parts of the body was unmistakable.
Financial reporters took up the compass metaphor to enliven their language about the direction of the stock market. "The markets headed south today" is an all-too-frequent usage in finance. Lou Dobbs of the CNN program "Moneyline" tells me, "While I've heard many analysts and market gurus talk about stocks going south, I've never heard anyone say a market is going north."
At least the directional metaphor of North (up, good news) and South (down, bad news) is clear. For example, when there is good statistical news on the jobless or inflation fronts, and those figures drop, you do not hear "Unemployment figures and inflation rates are headed south." Thus, the metaphoric meaning of "headed South" is not so much "downward" as "bad news."
That clarity cannot be claimed by uphill and downhill. "Your column and the crossword puzzle get my week off to a civilized start," Patricia Patricelli of Boston writes. "Usually it's all downhill from there. (Or is it uphill? I've never really understood that expression. Going downhill is easier, but it sounds negative to me, i.e., sinking, down in the depths.)"
It's all downhill from here. Does that mean "From now on, it's easy -- no more struggling uphill" or does it mean "This is as good as it gets, and now we're headed for the pits"?
"I always thought that if someone were going downhill, that signified deterioration," Steve Conn of New York writes, "whereas uphill meant getting better. Tell me: should we prefer to go uphill or downhill?"
Allan Metcalf of the American Dialect Society notes that "Downhill has been going figuratively downhill since the O.E.D.'s first record of its use, in 1591: 'Th' Icie down-Hils of this slippery Life.' Whether we weep or rejoice in any particular instance depends on whither the icy downhills lead -- to a decline, or to an Olympic skiing record."
John Algeo, the neologist of American Speech, points to the two-way working of the metaphor: "If one thinks that the top of the hill is the place to be, then going downhill is declining. But if one thinks about effort, then an uphill struggle is bad, and coasting downhill is good. The difference is between metaphorical place ('up' good, 'down' bad) and metaphorical effort to move on an inclined plane ('uphill' hard, 'downhill' easy)."
Though the first use of downhill, about the slippery life, was pejorative, a more famous use -- by Daniel Defoe in his 1719 "Robinson Crusoe" -- was upbeat: "a very short cut, and all down-hill," which was quicker and easier for the castaway and his man Friday than the long way uphill. "Perhaps a human tendency to look on the dark side favors the pejorative sense," Professor Algeo says. "Metaphorically, both work."
But they work at semantic cross-purposes. The hills are alive with the sound of confusion. My advice: forget the hill metaphor and try something nautical: smooth sailing and rough sailing, or if you go for the icy slopes, easy sledding or hard sledding. Ban the hills; if you want bad news, go South.
 
I Wrote It Myself
President Clinton has taken to running down his speech writers in public, boasting about rejecting prepared remarks and doing the writing himself; this is to show that what he says comes from the Real Him. I suspect that these lines are written by speech writers falling on their pens, mightier than their swords.
In Mr. Clinton's pre-Christmas "Middle Class Bill of Rights" speech (bottomed on Nixon's "Economic Bill of Rights" statement, which we stole from F.D.R.), I was pleased to hear his pickup of the "government that is leaner, not meaner" phrase; was ambivalent about his "raise their children" (purists differentiate between raising cattle and rearing children, and in formal speech that distinction should be made, but Mr. Clinton, even when wearing a dark suit in the Oval Office, prefers the folksy), but was stunned, stunned (one cut above "shocked, shocked") by "Some people do take advantage of the rest of us by . . . flaunting our immigration laws."
To flaunt means "to show off, to parade ostentatiously"; the verb the President meant was flout, "to disregard contemptuously, to mock or scoff at." Even kids raised with the laid-back Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage are told that mistaking flout for flaunt is "a genuine error" and, by confusing these verbs, "you do run the risk of giving some of your listeners the mistaken impression that they are smarter than you are."

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Dancing Precariously On the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON DEPOT, Conn.

 BODY:
THE OFFICE IS A CLUTTER OF battered furniture, overflowing file cabinets and obsolete business machines. Highly skilled employees, paid as little as $ 485 a week, and only for the weeks they work, labor under the constant threat of layoffs. Management, lacking a dependable flow of cash or assets to back regular bank loans, must rely on credit-card debt to cover month-to-month obligations.
From the description, this could be any of thousands of small businesses that lack the capital necessary to survive for the long term. In fact, it is Pilobolus Dance Theater, one of America's most popular modern-dance troupes, and its struggles are hardly atypical. The American Ballet Theater came back from a near-death experience in 1993 after gaining concessions from creditors and unions. The Nikolais and Murray Louis Dance Company has downsized drastically just to stay afloat. The Joffrey Ballet, battered by financial problems, announced last month that it would cancel part of its 1995 season. 
 Indeed, as the arts head into the new year in New York and other cities where cultural life is a staple, help, apparently, is not on the way. Republicans are proposing deep tax and budget cuts on both the state and Federal levels; if enacted, the cuts will threaten the viability of all performing-arts groups that depend on government subsidies. While Congressional Republicans haven't yet formally put it on their agenda, financing for the National Endowment for the Arts will almost certainly be challenged.
Adding to established dance companies' woes, what little public and philanthropic money there is supports artistic innovation and audience outreach rather than day-to-day overhead. The Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, America's largest private donor to the performing arts, did come through for Pilobolus with $ 100,000 a year for three years beginning in 1993, but with restrictions. Rory MacPherson, the coordinator of dance projects for the fund, confirms that the money is intended to bring dance to "unique and underserved audiences."
Everyone, it seems, wants to subsidize what is different, exciting and socially uplifting, but "nobody wants to pay the light bills," says Barbara Hauptman, the executive director of the Alvin Ailey company, yet another celebrated troupe feeling the financial pinch. Eventually, hard times are bound to take their toll on creativity, slowing the introduction of new work and inhibiting experimentation with sets, music and lighting.
Like every dance company, Pilobolus has been buffeted by cycles of feast and famine. A look at its history -- and financial accounts -- offers perspective on the predicament of the performing arts in general and dance in particular. It also serves as a reminder that culture that depends on the kindness of strangers lives at the mercy of economic and political fashions that are hard to predict, let alone influence.
Pilobolus, which is named for a light-seeking mushroom, was born on a lark in 1971, the product of an enthusiastic handful of athletes who took the same dance class in college. "We were just jocks from Dartmouth," recalls Michael Tracy, who joined shortly after the company was founded and is now one of its four artistic directors.
The communal spirit endured long after the troupe became a familiar presence on the dance scene. The dancers choreographed their own witty, free-spirited, breathtakingly gymnastic programs -- "Day Two," "Land's Edge," "Untitled," "Monkshood's Farewell" among them -- and managed their own tours. With two of its artistic directors already living in the area, Pilobolus settled in the tiny northwestern Connecticut town of Washington Depot.
Those with the company from the beginning remember the 1970's as a golden age, when it simply wasn't necessary to pay attention to the humdrum of finances. "We'd sit here, the phone would ring, and we'd be hired," recalls Jonathan Wolken, another artistic director.
In hindsight, it is clear why. Pilobolus neither solicited nor received much direct assistance from private foundations or government. But the troupe depended indirectly on nonprofit organizations -- notably universities and dance festivals -- financed by government and private gifts to sponsor their performances around the country. In fact, most professional dance companies must travel widely to reach an audience large enough to sustain a full-year schedule. And during the 1970's, money to subsidize "presenters" was growing rapidly: grants for dance from the National Endowment for the Arts rose from about $ 5 million in 1975 to nearly $ 9 million in 1980, underwriting a nationwide boom that allowed even marginal companies to flourish.
The good times continued well into the 1980's. Kimber Craine, a spokesman for the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, a group that coordinates public financing for the arts, points out that while National Endowment money earmarked for dance changed little, state governments took up the slack. Total state government support for dance increased from roughly $ 2 million in 1983 to a whopping $ 18 million in 1990. Corporations and foundations also wrote bigger checks, raising private donations for dance from about $ 9 million in 1983 to $ 19 million in 1989.
But these figures masked a trend that soon undermined the financial viability of individual dance companies. Increased Federal, state and philanthropic financing encouraged regional troupes like the Cleveland Ballet and the Ballet Hispanico to make the leap from local seasons to national touring with elaborate productions that absorbed enormous amounts of cash. This institutionalized support, said Mr. Craine, "created an entire cultural infrastructure," one that needed large sums to sustain and that had smaller troupes competing for subsidies with older, established national companies like the New York City Ballet.
The recession and resultant economic distress of the 90's have hit dance with a vengeance. National Endowment grants are down by roughly $ 2 million a year since the mid-80's. And in 1993, the last year for which data is available, state grants to dance were cut to $ 12 million from the 1990 peak of $ 18 million.
Pilobolus felt the consequences of decreasing financial support later than most companies, at least in part because its playful, acrobatic style is accessible to untutored audiences; hence, when sponsors were forced to cut back their dance bookings, they were apt to retain a company that would sell out in larger auditoriums. In part, too, notes Susan Mandler, Pilobolus's business manager, the troupe could still count on a long and lucrative season in Europe.
But this is no longer the case. European tours, typically cash cows for high-profile American companies, have ceased to be a reliable source of income: Europe, too, has been hit by recession and tight government budgets. Last year, for the first time since the 1970's, Pilobolus was unable to put together a European tour. "We didn't know what hit us," said Robby Barnett, a Pilobolus artistic director.
The company's response to their financial problems was to slash salaries and ask the artistic directors to contribute outside earnings to the communal kitty. Pilobolus now markets dance-education workshops through the Pilobolus Institute, trying to make profitable use of its name and skills when the company is not performing or rehearsing.
UT TEACHING AND miscellaneous earned income (largely from T-shirt sales) accounted for just $ 55,000 last year, 6 percent of the troupe's budget. And like other dance companies, Pilobolus is now caught between the rock of high costs and the hard place of increasing competition for donations, government money and income from touring.
The business distinction between overhead and operating costs, best explained in context, offers a concise way to analyze the financial trap in which most established dance companies find themselves in the increasingly competitive world of touring.
In November, for example, Pilobolus's six dancers, along with two technicians, made a five-day trip from Connecticut to present four shows at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts near San Francisco. Trip expenses, including salaries, ran to $ 16,000. Pilobolus was assured a payment of $ 21,000. But since overhead -- rent, secretarial services, medical insurance and artistic directors' salaries -- runs to roughly $ 9,000 a week, the company ended the week $ 4,000 in the red.
Still, the troupe is in a better position than many other companies, since it will inevitably make money on one annual enterprise that is risky even for some of the most established companies: a season in New York City.
New York remains an imperative for every company with aspirations to world-class or even national status. And Pilobolus's annual summer stop is sponsored each year by the nonprofit Joyce Theater, for many years a showcase for modern dance. But larger companies, like the Alvin Ailey, don't fit on the Joyce's relatively modest stage. Nor, for that matter, could they come close to covering costs in the Joyce's 500-seat auditorium.
Hence a larger dance company is effectively obliged to perform at City Center, a space that is staffed by New York's generously compensated craft unions and that requires dance troupes to bear the entire financial risk of an engagement. "If I can cover my costs, it's remarkable," laments the Alvin Ailey company's executive director, Ms. Hauptman.
 If donors and presenters can't or won't pay the full cost of dance, is it possible for already strapped dance companies to reduce costs? It seems unlikely.
Professional dancers are hardly in a position to tighten their belts. As a practical matter, the best that most can hope for is enough work to be eligible for unemployment benefits. The union contracts that cover the dancers with companies like the New York City Ballet, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company and the San Francisco Ballet provide only marginally better pay and benefits.
"I live very frugally," said Peter Francyk, who is dancing his first season with Pilobolus and couldn't possibly moonlight after days of demanding practice. "It's a labor of love," he allows. "Or craziness."
INANCIALLY, choreographers may be a little better off as a group, but they hardly constitute a fat target for bean counters. The National Endowment's most recent survey, in 1989, of 405 choreographers showed a median annual income of $ 18,500 -- most of it from moonlighting in unrelated fields. Pilobolus pays each of its now-middle-aged artistic directors $ 40,000 a year. But along with choreographing new productions they are also obliged to direct rehearsals, teach classes and beat the bushes for donors.
With financial public or private salvation so remote a prospect in this era of reduced spending, it seems almost inevitable that many companies will be forced to scale back, or even go out of business. The fear has been voiced before, of course, but this time professional dance may really bean endangered art form.
Ambitious and marvelously skilled dancers still pour out of schools despite Money magazine's ranking of their job prospects just above butchers, sanitation workers and taxi drivers. When Pilobolus held auditions for two positions last year, hundreds applied. "Almost everyone who showed up could have done the job," reported Alison Chase, another of Pilobolus's artistic directors.
But the supply of dancers may not remain endless when word finally gets out that they can no longer expect to lead even minimally secure lives working at their craft. "You can't starve as fashionably in New York as you once could," said Sali Ann Kriegsman, director of dance for the National Endowment.
Although much of the public and private subsidy for dance companies is for new work, dance simply isn't possible unless the rent and insurance bills are paid. Further, the Pilobolus artistic director Mr. Wolken worries that the anemic sums remaining for costumes, sets and rehearsal time will undermine the quality of the company's new work. Live musical accompaniment to dance has already become as rare as sympathy from Jesse Helms: Ms. Hauptman notes that the Ailey employs an orchestra for just one performance in their New York season.
Bonnie Brooks, the director of Dance/ USA, a Washington association that represents most dance troupes, expresses a deeper worry. Hard times will beget harder times, she frets, as dance loses status in a society inclined to equate value with material results. "Dance is like a suspension bridge," Ms. Brooks suggests, one now "held together with spider webs."

Despite Safety Concerns, Tourism to Peru Surges

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: CUZCO, Peru

 BODY:
UNFAZED by reports of terrorism, cholera and street crime, tourists from Atlanta to Australia are pouring into Peru at an unprecedented rate, drawn mainly by the lost Inca city of Machu Picchu, and officials expect the final figures to show that 1994 was a record year for tourism in Peru.
Based on preliminary figures, Peru's National Tourism Board estimates that the number of foreign tourists passing through Peru in 1994 exceeded 400,000, compared with 275,000 in 1993. 
 If the 1994 estimate holds true, the number of foreign travelers visiting Peru will surpass its height of 360,000 in 1988, just before an escalation of Shining Path terrorism, hyperinflation and an outbreak of cholera sent tourism into a steep decline.
The sharp rise is attributed to a dramatic turnaround in Peru's economic and political situation under President Alberto J. Fujimori: Cholera is no longer a problem, except in some remote areas; the economy has stabilized, and terrorism is waning with the capture of Shining Path's top leaders.
But the United States State Department continues to warn Americans of the dangers of travel in Peru. A July advisory said that "with the exception of certain tourist areas, terrorist violence, which has diminished over the past year, continues to occur in many parts of the country."
While the State Department's warning said that foreign visitors have not been specifically targeted and tourist areas have generally been free of terrorist activity, United States Embassy officials in Lima said recent acts of violence by the Shining Path guerrillas in Lima and the Andes prompted the agency to warn Americans of the potential danger.
Still, the warning did not keep Chris Hedley, a Los Angeles radiologist, and Felicia Ferrari, a businesswoman, from seeing Machu Picchu, along with thousands of others who arrived early on a December morning to view the ruins, which are considered one of the most important and mysterious archeological monuments in South America.
"It's a place that we've always wanted to come and see, but we had some hesitation because of the reports of terrorism," Mr. Hedley said. "Now that we are here, I'm sorry we didn't come sooner."
Cuzco, which was the center of the Inca Empire, is Peru's top tourist destination, with 32 percent of Peru's visitors taking the one hour flight from Lima to here, en route to Machu Picchu, which is four hours away by train. The ruins suggest the remote stone city of 700 years ago, and visitors can still see the terraced plots where the Incas grew as many as 500 different crops a year.
Frank O'Connell, a 61-year-old retired banker from Perth, Australia, was visiting a friend in Rio when he decided to take the 22-hour trip by plane, train and bus to Machu Picchu. "When I arrived I wondered if I had done the right thing in coming because of the terrorism and all," Mr. O'Connell said. "But after seeing those spectacular ruins, I'm convinced this was the highlight of my trip to South America."
The Peruvian tourism agency said that most visitors to Peru were from North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and other South American countries and that the average age of tourists was 65.
Many tourists tour Peru alone and most with little trouble, but street crime is very common in Lima, Cuzco, Ayacucho, Arequipa, Trujillo and other destinations. Tour guides here advise travelers not to carry watches, passports, credit cards or other items of value, as pickpocketing is rampant.
With the number of tourists expected to rise to 500,000 in 1995, Peru is quickly running out of hotel space to accommodate them. Although several deluxe hotels are under construction in Lima and a Government-owned lodging chain is being privatized, tourism officials recommend that visitors book far in advance.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Of Renaissance Visions And American Dreams

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"ITALIAN RENAISSANCE Architecture," at the National Gallery in Washington, is a pale shadow of the sumptuous exhibition mounted last summer at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice. Still, even this severely truncated version is worth a visit, especially when seen in conjunction with "World War II and the American Dream," the National Building Museum's outstanding survey of military construction.
Though the shows explore vastly different periods, styles and building types, they tell similar stories. Both are studies in architectural subterfuge. They show how buildings have helped to disguise as well as drive major shifts in cultural history. 
 Beware architects bearing models: that's the unstated moral of the Renaissance show (through March 19). On the cover of the catalogue, a painting depicts Michelangelo presenting a scale model of St. Peter's to Pope Paul IV. The presentation is a tribute to God, and to the supreme power of the church. But it is also an act through which the architect enlarges his own cultural power.
While scarcely social equals, the artist and the Pope are in the same picture. Here, in the words of Arnold Hauser, a sociologist of art, we see "the ascent of the artist from the level of the petit bourgeois artisan to that of the free intellectual worker." In time, that worker will exercise ever greater cultural influence. If this period is called the Renaissance, that is partly because history has defined it as a time of intellectual flowering, and partly because that flowering affected the study of history itself.
As in Venice, the stars of the show are the wooden models that enabled architects and their patrons to study designs in three dimensions, though in Washington these have been pared down to 14 models of three buildings: the cathedrals of Florence and Pavia and the basilica of St. Peter's in Rome.
Many of the models are the size of armoires, but two, of St. Peter's and the Cathedral of Pavia, are virtually buildings in their own right. The largest of these, representing an unexecuted design for St. Peter's by Antonio da Sengallo the Younger, is 15 feet tall, weighs six tons, took seven years to build and is perhaps best understood as a Renaissance version of the Trojan horse. From it will emerge -- metaphorically, at least -- the arts, the humanities and the freedom of thought that will ultimately displace ecclesiastical authority in cultural affairs.
At the Palazzo Grassi, they unpacked the whole horse. That exhibition displayed the entire arsenal of tools with which Italian architects attained cultural prominence. There were rooms devoted to architectural theory, the study of antiquity, the development of such techniques as drawing, model making and construction, the figure of the architect, and the ideal city. The models were firmly planted in the history of ideas.
In Washington, where the show was organized by Henry A. Millon, of the National Gallery, this context is reduced to a skeleton crew of about 50 drawings. Handsomely installed in and around the National Gallery's West Garden Court, the selection provides enough detail to convey the reverence with which architects and architecture came to be held in the 15th and 16th centuries.
Brunelleschi's design for the dome in Florence, for instance, aroused as much popular passion as a modern space program, which, in a sense, it was. But one must consult the catalogue (edited by Mr. Millon and Vittorio Magnano Lampugnani, who was co-curator in Venice) to realize that something more than architecture was at stake. Even as Renaissance architects looked back to the ancient world for inspiration, what they were actually modeling was modernity itself.
Modernity of a more familiar stripe is on view at the National Building Museum show, which runs through this year. Here are kitchen appliances, molded plywood Eames chairs, mobile homes, Levittown and, toward the end of the show, a panorama of postwar affluence that unfolds like the vista of a lost Golden Age. But those who recall the 1950's as a time of national innocence may find this show unnerving.
The world of Ozzie and Harriet was prosperous but hardly innocent. The house, the garden, the car and all those labor-saving appliances were wrapped like camouflage around an architecture of war. President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned his contemporaries about the military-industrial complex. This show uncovers the workings of a military-"Joy of Cooking" complex. It's about how, in becoming a military power, the United States lifted itself out of the Depression and propelled itself down the road toward postwar plenty.
Organized by Donald Albrecht, an architect and independent curator, and presented in a superb installation designed by the architect and critic Michael Sorkin and J. Abbott Miller, a graphic designer, the show pulls into coherent shape a wide range of artifacts: photo murals of bomb factories, prototypes for new consumer products, clips from wartime propaganda films, Hollywood pinups, a full-scale Quonset hut and other materials that illustrate the rise of a superpower.
In 1938, the United States ranked only 20th among the world's military powers. By 1944, it was the world's leading producer of armaments. In 1940, United States Army training camps housed 300,000 soldiers. Two years later, the camps could accommodate more than four million.
Fueling this explosion was a $23 billion construction program. That quantitive explosion produced a qualitative shift. While the techniques of mass production were not new to industry, they were now applied for the first time to the built environment. New materials, new methods of construction, were deployed in mass-producing military architecture: training camps, factory buildings, blimp hangars, civilian housing and shopping centers. Entire secret cities were created for developing atomic weapons, while full-scale "camouflage" cities were built on the roofs of arms factories.
After the war, augmented by new techniques of mass marketing, this production machine was retooled to manufacture the American Dream. Instead of molding acrylics into airplane nose cones, manufacturers turned out transparent shower enclosures. Instead of leg splints, plywood side chairs. Instead of barracks, Levittowns. Suburbia, the show reveals, was a continuation of war by precisely the same means: mass production, territorial expansion and, above all, relentless propaganda, as the advertising industry geared up to inflame consumer desires. "After total war, total living," as one ad proclaimed.
Mr. Albrecht does not cast this story in a sinister light. If anything, the show is celebratory. It's about what a society can accomplish when its individual members are roused to collective action. Yet, as the show hints, the accomplishments of wartime production resulted in costs as well as benefits, and both continued long past D-Day. Regimentation of the work force was great for the war effort, but in peacetime it led to the gray-flannel-suit conformity for which the 50's were famous.
More to the point, did peace ever come? Though World War II ended, the Korean War and the cold war insured that the United States was never, in fact, demilitarized. And the consequences of this indefinite postponement continue to this day. Not only in the country's continued economic dependence on arms production, but in the jarring, split-level reality -- missiles below, barbecues above -- that superpowerdom brought in its wake.
IN A SENSE, BOTH SHOWS RAISE the same question: what happens when the authority of an institution is eroded by the culture it helps to create? The Renaissance show, with its focus on the emergence of the independent mind, looks forward to the Reformation and beyond that, to the Baroque period when the church campaigns to entice straying faithful back into the fold. The World War II show looks forward to the disaffection with the military that took hold of those who grew up amidst postwar plenty.
As Americans discovered in the convulsive 1960's, that generation balked at paying the cost of maintaining the way of life that wartime production had made possible. As we are learning from reactionary quarters today, the 1950's retain their appeal for those who mistake wartime regimentation for the traditional order of things.

SOUNDS OF THE PAST
Flute, oboe and horn concertos by Mozart, and Haydn's Symphony No. 49 will be heard as they were in the 1700's, when the Orchestra of the Old Fairfield Academy performs on Saturday at the Westport Arts Center. Diana Erdmann, soprano, will be the soloist in an aria from Haydn's opera "Il Ritornodi Tobais." 
 The orchestra, founded by Thomas Crawford in 1986 as the historical affiliate of the Fairfield Orchestra, is made up of expert period musicians playing authentic instruments. It has appeared at Lincoln Center, and it recorded Mozart's piano concertos on the Musicmasters label.
This concert is a preview of a future recording. Tickets are $25 and may be reserved by calling 831-6020. The arts center is at 17 Morningside Drive South.
 
GRASS-ROOTS PLANNING
 The Regional Plan Association of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will hold a forum on Friday in Hamden to gather opinions in preparation for publishing its Third Regional Plan in 1995.
The association, which invites business and civic leaders, planners and residents to share in formulating policies on the economy, transportation, land use and the environment, celebrated its 65th year in 1994.
The forum is open to the public free of charge from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. in the Buckman Theater of Quinnipiac College. Those interested in attending should register by calling (212) 980-8530, ext. 208.
Crucial to Connecticut in the new plan will be recommendations for providing businesses and workers with more efficient transportation, a better regulatory climate and a regional economy that will eliminate border warfare among the three states.
On the environmental agenda is the need for providing patterns of growth that protect the character of the Litchfield Hills, Long Island Sound and the northeastern corner of the state.
Other subjects for review are better education for the work force, improved community planning and the preservation of open space through better zoning, and the reclamation of abandoned industrial buildings for development.
 
COMMENTARY IN DANCE
Stuart Pimsler started out to be a lawyer. He graduated from Catholic University Law School in Washington, D.C., passed his bar exam and worked as an investigator of charges of sex and race discrimination.
While pondering the snail's pace of social change, he wandered into a dance class and decided that he could make a greater and quicker impact as a choreographer than as a lawyer. After completing a master's degree in dance at Connecticut College, he formed the Stuart Pimsler Dance and Theater Company in 1978. The ensemble, which defies all traditional and modern dance mores by speaking lines of dialogue and employing theatrical props, will perform on Saturday at 8 P.M. in the theater of the Norwalk Community- Technical College, 188 Richards Avenue.
Over the years, Pimsler and his troupe have been invited to perform his innovative and often comical commentaries on everyday life at, among other places, the Kennedy Center in Washington, the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis. Tickets, at $14, may be charged to major credit cards by calling the box office, 857-7271.
 
DRAMA IN THE DEPTHS
Imax, short for image maximum, is the 8-story-wide and 6-story-high movie screen at the Norwalk Maritime Center theater, where documentaries on outer space, animals, and the sunken Titanic have been presented.
A new film, "Flight of the Aquanaut," opens on Friday and runs through June 15. While it is based on an event that occurred 15 years ago, the film departs from the documentary form to tell a fictionalized version of the original story.
Paul Mockler, a diver and cinematographer, provided the scenario by recalling his experience off the coast of Newfoundland, when a strong current sucked his small submarine into the wreckage of a cargo ship deep underwater. He and a colleague barely got out alive.
In the film, which has almost no dialogue, a diver on an underwater environmental mission admires the beauty and wonder of marine life until he encounters a sunken ship, just as Mr. Mockler did. But this time, the diver enters the hull on his own volition, attempting to discover the origin of toxic substances seeping out of a number of rusting drums lying near the wreck.
Working almost entirely under water at Grand Bahama Island, the crew operated at depths of up to 120 feet, and the aquanaut, wearing a new device called a Newtsuit, was able to dive to nearly 1,000 feet. At that depth, four crews had to be deployed in sequence to set up gear, film and recover equipment to complete a single shot.
Screenings are at noon on weekdays and at noon and 2 P.M. on weekends. Tickets are $6 for adults, $4.50 for children 2 to 12 and adults 62 and older. More information is available by calling 852-0700.
 
GUILD NEWCOMERS
Thirteen new members were elected to the Silvermine Guild of Artists in New Canaan in 1994, based on works submitted to a jury of guild artists. An exhibition of their work may be seen through Feb. 5 in the center's galleries, 1037 Silvermine Road, and a reception is scheduled for 2 to 4 this afternoon.
The new members are Hillary Burnett of New Canaan; Fred George and Adam Tinkoff of Stamford; Ann Louria, Heidi Roos and Joan Wheeler of Norwalk; Patra Holter of Wilton; Jackie Nach of Weston; Janet Slom of Westport; Alistair Dunn and Maureen Mullarkey of Chappaqua, N.Y.; Gedas Paskauskas of Dorchester, Mass., and Lise Poirier of Patterson, N.Y.
Categories in which they work include painting, drawing, sculpture, printmaking, photography, jewelry and book design. The number for more information is 966-5618.
 
PRISCILLA'S PROGRESS
"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," starring Terence Stamp as one of three drag performers touring the Australian outback in a bus, will be shown at the SoNo Cinema, 15 Washington Street in Norwalk, this evening at 7:30. Admission is $10, with a $2 discount for those attending the Triangle Community Center Open House today from 2 to 6 P.M. at 25 Van Zandt Street.
The two events mark the fourth anniversary of the center, a service organization for Fairfield County's gay and lesbian community and their families. Admission to the open house, with light refreshments, is free. Information is available by calling 853-0600.
 
THIS OLD HOUSE
Wheeler House, the 1795 home of the Westport Historical Society, is celebrating its 200th anniversary with an exhibition documenting the house's own history.
It opens today from 2:30 to 4 P.M., and remains through March 25 at 25 Avery Place. Visiting hours after today are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M., and admission is free.
The house has been remodeled in a mid-19th-century Victorian Italianate style, containing a museum shop in addition to the furnished rooms. Behind it is the Bradley-Wheeler Barn, the only octagonal cobblestone barn in the state.
In conjunction with the anniversary a number of special events are scheduled, beginning with a talk on Westport's commercial history next Sunday at 2 P.M. by Harry Audley, vice president of Antique Tools and Trades in Connecticut. The information number is 222-1424. ELEANOR CHARLES

ANOTHER 'FANTASTICKS'
In May 1960 Jerry Orbach opened in "The Fantasticks" in a little theater far off Broadway on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village. Since then Mr. Orbach has gone on to fame and fortune on Broadway, in movies and television, and the musical by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt has been true to its name, generating 472 productions in 67 countries and just about every one of the 50 United States. 
 It will be performed by the four-year-old Herbert Mark Newman Theater of Pleasantville on Fridays and Saturdays through Jan. 21 at 8 P.M. and next Sunday at 4 P.M., not in Pleasantville, but at the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls. Tickets at $12, $14 and $15 may be reserved by calling 277-8477.
Maria Mills, the Newman Theater's director, reported: "We have four women and four men, instead of the seven men and one woman in the original. There is more choreography, the costumes and sets are our own designs, but the music and the basic show remain the same." A percussionist, violinist, pianist and harpist accompany the cast.
 
ALL MAQUETTES
An exhibition of maquettes by 22 sculptors has just opened at Nardin Galleries in Somers and will remain through Feb. 5. Serving as working models for larger, finished pieces, maquettes are sometimes shown with the final work, but in this show they are the final work. Ranging in height from 12 to 30 inches, they are priced from $300 to $22,000 (for a steel construction by Alexander Rutsch).
Drawings for the maquettes and individual drawings are also in the exhibit. In addition to Mr. Rutsch, some of the other artists represented are Robert Blood, Jacques Lipschitz, Dorothy Dehner, Adolph Gottlieb and Ernest Trova.
The gallery, on Route 202, is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and by appointment. Call 276-8485 for more information.
 
PAPERBACK SALE
Thousands of used paperback books will go on sale in the lobby of the New Rochelle Public Library on Friday and Saturday from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. Popular fiction, records and scholarly works will be available at 10 cents to 25 cents.
A smaller collection of used books in other categories will be sold in the Friends' Book Room on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Proceeds will help underwrite the library's concerts, storytelling programs, films, lectures and children's workshops.
Book discussion groups for adults and children will begin this month, with adults meeting on Thursdays from 7 to 9 P.M., starting this week. The group will select its own books. Call 576-1138 or 834-8739 for more information on the discussion groups.
Children's sessions are for grades 4 through 6. A preliminary meeting will be held on Wednesday from 4 to 5 P.M. to plan meeting times and select books. The number for more information is 632-7878.
 
PICTURE EXHIBITION
Fine photography by members of the Ground Glass Inc., celebrating its 20th anniversary, may be seen through Jan. 21 at the Rye Arts Center, 51 Milton Road.
Juried by Cornelia Butler, curator of contemporary art at the Neuberger Museum of Purchase College, the exhibit contains works by 24 art photographers, photojournalists, academics and amateurs. One of the exhibiting photographers is Renata Rainer, who founded the Ground Glass in 1975 as a forum for ideas and a way to share technical information through lectures, workshops and exhibitions.
Hours are Mondays through Fridays from 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 and 1:30 to 5 P.M. and Saturdays from 1 to 5 P.M. Call 967-0700 for more information.
 
FOOD FOR THE ARTS
The Westchester Arts Council has scheduled a benefit for the many cultural programs it provides throughout the county at the Tappan Hill mansion, 81 Highland Avenue in Tarrytown, on Friday at 7 P.M. For $125 a person, patrons will dine on Abigail Kirsch's food and taste wines of France, Italy, Oregon, California and Australia.
Pinot Gris from France and Oregon will accompany hors d'oeuvres of mussels, foie gras, tomato bruschetta and rice cakes. An appetizer of smoked salmon pizza will be washed down with a rose from France and a California white wine, followed by a choice of two salads.
Lamb osso bucco with rice will be served as the main course with California and Australian wines, and the wines of Italy will top off the desserts of apple dumplings and cookies. Call 428-4220 for reservations or more information.
 
REAL ESTATE LUNCH
Real estate trends in the region will be discussed at a public lunch on Thursday at 11:30 A.M. at the Rye Town Hilton, sponsored by the Building Owners and Managers Association of Westchester and the Fairfield-Westchester chapter of the International Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives. Reservations are $40 and may be obtained by calling 328-9703.
Two speakers will address the question "You've Stayed Alive Till '95 -- Now What?" They are Thomas J. Spitznas, president of the economic consulting firm T. J. Spitznas and Associates, specializing in forecasting regional trends in industry and the economy, and Greg David, editor of Crain's New York Business for 10 years.
Mr. Spitznas is a director of the Westchester Private Industry Council and a member of the Westchester County Association. Mr. David, the winner of the John Hancock Award for excellence in financial journalism, appears each week on Public Radio International's "Marketplace Monitor."
 
MAKING LOVE LAST
"Couples and Successful Relationships -- How Are They Built and Sustained?" will be the subject of a program at the Loft in White Plains on Thursday at 7:30 P.M.

 BODY:
It seems to me that Moore didn't worry too much about quitting jobs she didn't like. Only the middle class does that.
Expensive work-training programs aren't the answer. People go to work and hold on to jobs when they have to. They learn to get along with others and to show up on time because they have to. They practice birth control because they have to. They wait to have children until they are married because they have to. Some of us are old enough to remember when every American lived that way. The incentive is economic survival. Welfare has taken that away. 
 We simply need to phase out welfare and phase in the old economic survival instinct. I suggest that we "grandfather" in all current recipients and refuse to put anyone else, even new babies, on the dole. It's called tough love.

PBS's Wheel of Fortune

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
NEWT GINGRICH WANTS TO "ZERO out" the taxpayers' contribution to public broadcasting, and sometimes so do I. The impulse to strangle last struck me during the bonus round of a new quiz show, "Think Twice" -- yes, a PBS quiz show. Two contestants, already bathed in gifts from the Microsoft Corporation, failed to win the jackpot, a generously advertised $2,500 investment in a Keystone mutual fund. No Vanna White appeared, but along with the commercials came an ebullient M.C. and players childishly applauding their own right answers, just like "Wheel of Fortune." It's not only Big Bird and "Masterpiece Theater" for whom the Gingrich tolls.
But then it's not the quality of public broadcasting that bugs the Speaker. If it were, he'd offer more, not less, than the $300 million the Treasury contributes to public television's $1.5 billion annual expenses. Gingrich objects in the name of principle: he contends that PBS is superfluous because cable and satellite can now serve every taste for which there is a "market." They could but they don't. 
 One trouble with his theory is that 40 percent of America's homes don't get or can't afford multichannel service. A bigger trouble is that the commercial market seems unable or unwilling to devote prime time and money to the kind of news analysis, music, dance, history, biography and science available in public television's best weeks. Beyond that, the market offers nothing as wholesome as PBS's educational programs for children and virtually no instructional programs for adults, very little theater beyond the soaps, very little music older than an adolescent. And the Speaker knows it.
What really grates on him, and other aggressive partisans, are the liberal values that shine through many of public broadcasting's cultural and academic programs. Often, the conservative critics honestly misunderstand; they perceive skeptical curiosity or social tolerance as dissent or deviance. Then again, sometimes they are right. Right or wrong, they piously contend that taxpayers should not underwrite views they oppose.
But why not? Why do the champions of imperfect economic markets show no tolerance for flaws in the ideological market? Why is the much more pronounced rightward tilt of opinion in radio talk shows less objectionable than the occasional liberal tilt of "All Things Considered"? Do these experts on public finance fail to recognize the public's financial support for all broadcasting and for the think tanks that supply ammunition to the broadcasters? Rush Limbaugh owes the taxpayers a lot more for the free and profitable use of the public airwaves than Bill Moyers.
A Government that has wisely stopped trying to legislate fairness and equity in broadcasts to mass audiences should not fuss so hard about small lapses in speech addressed to assorted minorities. Elementary fairness in public broadcasting could be better assured by depoliticizing its board of directors, now appointed by the White House and hounded by Congressional committees.
There are days when, with Gingrich & Company, I too rage at "All Things Considered." I am annoyed not only by its occasional longwindedness or lapses into liberalism but also by its excellence, the breadth and depth of its coverage. Why, I wonder, should taxpayers subsidize a news operation that so effectively competes with The New York Times, which must spend hard-earned millions to gather the same news?
But invariably, reality dawns. Even the "all news" radio stations in New York reduce human activity to a few headlines surrounded by weather and traffic reports and commercials. Even The Times's own radio stations, serving sophisticated audiences with classical or golden oldie music, offer no newscasts worthy of the paper or as good as public radio's.
It's a tough concession for any American, but our market culture is an inadequate culture. Without Government subsidy and tax-supported philanthropy, there would be no great universities, no great libraries, no great museums, no grand opera or basic science. Despite all its shortcomings, public broadcasting represents the civilized conviction that not everything of value can be popular.
By not grasping that paradox -- that public broadcasting is not the same as popular broadcasting -- Americans have driven the loose PBS network of 351 stations toward its biggest failings. PBS is in trouble because its layers of insulation from politics have worn too thin. Instead of a reliable stream of multiyear subsidies for innovative programming, it has been held to an insecure Federal dole and required to share it with often redundant and poorly managed local stations. That sustains a helpful lobby in almost every Congressional district, but it drains money from programs that could reach the same large audience through many fewer stations and also by tape and disc and eventually through cyberspace.
Given its predicament, noncommercial television has come to depend on compromising commercials and tedious fund appeals and has been forced to pursue large audiences, meaning "contributing members," with inexpensive but presumably popular programs like the quiz show.
A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS OF how public television came to be and what it could still become was published last year by a diverse group of distinguished citizens assembled by the Twentieth Century Fund. Called "Quality Time," the group's report urged "fundamental structural change," but it has been largely ignored by critics and defenders alike.
The group wanted Federal subsidies increased but destined entirely for creative and better-protected programming. By ending the subsidies to station operators, it said, Congress would require the states and local communities to decide which of many overlapping stations they can still afford. The group also wanted educational and instructional programs to be improved. And it wanted public broadcasting to be more securely financed with fees collected from commercial broadcasters for their use of the public spectrum -- much as cable operators tax themselves to support the excellent noncommercial C-Span channels.
There you have an agenda worthy of a radical Republican Speaker: No more mandated pass throughs from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to local station bureaucracies that endear themselves to House members. No more free grazing on the taxpayers' airwaves by commercial broadcasters. And a portion of their royalties sent directly to public broadcasters. With such a program, Gingrich could save tax dollars on public television, earn some money for the taxpayers from commercial television and avoid becoming a censor who appears to want only to zero out the free market of ideas.

Will Video Game Machines Turn Into PC Killers?

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
AT this year's Consumer Electronics Show, which ends this evening, it became clear that the personal computer is finally a bona fide consumer-electronics item.
Entertainment software for home personal computers has been the talk of the show and William H. Gates -- the king of Microsoft, who seems to be everywhere these days -- gave a keynote address yesterday where he described his company's new "Bob" software, which is designed to simplify the family PC. 
 It appears to be a timely product introduction, because personal computer sales nearly equaled sales of television sets in 1994, according to data released Friday by the show's sponsor, the Electronic Industries Association.
But the PC's reign in consumer electronics could be short lived. For in the computer industry, things are never stable for long, and the outlines of a new computing world order are already taking shape.
This year will see the arrival of a generation of computers with many times the power of the personal computer, yet costing far less. "The pressure to build super-high-performance machines for zero cost is unbelievable," said Dennis Allison, a Silicon Valley computer designer who has helped design microprocessors for the next generation of video games.
Look for at least three key developments this year:
* New video game machines from Nintendo, Sega, Sony, 3DO and Atari are scheduled to be available for Christmas 1995. These "computers" will have far more processing power than the current top personal computers using Intel's powerful Pentium chip. Rather than costing $2,000 to $3,000, as Pentium PC's do, they will start at less than $500 and fall to $250.
* Television set-top computers, based on a new generation of "media processor" chips, will be introduced. These set-top boxes will be designed to translate streams of digital information sent over cable or telephone networks to let viewers select movies at the time of their own choosing, and will also offer computer animation capabilities rivaling the quality of video game machines.
* The first prototypes of Japanese digital video disk systems, based on competing standards backed separately by Sony and Pioneer, will be demonstrated this year. Designed to replace today's videocassette recorders and scheduled for sale in 1996, the new systems will use powerful and inexpensive microprocessors to play back movies from compact disks the same size as today's audio CD's and the silvery computer disks known as CD-ROM's.
The computing industry is less stable than other businesses because, as a technological rule of thumb, every 18 months it is possible to put twice as many transistors on a single silicon chip.
That means not only the price of computer processing tends to plunge even as speed and performance soar, but also each generation in computing makes the last one obsolete.
Each new generation of computers has not simply replaced those of the previous era. And in the breeds of computers arriving this year, each has been developed for game-playing or other entertainment applications. They will not immediately supplant computers designed for serious business uses.
Yet, these small supercomputers will ultimately be deployed in a wide range of applications that were previously unattainable or too costly for the consumer market -- including voice-recognition devices that respond to a broad range of spoken commands, and smart, portable digital valets capable of handling virtually all their owners' computing and telecommunications needs.
The rise of computing's new order will be anything but painless. Since the mid-1950's the computing world has been overthrown twice: Mini-computers broke the monopoly of mainframes in the late 1960's and early 70's, and in the mid-70's personal computers began edging mini-computers out of the spotlight. Each time, the older machine survived, but it no longer ruled.
In each case, the changes -- whether in terms of letting smaller companies adopt computing or giving more workers access to information -- had an impact throughout the economy.
"The trend is for the fastest to also be the smallest and cheapest," said John Moussouris, co-founder of Microunity Inc., a Silicon Valley chip maker that is developing a television set-top box with backing from companies like Tele-Communications Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation.
"This will continue to disrupt the computer industry to a greater degree than the auto disrupted the horse and buggy or the calculator disrupted the slide rule," he said.
FOR the computer industry itself, consumer electronics companies are already becoming the largest investors in financing research and development in advanced information technology. That is a departure from the past, when computer makers with a scientific and engineering focus, like Cray Research, with financing from several large corporate backers and the Defense Department, were the first to introduce the fastest computers.
Now Pentagon financing for computing is flat or declining, while consumer electronics companies are investing billions of dollars to advance the state of the art. Why? Because consumer electronics companies are best able to spread such investments over millions of customers. Much more than the military or corporate markets, though, the consumer market demands low-cost products.
As with generations of technologists who have come before them, today's executives in the personal computer industry are skeptical that their role as technology innovators is threatened. In fact, their industry is still widely believed to be among the nation's most innovative.
But computer experts who have watched the technological revolutions in recent decades say there is no reason that the PC makers should consider themselves immune from the forces that in 1995 will point to a new world order in computing.
"For about five years I've been telling my friends in the work station business they're not immune to the inexpensive personal computer," said Carver Mead, a computer engineer at the California Institute of Technology and a father of modern chip design.
"Now," he added, "the same pattern is going to be repeated with video games."

HEADLINE: Looking Outward to Keep U.S. Economy Chugging

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
With the nation's economic expansion still strong but aging, this year is likely to provide a crucial test of whether increased trade can visibly deliver on its promised benefits to Americans. For now that the advance in domestic demand is expected to slow at least somewhat, trade specialists say, foreign growth is the best hope to animate the United States economy.
"If the U.S. slows down in the next couple of years," said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, "a lot of slack can be taken up by the resurgence in Europe, Japan and the emerging markets." 
 Trade, in fact, is becoming the new standard currency of American diplomacy, and not just because the cold war has ended. The nation's annual exports have more than doubled in the last decade, accounting for a sharply rising share of the nation's output.
Although economists see no recession soon, increasing interest rates could retard economic growth at home. But many of America's major trading partners are just getting their own recoveries under way, while much of Asia and Latin America is growing much faster than the United States.
Mexico caught up with Japan last year to become the nation's second-largest export market, behind Canada. Although the recent plunge of the peso and an austerity plan is likely to curb Mexican imports this year, most economists expect Mexican demand for American products to continue rising over the longer run.
For almost a decade now, exports have been one of America's secret economic weapons. United States corporations did so well in foreign markets last year -- merchandise exports were up 9.5 percent through September -- that they favored the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with near-unanimity. From 1985 to 1994, exports rose from 7.2 percent to 10.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product as American firms vastly improved their competitiveness. With the new global trade agreement and a worldwide economic expansion, business leaders say, things should only get better.
"America has a huge potential for increased export opportunities," said Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Compaq Computer Corporation, which gets half its sales from abroad. In an interview, he spoke of having penetrated the Japanese market in 1992, and now expanding in Europe as more companies learn to take advantage of technology. Among the recent visitors at Compaq's headquarters in Houston have been oil executives from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan and bankers from Poland.
Labor leaders point out, however, that the trade deficit also swelled last year, despite a weak dollar, which would normally favor exports over imports by making American goods less expensive in foreign markets. And they say the export of jobs, promoted by the year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, is only beginning. While the Administration says that each billion dollars in exports creates 20,000 jobs, the unions respond that each billion dollars in imports destroys 20,000 jobs. And the merchandise trade deficit for 1994 is expected to reach about $160 billion, which would nearly match the 1987 record.
"The trade deficit, the huge deficit, represents a net loss of employment to this nation," said Mark A. Anderson, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Task Force on Trade. "We are losing the broad middle class that provided stability in this country."
Economists ascribe the imbalance to the economy's gathering strength. Import demand is stronger in the United States than abroad because growth is more robust here. They also say that trade promotes the most efficient allocation of resources, which helps lift living standards across the board for nations that participate in the global economy.
That is little solace to many union officials. While champion exporting companies tend to pay higher wages, labor leaders contend that the surge in international trade has led to little more than stagnating incomes for many workers.
They point to Caterpillar Inc., a leading supporter of GATT, which has gotten the United Automobile Workers union to allow some new workers to receive $8 an hour instead of the usual $17 minimum. Caterpillar, a top maker of construction equipment, has profited from the nation's strong 13 percent rise to $151 billion through three quarters in the export of capital goods, which are used to equip factories, build roads and run offices.
For consumers, the benefits of freer trade are obvious: not only cheaper imports, but also pressure on domestic producers to keep prices down. But some workers inevitably suffer. After the North American pact took effect a year ago, the Administration offered retraining for those who could prove that the flow of goods and investments had cost them their jobs. Labor unions complain that only a quarter of the 48,000 workers who have applied has been certified for retraining.
THE Clinton Administration has promoted exports as single-mindedly, it seems, as anyone since Japan's MITI bureaucrats at their zenith, if not Louis XIV's mercantilist minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert.
"We need a superaggressive national export strategy," the Commerce Department's Mr. Garten said in an interview. "We have to turn up the heat in ways not yet contemplated."
He can already point to billions in foreign contracts signed after executives piled aboard for Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown's many trade missions abroad. Some wonder, however, whether political supporters have an edge in winning seats on the plane.
When Brazil wanted to build a $1.5 billion satellite and radar system in the spring to monitor the Amazon environment, Mr. Garten said, the chiefs of the United States space, environmental and interior agencies lobbied their Brazilian counterparts. Secretary Brown visited the country and the United States promised to match any financing that its chief rivals, the French, could offer. The United States won the contest.
As the Administration and many corporations are discovering, the most rapidly growing export markets are sure to be among such rapidly developing nations. For the first three quarters after the new trade pact took effect, exports to Mexico were up 21.7 percent, imports up 22.8 percent.
That's why when other goals conflict with the pursuit of foreign trade these days, those other goals usually give way. The Chinese Government hardly bothered to make even cosmetic improvements in its human rights record in 1993, but the Clinton Administration decided it had little choice but to grant China the most favorable trade status.

HEADLINE: The Basinger Bankruptcy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We are writing this letter on behalf of our client, Kim Basinger, to correct false implications which we believe exist in the article about her that appeared last week, "The Basinger Bankruptcy Bomb." 
 The article blames the poor economy in Braselton, Ga., and the failure of the proposed renovation of the town, on Ms. Basinger's bankruptcy case and her dispute with Main Line Pictures. If there are problems in Braselton, those problems were caused by the recession, local and national declines in property values and a change in the investment strategy of the Ameritech Corporation's pension fund, the controlling party in the renovation project. The problems were not caused by Ms. Basinger, her bankruptcy case or her dispute with Main Line Pictures.
The facts of the matter include the following:
In 1989-90, the Ameritech pension fund invested in Braselton based on a strategy mapped out by its managers and third-party real estate promoters. Ms. Basinger agreed to associate her name with the project in the belief that Braselton would be developed into a charming historical/commercial center. Although she borrowed large sums of money to help finance the project, Ms. Basinger, as a limited partner, was legally precluded from controlling the financial workings, day-to-day operations or other business aspects of the project.
As a result of her bankruptcy case, Ms. Basinger was able to complete her appeal in the Main Line matter and obtain a reversal of a judgment that was held by the California appellate court to violate her constitutional right of due process. Although Ms. Basinger won on appeal, the bankruptcy trustee attempted to make a settlement that would have paid Main Line about $2 million and allowed her other creditors only approximately 17 cents on the dollar. Fortunately, the bankruptcy court rejected the trustee's proposal as failing to give appropriate credence to the merit of Ms. Basinger's legal positions. Ms. Basinger's legitimate creditors now have the possibility of recovering 100 cents on the dollar, a chance that would never have been available to them had Ms. Basinger not filed for bankruptcy protection.
While Harvard Law School Prof. Charles Normandin, who was quoted in the article, may be an esteemed bankruptcy scholar, he has had no involvement in the Basinger bankruptcy case. The article's use of Professor Normandin's general views about bankruptcy law cannot substitute for an accurate legal and factual analysis of the Basinger bankruptcy case. The statement in the article that "Americans have long been more understanding than their European ancestors toward deadbeats," which apparently relies on Professor Normandin's opinion, bears no relevance to the Basinger case and incorrectly implies that Ms. Basinger is a "deadbeat." Indeed, the fact that Ms. Basinger won her appeal makes it clear that her decision to go through a bankruptcy case was the right one.
Even before she won her appeal of the Main Line judgment, Ms. Basinger could never have been considered a "deadbeat." To the contrary, Ms. Basinger offered to post all her nonexempt assets as well as three years of prospective earnings as collateral for the right to pursue the appeal. However, Main Line rejected her offer, insisting it would only consider a proposal that would guarantee it 100 percent payment, give a third party chosen by Main Line the right to control Ms. Basinger's career and include a promise that Ms. Basinger (then 40, and a newlywed) would not start a family until Main Line was paid in full. Ms. Basinger's conversion from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, and the relinquishment of her assets to a bankruptcy trustee, was her only alternative to allowing a third party the right to tell her what professional roles she must accept and when she could have a baby.
The article falsely insinuates that Alec Baldwin's assets should be made available to the bankruptcy case or the Braselton residents. Since Ms. Basinger and Mr. Baldwin were married after the bankruptcy case was filed, by law Mr. Baldwin's assets, life style and ability to provide a life style to his family are excluded from his wife's bankruptcy case.
We take issue as well with another statement in the article: "While the wheels of justice creak and moan, Ms. Basinger's small creditors -- those who arranged her travel plans or repaired her home -- go unpaid. And the folks of Braselton, population 450, learn that getting too involved with an actress can be dangerous." There is no truth to the suggestion that getting involved with Ms. Basinger is "dangerous" and indeed it is false to suggest that Ms. Basinger caused these individuals' problems.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Mexico Will Prosper, but Not Very Soon

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
IN 1863, the American Civil War wasn't the only battle going on in this hemisphere. A French expeditionary force reached Mexico City, having invaded in anger over Mexico's failure to pay its bills.
The history of foreign investment in Latin America is a history of great expectations, fleeting profits, dashed hopes and defaults. There is potential aplenty, but it seems that every generation has its own disaster. As far back as 1825, the ramifications of a Latin American investment boom gone bust almost brought down the Bank of England. 
 To be fair to the Latin Americans, such problems are common in developing countries, at least in ones that are able to attract capital. "The British were had over and over again," recalled Gert von der Linde, the retired chief economist of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, in discussing American history. Whether it was toll roads, canals or railroads, America's growth was financed largely by foreigners, who often left feeling fleeced.
We checked in with Mr. von der Linde because he saw the debacle coming, warning last spring that Mexico was living beyond its means and had a history of peso devaluations during presidential election years, like 1994.
Until a few days before Christmas, almost everyone on Wall Street loved Mexico. It had pegged its currency to the dollar, with gradual devaluations that seemingly removed any currency risk, and it was viewed as one of the safest of developing markets, thanks in part to the export market guaranteed by Nafta. Its balance of payment problems were viewed as manageable. Then the peso collapsed, and with it the profits of many American investors.
Mexico's new financial plan was sold brilliantly last week by its new finance minister, Guillermo Ortiz, who wowed almost everyone he met in New York. Listening to him, we found ourselves believing that it all would work, that the workers would take a cut in their standard of living, that the government would slash its spending, that foreign investors would be persuaded not to take money out of the country, and that new investment would pour in to take advantage of lower real wages. More than a few money managers who heard him bought Mexican securities on Thursday, but by the next day the peso was weak again. It has now lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar. Mexico borrowed billions through an unusual short-term bond called a tesobono, denominated in dollars but payable in pesos. So the lenders can take out their money as tesobonos mature in coming months, presumably without losses because the Mexicans will have to pay more pesos to offset the devaluation.
It was a sign of weakness that Mexico was not able to get enough foreign investment without that gimmick. Now, finding a way to persuade investors not to take their money and run, without Mexico having to pay ridiculously high interest rates, is the first challenge confronting Mr. Ortiz, and perhaps the hardest. Mexico has the money, thanks to loans from this country and others, to pay off those loans. But if it has to do so, and thereby depletes its reserves, it could set off a destructive cycle of devaluation and inflation that would wreck whatever chance the Mexican plan has of success.
"We developed," said Mr. von der Linde of the United States. "And so will Mexico, eventually. People are right to say they are good longer term prospects." But not, he added, worth the risk right now.

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
The Economy's Dead. Long Live the Economy.
Two of last week's big stories seemed strikingly at odds. Republicans stormed Capitol Hill with the glee of schoolchildren entering a long-padlocked playground, carried to glory on the shoulders of a failed economy. But hard on the heels of that triumphant return came news that that same economy finished the year on a mighty note: the unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, and more than a quarter million jobs were added in December. On top of that, there was a huge upward revision that made November's rise in payrolls the biggest in seven years. All this brought 1994's payroll expansion to 3.5 million, over a million more than in 1993 and the strongest in a decade. Now it might be logical to expect that such news, a clear inflation threat, would spook the markets. But in the bond market, rates actually fell a bit, and stock prices rose strongly. 

Why Are These Men Smiling?
It's here. The Age of Gingrich. Sparks are flying. But the way Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich smiled when they met, you'd think they were good ol' boys hunting the same duck. Which is what, defying every law of nature, they said they'd try to do. The first deal: the President won't lobby hard against a balanced-budget amendment, Republicans won't bust the budget with too-steep cuts in capital gains taxes. It's the Republicans' day, though: when Senate Democrats tried to scrap one bit of business-as-usual and bar members of Congress from taking lobbyists' gifts, the idea was summarily killed off.
 
What the Dividends Foretell
Each week, a different crystal ball peers into the economy's soul. Yes, we'll soon be hearing about the Super Bowl indicator. The latest tea leaf? Corporate dividends. An S.&P. study out last week showed that while few companies are cutting dividends, they're not quite as quick to raise them. True, payout increases were up in '94 from '93, but the rise wasn't as steep as a powerful economy might suggest. Since directors hate to cut dividends, and thus avoid raising them unless they're sure they can be sustained, this could be a sign of wavering confidence.
 
Orange County Digs Out
Raise taxes? In Orange County? Don't be ridiculous. It's "not going to happen," said an adviser to the county. "I will not support any new taxes," said a county supervisor. Californians feel strongly about such things. Never mind that in the wake of the derivatives debacle, the county -- the very symbol of suburban affluence -- can't pay its bills. It did come up with $40 million in budget cuts recently to try to dig itself out, but it said last week that its shortfall was an awful lot more -- $172 million for the next six months. So without taxes, or a miracle, a lot of services are probably going to disappear.
 
What About New York?
Somehow the New York area fell off the bus a few months ago as the nation's economy sped gleefully onward. The region is one of the weakest in the nation, with job growth vanishing since July. (It did better in December, perhaps because of holiday sales jobs.) So those Federal Reserve rate increases -- meant to cool things off nationwide -- could plunge the city into an icy bath. And it could get worse: Charles Schumer of Brooklyn -- that new rarity, a House Democrat -- just released a study showing that the "Contract With America" would cost the city $1.9 billion in Federal aid next year. New York would be hit hard because, Mr. Schumer said, Newt Gingrich "uses 'New York' as a pejorative adjective."
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Paying Hitler's Bills
The time, the 1920's. The world had been made safe for capitalism, America was roaring, Germany was shattered, and Americans bought $210 million in German bonds. Not a wise move. When Hitler came along, he treated these bonds with his typical respect, and Germany quickly defaulted -- with Roosevelt reportedly saying, with a laugh, "Serves the Wall Street bankers right." Those bonds weren't forgotten, though -- part of the tab was paid years ago -- and now Germany's squaring its debts. It's offering new, presumably more solid bonds to investors, or, more likely, their descendants. Are you among them? Call Deutsche Bank. Now, where were those bonds?
 
Mexico Tries Soothing Words
Mexico, with firmly crossed fingers, is trying to push past this economic crisis. On Tuesday President Ernesto Zedillo announced a detailed recovery plan, and on Thursday the freshly minted Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, came to the money capital, New York, bearing calming words. This is "completely different" from 1982, he said, referring to Mexico's bond default. "We have a fundamentally solid economy." The peso, he assured, should steady itself at about 4.50 to the dollar -- it's now well above 5 -- and do so without Mexico's central bank propping it up. At first, the markets seemed to think he had a point, but on Friday the peso plunged again, to a new low.
 
On the Road Again
They're at it again. The United States and Japan keep trying to hammer out a solution to the lopsided trade in autos and auto parts, and last week they said the stalled talks would resume this month. The American deficit in the auto sector rose to $36.1 billion last year, more than half the trade gap with Japan. True, we're selling more there, but the flow this way more than wipes that out. It's a bit vague what any new talks will focus on, though, for Washington will now deal directly with Japanese companies on buying parts -- that was a big issue. The main thing seemed to be setting a tone of harmony when Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama calls on President Clinton this week.
 
COMPANIES
 
Thinking? Don't Get Caught
If you're toiling away past quitting time, visions of extra pay dancing the pain away, you'd better watch out: If you catch yourself feeling creative, put a lid on it, quick. Only the drones, it seems, need apply for overtime. A former Washington Post reporter, Thomas Sherwood, had insisted that under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, he should have gotten time and a half for all the extra hours he put in over the years. But a Federal judge has just ruled that the act does not apply. The act exempts professional and "artistic" workers, it seems, and the judge said many journalists fall into the latter category -- those whose work requires "invention, imagination and talent." So once again, this time by judicial decree, art is its own reward.
 
Go Digital, Young Man
"The Graduate," ca. 1995. Wise older person (not necessarily male) offers Dustin Hoffman type a single word of advice: "Digital." Forget traditional televisions, VCR's and the like. "Digital" is the word from last week's Consumer Electronics Show (a digital broadcast standard is coming), and the race is on. In 1994, sales of home computers, at $8.1 billion, came perilously close to the $8.4 billion spent on TV sets. Soon, in fact -- to hear the electronics gurus tell it -- we won't even be able to tell the difference. After all, a screen, as Humphrey Bogart didn't say, is just a screen. TV's will pay bills, under-$500 personal computers will have remote controls, and consumers will have headaches trying to keep up with it all.
 
Fabio! Believe It!
The folks who make I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! feel strongly about that exclamation point. So it's only natural that before they introduced a spray version last week, they scoured the globe for a human exclamation point to help sell it -- a search that led, of course, to Fabio. Fabio, who's such a superhunk supermodel that he doesn't need a last name, has adorned countless romance novels, but only now -- tomorrow, to be exact -- is he breaking into network commercials. I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! Spray has no fat, no calories, no cholesterol, its makers say; it's cooking in a "whole new way!" (There's that exclamation point again.) And the ads for it end with Fabio -- muscles rippling, blond hair flowing -- closing in to embrace the heroine of the moment. The voice-over: "Who says fantasies don't come true?" Sigh.
 
Just One Minus Sign . . .
Now we know what was behind that vanishing payment at Fidelity Magellan. It was the tiniest thing, Fidelity just told shareholders in a letter -- just a missing minus sign. An accountant, transcribing financial records onto a spreadsheet, accidentally turned a $1.3 billion loss into a $1.3 billion gain. But that $2.6 billion error was no small thing for investors who'd been told in November that they'd get $4.32 a share, then probably spending it before they got it, and ended up with nothing. A fitting end for a bleak year in mutual-fund land.

Armory's Status Is Quo As a Dispute Drags On

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
The Flushing Armory was converted into a homeless shelter in 1981, just when downtown Flushing shook itself out of economic doldrums. Over the years, various groups from the Flushing Chinese Business Association to the Borough President's Office have complained bitterly that the shelter brought loitering, prostitution and drugs into the heart of a busy retail area and an Asian center rivaling Manhattan's Chinatown.
And recent turns and twists in the armory's debated life have only irritated them further. 
 Last summer, the city closed the armory, at 137-58 Northern Boulevard, which was serving as one of its largest shelters for homeless women. But two months later, the city redesignated the armory as an emergency shelter for homeless men. (So far, because of the mild winter, it has not been called into service..)
Then, late last month, Assemblyman Brian McLaughlin, a Democrat, reported that a son of Queens would finally end the battle. He said he met privately with Mario M. Cuomo during his last days as Governor, and that a sympathetic Mr. Cuomo said he would have the State Divison of Military and Naval Affairs, which owns and leases the armory to the city, revoke the city's permit for the site.
Mr. Cuomo could not be reached for comment. But last week, Walter C. Wheeler, a spokesman for Military and Naval Affairs, said there has been no change in the armory's status.
"The Governor told me it was among his highest priorities," Mr. McLaughlin said. "Obviously, we are keenly disappointed."
So the fight goes on. The Assemblyman said he would urge Governor Pataki to revoke the permit.They want the armory to be transformed into a community center.
"We are ready to move in," said Regina Colletta, district manager of Community Board 7, which has no permanent office. N.O.

3 Advisers Set Model Courses for '95

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
MOST mutual fund investors had a bad 1994, as stock funds lost just over 2.5 percent, on average, and bond funds fell nearly twice that.
But 1995 looks more promising. Ballooning equity valuations have finally burst. And last year's growing economy, which prompted the Fed to raise interest rates six times, may at last be starting to slow down. 
 Given last year's tough markets, it is not surprising that the theme in 1995 fixes on rebounds. That's the common thread running through investments picked by the three advisers who were once again asked to craft model portfolios for the year ahead.
There's the anticipated revival in growth stocks. They offer good value relative to the overall market, and their earnings growth should become more attractive in this year's sluggish economy, the advisers say.
All three also assert that smaller-capitalization stocks are good values; that bonds, particularly hard hit in 1994, should begin to bounce back, and two say thatreal estate prices should be rebounding.
Columbia Growth is a core stock fund (20 percent) in John Rekenthaler's model portfolio for 1995. Mr. Rekenthaler, who edits Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago, says the fund's "multiples are reasonable relative to value stocks, and people will start to think more about a slowing economy this year, which is good for growth stocks."
He would also put 20 percent in IAI Regional, a midcap growth fund that survived a tough 1994. That's also a bet on smaller stocks bouncing back, as is Smallcap World (20 percent). It has half its portfolio invested domestically and the rest abroad, including smaller stocks in Europe, which Mr. Rekenthaler called good values now.
His core global position is Ivy International. Mr. Rekenthaler is willing to pay a steep 5.75 percent sales load for Ivy, which is managed by Haken Castegren, who also runs Harbor International. Mr. Rekenthaler calls Harbor "the most consistently successful international fund," but it is closed to new investors. Last fall, Mr. Castegren had Ivy invested in few Japanese and German stocks and split 16 percent equally among South African and Swedish issues.
Mr. Rekenthaler's remaining 20 percent is invested in Fidelity Puritan, a conservative pick with holdings in bonds and high-yielding stocks (up 1.8 percent in 1994).
Growth stocks, big and small, account for more than a third of the model portfolio built by Ken Gregory, who edits the No-Load Fund Analyst in San Francisco. He invests 20 percent in Harbor Capital Appreciation to tap into big-cap growth stocks, which he calls very cheap relative to the overall market and which should profit as the economy slows. Strong Growth (15 percent) buys issues that are still reasonably valued and have good earnings growth, he says.
Real estate investment trusts are coming off a bottom in real estate values and should benefit from a big inflow of capital from institutional investors, Mr. Gregory says. His pick: Cohen & Steers Realty Shares (15 percent), which has worked solely with REIT's for more than 10 years.
Mr. Gregory sees plenty of opportunities internationally. While currency risk remains a worry, long-term exposure overseas is a must, he says. He likes Warburg Pincus International Equity (20 percent).
Emerging markets' bonds were hit hard at the start of 1994 but rebounded nicely as the year went on. Then the devaluation of the peso by Mexico at year-end hit the group hard again, even though most emerging markets debt is dollar-denominated. Mr. Gregory bets on another rebound in 1995 with a 10 percent stake in Fidelity New Markets Income Fund.
As for domestic bonds, they should be far more stable in 1995, returning between 7 and 10 percent, Mr. Gregory says. He likes Pimco Total Return (20 percent), whose high minimum investment can be avoided by buying shares through a discount broker. Harbor Bond, a higher-expense alternative managed by the same firm, can be bought directly with a $2,000 minimum.
Domestic bonds also look like bargains to Anthony Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo. He taps into the market using the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index, a proxy for the United States bond market and 20 percent of his portfolio.
Overseas investments are imperative, he says, with so much of the world's capitalization outside the United States. He would allocate 15 percent to the T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, which has ranked in the top 6 percent of all foreign stock funds the last decade, he adds.
Among domestic stocks, Mr. Ogorek sees several potential revivals among beaten-down groups. Electric utilities were off almost 20 percent last year, and he would look for a rebound using the Stratton Monthly Dividend Fund (20 percent). He also looks for a rebound in REIT's in 1995, using Cohen & Steers Realty Shares (15 percent).
To tap into smaller capitalization stocks, Mr. Ogorek recommends Strong Growth (15 percent) and Parnassus (15 percent). Parnassus, a "socially responsible" fund, is currently moving into undervalued market sectors like health care, he says.

Dateline: Chinatown

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
ONE recent day, John Yu, a porter in a hotel and an immigrant from Hong Kong, stopped at the newsstand on Canal Street near Mott and perused the four major Chinese-language daily newspapers: World Journal, Sing Tao Daily, The China Press and The United Journal.
"My English isn't that good," Mr. Yu said. "This is the only way I can find out what's going on in the world." 
 He selected the World Journal. But just for this day. Mr. Yu said he alternated his selection on different days.
"It's hard to get the complete news from any one single Chinese-language newspaper here," he said. "Most of the newspapers have a political bent. It's hard to find out what's really going on in the world."
For Chinese immigrants who read little English, the Chinese-language newspapers are a lifeline to the outside world, a way of keeping abreast of the news that is beyond their reach in the American news media and of keeping up with the social and political activities in the Chinese community. But they often read the news with a skeptical eye, believing that the coverage is tainted by the decades of hatred between the Communist Government of the mainland and the exiled Government of Taiwan. Television does not help much. The five hours of Chinese-language programming each week on cable are mostly entertainment.
In recent years, with economic opportunities opening up on the mainland and reunification efforts taking place, the papers have shifted away somewhat from political extremes, and the papers' management proclaims neutrality, with the exception of The United Journal, which is vocally anti-Communist. Still, the Chinese consumers of news perceive differences, even if sometimes those differences are subtle, requiring as much a sense of what is not said as what is.
The different approaches between World Journal and The China Press, for example, were vividly apparent last fall in the coverage of the Chinatown parade celebrating the founding of the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan. World Journal, which stresses coverage of Taiwan, ran a front-page story and reported that 60,000 people turned out. The China Press, which focuses on the mainland, placed the news on page 16 and gave a much lower crowd estimate.
Two weeks earlier, after a parade celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China, or the mainland, The China Press had run a front-page story but made no mention of the handful of pro-democracy demonstrators. World Journal reported the parade on the front page but ran an article next to it on the demonstration.
The local coverage varies in comprehensiveness and is generally uncritical to local Chinese leaders and to organized-crime leaders who are believed to wield enormous power in Chinese neighborhoods.
When Benny Ong, an underworld figure commonly known as "the Godfather of Chinatown," died last August, his obituaries were reverential and there was no mention of his criminal past. Coverage of several recent arrests of organized-crime leaders kept to the basic translation of the indictments. Sometimes, even such perfunctory coverage can be risky. Once, when a reporter mistranslated a court document, the accused demanded a whole roast pig as an apology. He got the pig.
Some Chinese journalists say their objectivity is compromised by having to sell advertising space. Reporters from Sing Tao Daily and The United Journal sell space.
"I don't like what he is doing to the community, but he's my biggest account, what can I do?" a reporter said recently about a businessman.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
When City Walls Speak

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
THE police expected a shootout. After all, they had seen the writing on the wall: a threat scrawled in spray paint on a housing project doorway. Someone named Dock vowed that when he ran into his enemy, Rine, he was going to TOS him -- terminate him on sight.
The cops knew Dock and Rine (rhymes with "sign"). Both had been behind bars for vandalism. But now they were back on the street. The police found Dock, who runs with a crew called the Deadly Ones, and explained that bumping off Rine, a member of the rival Manhattan Known Bombers, would mean jail, for years. 
 "It was a beef over spray paint," recalled Officer Robert Cekada of the housing authority police anti-graffiti unit. "One guy tagged over another guy's tag. What we were able to do was to mediate the whole situation and calm them both down."
Officer Cekada, 23, and his partners, Anthony Gonzalez, 25, and Alberto Ruiz, 29, have spent the last year and a half studying graffiti in East Harlem. In the universe of police work, this may not seem like the most macho assignment or a likely candidate for an episode of "NYPD Blue." But recently, as the housing police have learned, it is often deadly serious work. Understanding the nuances of this Internet of urban youth has helped head off trouble and has brought to light new facts about gang culture.
"Graffiti is being used to sell drugs, to sell prostitution," said Allen Monczyk, a spokesman for the New York City Public Housing Authority. "It was once seen as a social nuisance, a social problem, and because it was allowed to exist and nobody really fought it strenuously, criminals are using it for their benefits."
An example is the case of Jose Lopez, 16, whom the officers caught writing the name of a well-known gang -- Netas -- in bold, four-foot- high letters on asphalt in a courtyard at Clinton Houses. "He said he wanted a police helicopter to know that this was his turf," Officer Cekada said. Jose, who goes by the street name Aco, was arrested for vandalism. But he was wanted on a murder warrant, and the address led the police to a major prostitution ring that they said Jose and other gang members were involved in. The police say the ring was shut down.
Busts like this one have helped the three anti-graffiti officers gain the respect of their peers. Once dubbed the "crayon cops" by colleagues who viewed fighting graffiti as a cushy quality-of-life assignment, the unit has made 200 arrests (most for vandalism), has solved dozens of robberies and drug cases and passed along countless leads.
Their success has surprised the officers' former commander, James Tuller, who set up the unit last year. Mr. Tuller said he knew the housing authority spent $13 million a year to clean graffiti from walls, halls, walkways and windows, but he never recognized its connections to crime.
"As we're picking it up and we're learning the language, " Mr. Tuller said, "I like to say that those walls talk to us."
Residents of the 11 buildings patrolled by the officers call their beepers at the first sign of a fresh tag, and youths who recognize their unmarked Chevy Lumina tease them with gang hand signals.
Graffiti scrawlers sometimes play cat and mouse, incorporating the officers' names into their writings. One vandal whose tag is Spon wrote a slur against Officer Cekada on a wall of Park East High School at 106th Street and Park Avenue. On Halloween, Spon desecrated a nearby handball court with a taunt: "Trick or treat: we write while you sleep."
After that, "we locked Spon up," Officer Gonzalez said with a gleeful smile. Standing in the playground of Park East High -- where an unsanctioned graffiti "Hall of Fame" covers the walls -- Officers Gonzalez and Cekada divide its artists into those they have arrested and those they haven't.
"At 9 A.M. on a Saturday we locked up six guys here with about 200 cans of spray paint," Officer Cekada said. "They were from Rhode Island."
The officers spent their own money to travel to Los Angeles and to Boston to study graffiti. All three hard-boiled New Yorkers were rattled by the drive-by shootings and menacing graffiti they found in Los Angeles. "We thought, 'Oh, we work in Harlem, nothing can scare us,' " Officer Cekada said. "But it's a totally different world out there. They have a much worse problem than we have here."
The trip also taught them more about Los Angeles gang slang, which has migrated East through "gangsta rap" music. So have many members of Los Angeles's most notorious gangs, the Bloods and the Crips.
This month, Officers Cekada, Gonzalez and Ruiz will train 12 more anti-graffiti cops to decipher spray-can hieroglyphics. All 15 will fan out in the five boroughs. Plans call for doubling the size of the unit in 1996.
A $1.8 million grant from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development will pay for a computer system to record photographs of graffiti from throughout the city on disks, enabling officers to compile a multiborough gang database. The East Harlem officers hope to learn how many of the 50 gangs they know about operate elsewhere in the city. They say they can tell what a gang is up to by what its members write. And they think the gangs are often foolish to cue in the authorities so blatantly.
"A lot of times they even write down the block that they live on," Officer Cekada said. "They're so stupid."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
$300 Million Is Coming. Who Will Spend It?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
If money is power, five political appointees are destined for the fast track. The five, still to be chosen, will decide how $300 million in public money will be spent in Harlem, Washington Heights and parts of the South Bronx, one of six urban empowerment zones picked by President Clinton late last year.
For two years, community advocates in the three areas have compiled wish-lists of projects they would pay for if New York was tapped for the direct government aid and tax breaks zone status confers. At the top: a "one-stop capital shop" for small businesses, two centers to recruit and train unemployed residents for jobs, more day-care and clean-up of vacant lots. 
 With the checks nearly in the mail, local officials are feeling pressure to set up the zone's governing structure and secure money quickly for projects with immediate, measurable impact. They fairly swoon thinking of an influx of new businesses, and a leap in local employment rates by the end of 1997.
"The Federal Government will be keeping a very close eye, a very close tab on progress, so the communities must show progress in the first two years," said Sam Mattingly-Wilford, a spokeswoman for the Harlem Urban Development Corporation.
Another goal is to rebut critics who view the zones as futile attempts to revive costly Great Society programs of the '60s. "This is the show," said Dennis Reeder, the director of the Washington Heights and Inwood Development Corporation. Failure to produce would mean "there's going to be nothing else."
A pledge of $300 million in government money may seem like a windfall when screws are tightening at every turn in the fiscal process. But residents hope it's just seed money to leverage private investment.
Officials hope to have the zone's three governing groups in place by the end of this month. But the chances are remote. A likely bottleneck is the office of Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem Democrat, who fended off a challenge from Borough President Fernando Ferrer to add two Bronx neighborhoods, Melrose and Mott Haven, to the zone.
Despite hints about whom he might appoint to the governing panels, Mr. Rangel has offered only one name, former Mayor David N. Dinkins. And even that came with caveats in an emerging game with Washington. Before formally naming Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Rangel wants to see how senior an official is chosen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"Mayor Dinkins has agreed to serve for Manhattan," he said, "but I would not want him to do it if it were just a lower-level appointee from HUD. Everyone is looking at each other because we want it to be on the same level." JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Recovery? Not in Your Paycheck.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
SOMETHING is wrong with America's economic boom. After nearly four years of ever-stronger growth, people's wages should be going up faster than their expenses. For most people they're not, and this is the first time in decades that a recovery has gone so long without putting more money in more pockets. And now, if the recovery runs out of steam in 1995 -- as so many economists predict -- that money might never show up.
Raising wages has become the No. 1 economic issue in the nation today. Robust economic growth and rapid job creation are no longer enough to raise spirits. Both occurred in plenty of time for the November election, and still the Democrats lost Congress.
In his last speech to the nation, in mid-December, President Clinton made raising incomes, particularly wages, the new top priority. But neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are proposing ways to do this, except by lowering taxes. 
 "Think of the income tax-cut proposals," said Richard B. Freeman, an economist at Harvard, "as saying to American workers, 'Gee, we won't let you get wage increases through the job market, so we will give you some tax cuts, which are really wage increases, and we politicians, Democrats or Republicans, can claim credit for it.' "
For months, the Clinton Administration had counted on a strong recovery to create jobs and then to force up wages by more than the inflation rate. The hiring happened; the work force grew by 3.5 million people last year alone, including 256,000 in December. The script written by economists said that as the unemployment rate fell -- it dipped to 5.4 percent last month -- labor shortages would develop and employers would raise wages to get workers.
Some labor shortages have indeed developed, but Corporate America is not bidding up wages.
The average weekly wage of jobholders below management level is $389 today. After adjustments for inflation, that amount turns out to have the same purchasing power as the $342 average wage in March 1990, when the recovery began, the Labor Department reports. Other measures of average or median wages offer similar evidence of stagnation.
Still, there are stories of hefty raises for ordinary workers.
The Gillette Company, for example, regularly upgrades the manufacturing technology at its razor factory in South Boston, where 2,000 people are employed. As more complicated machinery replaces older, simpler equipment, the company requires a higher proportion of very skilled workers.
"If someone is a Grade 11 operator making $8 an hour, then we train him in the new skills he'll need and we promote him to a Grade 10 or Grade 9 operator, making $10 an hour," said Edward DeGraan, a senior vice president of manufacturing at Gillette. "His old job is then eliminated."
That is a 15 percent raise, far above the annual inflation rate of nearly 3 percent.
 
The Making of Machinists
 Similarly, metalworking shops in Rochester, their order books filled in a strong economy, need more machinists, or at least people who can perform some of the functions of a machinist. So they hire away retail clerks making $7 an hour, train them for several months and put them to work as machinists at $9 or $10 an hour, a substantial jump.
The stores, in turn, hire even lower-paid employees away from restaurants and other establishments. Then their owners, being at the bottom of the wage chain, put help-wanted signs in the window, hoping to attract the unemployed to their minimum-wage jobs.
But these examples represent a jump in pay levels for the workers involved, not a change in pay levels themselves. "Each company is reluctant to increase the pay assigned to a particular job," said David Wyss, senior economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill. "What they are doing is reaching down in the spectrum for people in lower-paying work."
And so far this job-shifting and reaching down has not involved enough workers to affect average wages nationally.
 
Between Recessions
 In the pattern set after World War II, wage scales rose frequently between recessions. Each rising economy soon lifted all boats. Living standards would rise for tens of millions of people, whether they were job-hopping or staying put. In the 1980's, however, the recovery from the 1982 recession was nearly six years old before wages recovered. And so far in the 1990's, most boats have not risen at all.
Many explanations have been offered for the delay. The numerous layoffs and plant closings play a role. So do the weakening of labor unions, the alternative of cheaper workers abroad, inefficiency, and falling prices for computers, which hold down wages in that big industry.
Whatever the truth, the nation still possesses a huge pool of standby people eager to shift to higher wage jobs, or any jobs at all. This pool might disappear if the economy continues to grow strongly this year and probably next year as well, many economists say. But they also say the strong growth won't last; although many indicators remain strong, they suggest that the economy has passed its peak for this recovery.
That raises another issue. Suppose the market system fails to end the wage stagnation in the traditional way, by forcing employers to bid for scarce workers to keep their operations running at full capacity. Should the Clinton Administration or Congress or both take steps -- other than their proposals for tax cuts and more training for more workers -- to try to raise people's incomes before the 1996 election?
Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are debating such things right now. But Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said on Friday that the Administration was discussing an increase in the minimum wage. He also engages in some jawboning.
"American business has gotten everything it wished from this Administration: Nafta, GATT, deficit reduction and vigorous promotion of U.S. exports," Mr. Reich said. "If American industry wants to maintain the loyalty of employees and a political consensus that is pro-business, it has got to get serious about training workers and increasing their pay."

Shoppers! Deciding? Just Ask Your Child.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the members of the beleaguered middle class contemplate the economic forces that are devouring their discretionary funds, they might also look at the self-inflicted one: indulging their children.
Such an idea may not be all that surprising to parents who have made it through another holiday shopping spree and are now realizing how much of a body blow was dealt the family budget by purchases of Power Rangers, the American Girl Doll with accessories or the portable Game Gear with Mortal Kombat. Even as the American public insists that the Government tighten its belt and curb spending, the willingness of parents to shower their children with material goods continues to accelerate. 
 Last year, Americans spent $17.5 billion on toys, nearly 50 percent more than in 1980, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade group in New York. Spending on toys, clothing and other items for children was a major reason for the 6.5 percent growth in holiday sales, the third year in a row that Christmas buying produced an increase over the previous year.
 
A Weakened Family
 Some companies and marketing experts believe that dollar figures for toys, games and clothing purchased for children do not reflect the children's true impact on family budgets. James U. McNeal, a marketing professor at Texas A & M University says that during the last decade, children exert an ever-increasing influence in decisions to buy a host of products from food, clothing, vacations, furniture, computers, autos and a range of other products or services that once were the province of adult decision-makers.
"The decision-maker increasingly is becoming the kid," said Mr. McNeal, who has studied family spending habits for more than 30 years, surveying parents, children, manufacturers and advertising and marketing companies.
Mr. McNeal estimates that children played a direct role in the purchase of $157 billion in goods and services in 1993, more than triple the $50 billion in purchases he attributes to them in 1984. And he predicts that the amount of what he calls "kid-influenced spending" will double by 2001. Mr. McNeal and other marketers say that based on their surveys of the industry and families the growth in such spending is pushing up expenditures for families, adding to the financial pressures on the middle-income families.
"How do you think a family making $22,000 feels when their kid says, 'I've just got to have a computer?' " Mr. McNeal asked.
According to Mr. McNeal and others who have studied the American family, the increasing weight of the children in deciding how parents spend their income is an outgrowth of the gradual weakening of family structures. Factors include high rates of divorce, single parenthood and the rising number of families where both parents work, a group that now totals 70 percent of all families with children.
In the past, for example, children might express the wish to wear a particular article of clothing and the nonworking spouse, usually the mother, would browse the stores, looking for something that might fit the bill at the best price. Today, after working a 40-hour week, many mothers are too tired, or don't know where to find specific styles at a discount. As a result, some marketers or others who study family spending behavior say, they are likely to indulge the child's desires, even if they include $100 brand-name sneakers, oversized jeans or a $25 baseball cap to be worn backward.
And some researchers say with the weakening of families, children are more and more disposed to get their values from peer groups and television -- two sources that tend to stress consumerism. "Children can acquire an identity from their home, or they can purchase it in the marketplace," said David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values, nonpartisan research organization that focuses on family issues. "And we are becoming more and more a society where children want to buy it."
With the diminution of parental authority in buying decisions, a wider variety of corporations than before have begun targeting youngsters in advertising and promotion campaigns. In recent years Holiday Inn and Delta Airlines have established marketing programs aimed at children. Marketers say electronics and computer companies, vacation resorts and clothing manufacturers have joined fast food restaurants in appealing directly to children and hoping that what they call the "nag factor" will help move the merchandise.
No parent who has brought a child along on a grocery-buying expedition has emerged unscathed from certain aisles. Sugared cereals, cookies and salted snacks somehow find their way into the shopping cart along with the meat and potatoes. Companies like General Foods have found that they can charge more for food items if they create them in shapes and colors appealing to children. Parents, who spend less time with their children during the week, find that quality time on the weekend often involves shopping excursions.
"The stuff we come up with, some of it targets directly to the kids and looks at the kids as the primary spender," said Pamela Hege, executive director of Kids Link, an Atlanta-based marketing company. "We have other campaigns where we use the child as a conduit to get to the parents."
 
Material Babies
 The marketers' job has become much easier, researchers say, because children are much more conscious of brands at an earlier age. But before blaming this latest trend on the advertising on Saturday-morning cartoon shows, Mr. McNeal insists that children's penchant for more expensive brand-name items is a direct reflection of their parents' desires for the very same kinds of things.
"You find parents who buy a pair of Nikes or an Izod shirt for their baby because they think it's cute," he said. "Well, baby figures that 'If Mommy or Daddy likes these things, I ought to like them, too.' Children want things more often than not because their parents taught them to want them."

You Want Your Newt TV? Whether You Do or You Don't, It's Here.

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
NEWT GINGRICH, the new Speaker of the House, says he wants to "zero out" funding for public broadcasting because he doesn't think taxpayers should have to "subsidize something that told them how to think."
National Empowerment Television is more his speed. Founded just over a year ago by Paul Weyrich, the 24-hour, Washington-based network is home to two of Mr. Gingrich's programs, including a history course. He says that with its emphasis on live, viewer call-in programming, the conservative network provides a better alternative to the "distortions" of the "media elite." 
 NET's national penetration is patchy now -- it says it reaches roughly 11 million households, via satellite dish or by local cable or broadcast arrangement -- but it expects viewership to grow what with the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. planning to carry it on more of its systems and interest in the new Republican-dominated Congress high.
The question becomes, what's in store for many American channel-surfers?
The network sums itself up thusly: "NET is must-watch television for public policy wonks and junkies, the C-SPAN crowd looking for more spice and pace, and the PBS and public policy crowd looking for more real-time coverage.
"In short, NET is C-SPAN with an attitude."
Below is a sampling from NET's weekly program schedule, with descriptions excerpted from its promotional literature. For comparison's sake, last week's corresponding programs from the other NET -- the Public Broadcasting System's flagship WNET in Newark -- and from one of the major commercial networks are also listed. All times are Eastern.

HEADLINE: Blacks Say Life In Los Angeles Is Losing Allure

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7

 BODY:
For perhaps half a century, Los Angeles has lured blacks, along with hundreds of thousands of other immigrants from the South and Midwest, with its promise of jobs and the luxury of space. But in the last decade, fed up with high housing costs, drugs and crime, blacks have been fleeing Los Angeles, not only to outlying areas, but also to other states, particularly in the South.
In fact, demographers and geographers say, middle-class and working-class blacks, born in California, are on the verge of disappearing altogether from some neighborhoods. 
 According to population surveys conducted by the Census Bureau, from 1985 to 1990, 61,773 blacks moved out of Los Angeles County. That represents 6.9 percent of the 901,200 blacks over the age of 5 counted in the 1990 Census.
"We are seeing a total restructuring of Southern California's black community," said James H. Johnson, a geographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies black migration. "In a community where you have other ethnic groups growing rapidly, these changes have enormous political and electoral significance."
Demographers say most blacks are moving to neighboring counties like Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura. But a surprising number are moving to other states to seek economic opportunity, especially in the South, even if they do not have roots in that area.
Although South-Central Los Angeles is still predominantly black, in little more than a decade it has also become one of the nation's fastest-growing Hispanic neighborhoods. And by the turn of the century, experts say, Hispanic people will outnumber blacks in both that neighborhood and the county. Asians are also rapidly moving into Los Angeles County in numbers expected to double by the end of the century to at least 12 percent of the total population.
In South-Central Los Angeles, movie theaters, dance clubs, barber shops and pool halls that once catered to a black population are vanishing. Central Avenue, once the center of black life in Los Angeles, now is home to Hispanic-run appliance and furniture stores. And as the neighborhood has changed, there have been clashes between the two groups.
Blacks who are leaving point to the still struggling Southern California economy, whose hard-hit defense industries employed tens of thousands of blacks in relatively high-paying jobs. But almost as important as a chief motivation for the exodus is the area's long eroding quality of life.
Kaama Moseley's parents fled the poverty and bigotry of segregated Arkansas 50 years ago for the jobs, hope and vigor of the West Coast. Now, disillusioned with Los Angeles's stagnant economy, drugs, crowded schools and gangs, Ms. Moseley, her husband and three children have recently resettled in Lithonia, Ga., a semirural suburb of Atlanta.
"It's kind of ironic," said Ms. Moseley, 37, a hairstylist who grew up in East Los Angeles and who until now has lived her entire life in California. "I left California for the same reason my parents abandoned the South. They couldn't make a decent living there, with Jim Crow and all of that, and I couldn't make it anymore in California. I was fed up and tired of that vicious economic cycle."
In an interview in her new home, Ms. Moseley said she left the state partly because her livelihood as a professional hair-braider depended almost entirely on blacks, and over time the market was diminishing.
"I have a product that's designed for black people, so I needed to go where they were," she said. "There are a lot of black businesses here, and a lot of black people who are doing very, very well."
Now, she says, she is the pioneer in her family. "I have a brother coming here in late January or February, and then my younger brother is coming as well," she said. "And a lot of my cousins have been asking me about moving."
Marilyn Thompson, 45, a telephone company manager who lived in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years before moving to Atlanta last year, also said the doors of opportunity seemed open for Hispanic and Asian residents but shut for blacks in California.
"It seems like you can come into California and have nothing and end up with everything," she said of other immigrants to the state. But, she said, blacks "can't seem to get ahead."
Ms. Thompson, who had lived in Baldwin Hills, an affluent black neighborhood on a hill that overlooks South-Central Los Angeles, added that the constant threat of crime and violence had made the city increasingly uninhabitable.
"I lived in a pretty good area, Baldwin Hills, but it didn't matter where you live, you had that element coming in," she said. "That gang scene was getting out of hand. I was tired of those drive-bys."
Some well-educated and relatively affluent blacks see an equally grim picture. Lisa Collins, a 38-year-old lawyer, and her husband, Arthur, a 39-year-old doctor, said they were planning to leave Los Angeles as soon as they could establish their careers elsewhere. Originally from Indianapolis, they cited high living costs and the deteriorating public school system as reasons to move.
"If I was living in Indianapolis, I'd have 50 acres, probably 10 horses and a mansion with a maid," Mrs. Collins said.
The Collinses said they had delayed having children because they lacked confidence in the Los Angeles public schools. Mrs. Collins said: "It seems like most of my friends have enrolled their kids in private schools here. Or they have moved to areas where at least the schools are decent."
Recent studies suggest that while white flight from urban areas has often begun among the middle and upper classes, black flight here is encompassing the entire economic spectrum.
The Census Bureau analysis, conducted for the University of Michigan Center for Population Studies, provided details about the millions of people who moved to, from or within metropolitan Los Angeles in the second half of the 1980's.
"What's important and new about this," said William Frey, a demographer for the Michigan center, "is that the black outmigrants are not only middle class, but also on the lower end of the economic scale."
Dr. Johnson, the North Carolina geographer, said: "The typical picture of poor blacks is that they are the ones who remain in economically depressed communities who become welfare dependents. What these data suggest is that a substantial cadre of poor and disadvantaged blacks are moving in search not of welfare but better economic opportunities."
The blacks who are leaving Los Angeles for other areas in California are generally leapfrogging the familiar suburban destinations of whites, like Orange County, and heading farther east toward Riverside and San Bernardino Counties or up the coast north to Ventura County. From 1980 to 1990, the black population in the Riverside-San Bernardino area increased 113 percent, making it the fastest growing black community in the country.
The blacks who are leaving California altogether are heading to Southern states -- including Florida, Georgia and Texas -- as well as to Illinois, New York and Washington state. Dr. Johnson said some blacks from Los Angeles are also moving to Las Vegas, Nev., where they are seeking service jobs in the casino industry. Other blacks are moving to Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, apparently because they have roots in those states.
South-Central Los Angeles's last major ethnic transition occurred in the early 1940's during World War II. Before then, the neighborhood was a mosaic of Italian and Hispanic immigrants and blacks, who had fled the stifling racism of the South. But as more and more blacks moved in, the whites moved out, eventually creating one of the country's most racially segregated areas.
After riots in the Watts section in August 1965, many factories pulled up stakes, taking with them well-paying manufacturing jobs. The area further deteriorated in the 70's and 80's as the few remaining major companies closed their factories.
But the area's economic demise did not dim the hopes of a wave of immigrants from Mexico, Central America and Asia who began to push blacks out of Watts and other areas. Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, the black population of Los Angeles County dropped to 11 percent from 13 percent of the population, while the Hispanic and Asian populations swelled.
At the same time, many black residents have become increasingly resentful of the new immigrants, who many say are taking most of the region's low-wage jobs.
Ms. Moseley said that Asians who own many of the small businesses in Los Angeles tend to hire other Asians as workers, not blacks.
"I'm not taking anything from them, because I'm trying to emulate them and to watch them and to do as they do, because what they've done is what you're supposed to do," she added. "You come and find an opportunity and seize it, so you can't blame them for that. It just puts us in a very awkward situation as natives.
"I told myself, this is something that's bigger than you," she continued. "You can't change the political structure. Sometimes it's better to leave, which a lot of people have done."

HEADLINE: BUDGET WOES EASE FOR CITIES IN U.S., ANALYSTS REPORT

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Flush with growing tax receipts from an improved economy and reaping the benefits of years of belt-tightening, the country's major cities are in their best financial shape in years, city officials and analysts say.
This trend is evident despite the fact that it does not include the nation's two largest cities, New York and Los Angeles, where weak local economies have contributed to continuing budget woes. 
 The roster of cities that have made stunning comebacks from the hard times of the recession include municipalities as diverse as Chicago, Miami, Denver, Detroit, San Francisco and Cleveland. Even Bridgeport, Conn., which was forced into bankruptcy in 1991, has returned to fiscal stability.
Many cities are even running surpluses for the first time in years, say students of municipal finances and chief financial officers of large cities.
Analysts of municipal finances say that in recent years more and more cities based budgets on conservative estimates of revenue and then used those estimates as a rationale to trim costs. As a result, as the economy bounced back, revenue exceeded expectations, leaving many cities with balanced budgets or even large surpluses.
"We've found that even the cities that were sort of just hanging in there and not doing terrifically well, even they are reporting that the underlying economic base was better in '94 than it was in the prior two or three years," said Michael A. Pagano, a political science professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who tracks municipal finances for the National League of Cities.
Beyond increased tax revenue, many cities have, in recent years, reduced expenses. They have instituted hiring freezes, kept wages down and in some cases, introduced new work rules to increase productivity. As a result, Mr. Pagano said, spending by large cities grew by one-half of 1 percent in 1993, a sharp decline from the 3 percent spending growth of the late 1980's and the 2 percent to 2.5 percent of the early years of this decade.
Analysts caution that the heady return to fiscal health of cities could unravel this year. For one thing, urban problems like poverty, crime and AIDS have not gone away as cities made sharp cuts in their social spending to cope with the recession. And unions, after accepting years of wage freezes, may start agitating for pay increases.
In addition, the revenue received by cities could face threats both from a slowdown in the economy, which many experts predict, and from proposals from would-be tax cutters in Congress and many state legislatures to reduce aid to cities.
"It's too early to declare victory," said Hy Grossman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Public Finance Department.
Still, in an annual survey of city fiscal administrators last July, the National League of Cities reported that 54.5 percent of more than 550 chief financial officers felt their cities "were better able to meet their fiscal needs in 1994, compared to 1993." That was a substantial increase in the level of optimism compared with the 33.7 percent who felt that way a year before.
And a report last year by Moody's Investor Service indicated that in 1993 -- the latest year for which complete data are available -- it upgraded the ratings for the general obligation bonds for 83 cities and downgraded the ratings for 39 others. That was a marked improvement in the fiscal health of cities from only a year before, when Moody's upgraded the ratings for 61 cities and downgraded those for 59.
"It's really great," Elizabeth Orr, Denver's finance director, said of her city, which went into the economic doldrums in the late 1980's with the collapse of oil prices. "Since 1989, we've been in very good financial shape. Some of that is just what's going on in the overall economy; some of it is a result of investments the city helped make to encourage economic activity."
Russell Carlson, first deputy budget analyst for Chicago, said that in addition to a healthier economy in the Midwest, his city has benefited from the fall in interest rates, which saved it $90 million in debt service last year. Mr. Carlson said the city ended the last fiscal year with a $76 million surplus and expects a similar result this year.
Three years ago, San Francisco ended its fiscal year with a surplus of $100,000, "which is, like, nothing," said Teresa Serata, the city's director of finance. Two years ago, Ms. Serata said the surplus grew to $600,000. Last year it was $11 million.
Even officials in Detroit, long considered one of the basket cases of American cities, will end its fiscal year next June with a balanced budget, a far cry from the $54 million deficit with which it started the fiscal year, according to Eric Tucker, its finance director.
"Some of it will be done through borrowing," Mr. Tucker said. "Some of it is managing expenses better. A lot of it is an improved economy. This is still the Motor City and the auto industry is doing fairly well."
Most cities are required by law to balance their budgets. But often, especially during hard times, officials employ accounting gimmicks to mask deficits.
Some experts who keep track of municipal finances say that while city budgets are in better shape that does not mean urban areas have cured their endemic problems of poverty, shoddy housing, poor schools and a loss of jobs to suburban areas. Indeed, some experts say cities are balancing budgets by cutting back on programs for low-income residents.
"Cities have pulled back, in most cases, from thinking that they can solve the problems of poverty and social ills and tend to be focusing on day-to-day delivery of core services," said Philip Dearborn, director of government finance research for the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a body created by Congress to study the relationship between Federal, state and local governments.
Still, even as cities enjoy a healthier bottom line, many municipalities continue to struggle. And because three of them -- New York, Washington and Los Angeles -- are the country's prime media centers, there continues to be an impression of overall urban budget problems. At the same time, all three cities face financial problems different from others cities in the country.
In New York, the Giuliani Administration is facing a potential $2 billion deficit next year, despite having negotiated work rule changes that increased productivity of municipal workers. The prime cause of New York's financial woes is the slowdown in the regional economy, especially the banking and securities sectors.
In addition, New York City's counties -- each borough of the city is a separate county -- have to pay 50 percent of the non-Federal share of Medicaid, a burden that is usually picked up entirely by state government.
Los Angeles, which had a $54.1 million deficit for the fiscal year that ended last June 30, has had to deal with cutbacks in defense spending in recent years, which have devastated its aerospace industry. In addition, the city is still digging out from the financial impact of last year's earthquake and the riots of 1992. Also, Los Angeles, like all cities in California, is limited in its ability to raise property taxes, by Proposition 13, the 1978 tax-cutting amendment to the state Constitution.
The District of Columbia sits in the heart of an area that is fifth among the 25 largest cities in household income, third in the percentage of people completing college and first in employment of high-wage professional, managerial and technical jobs. But it nonetheless is facing a budget deficit of $530 million, which some analysts say could rise to nearly $1 billion by the turn of the century.
Part of the current problem is a failure to move quickly to cut costs as revenue fell during the recession. But the District's special constitutional status, as a kind of city-state without full independence, has created other problems. The District has to fully finance certain services, like the non-Federal portion of Medicaid or the incarceration of felons, that are generally picked up in whole or in part by state governments.
Moreover, even though the District of Columbia continues to be the chief location of jobs for people living in the area, it cannot impose a commuter tax without getting permission from Congress -- an increasingly remote prospect with Republicans in control of that body.

HEADLINE: We Still Need C.I.A., but It Needs to Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"For C.I.A., History Is the Big Traitor" (The Week in Review, Jan. 1) nails the soft spots in national intelligence: the secondary role of intelligence in international crime; the competition of open-source information; the marginal potentials of intelligence to contribute to ecology, environment and even economic threats, and the lack of a vision of future strategic intelligence needs. 
 You also tell us that a relevant direction for the Central Intelligence Agency is an imperative for national security.
Robert M. Gates, when leaving the National Security Council to become Director of Central Intelligence, got President Bush to sign a directive to all executive departments to conduct a review of intelligence needs for the post-cold-war era. Largely based on these results came the cry, first from Mr. Gates and then from President's Clinton's C.I.A. Director, R. James Woolsey Jr., that the post-cold-war world was a more dangerous place and that intelligence had to do more with less.
They missed the point that the "more" is the marginal and inappropriate work that you rightly dismiss as a basis for continuing the C.I.A.
Post-cold-war geopolitical developments that will eventually force a more aggressive United States foreign policy have not matured to the point of sparking a response strategy. The national, ethnic and boundary-conflict crises that fill the news do not constitute a more dangerous world to United States citizens.
But this early period of the post-cold war is transitional. It is a recess from the offensive foreign policy that we had to endure for four decades. Strategic intelligence needs by policy makers and defense planners are consequently ill defined.
But this doesn't mean no intelligence work. Intelligence must still monitor and interpret the major, glacierlike, regional geopolitical power shifts in all continents, and it will be of immense importance to our future well-being.
Future strategic threats include the Asian economic explosion; the declining rationale for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Japan's growing political power; the increased economic strength of a confederated Europe, and Russia's future position in Eurasia.
While the consequences of these geopolitical evolutions look ominous, the results are not predestined. Good foreign and defense policies will be able to minimize the negatives and even create new security opportunities. This will take good intelligence.
The country still needs a healthy Central Intelligence Agency, and there will be no doubt about it by the end of the century, provided that your article is taken as a wakeup call.

HEADLINE: A Contract for Our Royalist Congress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Republicans in Congress have put forward a "Contract With America." I propose a three-item "contract" that all members of Congress, both houses, should adopt. 
 (1) Every March the Internal Revenue Service prepares the tax returns of representatives and senators. We taxpayers pay for this privilege, which should be abolished. Congress needs to be subjected to what we taxpayers are put through. Then it might simplify the process.
(2) Congress does not participate in Social Security like the rest of us. It has a Federal pension plan, 100 percent inflation-adjusted annually. It should be abolished, with all members placed on Social Security. Only when they and we share a common plan will they become reasonable about changes to the plan.
(3) Congress has its own health insurance plan. Members pay $25 each month for family health insurance. They also have access to government hospitals, for free surgery and other care. We taxpayers pay for this privilege for them too. In this case again, their interests are not those of the rest of the body politic.
The American people have created a royalist class: Congress! Members have exempted themselves from laws that affect our lives, and we have accepted this terrible mistreatment. We deserve something better, and it's time we demanded it.

HEADLINE: General Services Nominee Is Criticized

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The man picked by Gov. George E. Pataki to manage New York State's office space and its $2 billion purchasing operation has been doing the same job for five years in Westchester County, where he has been criticized for awarding lucrative leases to Republican contributors.
As general services administrator here, the nominee, Peter W. Delaney, has been accused by both Democratic and Republican county legislators of steering leases for office space that was not always needed to landlords and developers who were political supporters of the Republican County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke. 
 Mr. Delaney, 43, was nominated to be the state's general services commissioner, a $96,000-a-year position, on Dec. 30. He became Westchester's general services administrator in February 1990, making $102,000 a year. He took a leave from the Westchester job in 1993 to run Mr. O'Rourke's re-election campaign.
During his tenure, the county has moved its surrogate's court, appellate courts and public administrator's offices into two floors of a White Plains office building owned by Louis Cappelli, a builder who contributed $10,250 to Mr. O'Rourke's 1993 campaign.
The county also leases a three-story glass-and-steel building known as the Pep'e-Fareri building from a real estate partnership whose principals include John Fareri, who contributed at least $3,000 to Mr. O'Rourke in 1993. A third of that building space has remained unused by the county since it signed the lease in 1991.
As a result of such leases, say critics like Katherine S. Carsky, a Republican county legislator, the county's office space has doubled while its work force has stayed about the same. In 1985, the county owned or leased 437,222 square feet of office space for 4,809 workers. This year it is expected to have 978,043 square feet, while its work force has grown only slightly, to 5,067.
In choosing Mr. Delaney, Mr. Pataki has picked someone he has known since the mid-1980's and has done business with. In 1989, Mr. Delaney used Mr. Pataki to broker a real estate deal that earned Mr. Pataki the bulk of a $40,000 broker's fee.
Zenia Mucha, director of communications for Governor Pataki, said Mr. Delaney had saved Westchester "millions of dollars through automation" and would fulfill Mr. Pataki's goal of shrinking government.
Asked the administration's position on the awarding of leases to contributors, Ms. Mucha said: "Our understanding is they were given to people who offered the best price for the best product. Just because someone is involved in civic affairs and supports candidates should not automatically exclude them from conducting a business."
Mr. Delaney's appointment must be confirmed by the Republican-dominated State Senate.
He has been the head of a Westchester agency that operates almost 1 million square feet of office space and procures $55 million of equipment and supplies a year for the county. He has served as campaign manager for Mr. O'Rourke twice, in 1989 and 1993.
In an interview, Mr. Delaney denied favoring Republican contributors. "Most of your big landlords and developers give to both sides," he said, adding that the county had just as often rejected buildings owned by other large contributors. He also noted that Mr. Fareri gave his contribution two years after the county began leasing the Pep'e-Fareri building.
He acknowledged that the county's leased space had mushroomed, but said that was because the work force grew during the 1980's. "There were four people in a cubicle meant for one, on top of each other, talking over each other on the phone," he said. "In the past few years, the county has been cutting its work force and so it has had to consolidate some of its office space as well."
Stephen P. Tenore, the chairman of the County Legislature and a Republican, has frequently tangled with Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Delaney on their leasing practices. He has criticized them for leasing space like the Pep'e-Fareri building in suburban areas like Hawthorne, saying those leases did little to enhance the downtowns of struggling small cities like New Rochelle and Yonkers. "There clearly seems to be a pattern formed," Mr. Tenore said. "When we look to revitalizing the downtown of our inner cities with office space, it's obvious that the Pep'e-Fareri building doesn't fit."
No other building has been as controversial as the Pep'e-Fareri building, which the county leased in 1991 from Mr. Fareri and his partners as a new home for offices and data-processing equipment. About 700 workers from the parks, health and general services departments have been moved there. Yet the data center floor remains vacant, and part of a second floor is vacant as well. Ms. Carsky, the Republican legislator representing parts of Greenburgh, Yonkers and Scarsdale, contends the county wasted $1 million last year alone on the vacant space.
When the lease was negotiated, a bipartisan coalition in the 17-member County Legislature questioned whether the move was necessary and suggested it was a bailout of a faltering office building owned by an influential landlord. But the legislators did not get to vote on the lease. Mr. Delaney structured the rental contract as a 5-year lease with three options to renew for a total of 15 additional years. The legislature has the right to to vote only on leases longer than five years.
The lease was approved by the three-member Board of Acquisitions and Contracts, on which Mr. O'Rourke controls two of the three votes.
Mr. Tenore, the legislature's chairman, Ms. Carsky and others accused Mr. Delaney of circumventing the legislature, saying he had effectively created a 20-year lease. The legislators then refused to approve bonds to refurbish the building, and so the computers remain in the aging county office building in White Plains. Thus, Mr. Delaney said, the Legislature is responsible for the building's vacancies.
Mr. Delaney argued the Pep'e-Fareri building was needed. It has the power capacity to support the county's computers, which now occasionally shut down or slow down, he said. And, he added, it is in the line of sight of the county's radio tower, allowing for microwave communications among the county's scattered computers rather than expensive telephone lines.
He acknowledged that he had tried to avoid a vote by the Legislature on the lease.
"Quite frankly, we were trying to get things done," he said. "We knew we needed 12 votes to pass the leases. Quite frankly, we weren't sure we would have it."
"They put us between a rock and a hard place," he added.
He also accused Mr. Tenore of profiting from the opposition to leasing the building. Mr. Tenore, he said, pressured the county to move employees in the county's environmental facilities department to Mr. Tenore's home turf, New Rochelle, rather than to Hawthorne. Indeed, he said, the New Rochelle building chosen was one whose sale was brokered by a real estate agency for which Mr. Tenore is an agent.
Mr. Tenore said the sale had been made years before the county considered leasing space in the building and that no brokerage fee had been paid.
"He's a wheeler-dealer, who would do good for a private company," Mr. Tenore said of Mr. Delaney. "Some of his actions are not appropriate to government. "
Mr. Delaney says that in his tenure as head of general services the county has developed a new system of electronic purchasing that saves more than $200,000 a year and has bought new equipment that has saved $1.4 million in maintenance costs. He says he has cut the county's automobile fleet for commissioners and other top employees from 176 to 93 and has shopped around for a far cheaper long-distance telephone company.
Mr. Delaney, a broad-shouldered, 6-foot-3 figure with a goatee, is known for shrewd political instincts that were honed as the son of the longtime county sheriff. He was born in the Bronx and spent his teen-age years in Westchester, where his father, Thomas J. Delaney, was first Mount Vernon's police commissioner and then, from 1973 to 1983, the county's elected sheriff. Mr. Delaney worked in his father's campaigns.
He attended Iona College, where he obtained a degree in finance, and later invested in three Baskin-Robbins franchises. He got his start in Westchester County government as an economic development specialist. In 1988, Mr. O'Rourke recruited him to run the County Center. The next year, Mr. O'Rourke asked him to run his re-election campaign and, with his profits from the ice cream franchises, he decided to invest in real estate.
That year, Mr. Delaney and a group of partners paid $1 million to buy 47 vacant acres in Peekskill that once belonged to an Episcopal girl's school. Mr. Pataki, who ran a Peekskill law firm at the time and was that city's former mayor, brokered the deal, receiving the bulk of a $40,000 fee. Mr. Delaney says it was also Mr. Pataki who persuaded him to move to Peekskill and buy a new town house condominium there.
The two have known each other since the mid-1980's. In early December, after attending the tree-lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center together, they ate dinner nearby at the DeGrezia Restaurant and Mr. Pataki offered him the job as state commissioner.
Mr. Delaney believes his numerous business ventures have prepared him for his new job.
"When you own four or five different businesses, you learn how to manage something, how to get a bottom-line deal," he said. "You learn how to negotiate, how to deal with people. You get a sixth sense for doing this."

HEADLINE: Texas Senator Gets Nod in Louisiana Republican Straw Poll

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Jan. 7

 BODY:
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas overwhelmingly won a Presidential popularity poll today among Louisiana Republicans that may be more a testament to his letter-writing abilities than a reflection of his prospects for the White House in 1996.
Mr. Gramm received 902 votes to 150 for his nearest rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator. None of the others had more than 100 votes. 
 In the larger political scheme, the extremely early Presidential preferences of Republicans in Louisiana -- a state long been dominated by Democratic politics -- is virtually meaningless. More than anything else, it was a way for the state party to attract national attention and raise money at a state convention that would otherwise go unnoticed.
Still, these straw polls have become a rite of passage and can give a candidate aura of momentum. So this, the first of about a half-dozen such events in coming months, set off early jockeying among Republican contenders, most of whom are preparing their official announcements or are in the final throes of deciding whether to run.
One who unquestionably took today's contest seriously was Mr. Gramm, who was so determined to win the support of delegates at the Louisiana Republican Party convention here, in his home region, that he inundated the 1,700 delegates with as many as a half-dozen cards and letters and phone calls from his supporters.
He also prevailed on state party officials to schedule him as the keynote speaker immediately before the voting began and persuaded them to let Senator John McCain of Arizona give a speech that included a plug for the Texas Senator.
Though Jim Norris, a banker from Monroe, backed Mr. Gramm today, he rolled his eyes at the notion of the poll and said he might well vote for someone else in the primary here more than a year from now.
"It's like figuring out who I'm going to vote for in 2040," he said. "It has nothing to do with anything."
John Zmirak, a business writer and a delegate, also expressed mock disbelief at his fellow Republicans for staging the poll. "Come on," he said. "Louisiana Republicans? To use this as the compass to point the country? It's a media gimmick."
Mr. Gramm saw more at stake here than that. "Am I starting to measure the drapes at the White House?" he asked after the votes were tallied. No, but he added, "There's one thing that can't be disputed. We won the first battle in this long war."
Knowing that Mr. Gramm had the edge, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, another Presidential hopeful, made a point of saying that he was not even trying to compete.
Mr. Alexander, who came in third, with 58 votes, flew to Baton Rouge to speak at a state party dinner on Friday night but did not stay to woo supporters today. "In that contest, I'm not competing," he said of the straw poll. "I have other things to do."
Even so, Mr. Alexander did not want to lose too badly. So he, too, sent a letter out to delegates, though not on Mr. Gramm's grand scale.
Mr. Buchanan was also there and began attacking the Republican field with the same brand of sharp-tongued comments that bruised President George Bush during the 1992 primaries.
Making it plain that he sees himself as the most qualified prospective candidate, Mr. Buchanan said of Mr. Gramm: "I was going to summits with Richard Nixon when some of those guys were still teaching economics at Texas A&M." Mr. Buchanan said he was far from deciding about running, but his supporters were passing out freshly minted "Buchanan '96" buttons.
Some better known contenders, most notably Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate majority leader, sat out the event, although at least one Dole operative was spotted making the rounds here. The Senator drew 28 votes.
Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary, and Alan Keyes, a former State Department official, each drew 36 votes. Former Vice President Dan Quayle received 17 votes, and six others in the contest drew fewer than 10 each.
This convention attracted Republicans of all stripes, including David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klansman who won national attention for his unsuccessful bids for statewide office. Mr. Duke was milling about at a reception for Mr. Buchanan.
"I'm going to vote for him," Mr. Duke said. "He's the most conservative of the lot."

HEADLINE: A.& S. Layoffs Prompt Worry in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
One by one, the great Brooklyn institutions seem to evaporate -- the Dodgers, the breweries, Lundy's Restaurant -- but many said the latest loss seemed particularly cruel.
A.& S., the department store chain, will no longer be based in Brooklyn, although it will keep its flagship store there, the chain's new owners said on Friday. Neighboring businesses in downtown Brooklyn said they would be hurt by the loss of 900 jobs, most of them white collar. 
 Shoppers in the A.& S. store in the chain's headquarters building on Fulton Street worried a favorite haunt would somehow change. Other Brooklyn A.& S. employees fretted that they would be next.
"A lot of people are upset, very upset," said Louis Robles, a security officer, who says he began worrying about the store's future when it skipped putting up a Christmas tree and hiring a Santa Claus this Christmas season.
Others say it is inconceivable that the owner of the chain, Federated Department Stores Inc., would close a store often called one of A.& S.'s biggest sellers.
On Friday, Federated announced that it was laying off 650 employees in the executive offices of A.& S. Those laid off, who range from advertising executives to secretaries, are housed in the same downtown Brooklyn building as the company's flagship department store.
Another 250 employees will be transferred to Macy's corporate offices at Herald Square in Manhattan. Federated, which is based in Cincinnati and has owned A.& S. since the 1930's, acquired R.H. Macy & Company last month, rescuing it from bankruptcy.
The move on Friday was not a surprise, but had been mentioned in bankruptcy papers filed in conjunction with Federated's acquisition. "Short-term cutbacks are a necessary part of facilitating a successful merger," said Hal Kahn, chairman of Macy's East, the division that oversees A.& S.
An immediate impact will be on local businesses whose customers include the departing employees. Though many had not heard the news until told by a reporter, employees of record stores, electronic outlets and drug stores all expected their businesses to suffer. Restaurant owners and managers seemed to feel particularly vulnerable.
"This makes it a more difficult business environment," said Peter Aschkenasy, owner of the landmark Gage & Tollner restaurant. He said four of his tables were regularly filled at lunchtime with A.& S. executives, from lawyers to fashion buyers. "I have the sense that Brooklyn didn't work hard enough to keep it."
At the Express Stop, a fast-food restaurant next to A.& S., the owner, Jimmy Salis, said: "This is bad news. Business will come down."
And two and half blocks away at 320 Atlantic Avenue, Lucille Gutierrez, the manager of Antic Restaurant, said she expected lunch crowds to dry up at the eatery, which specializes in lower-priced California and Mediterranean cuisine.
"We get the whole advertising department and a lot of buyers," she said. "These people come to our restaurant four days a week."
An A.& S. store supervisor who asked not to be identified characterized the store -- which moved to its current location in 1883, the year the Brooklyn Bridge opened -- as the economic engine driving the Fulton Mall and neighboring areas.
"This is the money store," he said. "If this thing closes down, everything closes. Forget the mall, forget the little stores, forget Brooklyn."
He also heatedly claimed to resent the possibility of the store's name being changed to Macy's, which has been the subject of much speculation in local newspapers.
"It's not right," he said. "Macy's went broke. A.& S. wasn't broke."
At the store yesterday, customers expressed their devotion. "It's the largest store we have left in Brooklyn -- all the rest are little boutiques," said a teacher who lives in the Flatlands section who would not give his full name. He listed the department stores he has seen close on Fulton Street: May's, Nam's, Korvette's, Martin's.
"I love A.& S.," said Sarah Famiglietta, who said she had come once a week all her life, except for the several years her family lived in Massachusetts. Then, she would make special trips to the Brooklyn A.& S.
"I'd feel terrible if A.& S. were gone," she said, carrying a bag with pajamas for her pregnant daughter to take to the hospital. "I couldn't shop in any other store."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
73 Mr. Smiths, of the G.O.P., Go to Washington

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The seven House Republicans chosen by their party to summarize the accomplishments of the opening week of the 104th Congress for the press on Friday had a grand combined total of about 14 days in office. They had succeeded lawmakers with a combined total of 110 years in office. Some reporters had to struggle for the freshmen's names, and the freshmen themselves seemed a little unsure about news conference protocol.
But they had their message down, and they had their huge blowup of the "Contract With America," the Republican campaign manifesto. And they were able to check off some items, changes in House rules accomplished and delivered "on behalf of average people," in the words of Representative Gil Gutknecht, a freshman from Minnesota. They were, in short, on their way to "a new day in American politics," as Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina declared. 
 And then they bustled off to their committee meetings, to change America some more.
There were many moments like that one this week, as the outsiders came inside: the large, feisty Republican freshman class of 1994, sworn into an institution they had campaigned so hard against -- and enjoying it, just a little, albeit cautiously, like a teetotaler at a wine tasting.
"Our class is here to ask why," said Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a former professional football player, one of many Republican freshmen with unconventional backgrounds. "Why do we have to do that? Why do we have to pay that much? Why can't we cut that, why can't we reduce that?"
Virtually every new member comes to the House of Representatives vowing to change things and make a difference; in this, the class of 73 Republican freshmen is not unusual. But freshmen usually run up against the muffling power of seniority, 435 competing agendas and the gradual assimilation of a seductive institution.
This class, however, has the potential to leave its mark on the House and the Government at large as few other classes have, in the view of many analysts, who compare it to the big post-Watergate class of Democrats that shook up Congress in the 1970's.
It is not simply the presence of giant-killers like Representative George Nethercutt, who toppled Speaker Thomas S. Foley on Election Day, and the absence of the giants they disposed of. It is a combination of their youth, their conservatism, their zeal to restructure a Congress that so many ran against as fat, flawed and out of touch.
Representative Dick Chrysler, freshman Republican from Michigan, entered the House chamber this week alongside Representative Zach Wamp, freshman Republican from Tennessee. Mr. Wamp's campaign slogan had been "Wamp Congress," and Mr. Chrysler told him as they entered the House on that historic day, "You're absolutely the appropriate guy to walk into Congress with."
Most significant of all, these freshmen have been given extraordinary power and visibility by the Republican leadership, which clearly sees them as a new and appealing face for the party. The House Rules Committee has its first Republican freshman since 1915, the Ways and Means Committee its first Republican newcomers since George Bush in 1967.
"We view them not as an obstacle, as freshmen are sometimes viewed, but as resources," said Representative Bill Paxon of New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. "They are the face of the Congress we want the people to see: fresh, energetic, diverse."
They are different. Half of them have never held elective office before, in striking contrast to the House as a whole, two-thirds of whose members held elective office before coming to Congress. Many of them are proudly un-political, which suits party strategists just fine in an era when "career politician" is an epithet.
"They don't look like politicians, and they don't sound like politicians," said Frank Luntz, a pollster and adviser to the House Republican leadership, who argues that these freshmen can be a particularly powerful link to independent-minded Perot voters. "Every day I get on my knees and thank God they were not traditional politicians."
Even many of those with past political careers, like Representative Linda Smith, a former State Senator from Washington, rode the wave of grass-roots politics; she won her primary on a write-in.
Not surprisingly, these freshmen seemed achingly sensitive to the dangers of "going Washington" even as they wandered somewhat dazzled through the halls of the Capitol this week. They say they are just passing through on the people's business, or, as Representative J. D. Hayworth, a former sportscaster from Arizona, put it, "I don't want to make the House a home." Representative Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who holds the seat held for 53 years by Jamie L. Whitten, said he hoped to be "somewhere" in 53 years, but not in Congress.
Many of them make a point of keeping their families (i.e., spiritual roots) back in the district. "I want to be in Kansas as much as possible so I can be more like that environment than this," said Representative Sam Brownback, a freshman from Topeka.
These freshmen stand out in another way: They have a clear policy agenda in the "Contract With America," a platform on issues from tax cuts to welfare restructuring to a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget. Many Democrats see the contract as nothing more than a poll-driven campaign tool, but to many of the Republican freshmen it is a political bible. Representative Jon Christensen, a 31-year-old insurance agent from Omaha, whipped a laminated copy of it from his suit jacket as he talked about his mission here in Congress.
"I'm a conservative's conservative," Mr. Christensen said. "I don't believe government has the answer to people's problems. I believe government has gotten too big, too expensive, and we need to cut it down."
Their mistrust of government is fundamental and, in many ways, their animating force. Some analysts see them as Reagan's children, noting that a big chunk of them came of age during the glory years of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. Kate O'Beirne, vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, "There are far more Reagan Republicans in Washington now than there were during the Reagan years."
Mrs. O'Beirne, whose organization helped conduct an orientation for the Republican freshmen, added: "They question all of Washington's assumptions. We had a briefing on reform of the Congressional pension system, and the first question was, 'Why are there Congressional pensions?' "
In fact, some analysts think that there will be times when the Republican freshmen are out in front of their Republican colleagues, that their ideological fervor will make them more eager to cut, more intent on curbing Congressional perquisites and more adamant about term limits. "When and if the leadership blinks," Mrs. O'Beirne said, "whether it's on cutting personal staff or potentially on term limits, the freshman class will go on point."
So far the leadership -- notably Speaker Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, the majority leader -- have taken pains to cultivate the freshmen, aides say. "There's a strong synthesis between the freshmen and the sophomores and the House Republican leadership," said Ed Gillespie, spokesman for Mr. Armey. "Newt and Armey have very strong ties to the freshmen. They campaigned in more than 100 districts."
For now, all is undiluted promise for the class of '94, so undiluted, in fact, that some of their seniors worry a little. "The only concern I have is I think they're so euphoric about the opportunity to make the changes Republicans have always wanted to make that they haven't quite realized, or maybe don't quite believe, that there's going to be a reaction in the country," said former Representative Vin Weber, now a co-director of the conservative group Empower America.
Mr. Weber came to Congress with the Reagan Republican class of 1980. He recalls the post-budget-cut, mid-recession elections of 1982, when the party lost 26 seats.
This freshman class may change in other ways. The House from the inside can look very different from the abstract institution viewed from the campaign trail. Mr. Hayworth, for example, said he was struck by the intimacy of the place. "The cameras don't do it justice," the Arizona freshman said, "in letting people know how intimate a chamber it is. And in spite of the columnists' comments about the lack of comity and civility, I have found the opposite to be true."
Mr. Nethercutt, the victor over Speaker Foley at the polls, had lunch with him not long ago in a gracious coda to the signature campaign of an anti-Congress year. Mr. Foley told the freshman Republican that he envied him his first term in Congress, when simply walking onto the floor would be a thrill.
Mr. Nethercutt said he remembered that conversation when he entered the House this week. He looked up at his wife and daughter in the gallery, tried to absorb a scene that seemed so improbable just six months ago and decided that Mr. Foley had been right.
The class of '94, in other words, might even learn to love Congress a little.

Like many other Republican freshmen, Mr. Hayworth has no intention of making his stay in Washington anything more than temporary. "I don't want to make the House a home," he said.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
John Ward's response to "A Fond Farewell to Big Government" (Letters, Dec. 11; At Work, Nov. 13) is beyond even the incredible standards of the ridiculous established by economists and M.B.A.'s. Now that protectionism is associated with unions' trying to save jobs, history is revised to blame -- of all things -- the Smoot Hawley Tariff for the Great Depression! Greed, speculation on margin and general stupidity apparently had nothing to do with it. 
 Mr. Ward goes on about how growth since the Depression was made possible by "wealth creators" whose efforts the Government redistributed. Anyone can create goods and services. What is difficult is creating customers to make those "wealth creators" rich. This was done via programs defined as National Defense.
The big benefit of most military spending is the creation of purchasing power without creating anything to compete for customers. With the passing of the "Evil Empire," we are experiencing readjustments.
The ignorance and arrogance that turns people off is not that of government but of businesses that take customers for granted until the Japanese show them how badly they are being ripped off. The only thing those who voted for Rush Limbaugh proved is that they don't understand the parable of Lucy and the Football.

HEADLINE: The World According to Channel One

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER 

 BODY:
It is the highest-profile -- one might even say most glamorous -- controversy in American education. For the past five years, teachers, business executives, politicians and editorial writers have been fiercely debating the merits of Channel One, the commercial-studded classroom news show founded by entrepreneur Christopher Whittle.
Is it immoral to beam advertising to captive middle-school and high-school students? Or are two minutes of television ads a small price to pay for 10 minutes of news and public affairs programming? Is Channel One's format -- its MTV-esque graphics and fast pace -- anti-teacher, anti-literacy and ultimately anti-education? Or is it the best way to capture the attention of media-saturated teenagers? 
 And what about Mr. Whittle, who was recently forced to sell most of his communications empire, including Channel One, for a fire-sale price? Can we entrust even part of our kids' education to a man who has apparently frittered away most of his working capital on private jets, white-elephant office buildings and custom-built sock drawers lined with hand-tooled leather?
These are fine questions with which to engage adult minds. The view from educational Ground Zero, however, is quite a bit different.
Or so it seems after a week spent watching Channel One inside a "typical" classroom. Pliny Haskell Junior High, in the blue-collar Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos, Calif., is home to more than 600 seventh and eighth graders and two dozen teachers.
At Haskell -- a collection of one-story structures clustered near a freeway, in a neighborhood of strip malls and aged stucco-and-wood houses -- anything seen even vaguely as a resource is automatically thrown into the endless task of stimulating classroom discussion. And that includes Channel One.
The deal offered to Haskell is the standard one: In exchange for incorporating Channel One into its curriculum, the school received a satellite dish, a videocassette recorder and a closed-circuit television system featuring 19-in. Magnavox sets in each classroom.
The school has been hooked up to Channel One since tk, tk. Below, a week on the receiving end of this controversial connection.
 
Monday, Nov. 14
Let Your Smile Be Your Umbrella, reads the message of the day on the school signpost, as, shortly after 7:00 A. M., a line of mostly older-model cars begins dropping off students near the front gate.
Fifteen minutes later, Paulette Fuller, Haskell's principal, is in her small office, discussing her school and her students.
"A lot of the problems of society find their way here," says Ms. Fuller, who has worked in the school district for 26 years. "Gangs, drugs in the kids' homes. Physical and emotional abuse. Parents working two or three jobs."
The ethnic makeup of Haskell is roughly 35 percent white, 27 percent Hispanic, 25 percent Asian and 13 percent black. Many of the students are first-generation Americans. Recent budget cuts have meant an end to sports teams and all other afterschool programs. Parents are now being asked to purchase paper and other supplies.
Ms. Fuller says few of her students read a daily newspaper or watch nontabloid news shows on TV. "We like Channel One," she says, firmly. "The benefits greatly outweigh the disadvantages."
"Get the lights, somebody," says John Viculin to his eighth-grade English class. It is 7:45 A. M., the start of the first period of the school day. The task for the week is to have students analyze a short story for plot, theme and point of view. But like most of the other first-period teachers at Haskell, Mr. Viculin -- who has been teaching since 1966 -- must first facilitate the daily Channel One session.
His 23 students burrow into their sweatshirts and parkas in the still-chilly classroom.
The TV set is mounted atop the front chalkboard. Seated at desks facing the center of the classroom, most of the eighth graders peer sideways and upwards in the semi-darkness. Several lay their heads down and nap; a few doodle or finish their homework. (At Haskell, watching Channel One is optional. Students are not tested on it. And two minutes, the amount of commercial time in each program, has been added to the school day.)
Tape-delayed from its overnight satellite transmission, Channel One is broadcast schoolwide at the same time each day. It begins today, as it does every day, with a hand-drawn Channel One logo chosen from student submissions. Next, a few moments of rock music and music video-style graphics. Then a quotation flashes on the screen.
" 'Very big, China' -- Noel Coward," hangs above our heads momentarily.
Dissolve to Lisa Ling and Rawley Valverde, two casually dressed Twentyish anchors, in the game room-like Channel One news set.
Mr. Valverde, talking forcefully and seriously -- the Channel One anchor style -- reports briefly on President Clinton's trip to an Asian Pacific economic summit in Manila. Cut to: commercials for M&M candies and Nintendo video games. A few snickers from the classroom -- both commercials' a-bit-too-slick hipness is obvious. Then back to Ms. Ling, who introduces a mini-documentary she produced and taped in China last summer.
The report explains how the Chinese government tries to control the flow of information about its country and the real state of its economy. And Ms. Ling describes how her government escort steers her into filming only at tourist sites and atypical "typical" homes and factories. Excitedly, she holds up the small video camera she used as she escaped from scrutiny and interviewed "real" Chinese citizens.
There follow a few hesitant criticisms of government repression by unmonitored Chinese citizens, then some furtive shots of primitive-looking housing areas, farms and factories. The China report is to continue throughout the week.
"Okay!" says the grayhaired, energetic John Viculin, springing out of his seat as the picture fades and the lights go up. He pulls down a roll-up map of the world.
"Where did Channel One take us today?" he asks.
While his classmates stretch and rub their eyes, a volunteer, Billy, walks to the front and points successfully to China.
"Right! Thank you! Now, why should all of us here in California care about what goes on in China?"
"Because they can blow us up with nuclear weapons?" says Ben, from his seat near the exit.
"Trade?" arises weakly from a confused babble at the other side of the classroom.
" 'Cause they don't have the rights we do?" offers one of the girls, Gaby. "Because they can't say nothing bad about the government?"
"Yes, but why should we care?" counters their teacher.
A lively but somewhat scattered discussion ensues, touching on repression in Haiti, the virtue of obeying questionable government regulations and the true national origin of Toyotas.
After a few more minutes, Mr. Viculin glances at the clock and takes a valiant stab at wrapping things up.
"All right. Let's think about one of the reasons people traveled across the Atlantic to start this country."
Silence.
"Why do we study history?"
Nothing.
"If people are afraid to speak out, what will eventually happen?"
One of the girls sitting near the front, Carolina, cocks an eyebrow skeptically. "Like, is there a specific answer to that question?" she says.
 
Tuesday, Nov. 15
The classroom is cold again; the whispered conversations as the lights go down are in both English and Spanish.
The quote of the day is drawn from Will and Ariel Durant: "Only a fool would try to compress a hundred centuries in a hundred pages of hazardous conclusions. We proceed."
"Huh?" says a voice in the darkness, answered by giggles.
The commercials: pitches for Pepsi and pimple cream. Rawley Valverde is gone, replaced by an equally earnest young anchorman, Kris Osborne.
The main feature of today's broadcast is another installment of Lisa Ling's China project. Wearing a Mao jacket and cap, Ms. Ling scrolls briskly through the modern history of China -- emphasizing its heritage of political repression, the legacy of the 1989 Tianamen Square rebellion, the absence of many of the freedoms Americans enjoy. Many of the points she makes echo the previous day's; a few more heads than before droop to the desktops.
Mr. Viculin, who has been taking notes, kickstarts the discussion.
"What would you say is Lisa's view of China?"
"Negative," says Ben.
"Why?"
"Because they've got nuclear weapons, and they can blow us up."
After the shouts and laughter die down, Mr. Viculin proposes that perhaps, just perhaps, in the point--of-view department, Lisa Ling's Chinese-American heritage makes her extra-sensitive to the differences between her own country and her ancestral one. It is a provocative concept, and for a few seconds the silence crackles.
 
Wednesday, Nov. 16
The quote is from Thomas Jefferson, the commercials for chewing gum, AT&T and a Space Invaders video game. The program includes segments on political repression in Indonesia, the progress of Hurricane Gordon, and the conservative push to legalize school prayer.
Is it the observer's imagination, or are the students falling into a cathode-ray trance state more quickly as the week goes on? Today, there is no change of expression when the program shifts from news to commercials and back again.
"Okay. Form groups of three and brainstorm," says Mr. Viculin. "List the three stories on today's program and put a star next to the one you think is most important."
After huddled discussions and some quickly-suppressed cross-classroom name-calling, the teams report in, voting almost unanimously for Gordon.
Mr. Viculin smiles. "Well, I had the hurricane last, with school prayer first," he muses. "Maybe I was up in the clouds."
 
Thursday, Nov. 17
Even though John Viculin spreads his attentions equally, it's obvious that some of his students are less attuned to his efforts than others. Throughout the week, heads hit the desk even when the lights are up. Given on-the-spot writing assignments, some of his students in first period screw up their faces scornfully and produce barely a line, while their classmates scribble eagerly. During lulls, snatches of gang slang and attitude float by.
"Schoolboy," mutters a girl, with chilling disdain, when one of her male counterparts volunteers to answer a question.
The TV quote today is by Pearl S. Buck: "Nothing and no one can destroy the Chinese people. They are relentless survivors. They are the oldest civilized people on earth." Magnavox: "We make technology people want."
On her segment this morning, Lisa Ling prompts a laugh from the class by showing the patrons of a new Chinese disco dancing to fossilized rock music. Later. she smuggles a fellow exchange student into her Beijing hotel room for an unmonitored interview. As they start taping, the phone rings: It is Mr Young, her government minder, asking if he can come up for a visit her.
Could her hotel room be bugged, she wonders? Hooked on drama, for just a second, we wonder also.
 
Friday, Nov. 18
After a quote that flies by too fast and a brief report on the school prayer controversy, Lisa Ling wraps things up with a skeptical visit to a suspiciously prosperous Chinese farm. Then, a stealthy meeting with some construction workers so poor that they have to sleep at the job site.
The picture fades.
'I'm going to try something,' says Mr. Viculin. "Put your heads down on the table. Close your eyes. Think about a blessing you can count on. Something in your life you value. Okay, head up. What did you think about?"
"This is about the prayer thing, right?" says Ben.
'Hey! You can't say prayers in school!" says Carolina.
"It's okay if they don't announce it over the loudspeakers," says Ben, drawing his own legal conclusions.
A lively discussion breaks out. Mr. Viculin beams.
"How do we know what's right or wrong?' says a boy, Jason, as both sides weigh in. "That's why people go to court."
Carving out a few minutes of class time, Mr. Viculin turns the class over to the visiting reporter for his questions.
What do the kids think of Channel One?
"It's great."
"It's b-o-o-o-oring."
(Simultaneous shout): "The best time to do homework!"
Do the commercials get you to want things you wouldn't otherwise?
"Yes!"
"No!"
"Maybe!"
How many think that Haskell Junior High should keep using Channel One?
The great majority thrust their hands upward. Only two students vote no. A few kids glance around at their classmates, surprised at the near unanimity, and giggle nervously. Their teacher calls for attention, and the class moves on.

HEADLINE: Anybody Home?

 BODY:
The Democrats are in the throes of an advice crisis. For once, there is a shortage of people eager to tell the President exactly what he needs to do. Meanwhile, the dangerous White House public-relations team continues to display its gift for feckless hairsplitting (the Hilton Head flyover) and humiliating imagery (the President posing with two terminally lame ducks).
Well, things do look bad for the Razorback Renaissance. Pretty soon, a bulb will have to blink on over Bill Clinton's head or they can turn the lights out at the re-elect office. But with time and discipline, Mr. Clinton could again become a factor in shaping the national policy agenda that was his alone to write only two years ago. 
 He has a couple of things working for him. One, the old Democratic crustaceans are gone. Better a Dick Gephardt trying to bushwhack you than a Tom Foley saying "Don't worry, Boss." Second, House Speaker Newt Gingrich remains slightly out of control. His tarmac sermonette on the need for journalistic cheerleading is only the latest example of a Gantryesque conviction that he has been sworn in as maximum-leader-in-charge-of-all-known-thought. The betting here is still that the voluble Georgian will not self-destruct, but he is creating an opening for Mr. Clinton to look large, calm and -- yes, say it out loud all you senior White House aides -- even Presidential.
Presidents, of course, have programs, convictions and an overarching vision. Any Clinton comeback must start with a strategy for confronting this President's unique double-barreled credibility problem. The American people do not believe what Mr. Clinton says. In addition, they do not believe he knows what he believes. Homely vows about fighting until the last dog, or duck, dies will not fix this malady. What is needed is an attainable set of proposals, quickly embodied in streamlined legislation, that flow from the values upon which Mr. Clinton campaigned. Here's a starter kit:
1. Propose simplified health-care reform that sets universal coverage as a national goal, ends cherry-picking by insurers but -- bowing to political realities -- immediately subsidizes coverage only for low-income children and pregnant women.
2. Offer tough, but humane, welfare reform that recognizes the fact that a majority of Americans oppose Mr. Gingrich's punitive two-years-andout rule.
3. Really push, this time, for a campaign reform bill that curbs PAC's and outlaws the lobbyist gifts that have just been endorsed by the new Republican majority.
4. Outsmart the Republicans on the politics of a bad idea by sticking to plans to target tax cuts on families making less than $75,000 a year. That rewards the workers who elected Mr. Clinton, rather than the affluent beneficiaries of the Gingrich plan.
5. Oppose the balanced-budget amendment as a sham and, as an alternative, support abolition of the industrial and agricultural subsidies now costing taxpayers $225 billion to $250 billion a year. The Democratic Leadership Council believes that Mr. Clinton should challenge the Republicans to whack these subsidies by $50 billion in the new budget.
Such steps would enable Mr. Clinton to make the embracing speeches he now lacks the political authority to deliver. He is, after all, still a better orator than Newt Gingrich, and once, not long ago, he had a better message. But right now the public sees the Democrats as a husk, a party ready for a long redefinitional agony like the one that consumed the British Labor Party for over a decade.
The Bill Clinton of 1992 could explain why America needs a Democratic Party. He described it as a party that invests in people, not corporations. He described a modernized party that responds to economic change by re-educating workers and battling special interests instead of warring on the poor.
In 1995, a weaker Bill Clinton faces a harder task. He must define a valid role for government to a people angry at government and tired of him. In other words, he is up against what George Bush inelegantly called the vision thing. Lack of a cohesive vision defeated Mr. Bush in 1992, and it can do the same for Mr. Clinton in 1996 unless he gets moving. An opportunity to do so still exists, but the moment is fleeting.

HEADLINE: We Still Need C.I.A., but It Needs to Change;
Some Kind of Analysis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 29 front-page news analysis on the Central Intelligence Agency's failings omits one that had tremendous repercussions on the United States and on the world. 
 You state that "throughout the cold war, the mission of the C.I.A. was clear," adding, "the Soviet Union was the 'target.' " You describe a concentrated effort to measure the Soviet military buildup. We have since learned that the size of this so-called buildup was grossly overestimated by the agency, resulting in an ever-escalating arms race, especially in nuclear weapons, at a cost of billions of dollars.
As has since been disclosed, it was the United States that led the development of newer and deadlier nuclear weapons, forcing the Soviet Union to respond to these threats from without and leading to proliferation in many other countries.
The result is still being felt in countless ways.
We have yet to come up with any practical means of disposing of dangerous nuclear wastes. Storage is deteriorating, adding to the danger.
There is great danger of nuclear materials that remain in the former Soviet Union will get into the hands of renegade countries or terrorists.
The economic cost has been felt in the tremendous national debt that has had a profound effect on our economy and quality of life. To deal with the budget deficit, programs to help the unemployed, rescue the homeless, improve the cities, provide a decent transportation system, clean up our environment and keep it clean are being slashed from inadequate financing.
With the C.I.A.'s kind of analysis, it makes one wonder why we need that agency at all. We taxpayers deserve better.

HEADLINE: A Small Start At Beachfront On Rockaway

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Ever since Mayor John V. Lindsay's urban-renewal bulldozers pushed over its crumbling summer cottages in the late 1960's, a vast tract of land in the Arverne section of the Rockaway peninsula has remained desolate, its weeds blowing in the ocean breeze along two miles of some of the best urban beachfront on the East Coast.
For a quarter century, every mayor since Mr. Lindsay has tried to redevelop Arverne, the largest tract of city-owned vacant land in New York. But none has been able to overcome a combination of economic and social problems that have made the 307 acres of Arverne in Queens one of the greatest planning and development challenges in New York City. 
 Now the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is taking its turn at returning the area to life, and typically, its approach is very different from the broad plans of its predecessors.
Rather than prepare a detailed master plan for each of the tract's more than 75 square blocks, the administration wants to start small, proposing 180 two-family town houses on three blocks at the western edge of the tract in the hope of spurring development on the rest. The city would pay for about $ 9 million in street and sewer costs, while private developers would build the market-rate houses with their own financing, possibly beginning next year. The project's modest scale, along with its reliance on private developers for the unsubsidized housing, is an indication of how the administration will try to manage the expensive task of redevelopment at a time when both budgets and political philosophy mandate a sharp decrease in the role of government. While Deborah C. Wright, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, says it is not necessarily typical of all of her department's plans, she said Arverne demonstrated how her agency was evolving into a "catalyst" to bring the private sector in contact with public opportunities.
"We're under a lot of pressure here at the city to try to help the private sector create the units, as opposed to us being the engine driving development in the city," said Ms. Wright, who was a member of the New York City Housing Authority in David N. Dinkins's administration. "Every area of operation is shifting to less government in the sense that private actors out there are perfectly capable of doing a lot of what we have historically viewed as our role."
But relying on private developers means that there has to be a profit incentive and a market, and that has proven to be a huge obstacle, due to the size and nature of Arverne.
Over the years, a series of developers has jousted with the tract and walked away in defeat, unable to overcome the city's declining economy and the surrounding neighborhood's blighted reputation. In addition, because the area was formerly dotted with ramshackle bungalows, there are few usable water or sewer mains, adding to a developer's costs.
There have been plans to build casinos, hotels, theme parks and stacks of high-rise public housing on the site. Most recently, in 1991, Oceanview Associates of Manhattan, a partnership led by Forest City Ratner Companies, gave up on a plan to develop all 307 acres with a $ 1.5 billion project of 7,500 apartments, as well as shopping malls, recreation centers and parks. The company said the downturn in the city's real estate market damaged the prospects for the project.
As a result, the city has decided to make just a few blocks available for developers, hoping that the reduced risk will make it easier to entice builders and lenders. The blocks are near the intersection of Beach 74th Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard. The request for bids is to be made in the spring.
"The strategy is not to just say, sorry, the market is not there for the entire project and not do anything," said Ms. Wright. "Instead, it's an approach of saying, let's get something started. In this portion, we can kick-start some progress."
One of the debates that long held up any progress on the development -- whether to include any subsidized units for low- or moderate-income residents -- has been settled. After residents and politicians said the peninsula already had more than its fair share of public housing units, the city agreed that only full-price housing would attract the kind of residents needed to improve the depressed economy of the Rockaways.
Each of the 180 town houses to be built would cost about $ 210,000, according to Vollmer Associates, the planning consultants hired by the city, and each would also contain a rental unit that would rent for about $ 750. Considering the income that the owner would get from the renter, each buyer would have to earn about $ 60,000 a year to afford a town house, the consultants said in a report given to the city a few weeks ago.
According to figures compiled by the city, there are about 4,000 units of public housing on the peninsula, which is about a quarter of the borough's public housing stock. There are also 6,000 beds in adult homes and nursing homes. Jonathan L. Gaska, district manager of Community Board 14, said the neighborhood convinced the city that was enough.
"We want to bring in working-class, middle-class people," Mr. Gaska said. "Right now, roughly 30 percent of the youth here are under the poverty level, and we want to skew that. Rockaway needs people who will add to the tax base and will spend dollars here."
But will middle-class buyers want to move to an area known for its high-rise public housing projects and vacant land, much of which is likely to remain vacant for some time after the first phase is completed? Some neighborhood residents, such as Lew Simon, are not convinced. Mr. Simon, who runs a local Democratic political club and is a lifelong resident, said the area was too depressed to attract buyers with money and suggested the city build a hotel or resort on the site instead.
The consultant's report, however, predicted that the houses would sell, and proponents of the plan agree, noting that the tract is between two desirable boundaries, the A subway line and the Atlantic Ocean beach, complete with a well-maintained boardwalk.
"That's the kind of housing that sells in this borough as soon as it's built," said Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President. "They will buy these houses. You have a resort area, an hour from Manhattan, where you don't have to take off early on Friday to get to your beach house. The water is a magnet to draw people there."
Peter Travis, a local developer who was formerly chief operating officer of Forest City Ratner, predicted a strong interest by developers in the project. The housing market is better than it was when Forest City dropped out, he said, and the smaller scale will allow a larger variety of developers to build.
"I think a lot of people in the city would like to live at the beach," said Mr. Travis, managing partner of Washington Square Partners, a firm he said might consider bidding on the project. "And it's a great beach. I've always thought it was one of the great secrets of New York City, that you could take the subway to a beach that's the equivalent of one of the great beaches of the world."

HEADLINE: A Textbook of Virtues

BYLINE: By STEPHEN BATES

 BODY:
Sitting in a circle on the floor, the first graders talked about courage. "It's being nice," a boy said. Jody Colby, the shoft-spoken teacher, reminded him that he had once endured being lost in Toys 'R Us. "That took courage," she said. He nodded eagerly.
 Sarah, a wide-eyed girl with her blond hair in a ponytail, said, "Courage is trying again." 
 "Suppose you fell off your bike," Ms. Colby said.
 "Like I did!" Sarah exclaimed.
 "Would that take courage to get back on?"
 The children chorused "yes."
 Ms. Colby read "Abiyoyo," Pete Seeger's retelling of a South Arican folk tale about outsmarting a monster. At the appropriate points, the children danced and sang while a girl missing a front tooth played the tambourine. Then the teacher asked the children if they had ever been scared of monsters.
 "When it's dark and stuff," Sarah said.
 "I thought there was a big monster," said Mike, "but it was just a doghouse."
 "This car," Kristi said, "it squeaked, and I thought it was a monster coming up the stairs."
 Ben told how he had once spotted a monster at the far end of his bed. He leaned down and seized it, only to discover that "it was my foot!" As he finished the story, he rolled on the floor with laughter.
 Straddling one of the child-sized chairs in the Foster Elementary School classroom, Henry Huffman smiled. Slender, bearded and courtly, he has been, as assistant superintendent of schools in Mount Lebanon, Pa., the moving force behind the district's efforts to teach children about courage and other moral values.
 Dr. Huffman, 50, began crusading for character education in the school system six years ago. There was no precipitating crisis - no drive-by shootings or heroin overdoses roiling this affluent Pittsburgh suburb. Character education was simply something that this former high school English teacher had come to consider important - indeed, inescapable.
 "You cannot avoid dealing with values," he said, just before a visit to Ms. Colby's class. "I can't teach 'Pride and Prejudice' without probing values. Teachers constantly have to deal with values - classroom expectations, school rules. So the question is not will we engage in character education, but how will we?"
 How indeed? School officials across the country are wrestling with this question. About one in five public school districts now offers formal programs in moral education, ranging from modest curriculum add-ons, like an occasional class in ethics, to blueprints for refurbishing the entire schoolhouse culture, like "just communities" in which students help make and enforce school rules. But teaching values begins with defining values, and in many districts, officials are wary. Issues affecting children provoke intense feelings, after all, as do questions of morality. By combining the two, values education - like the simmering struggles over school prayer - has the potential to spark an especially acrimonious and polarizing dispute.
 Here in Mt. Lebanon, the story is still unfolding. Advocates might call Mt. Lebanon's history a textbook example of how to undertake character education (literally: Dr. Huffman has written a book about it).
 But even in a placid, prosperous and fairly homogeneous suburb, a place that seems tailor-made for painless changes in curriculum, dissent and discord have flashed across the politicial landscape. Character education has attracted the attention of critics - experienced, persistent and potentially litigious ones. And it has raised profound questions: Is it the state's role to sculpt character? To teach children to be tolerant? (Tolerant of what, some parents demand to know.) And where are the boundaries of our moral consensus?
 On the bulletin board behind Dr. Huffman's desk is a quotation from Theodore Roosevelt: "To educate a person in mind and not in morals is to education a menace to society." Down the hall in the outer office hangs a cautionary counterpoint to this, and to Dr. Huffman's unswayable optimism: a print of Picasso's Don Quixote.
 To introduce character education to the Mount Lebanon schools, Dr. Huffman didn't closet himself with the works of Plato and Piaget, or plumb the depths of deontology and metaethics. Instead, he concentrated on pragmatic, often bureaucratic, matters. How, he wondered, can teachers, administrators and parents be induced to support a program that focuses on values?
 The answers he came up with - organization and motivation - underlie the how-to book that he wrote for school officials. Published last fall, "Developing a Character Education Program" reads more like a management textbook than an inquiry into morality. It is full of references to strategic planning teams, "transformational leadership" and "executive champion." It quotes not only Aristotle and Spinoza, but also "In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies."
 "One person can't just sit down and write a plan," said Ms. Colby, who served on two of the committees. "With this kind of thing, you have to build consensus the whole time you're doing it."
 In 1991, Dr. Huffman headed a 28-member committee that sought to produce a list of widely shared values - short enough for a student to memorize. The committee, of parents, high-school students, teachers and administrators, came up with more than 40 values, then pruned the list to six "core values," which the district adopted.
 "We believe," the statement says, "that the morally mature person habitually: respects human dignity, demonstrates active responsibility for the welfare for the welfare of others, integrates individual interests and social responsibilities, demonstrates integrity, applies moral principles when making choices and judgments, and seeks peaceful resolution of conflict."
 Committee members discarded several values with potential for controversy. "Respect for life" might have led to disputes over abortion and euthanasia, "and there was pretty quick agreement that we didn't need to head in that direction," Dr. Huffman recalled.
 "Respect for the environment" was dropped, too, because ecology activists and industrialists could disagree about its meaning. And "there was an understanding that we had to stay away from the 'R' word and things closely related to it," Dr. Huffman said, referring to religion.
 Next, they had to inject the values into the district's curriculum. For the elementary grades, Mount Lebanon chose a series of books produced by the Heartwood Institute in the nearby suburb of Wexfrord. Heartwood is a nonprofit organization founded by Eleanore Childs, a criminal defense attorney who felt that many fo her clients didn't seem to grasp basic moral concepts. Starting in 1987, Ms. Childs, who describes herself as "a remnant of the Sixties," worked with three longtime elementary educators to develop a curriculum that uses already published illustrated books, such as "Abiyoyo," as the bases for classroom discussions and activities. The books center around honesty and love. By featuring stories from different parts of the world, Heartwood's books also aim to promote multicultural understanding.
 An advantage of using the Heartwood books is that they do not demand any leap into the pedagogical unknown. "Teachers are comfortable with it because it's literature based," Dr. Huffman said. "Elementary teachers have been teaching reading for years." Heartwood's approach also reassured teachers who worried that character education would require them to talk about their own beliefs and experiences.
 Teachers have developed activities to accompany the books. Carol McCloskey had her Lincoln Elementary School fourth graders think about how they would experience loyalty through their five senses. One child wrote that loyalty "tastes like Fourth of July cupcakes." At Washington Elementary, Eileen Kennon's second-graders staged a play about their respect for a massive oak tree on the school grounds.
 Explicit classroom discussions and activities were just the beginning of school experience is also shaped by what scholars call the "hidden curriculum," the moral framework that encourages punctuality, respect for authority, politeness, obedience and other behaviors considered to be conducive to learning.
 "You can't just have a curriculum," Dr. Huffman said, "You've got to try to affect the entire ethos of a school" - by requiring community service for students or introducing an ethics code for employees and a sportsmanship code for coaches.
 When cafeteria workers complained about students' offhand gibes about school lunches, Dr. Huffman suggested a plan be developed for "talking with kids about empathy, sensitivity, respect - as it relates to the cafeteria workers who take pride in their work." He also suggested name tags for the food employees, so that students could address them properly.
 To sensitize nonteaching staff to the district's ethos, he thought of asking hypothetical quesions during job interviews. "We might ask, 'What happens if you come across a child crying in the hall?" he said. "Or, a child has been disciplined by the teacher and sent to the principal, and the principal's not there - you're the person receiving that child. How do you handle an irate parent?' Even if the answers are wrong, you're signaling through your questions that you have expectations."
 Mount Lebanon's program also aims to reach beyond the classroom. Teachers send home letters about each Heartwood unit, suggesting lines of discussion for parent and child. A fourth-grade letter on loyalty, for example, recommends that the parents "point out the ways that family members sacrifice for each other." the district has also arranged a series of lectures on childrearing.
 As a key administrator, Dr. Huffman tried to bolster the effort. He visited classrooms, taught Heartwood lessons, edited a staff newsletter about ways to promote the core values and otherwise tried to show that his office was committed to the enterprise. "Any innovation requires considerable nurturing," he said. "So many have been victimized by inadequate long-term support."
 Has all the effort produced results?
 "I can't honestly say there's been a big change," said Ms. McCloskey, of her fourth graders at Lincoln Elementary. "The kids were pretty good to start with."
 Other teachers detect subtle changes. Heartwood provides a vocabulary of virtues, in the view of Ms. Colby. "When someone's behavior comes into question, you can say 'Do you think you're showing respect?' You have a point of reference."
 "Evaluation of character education is tough," Dr. Huffman acknowledged. "You can give paper-and-pencil tests, but the kids are smart enough, and the values of the community strong enough, that they're going to work out the right answers."
Attitudes and behaviors - the main targets of character education - are much harder to gauge. "Character is what you do when nobody is looking," in Dr. Huffman's view. The effects of value education on children, he said, may only appear "down the road - after they leave us."
 Still, he finds some early indicators that he says are encouraging. Some parents have told him they try to reinforce the Heartwood concepts at home, including one parent who used the Heartwood teachings about respect to try to dissuade her son form bullying others.
 "Last year," Dr. Huffman said, "a child returned from an absence with a note saying she'd been sick on Friday. The mother came back with the child after lunch, holding the letter on honesty that the school had just sent home. She said to the teacher, 'I can't really expect you folks to nurture honesty if I'm modeling dishonesty at home. I need to set something straight in my child's presence, and that is that she wasn't sick on Friday' we took her out of school to take a three-day trip.' While it's not our intent to focus on parent behavior, it is a way to say to parents that all of us have a resopnsibility to model these core values."
 Not so long ago, character education was an integral part of the curriculum, indeed, a pervasive one. "Every facet of the schools included some kind of moral education," said B. Edward McClellan, a professor of education at Indiana University and the author of "Schools and the Shaping of Character," published in 1992.
 A didactic approach dominated the first half of the 20th century. The idea was that the teacher, who knew more than the students, imparted wisdom to them. "Moral instruction," a 1914 New York Times article said, describing the views of a contemporary educator "should be as systematic and as definite as a course in mathematics."
 Another method coexisted with the didactic approach - as a "critical counterpoint," Professor McClellan said. The so-called progressive approach, favored by John Dewey and others, involved students in the process of moral decision-making. "Learning 'always be honest' wasn't enough in a complicated world," said Professor McClellan.
 In the 1960's, character education began to wane. After the Supreme Court held that school prayer and devotional Bible reading violated the Constitution, many teachers wrongly believed that the Court had prohibited moral education, said Professor McClellan. Added to this, he said, was the "cultural relativism" that came to be popular in the 1960's.
 "Values clarification," the method introduced in the late 1960's, reflected that relativism. The handiwork of a Univesity of Massachusetts professor, Sidney Simon, and his colleagues, it established the teacher as moderator rather than moralizer. The teacher, explains a 1972 handbook wrotten by Dr. Simon, Leland W. Howe and Howard Kirschenbaum, was to be presented as just another "person with values (and often with values confusion) of his own."
 The approach was hugely popular. The handbook sold more than 600,000 copies. At a teachers' conference in the 1970's, more than 100 people crowded into the presentation on values clarification, Robert Hampel writes in "The Last Little Citadel," a history of American high schools. Down the hall, a session on how to teach "The Federalist Papers" attracted an audience of three.
 Not everyone embraced values clarification, though. The relativism troubled conservative Christian parents, among others. So did the questions recommended for classroom discussion. Some, it seemed to them, were stacked against religion. ("Does religion have some meaning in my life, or is it nothing more than a series of outmoded traditions and customs?") Others appeared politically biased. (One question asked students if they would rather join a consciousness-raising group, an environmental group or a food co-operative.)
 The protests against values clarification came mostly from the poltitical right. Some turned ugly. In 1977, the school board in Warsaw, Ind., voted to remove "Values Clarification" from all classrooms "with the understanding that the textbook . . . will be destroyed when legally permissible." A few months later, a group of townspeople torched a pile of the books.
 Perhaps more important, researchers discovered that values clarification wasn't having the intended effect. It wasn't making students more moral, as proponents hoped or less moral, as opponents feared. "All the research evidence suggests that it didn't achieve anything," said Ivor Pritchard, an analyst in the U.S. Education Department.
 So values clarification has quickly faded. "Some administrators today would rather be accused of having asbestos in their ceilings than of using valued clarification in their classrooms," Dr. Kirschenbaum wrote in a 1992 article.
 The latest enthusiasm for character education began in the mid-1980's. Fueled by concerns over increasing violence, promiscuity and drug abuse among students, it continues today - with support, it seems, across the political spectrum. Both Jesse Jackson and Barbara Bush serve on the advisory board of Character Education Partnership, a nonprofit group in Alexandria, Va., that promotes values education nationwide. At the Character Counts Coalition, a youth-focused project of the nonprofit Josephson Institute of Ethics, William J. Bennett works with Barbara Jordan.
 Public attitudes toward character education are a bit more complicated. Large majorities favor the classroom inculcation of particular values. In a 1994 survey conducted by Public Agenda Foundation, a nonprofit group that studies public opinion, 95 percent of respondents said they want schools to teach "honesty and the importance of telling the truth" and "respect for others regardless of their racial or ethnic background."
 But a markedly smaller group - 49 percent - supports the broad concept of character education, according to a 1994 Gallup survey. And 39 percent of the survey's respondents said that "this should be left to the students' parents and/or the churches."
 The disparity - near-unanimous support for teaching particular values, weaker support for teaching values in general - "makes it tough to find a solution," said Terry Peterson, advisor to U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley. "People are really split."
 Opposition comes from several directions. Some liberals worry that values education will be a Trojan horse for reintroducing Christianity to the classroom. And some civil libertarians say it is impossible to teach "values" in the public schools of a pluralist constitutional democracy. After all, whose values would be taught?
 More potent and vocal are the same critics who massed against values clarification - conservative Christians. Echoing their opposition to that earlier method, they now contend that character education programs tear children away from their faith and traditions, invade the family's privacy, promote moral relativism and "indifferentism" (the notion that all religions lead to salvation), endorse homosexuality and nontraditional family sturctures and further a left-wing political agenda.
 Addressing a predominantly hostile audience at the conference of Americans United for Separation of Church and State in November, Janet Parshall of Concerned Women for American, a conservative group, urged public schools to concentrate on "reinforcing" home-grown values, no "redefining" them. As for supposedly neutral values, she said, "I venture to say that there are some people in this room who would define 'fairness' other than I would."
 The idea of promoting tolerance in the classroom also alarms some conservatives familiar with New York City's Children of the Rainbow curriculum, which aimed in part to dispel prejudice against gay men and lesbians. "Twenty years ago, we would never have thought to define tolerance to equal the inclusion of homosexuality," Mrs. Parshall said after addressing her liberal audience. "My Bible teaches that I am to be intolerant of certain types of behavior."
 By now, fearing controversy, especially from the political right, many school officials are leery of values education. An article appearing a few years ago in one education trade journal termed it "political suicide for administrators."
 If there is a school district where character education could be implemented without discord, Mount Lebanon would seem to be it. A suburb of Pittsburgh, this town of 33,000 is homogeneous (98 percent white) and prosperous (the average family income is nearly $77,000). Its political disputes, says Dr. Huffman, embody "a level of civility in public discourse that you don't often see."
 Curriculum, a contentious issue in many school districts, has rarely come under attack here. When Pennsylvania's conservatives mobilized against the state's planned Outcome-Based Education program, contending that some of the proposed goals for students were less academic than political, the fracas only lightly brushed Mount Lebanon.
 "We hosted a meeting, and I think most of the opposition question came from outside the district," Dr. Huffman said. "Our P.T.A. and parents had confidence in our ability to take whatever outcomes the state generated and work with them in a way that's respectful fo community norms."
 Dr. Huffman himself shares many views of the conservatives who criticize public schools. A churchgoing Methodist, he speaks of "a spiritual dimension" in his life and approvingly cites publications of the conservative organization Focus on the Family. He has criticized as "less than neutral" a classroom video about AIDS that listed reasons why people remain sexually abstinent but failed to mention religious beliefs. He frames his opposition to organized classroom prayer in spiritual terms: "If the prayer is broad enough to satisfy a majority of people, it will be so innocuous as to be offensive to those who take the nuances of their faith seriously."
 But even in Mount Lebanon, even with Dr. Huffman's temperate views and his efforts to forge consensus, dissent and the threat of discord have arisen.
 The school board, for example, vetoed mandatory community service in the high school. "I think it was viewed as part of a liberal political agenda," Dr. Huffman said, adding that "it didn't help" that it was Senator Edward Kennedy who sponsored a 1993 bill calling for student community service in exchange for help with college tuition bills. "So we're paying for the sins of the Massachusetts Senator," he said.
 And there were other objections. "One parent said, 'Are you going to be teaching about homosexuals?' "recalled Ms. Colby, the first-grade teacher. "They're so afraid that in teaching respect and tolerance for others, we might respect and be tolerant of homosexuals."
 Dr. Huffman invited critics of the Heartwood books to meet with him. In one such meeting, Lawrence Dunegan, a Mount Lebanon pediatrician, objected to an assertion in the teacher's manual that "our concept of families is changing," as well as to two stories: one depicting children as wiser than their parents, the other a South African tale that he considered "very Marxist in its appeal."
 "Character formation is not really a proper function for government," Dr. Dunegan said later, after his meeting with Dr. Huffman. In fact, he added, "I don't think government has a right to educate at all."
 At another meeting, Dr. Huffman heard from Dawn Morrison, a parent. After reading some Heartwood materials and a research study about them, Mrs. Morrison concluded that the curriculum was using "psychological methods" to alter children's values. She was disturbed to learn that Heartwood's impact had not been extensively tested. "Is this an experiment?" she asked in an interview. "An experiment with our children's system of moral development, their values, their character?"
 Her opposition to the Heartwood material, Mrs. Morrison says, has nothing to do with her religious faith and little to do with the stories themselves. Although she considers particular stories inappropriate for young children, she limits her criticism to the program's methodology. "I don't want to get labeled a book burner," she said.
Mrs. Morrison says she hasn't asked to have her two children excused from reading the Heartwood books, partly because they "weren't real comfortable with the idea of being removed from the classroom and made to seem different."
Accompanying Mrs. Morrison to the meeting was a seasoned critic of public schools who had also been studying the Heartwood curriculum. From her home in nearby West Alexander, Pa., Anita Hoge, a self-described parents' advocate, had earlier rallied opinion against Outcome-Based Education in the state. Called the "Rosa Parks of the parents' rights movement" by one supporter, Mrs. Hoge has spent years challenging what she considers "invasive testing" about values in the public schools.
Like Mrs. Morrison, Mrs. Hoge says she opposes Heartwood's methodology. She faults the Heartwood program -- along with William Bennett's "Book of Virtues" -- for slighting moral absolutes. In her view, students should be told that stealing is wrong, "according to an authority -- either God or the parents, it doesn't matter." Heartwood's method, in her opinion, simply engenders "situation ethics," and parents have a right to know that.
Eleanore Childs, the president of the Heartwood Institute, disagrees with Mrs. Hoge and the other critics. She views the curriculum she helped develop as nonpartisan. "It's not political, and I think it's a shame to make it political," she said, adding that Heartwood's seven attributes "would fit very nicely into the Christian agenda."
The dispute reminds her of her days in the antiwar movement: "In the '60s, we criticized without offering solutions." From her perspective, that's what Mrs. Hoge and her allies are doing. Ms. Childs finds herself in an unfamiliar role, defending the established order and urging protesters to "collaborate, not criticize."
The Heartwood critics may not be collaborating, but unlike many critics of the school curriculum, they are communicating with the other side. "It was a great discussion Henry and I had," Mrs. Hoge said of her two-and-a-half hour meeting with Dr. Huffman.
In schoolbook battles across the nation, one often hears the same hand-wringing refrain: If only the disputants would sit down together and talk, they would discover vast common ground. In Mt. Lebanon, though, the Heartwood critics and the school officials are sitting down and talking. And it is not enough.
THE ISSUES and tactics arising in Mount Lebanon are also appearing elsewhere. Schoolbook critics across the country have been advancing secular arguments for teaching moral absolutes, in place of the religious arguments they once advanced for teaching Christianity.
"The right wing has learned that if they blatantly raise their religious perspective, it discredits them," said Michael Hudson, Western regional vice president of People for the American Way.
Today's schoolbook protesters are also less confrontational than those of the 1980's, Mr. Hudson says. "They've clearly toned down the rhetoric," he said. "From Pat Robertson all the way down to the grass roots, they're trying not to look so kooky." That rhetorical shift, he added, creates "one of the biggest problems for our side. The movement is so much more sophisticated now. It's not nearly as easy to expose them as it was in the '80s."
As in Mount Lebanon, protesters are commonly focusing on methodology rather than book content, says Eve Hoffman, a former chair of the Gwinnett County, Ga., school board, who has studied the conflicts between conservative Christians and public schools in Georgia. "There are a lot of accusations that schools are practicing psychology without a license," she said.
Among the speakers who have addressed conservative groups in Georgia recently, she added, is Mrs. Hoge. "She's so far to the right, she flashes back to 'None Dare Call It Treason,' " Ms. Hoffman said, referring to John Stormer's anti-Communist tract of 1964. "Hoge is definitely a national player."
Whatever else enters the dispute about values and education, it centers around turf and trust. Dr. Huffman says his message to Heartwood critics is: "We're on the cutting edge here, folks. Trust our professional judgment." Mrs. Hoge's view is that "parents have been going along in this little marshmallow world, trusting the professionals." Her message, she says, is: "Parents -- you are the professionals."
MESSAGES like Mrs. Hoge's may resonate with the public's current mistrust of politics and political institutions. And the electorate's rightward shift may mean that values education will become even tougher to implement. Conservative critics are not easily satisfied these days: Mel Gabler of Longview, Tex., whose textbook reviews influence many book protests, says he doesn't know of any character education program that Christian parents can embrace.
In Mount Lebanon, Mrs. Hoge is contemplating a lawsuit to quash the Heartwood program. She maintains that state regulations require the district to test students on core values, but a Federal law, the Hatch Amendment, prohibits such testing without parental consent. "We have our ducks in a row," she said. "If the parents are pressured, they will do what is necessary to insure that their rights are respected." After a pause, she added: "I will never be stepped on again."
Mrs. Hoge may not have a winning legal argument -- experts dispute her interpretation of both the state and the Federal laws -- but she could still prevail. Defending a lawsuit can be costly and time consuming. And even without a lawsuit, curriculum disputes impose emotional costs. Three longtime school superintendents interviewed by Ms. Hoffman for her Georgia study said that the atmosphere created by conservative Christian protests felt "worse" than the acrimony accompanying desegregation.
Six of Mount Lebanon's nine school board members have taken office since approval of the initial plan for character education. Some of them are cool to the Heartwood program. Might the board abandon character education rather than endure a lawsuit or a political fight? "That's a concern," Dr. Huffman acknowledged.
If so, it won't be the first time that a handful of objectors has succeeded in rejiggering the curriculum. "It's absolutely common that a small minority of highly energized folks can dominate the process," Mr. Hudson of People for the American Way said. Ms. Hoffman agreed. "These folks are driven by an adrenaline rush that most of us don't have," she said. "If they decide to come after you, it does not matter if you have engaged 95 percent of the community -- they're going to get you."
WHATEVER happens to the fledgling program in Mount Lebanon, Dr. Huffman may not be there to deal with it. He has applied for a position as director of a planned Pennsylvania-based research center on character education. Whether or not he gets the job, he intends to leave the Mount Lebanon school district where he has worked for 27 years, and devote himself to advancing moral education across the country.
He hopes to help other districts, especially those without the resources of Mount Lebanon, implement values programs of their own.
What of the program he midwifed? "My leaving may be a good thing for our initiative," he said in a written statement, "to the degree that my presence may have inhibited some staff from playing a more prominent role." No longer will the program be viewed as "Henry Huffman's project."
Ms. Colby isn't so sure Dr. Huffman's departure is a good thing. Sitting in the teachers' lounge after reading "Abiyoyo" to her first-graders, she said, "If somebody wants to take exception to what your're doing, where are you going to go? With Henry not being on site, people are afraid they're not going to be able to stand up to criticism."
Though she had just finished teaching a lesson on courage, Ms. Colby looked apprehensive.
 
Which Values?
When it comes to character education, the first few values on any school's list are fairly predictable: "compassion," "honesty," "tolerance."
Some schools go beyond moral values to address friendliness, or neatness. Some list self-esteem.
And a fewschool districts have developed lengthy lists, like the 36 items (one for each week of the school year) in Dayton, Ohio, or the 24 in Baltimore County, Md. (where the roster includes "courtesy" and "objectivity").
In 1992, the nonprofit Josephson Institute of Ethics endorsed six "core ethical values": respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, caring, justice and fairness, and civic virtue and citizenship. In the view of the participants, representing education organizations, universities and youth groups: "These core ethical values transcend cultural, religious and socio-economic differences."
Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University and author of the 1993 book, "The Spirit of Community," would concentrate on just two values.. "Every human being I know except Mother Theresa commits one sin a day," he said. "There are impulses which are not expungeable." A noble person, then, is one who is "relatively well equipped" to resist the impulses toward misbehavior. "The person has two attributes," Professor Etzioni continued. "First, self-control. And second, empathy -- because if you have only self-control, you will be a very effective murderer." S.B.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
The Virtual Classroom

BYLINE: By ROSALIE STEMER; Rosalie Stemer is a journalist who has taught at Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
At Southern Methodist University in Dallas last semester, Professor H. Charles Baker was leading what may well be a classroom of the future. In the room were 44 electrical engineering students, but six others were sitting 2,000 miles away at A.T.&.T. in Middletown, N.J. They watched television monitors carrying the class live, and interrupted Professor Baker to ask questions by speakerphone. The course, appropriately enough, was Introduction to Telecommunications.
 The six students are enrolled in National Technological University of Fort Collins, Colo., and can earn master's degrees by taking video courses from Southern Methodist University and 45 other universities. Theirs is a virtual classroom, for they travel from campus to campus without ever leaving town. 
 "Someone in Boise, Idaho, can take a course from Cornell University one term, a class from University of California at Berkeley the next term and a class from Columbia University the next term," said Lionel Baldwin, president of National Technological University. "This is a way for students to have the best instructors around the country."
 Most National Technological University students are engineers, computer scientists and managers whose employers pay their tuition. The average student age is 33. Although the students may complete course work from several schools, their degrees will be awarded by National Technological University, which is accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities.
 This may be the highest-tech descendant of the old "Sunrise Semesters," the continuing education classes on television, offering art or cooking or math to people in their homes. That concept never caught fire - no one could figure out how to replicate the classroom, guided by a wise professor, or the feeling of discovering and learning together.
 But today, from the largest universities to the small liberal arts colleges, schools are trying to figure out how to use technology without diminishing the quality of educaiton and without destroying student-teacher interaction.
 "The potential of new technology in education is revolutionary, as long as we don't get so carried away that we remove the human element," said Thomas H. Kean, president of Drew University, a small liberal-arts school in Madison, N.J. "Students with jobs or family obligations might have lectures delivered to their homes electronically and interact with faculty by computer. But for the best kind of education, teacher and student must get together at least once a week. The student needs to explain his ideas and have those ideas challenged in a small group with a professor. And when students challenge the professor's assumptions, that's when they really learn. The professor needs to sit on one side of a log, and the students on another."
 But, counters Professor Jack M. Wilson, director of the Center for Innovation in Undergraduate Learning at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.: "The log might have to be an electronic log. You could bring the students to the classroom electronically. I would argue the students meet the faculty every time they come to class."
 At its best, technology like videoconferencing can permit students like Professor Baker's to participate from 2,000 miles away. And fiber-optic cables promise to improve the picture and sound. Computers can play to a student's best learning style - trial and error, visual memory, graphic example.
 But at its worst, video and other technologies could conceivably be used as a substitute for the traditional classroom or lecture. Some faculty members fear that universities with shrinking budgets will force them to teach huge numbers of students by television. They envision exploding workloads, reduced quality of education and, ultimately, loss of their jobs. They worry that a university system with many campuses will decide to save money by showing videos of, say, its best philosophy professor and eliminate philosophy departments on its other campuses.
 "There are people who would love to see the 5,000-student class taught by television, with machine-graded tests," said Erwin Kelly of California State University, Sacramento - an economics professor who is a member of a commission exploring possible uses of instructional technology on all 20 Cal State campuses. "To the California Legislature, distance learning seems to be the answer to the budget crisis: Teach more students with less money. We have an ongoing tension between people who see technology as a way to cut costs versus people who want quality."
 His fears arise from the gloomy outlook for the 320,000-student California State University system. State financing is less, in real dollars, than it was four years ago and in that time, 4,000 faculty positions have been cut and 10,000 class sections eliminated. Some students have been unable to complete their degrees in four years because they could not get into courses required for their major.
 "By the year 2005, we expect student enrollment to hit 500,000, but we won't even have physical space on our campuses for 50,000 of those students," said Patricia Cuocco, Cal State's interim director of information technology initiatives. "If more class sections were offered over video, computer, microwave, satellite, there would be less competition for seats," she said. Students would get the classes they need in more timely fashion and not languish on campus for five or six years to graduate."
 This does not mean that administrators are rushing to buy everything available, Ms. Cuocco explains. "We need to be careful that technology should never drive the application," she said. "The application needs to drive the technology."
 In a two-year experiment, CalState is using two-way video to share resources among four campuses. In Sacramento, San Jose, Hayward and Chico, students pursuing a master's degree in business administration can watch live courses transmitted from another campus. Voice-activated cameras at the originating and receiving sites focus on students as they speak up and on the professor while he or she is lecturing.
 "This is a prototype to find out what problems could develop, and we've found some," said Merle Martin, the project administrator.
 For example, three of the four campuses are on a semester system, while Cal State Hayward is on a quarter system. A student earns two hours of credit for the marketing course on the Sacramento campus, and three hours at Chico.
And not surprisingly, money is a touchy issue. "Right now, campuses receive funds from the Cal State system for each full-time-equivalent student taking 15 hours of classes," said Dr. Martin, chairman of Management Information Sciences at Cal State Sacramento.
"If eight students in Sacramento watch a course that originates in Chico, which campus counts the students?" he asks. "Under our current arrangement, the receiving site is keeping count of the student."
PROSPECTS of teaching by video also worry the faculty union.
"Once a lecture is on videotape, who owns it?" asks Professor Jack Kurzweil, president of the San Jose State University chapter of the California Faculty Association, the union that represents all faculty on the 20 Cal State campuses. "What if someone decides to show the videotape instead of asking me to teach the course?"
The State University of New York, with 397,000 students on 64 campuses, is also trying out instruction by video.
"We and Cal State are facing similar issues," said Christine Haile, associate vice chancellor for technology services at SUNY. "We both have large and diverse student populations and tight budgets."
Last semester, SUNY's Binghamton, Buffalo and Stony Brook campuses shared three engineering courses by videotape, E-mail and computer. They also sent videotaped classes to SUNY College at New Paltz.
Junior- and senior-level business courses from SUNY's Albany televion studio are being shown to students at 19 of SUNY's two-year colleges, giving students access to courses not otherwise available on their campuses.
"We have an award-winning faculty, and we will see greater sharing of our faculty expertise across campuses," said Ms. Haile. "But we don't see one faculty member for 10,000 students."
SUNY's faculty union, United University Professions, is cautious about the experiments. "We're in favor of distance learning provided we have equal control," said Bill Scheuerman, president of United University Professions. "We'll support it if it provides quality of education and doesn't put our positions in jeopardy."
New technology has been successfully brought into the classroom with impressive results as well as dollar savings Rensselaer Polytechnic, a much smaller school with an undergraduate student body of 4,500, dismantled its longstanding introductory physics lectures and created smaller class sections. In the process, the school is saving $80,000 each semester.
"We set out to de-emphasize large lectures and make students feel they matter," said Rensselaer's Professor Wilson, who teaches physics. "We wanted to use technology to get students actively involved in their own education. We also wanted to achieve a spectacular increase in quality and a modest savings in cost -- and we have."
Professor Wilson, a physics teacher, led a team that reshaped the course. Instead of lecturing to 400 students, a professor meets with 50 to 60 students in a physics studio.
They sit at computer work stations that provide text, full-motion video, audio, color photos, graphs and spreadsheets. Probes hooked up to computers let students to carry out scientific experiments. Multimedia software asks questions, displays and analyzes student responses, plots results and outcomes, then asks new questions.
Chris McPeek, a sophomore majoring in computer systems engineering, took the first semester of introductory physics in the old format, and the second semester in a physics studio.
"In the lecture, most students fall asleep," said Mr. McPeek, 19. "But the studio is a lot better and really interactive. We learn not by listening to the professor but by doing it ourselves."
Mr. McPeek's reaction affirms Professor Wilson's belief that he has met his goals. "We didn't re-engineer the class to use new technology, but we did use new technology to re-engineer the class," said Professor Wilson.
A re-engineered way of learning also eases access to education for older, working students. Today only 44 percent of college undergraduates are under 22 years of age and attend school full time, according to a current population survey by the U. S. Census Bureau. Many students have job constraints, family obligations or physical handicaps that make it difficult for them to visit a campus for regularly scheduled classes.
To reach them, New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark offers an extensive program in distance education. The school has produced 50 courses on video, among them chemistry, mathematics, physics and English. Students enrolled in for-credit courses can watch lectures from home on cable television or check out videotapes.
For a bachelor of arts degree in Information Systems, students may do all course work by distance learning. At least twice a week, students are required to log on to their computers and talk with professors and classmates by computer.
"We try to promote face-to-face interaction with faculty," said Ann Lippel, N. J. I. T.'s director of distance learning. "We provide one- to two-hour orientation sessions. Also, some instructors encourage students to take their exams on campus."
Of 7,000 students enrolled at N. J. I. T., 950 combined distance-learning courses with attendance in traditional classes on campus in the 1993-94 academic year.
Nancy Kurnellas of Medford, N. J., a computer programmer, was working on a master's degree in computer science when she injured her head in a horse-riding accident. To finish her degree, she got videotapes from N. J. I. T. for her last three courses and communicated with her instructors and her fellow students by computer.
"I got more student and professor contact over the computer than I did when I attended a traditional classroom," Ms. Kurnellas said. "A lot of professors show up when class starts and leave the minute it's over."
In May 1993, three years after her injury, Ms. Kurnellas received her Master's from N. J. I. T. at the age of 49. She became a senior test engineer for T. R. W. four months later.
Rensselaer, too, offers adults degrees by distance learning, broadcasting classes in engineering, computer science and technology management to work sites. "It's a Rensselaer master's degree -- nobody knows the difference," said Susan Bray, director of the Rensselaer Satellite Video Program. "These are the same high-quality students with the same course requirements. They get the same education as students on campus. But their seat in the classroom is 500 or 1,000 miles away."
For younger students ensconced in college dorms, learning by video could be a detriment. Matthew Hill, 18, a freshman honors student studying computer science, took one of his N.J.I.T. classes, PASCAL programming, by distance learning. He had to watch the lectures twice a week on videotape.
"Every time you log on, that's a classroom," said Mr. Hill. "You post messages to a bulletin board called Virtual Classroom. The professor might answer your question in the computer, or ask other students to comment first. The only time you see the other students in your class is at the midterm and at the final exam."
But Mr. Hill, who lives on campus, said he doesn't think he will take another class by distance learning. "It's harder to slack off when you go to a class," he said. "The professor is able to light a fire under you. Something is lost over the computer. It's just words on a screen. There are no faces and no voices."
At Drew University, where 90 percent of the 1,300 undergraduates live on campus, "we want to see our students in the classroom," said Alan Candiotti, assistant vice president for university technology. "We don't want to bring lectures into the dorm."
Drew focuses instead on other aspects of technology. The university gives every student and every faculty member a computer with printer and software. Recently Drew built a multimedia lab, where students in art class can use an electronic pen tablet to "paint" and draw, as well as to create three-dimensional images in a computer. In the introductory music theory and composition course, students compose on computers and send their music to the instructor by E-mail.
Rodney Cornelius, 18, a freshman from Boston, applied to several universities, but what tipped the scales for him was Drew's emphasis on technology.
"My theory is that a student who graduates from college without the ability to use new technology is not educated," said President Kean of Drew.
COLLEGES and universities are re-thinking the student-teacher relationship in the context of electronic education.
"Educational technology should enable us to reach more students in a better way," said Professor Kelly of Cal State's instructional technology committee. "But we want to raise the quality of education, not simply lower the cost. We don't want to replace faculty with machines."
Patrick Nichelson, president of the Cal State faculty union, believes that university advisory committees have become more cautious in the last two years about the use of technology.
"These are all teachers," said Professor Nichelson. "The more they look at it, the more they see that the relation between student and teacher is a precious thing."

Construction Nears on a Technology Park at Storrs

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

DATELINE: STORRS

 BODY:
WITH final environmental approvals drawing near, construction of a technology park should begin soon on 390 acres north of the University of Connecticut's campus in the Storrs section of the Town of Mansfield.
The first structure will be a 92,000-square foot Advanced Technologies Institute building, with construction financed by $10 million each from the state and Federal Governments. It is expected to be ready for occupancy in about a year.. 
 UConn hopes to attract research and development or light industrial tenants to complement its own research. Up to 1.25 million square feet of space, including a hotel-conference center, is planned.
"It's going to be a massive economic shot in the arm for the entire region," said Michael Helfgott, executive vice president of the university's Connecticut Educational Properties Inc., the nonprofit corporation formed to develop the park.
He said that a corporation study estimates that by the year 2000 the technology park will have created as many as 770 jobs.
"We're not in an urban setting, and we're not right on a major highway," Mr. Helfgott said. "But we are the only location in Connecticut with this kind of access to research infrastructure -- the expensive laboratory equipment and access to data" involved in high-technology advanced manufacturing. "Our job," he said, "is going to be to find companies that value that access."
Dr. Chandra Roychoudhuri, a photonics researcher at the university, said the lack of commercial space near the campus has hampered relationships with industry. Photonics is the use of light or lasers (amplified light) for surgical, biomedical or industrial tasks.
"Small companies are looking for space that is available immediately," Dr. Roychoudhuri said. "It's only larger companies that have the luxury of planning three, four years into the future. If the technology park was operating, I can guarantee you some of them would be here."
Gregory J. Padick, the Mansfield Town Planner, said that a recent survey had shown that about 80 percent of the town's residents approved of the project, with 12 percent opposed. "The jobs and the tax base that will be created, and the benefits to the university, will be such that it will offset any detriments," Mr. Padick said.
"Some of the opponents are concerned that this project and the changes that will come about as a result of it are going to change the character of Mansfield, and that's certainly an important consideration," he continued. But through strict planning and zoning controls, he said, the town can control future growth.
The technology park was originally proposed in the 70's. In 1983 a developer was hired to put in utilities and recruit tenants.
ABOUT the same time, Yale University, the City of New Haven, the state and the Olin Corporation were planning Science Park, a development on 80 acres that used to be the Olin arms-manufacturing plant, said Thomas F. Stabell, director of physical plant and development at Science Park.
The park now consists of about 300,000 square feet of space, 80 percent of it occupied by nearly 100 different tenants. Mr. Stabell said a $200 million expansion was planned on 26 acres adjacent to Route 34, near the Yale-New Haven Hospital.
But in Storrs, the concept languished through the 80's. After a bitter dispute with the original contractor -- ConnTech, a subsidiary of the Sunrise Development Corporation of Cleveland -- Mr. Helfgott's corporation took over the project in 1990.
Mr. Helfgott said that all approvals were in hand or expected in the next few weeks, that a half-mile road had been built through the center of the site and that the project was ready to proceed.
The plan calls for construction of another half-mile of road this year, to link the campus to Route 44 north of the campus.
About 150 acres of the parcel would be developed, with the rest, primarily wetlands or prime agricultural land, left as open space. In addition, there will be bike paths and hiking trails for recreation.
Mr. Helfgott said that after the technology building was completed, construction of incubator space, the hotel and some housing for graduate students was also planned.
Thomas G. Giolas, dean of the graduate school, said the park would enable university researchers to follow their work from laboratory discovery through commercial applications, while maintaining a separation between pure and applied research.
"When I first came in eight years ago the intent was to preserve the purity of the ivory towers, to avoid contamination by commercialization," Dr. Giolas said. "That's just not appropriate anymore, so we have to work hard to avoid conflicts of interest."
For instance, graduate students will not be allowed to work on proprietary projects that might, for industrial secrecy reasons, delay publication of their theses.
"What some of the faculty have been afraid of is, if they get too caught up in the money end of their research, they might end up losing some of their academic freedom," Dr. Giolas said. "We don't know how to deal with that except to say that it won't happen, and to guarantee that all internal funding will be available to all areas of research, even those that do not hold out much promise for commercialization."
Most faculty members are satisfied that UConn has taken steps to avoid conflicts, said Dr. Peter L. Halvorson, a geography professor and chairman of the University Senate executive council.
"There's sufficient insulation between the two so the park won't be a drain on the university budget," Dr. Halvorson said. "In fact, most people see the potential for some significant benefits."
The first building will be occupied by the school's Precision Manufacturing Center and its Environmental Research Institute, which already work with a variety of businesses, Mr. Helfgott said.
"Putting the university people in the first building will act as a magnet, to bring business into the park," he said.
"THE jobs of tomorrow are not going to come from the big businesses of today," Mr. Helfgott said. "They're going to come from what today are small, research-based, emerging business. And a park like this is put up to support those growing businesses."
Dr. Trevor P. Howes, director of the manufacturing center, said 20 companies had agreed to support its research, paying annual membership fees of $2,500 to $50,000.
"So," he said, "it's clear there is interest in our work. This park will bring so much expertise into a small area, we should be able to get some growth going."
Mr. Helfgott said he had begun discussions with economic development officials in northeast Connecticut to augment the park's limited space, restricted by wetlands and the presence of prime agricultural land.
"We're going to be very limited in terms of the manufacturing activity that can take place in the park," Mr. Helfgott said. "So we need to show them ways to stay in the park to do their research and development, and when it comes time to produce their invention we direct them to the American Thread buildings in Willimantic or the Putnam Industrial Park in Putnam."

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Milton Cohen;
Why One Business Planted Its Headquarters in Westbury

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
MILTON COHEN'S life has become a little easier. After commuting from Long Island to Brooklyn for 38 years, Mr. Cohen, president of the Lifetime Hoan Corporation, a designer of cutlery, kitchen tools and other gadgets, has moved his company to Westbury.
The new office, in a sprawling complex once occupied by the Olsten Corporation, is certainly more convenient, but that was not his first priority, Mr. Cohen said. The company moved, in October, to "secure the firm's profitability" after a recession that devastated more than a few retailers. 
 Lifetime Hoan sells 3,000 kitchen tools and gadgets under the brand names Tristar, Hoan and Old Homestead and under licenses from Farberware, Walt Disney and Pillsbury. Its customers are retail and discount stores throughout the country.
Defying a long recession and a widespread plunge in the sales of durable goods, Lifetime Hoan has doubled its sales, to more than $76 million from $38 million in the last five years.
The company bought the building in Westbury for $5 million, a small price, Mr. Cohen said, for profits and productivity that continue to soar.
The business has a showroom in Manhattan and a large manufacturing plant in Dayton, N.J.
Mr. Cohen acquired Lifetime Cutlery in 1960, which he merged with a houseware-products company that he founded in 1957. Lifetime Hoan went public in 1991 and is traded under the Nasdaq symbol LCUT. It employs 350 people, 80 of them on Long Island.
Mr. Cohen, 65, has been company president and chief executive for 34 years. He received a bachelor's in business from City College of New York.
Mr. Cohen has lived on Long Island for 40 years, the last 12 in Hewlett, where he and his wife, Norma, have raised three children.
Q. Why have the company's sales and profits soared steadily since 1989?
A. There are many reasons. First, I don't think there was much of a recession in the housewares industry, because these are things people use every day, and they aren't big-ticket items. Our products, in particular, appeal to the average household. And that's probably why we sell more cutlery than any other company in the world.
Also, there's not much competition left. When I started this business, there were maybe 100 U.S. companies' doing what we were doing. Now there are three.
Q. Why are so few left?
A. Most of them went out of business because they couldn't compete with imports. They could not compete with labor expenses overseas. In China the average factory worker gets one day off a month, and his monthly salary is $30.
Q. After being in Brooklyn for 45 years, why did you move to Long Island?
A. When I started the company Brooklyn was an industrial mecca. Everything was there. There was no industry like that anywhere on the Island. And our factory workers and plant managers all came from Brooklyn. So naturally it was the best place for us.
But eight years ago we moved our manufacturing to Dayton, N.J., and made the Brooklyn building our executive offices. That's when things got difficult. Most of our executives were Long Islanders, and they hated the commute.
Also, our design department -- which is critical, because design and function are what make you in this business -- was being dramatically expanded. It became computerized and state of the art, and we couldn't accommodate it in Brooklyn. We needed new workers, ones who were highly skilled in computer technology and design. And they were more abundant on Long Island. But when we interviewed them for jobs, they didn't want to commute to Brooklyn. So basically we came to them.
Q. Have you become more productive on Long Island?
A. Moving to Long Island has improved our work force dramatically. Aside from being able to attract the highly skilled people we need our longtime employees are much happier. They can drive to work in 10 or 20 minutes. The environment is safe. We were near the Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, and not a week went by when one of our cars wasn't broken into. Our space here is also much more efficient. It's very expansive and all on one level. There's nothing even remotely comparable to it in Brooklyn or any of the boroughs.
Q. Why did you begin importing significant inventory from Asia decades ago?
A. I saw we could no longer compete with what was coming in from overseas. So I started importing from Japan 34 years ago. Actually a Japanese gentlemen who knew the cutlery business quite well came to me with some ideas. I thought he had great potential. We went to Japan together, and he showed me around all the factories. I started importing parts from there and assembling, coordinating and packing them in the U.S. From Japan, I progressed to Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and then China. But I really owe a lot of my success to my Japanese friend.
Q. How did you manage the language barrier?
A. I did study Japanese. But once I got to other parts of Asia, I found that English was well known.
Q. Has it been helpful to have licenses to sell products under well-known names like Walt Disney?
A. Definitely. We've been using the Disney name, marketing a Chef Mickey product line to kids for 10 years, and it's been very successful. Our license with Farberware has also been successful. And now we're promoting a line of Pillsbury baking products. These are things any company could have done. We just thought of them first.
Q. After inventing items like the knife block, a wood cutting board that also stores knives, has innovation been important to success?
A. Yes, I think we got a jump on this industry and we've kept it up. We stayed in business because we started importing very early on. But you have to keep improving. New innovations are critical. Our latest development is a carousel which stores knives and an entire range of cooking utensils in a very compact space. It helps that every one of our executives has worked in the manufacturing end of this business. We're always coming up with new ideas. I thrive on the creativity. If I couldn't create new things I think I would retire.
Q. What are Long Island's strengths as a place for doing business?
A. We had a lot of problems getting out-of-town buyers to visit our showroom in Brooklyn. We'd offer to send cars for them, but they were still hesitant. We did open a showroom in Manhattan on Madison Avenue, but the rent is such that we couldn't have the huge showroom we wanted. But we can have it on Long Island. It's very efficient to have our buyers see our showroom and design department at the same time. We can get a lot more done creatively. The bottom line is the buyers are visiting again. They've heard a lot about Long Island. We're next to the Coliseum. There are fabulous restaurants here. We've gotten buyers from all over the country to come here.
Q. Do you think your move is a sign of things to come for Long Island?
A. Unfortunately, I think this was something good for our particular situation, and not necessarily a reflection of the Island's ability to attract new business. Though I can't really say it isn't a reflection, either. We've only been here for two months, so I can't make that judgment yet.
Q. How do you feel about the Island's development efforts?
A. I think Nassau County should have done a lot more to try and entice us. They did nothing in terms of financing, interest rates or incentives to expand our facility. We moved here pretty much in spite of the county, not because of it.
Q. Should Nassau re-evaluate its efforts?
A. It wouldn't hurt if they were more aggressive in trying to attract companies, like New Jersey is. Tax abatements, advertising, a lot is needed. I wish Nassau could compete with New Jersey, because it would be very convenient to have our factory here. But with taxes and rentals what they are, it just isn't possible.
Q. Did groups like the Long Island Association help with the move?
A. They tried, but there wasn't anything we needed. Ours was an ideal turnkey move. We sold our furniture in Brooklyn and bought the furniture at Olsten. The only thing we really had to move was my desk.
Q. Who are your chief competitors in the cutlery business?
A. Two European companies, Henckels and Wusthof. And in the U.S. there's Chicago Cutlery, which is a very fine brand. But it's in a higher-price category. We appeal to the masses, because that's where the volume lies.
Q. What is your concept of the "new retail reality"?
A. Having a good understanding of what retailers need to give to consumers, which is style, quality and retail price. You must know what the retailers are willing to spend. And since our management staff have all worked in the production end of the business at one time or other, they work with our factories in deciding what we should make, how we should make it and how we can make it affordable.

HEADLINE: Artists Find Isolation Ends in Hastings

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
AT an hour when residents of the river towns who work in Manhattan were already at their offices, about 30 members of the Rivertown Artists Group left their studios and home offices to gather upstairs in the Municipal Building here to share coffee, bagels, gossip and their latest projects.
"When you're an artist, it's a very isolating job," said Maxeen Smart, a Hastings resident who runs a home-based advertising-design studio and creates collages as well. "Sometimes this group is your only contact with other artists." 
 To address the problem of artists and writers working in isolation, Betsy Imershein and Jane Cameron, both Hastings-based photographers, started the informal artists' group last year under the auspices of the Hastings Creative Arts Council, of which Ms. Cameron is president. The group, however, is not limited to Hastings residents.
"We wanted to create a forum where we could share ideas with other artists," Ms. Cameron said. "We wanted this group to be a nexus for artists meeting other artists. So Betsy and I sat down at my kitchen table and invited 50 artists from our personal friends in the area. It grew from 7 people at the first meeting to 30 by the second meeting. People come together to share what they are working on and to get feedback on their work and inspiration from other artists."
At the monthly meetings, artists and writers discuss their current projects, coming exhibitions or publications and listen to a presentation from one or two members. The group, which has about 60 people on its mailing list, is open to visual artists, like painters, sculptors, fashion and jewelry designers, photographers, writers and musicians.
The group shares tips on negotiating with dealers and gallery owners, discusses technical problems and puts members in touch with writers for creative collaborations. A recent project was the publication of a booklet called "Local Talent: A Buyer's Guide to the Works of River Town Artists and Writers," available in bookstores and at libraries in Hastings, Dobbs Ferry, Ardsley and Tarrytown. It features visual artists and writers. The idea behind the guide was to expand the market for artists and acquaint residents with their neighbors' works.
"This is a part of the community that is normally quiet, because artists usually work alone," said the group's co-founder, Betsy Imershein, a Hastings' photographer. "This helps the community by giving a greater visibility to these artists and gives the community a sense of the greater resources that exist."
On a day in late fall, Ms. Smart presented some of her collages to the group. She was followed by a fashion designer, Edie Bazzano, who presented some of her children's clothes.
"Unlike other artists' groups, this one has musicians, writers, painters and photographers," Ms. Smart said. "It's rare to have all of us come together in one group. We show our work to the group, and there's a discussion of it. We share what shows we've seen. It's beneficial just being around other people who are interested in looking at art."
For many of the participants, the group's existence is testament to the artists' growing presence in the river towns, especially in Hastings, which has a reputation for attracting writers and musicians.
"Coming here every month has been delightful," said Lisa deMauro, a children's book author. "It's like going to Manhattan. I've seen people here whom I've never seen anywhere else. I've been amazed that there were so many children's book artists and authors here. And each month has been like a different gallery experience. It has been a real education."
There are other signs that the thriving arts community in the river towns is becoming an economic force as well. Like their counterparts in downtown Manhattan, who staked out claims to the Hudson riverfront, many of the artists who moved to Hastings, Dobbs Ferry or Irvington were attracted to the Hudson River vistas. And just as the downtown artists, photographers and writers attracted small publishers, literary agents and production houses, so too have the county's cluster of artist communities stimulated the development of economic activities usually associated with Manhattan.
Some of the Hudson riverfront commercial buildings that used to be devoted to industry have been refurbished to attract artistic tenants as well as small businesses. There's Noble House in Irvington, for example, and 145 Palisades Avenue in Dobbs Ferry, which have in recent years attracted diverse tenants like literary agents, small publishers and book packagers as well as graphic designers and studios.
"This is a very quaint, charming building with lots of history, and this is what tenants say they want," said Anella Aloia, general manager at 145 Palisades Avenue in Dobbs Ferry, a former book depository and brewery set on 15 acres. "About 25 percent of our tenants are artists or in related fields. We have lots of writers and musicians. It's quite an exclusive group."

HEADLINE: Crashing the 'Old Boy' Party

BYLINE: By ANDREA GABOR; Andrea Gabor is the author of "Einstein's Wife: Work and Marriage in the Lives of Five Great Twentieth Century Women," to be published by Viking/Penguin in August.

 BODY:
IT was a chilly October night in 1984, at the end of a two-year recession and the start of a shakeout in Boston's medical establishment, when a dozen or so women -- all health care professionals -- got together over a dinner of chicken and shop talk in Brookline, Mass. The women, all in their 30's, most of them married with children, had been meeting monthly for seven years.
During that time, they had navigated their way from middle management to senior positions at local hospitals and in state government and academia. And for the most part, their conversations focused on the nitty gritty of health care administration -- nursing shortages, obstreperous physicians, salaries. 
 But that autumn evening, the group, which would come to call itself the
A Team, had a collective epiphany: "We realized that we had started low, and were now all among the senior management of our organizations," says Elaine Ullian, a founding member of the group, who recently took over as chief executive of Boston University Medical Center Hospital, a top teaching hospital. "We were all working for new C.E.O.'s. We could be C.E.O.'s. But none of us was."
In 1981, not a single one of over 60 hospitals in the Boston area (except for one religious hospital) was run by a woman. And although the mid-80's saw a rapid turnover in the top jobs at Massachusetts hospitals, no A Team members had been considered for them. "There were three or four search firms that recruited for these jobs," Ms. Ullian explains, and "they didn't even know we existed."
The women decided this wasn't for lack of qualifications, since several of them already had senior positions and felt their resumes matched those of men who got many top jobs, but for lack of contacts.
So the A Team set out to be noticed. Over the course of a two-hour meeting, the women discussed the wisdom of an all-out push to help one another move up. Some women initially balked at appearing too aggressive, but in the end the group set a firm goal: to establish at least three of its members in executive suites within a few years.
And they set out to do this with a sophistication rare among such networks. In a methodical, highly planned drive, the A Team worked the phones, brought in headhunters and local politicians, even held seminars on down-to-earth matters like financial statements. All this was knit tightly together with regular meetings, sometimes over Chinese food, sometimes over breakfast, always with clarity of purpose.
 
A Quick Payoff
 The payoff was dramatic. The A Team, which has maintained a membership of 12 to 14, far exceeded its original target, with nearly half its members clinching top positions by the late 1980's. In early 1987, Ms. Ullian got the first of two leadership posts she would hold in the coming decade when she became chief executive of Boston's Faulkner Hospital. In 1987, Marva Serotkin became chief executive of Lemuel Shattuck, a state hospital.
And a year later, Judith Kurland became both chief executive of Boston City Hospital, a public hospital, and Boston's Commissioner of Health and Hospitals, a coveted job in which she won out over half a dozen established men. A Team members also took charge at several community hospitals.
Of course, the network cannot be judged as if in a test tube. Sweeping changes were opening health care to a surge of new ideas and new faces, with Massachusetts on the revolution's front lines, and affirmative action was very much in the air. Placed as they were in the top ranks of their organizations, many of these women may well have won promotions on their own. But there's abundant evidence that the A Team speeded them on their way.
The A Team is remarkable not only for its longevity and its members' accomplishments, but for what it says about the self-image of modern, professional women. Indeed, many in the group acknowledge that it took some time to come to terms with the extent -- and limits -- of their aspirations. Ms. Ullian, for one, said she was 22 and working in a clinic before she even realized a woman could be a doctor. And although she had been on a fast track since the mid-70's, it never occurred to her that she might want to become a chief executive until she joined a consulting firm in the early 1980's, advising the heads of some 35 hospitals on their strategic plans. Suddenly, she said, she realized that she could do the job her clients were doing and in many cases "do it better."
Some A Team members were cautious at first. "I wasn't quite sure how aggres-sive we were going to appear and whether it would work potentially against us," said Sandra Fenwick, who in 1984 had already won three promotions in her first five years at Beth Israel. Ms. Fenwick said male colleagues had cautioned her that aggressive women might be seen as having "forced their way" to the top, rather than rising on merit alone. As it happens, Ms. Fenwick turned down a chief executive offer in 1987 -- she calls it "one of the most difficult" decisions of her career -- because she had a 2-year-old child and was pregnant.
The A Team thus represents a new, pragmatic feminism, and a big departure from both the stridency of the 1960's and the ladylike passivity of earlier generations. To some extent, it was simply a challenge to the "old boy" networks that have long given men timely boosts up the ladder. But the A Team is different, the women insist. Membership was "not restricted by your class, your club, or your school," Ms. Kurland noted. Instead, the women were tied together only by their gender, a common profession, and a desire to share information and advice.
But didn't conflicts arise, with the women vying for the same jobs? The women say no. From the beginning, they say, the A Team took a one-for-all approach, and there never seems to have been overt competition. The members say that since each woman was at a slightly different stage of her career, there was little conflict over individual openings.
 
In 1977, Lone Pioneers In a Largely Male World
 The A Team had its roots in a series of casual lunches that began in 1977 and brought together a handful of women health care pioneers -- many young and isolated in what was still a largely middle-age, male world. One thing they missed was the companionship of like-minded women. "We had no agenda," Ms. Ullian recalled, "except to create a safe place to discuss our professional concerns. We wanted a place where we didn't have to worry that someone would say, 'She isn't very good, is she?' "
From its inception, the A Team struck a responsive chord among a generation of women who were intent on building careers, not just holding down jobs. When, in the late 1970's, the network's founders sent a mailing to notify colleagues of a meeting in a basement classroom at Boston University, nearly 100 women responded. That meeting laid the foundation for an umbrella organization known as Women in Health Care Management, and a number of smaller, loosely affiliated networks modeled on the A Team. (The network's official name is Group A, with its offshoots bearing other letters.) Today the umbrella group includes some 400 members.
The A Team was, in fact, one of the first of thousands of formal and informal women's networks, in nearly every profession, that appeared by the early 1990's. But in contrast to many networks, which tend to dissipate as the goals and lives of its members change, the A Team has maintained a nearly constant membership for close to two decades. So many women were eager to join, in fact, that early on the network decided to admit only a few new colleagues who came recommended by existing members. And although, over the years, there were slight fluctuations, most of the existing A Team was in place by October 1984, when the network gathered at Ms. Ullian's house.
 
A Sense of Urgency, A Sense of Mission
 The strategy of aiming for the top gave the group a sense of both urgency and mission. "We knew if we didn't initiate an organized approach it would never happen," says Linda Shyavitz, one of the strategy's aggressive champions. By early 1985 the group had already invited several of Boston's leading headhunters to its monthly meetings. Ms. Shyavitz also corralled a small group of A Team members to meet with David Kinzer, then president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association.
Meanwhile, other A Team members fanned out across the state to speak with women executives in other industries, hospital trustees, and more headhunters -- in short, anyone who might help them press their case. The group's ultimate aim was twofold -- to learn more about how to break into the health care power structure and to make their names known at key institutions.
Every time a senior-level job came open, A Team members phoned friends and former associates to recommend colleagues. The first payoff came in mid-1985, after Ms. Ullian and Ms. Kurland phoned some acquaintances at Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, Mass., to recommend Ms. Shyavitz for chief executive. Ms. Shyavitz, who was first approached by Sturdy just two weeks after giving birth to a son, told the search firm to phone back a month later. They did. In the fall of 1985, she became the first A Team member to head a local hospital.
Ms. Shyavitz wasn't alone in the executive suite for long. A few months later, Peter Rabinowitz, one headhunter invited to attend A Team meetings, recommended Ms. Ullian for the top job at Faulkner. To improve Ms. Ullian's chances, Ms. Shyavitz, who had once worked at Faulkner, also plugged Ms. Ullian in with former colleagues. In January 1987, Ms. Ullian, already the mother of two, became the A Team's second chief executive.
As each member wrestled with her individual goals, the group continued to hone its broad strategy. In October 1986, at another meeting at Ms. Ullian's house, Dorothy Puhy, soon to be the group's first chief financial officer, conducted a seminar on analyzing financial statements. "We understood budgets and profit-and-loss statements," Ms. Shyavitz explained. But "many of us were not sufficiently sophisticated in reading hospital financial statements." To help bring the women up to speed, Ms. Puhy passed out the audited statements of the New England Medical Center, where she worked at the time, and went through it line by line. In early 1987, the A Team asked Ms. Puhy, now chief financial officer of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, to offer a follow-up course.
By mid-1987, the focus of A Team gatherings had shifted slightly. Although the group would never veer from its main goal, the meetings were now devoted to a broad range of personal and professional issues that affected its members' day-to-day lives.
In March 1987, the A Team invited Janine Kolis, vice president for human resources at the Harvard Community Health Plan, to share a dinner of Chinese food at the home of Ms. Fenwick, and to talk about executive pay. Although the disparities between men and women are not as great in health care as in other industries, the A Team says, the differences between institutions is enormous. Ms. Kolis's lecture was intended to help members understand the differences in everything from salary to child-care policies at a range of institutions.
By 1988, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's proposals for creating universal health care in Massachusetts had been passed by the legislature and had become the focus for most of the state's health care executives, including those in the A Team. So in June the network invited Patricia McGovern, chairman of the state Senate Ways and Means Committee and a champion of universal health care, to address a breakfast meeting.
In what would be called by many members one of the A Team's most memorable meetings, Ms. McGovern gave an off-the-record, blow-by-blow account of how the health bill had made its way through the legislature. For many women present, the meeting not only underscored the "importance of political alliances" but also gave a revealing look at how one of the state's most powerful politicians had parried a slew of powerful special interests.
Indeed, it was already apparent that the accelerating changes in Massachusetts were creating a host of opportunities. Just as much of the nation's medical establishment was entering a new era of cost containment and competition, Boston faced a large surplus of hospital beds, and this, in turn, created a fiscal crisis for several local institutions. Suddenly, there was demand for a new breed of executive.
 
Credentials to Meet The Changing Needs
 Traditionally, the old-boy network in Boston hospitals was dominated by doctors and career administrators. But now there was a need for executives who both understood strategic planning and were conversant enough in the workings of state government that they could navigate new laws and regulations.
Many of the A Team held credentials that were not only ideally suited for the new environment, but would propel them to powerful health care positions. Ms. Ullian, for example, held jobs in state government, hospital administration, and strategic planning before taking over at Faulkner -- credentials that helped her turn the institution into a model community hospital. During her seven-year tenure, she opened three community health centers, recruited a new team of doctors and established Faulkner as one of the best breast cancer treatment centers in the country.
Her track record caught the attention of Boston Mayor Tom Menino, who calls Ms. Ullian "smart, results-oriented, charismatic -- in short, a natural leader," and who considers her a key adviser on health care. Last year, that reputation helped Ms. Ullian, now 46, get the top job at Boston University Medical Center Hospital, making her the first woman to head a major private university hospital in the Northeast and putting her in charge of restructuring a powerful but debt-ridden and demoralized institution.
Her path was paved, in many respects, by another A Team member, Ms. Kurland, who held one of the most unorthodox resumes in the group, and who, in 1988, at age 43, became the first female Commissioner of Health and Hospitals and chief executive of Boston City Hospital. A graduate of Mount Holyoke, Ms. Kurland held no graduate degree and had worked only about five years in hospital administration before clinching Boston's top health care job.
Through her work in government -- she served as a top aide to the late Tip O'Neill when he was Speaker of the House and chief of staff for former Massachusetts Lieut. Gov. Thomas O'Neill -- and a stint at the New England Medical Center, Ms. Kurland had made a name for herself both as a savvy political operator and management strategist. She had "an amazing grasp of how the health care system works," said Robert Restuccia, who once worked for Ms. Kurland at Boston City Hospital. It was that reputation that won her the job, plus former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn's conviction that Ms. Kurland was one of the few executives with both the skills and the will to rebuild City Hospital -- and she did.
Ms. Kurland, however, never let go of her political convictions, and became such a lightning rod for criticism that in the end the A Team provided one of the few havens from the fray. At a time when many local politicians and executives saw health care as Boston's only growth industry, Ms. Kurland predicted the impending crisis of overcapacity and fought the expansion plans of several leading hospitals, challenging them, instead, to increase community services. Although Mayor Menino praises her as a woman "ahead of her time," Ms. Kurland came under increasing political attack. Then, in 1992, in her fifth year on the job, Ms. Kurland's husband, who had quit working to care for the couple's three children, died of a massive coronary.
As Ms. Kurland coped with her family's grief, her home was filled with A Team members. Ms. Ullian, in particular, fielded phone calls, organized meals, and helped with child care. In the end, Ms. Kurland became convinced that as a single parent she could not remain in a demanding political job. In 1993, she announced that she would not seek another term as commissioner, and she is now a health care consultant.
Indeed, if the A Team was driven by a professional agenda, it was also one of the few places where members could find help juggling work and home life. By the early 1990's, the original mission was basically accomplished, but they now had aging parents and school-age children. As a result, the group was about to experience another transition as members struggled to balance family responsibilities with rising workloads.
In June 1992, during a meeting at Ms. Shyavitz's house, the network tabled its agenda -- handling workplace discrimination -- when three members mentioned that they were having to cope with the terminal illness of a parent. Other members, like Ms. Fenwick, frequently sought advice at meetings on finding new au pairs for her two children.
 
Leisurely Dinners Give Way to Breakfasts
 Even as the members continued looking to one another for personal and professional guidance, there was less time to devote to meetings. The leisurely dinners of the 1980's gave way to breakfast meetings -- although these too were held in members' homes. And although members continue to get together informally, the last full-fledged meeting was held several months ago.
Yet most A Team members insist that the network will never lose its relevance -- noting that it still maintains contact with the few former members who quit because they were transferred out of town. Says Lucy Farmer, a vice president at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge and a founding member: "The A Team is like the priesthood; once you're in, you're never out."

HEADLINE: A Fleet in Decay: A special report.;
New York's Bus Service Worsens With Little Help on the Horizon

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
After 20 years of losing riders, New York City's bus system has sharply deteriorated in quality because the fleet has aged, buses are wearing out and the two manufacturers under contract to provide new machines have failed to deliver, transit officials say.
More than 45 percent of the 3,600 buses in the fleet have now outlived their useful life and should be replaced, officials say. Chronic parts shortages keep buses sidelined for weeks. 
 At the same time, labor strife and sabotage have risen in depots as managers have pressed mechanics to work faster to keep the fleet running. On some lines, particularly in Manhattan and the Bronx, there are not enough buses in good working order to handle the morning rush hour.
For riders, these problems have caused longer waits between buses on some lines or occasional disruptions in service. In interviews, several riders also complained that the buses that do run are often bunched up together, leading to 15-minute gaps in service.
"There seems to be fewer buses every week, every month," said Verna Sabelle, as she shivered against the 26-degree weather last week waiting for the M1 bus on Fifth Avenue. "There are not as many buses as there were a few years ago. And they aren't programmed properly. I see no reason for four or five buses coming at once."
The Transit Authority says the depots still put 98 percent of the required buses on the street most mornings. Once on the road, however, more buses are breaking down. The average distance buses travel between breakdowns has fallen 9 percent in the last year.
A review of logs from a typical week in early December shows that about 8 percent of buses that left depots in Manhattan and 7 percent of Bronx buses experienced mechanical problems once on the road. Those numbers were in sharp contrast to Brooklyn, where about 4 percent broke down, or Queens, where only 1.3 percent had trouble.
The result is fewer buses on the streets. A recent Transit Authority survey of 40 heavily traveled lines suggested that on some lines in Manhattan and the Bronx as many as 1 out of 10 buses did not arrive. The problem worsened during the evening.
"The general view is that the bus service stinks," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a mass transit advocacy group. "The subways are improving and the buses are on a downward spiral."
With service declining, the Transit Authority president, Alan F. Kiepper, has shaken up the management of the bus department. The vice president for buses, Velva Edwards, resigned under pressure two weeks ago.
Ms. Edward's resignation came just 18 months after Mr. Kiepper brought in two operational experts from the subway system, Charles Monheim and Lars Updale, to whip the management of the depots into shape. Since then, three of the five borough managers have been replaced along with several of the 19 depot managers. Mr. Monheim now has been named the acting vice president in charge of buses.
"It's clear the department of buses is not performing at the level that we want it to," Mr. Kiepper said. "We've had significant problems in maintenance. There are management problems as well. I'm not laying it all at the feet of the union."
Labor and management have blamed each other for the slide in service. Managers complain that the union exerts too much control over work in some shops through its control of overtime and by enforcing work rules, and say efficient workers are harassed.
Managers also charge that repairs take too long. For instance, a transmission change takes about 42 hours in most city bus depots, compared with 22 hours in private companies.
This is especially true, transit officials say, in Manhattan and Bronx depots that used to belong to private bus lines before the authority took them over in 1962. The division of the Transport Workers Union that controls those shops has different work rules than Queens and Brooklyn mechanics follow.
"We have capable mechanics," Mr. Monheim said. "The issue is whether they are motivated to give their best effort or whether they feel compelled to operate at half speed or less."
Union leaders, on the other hand, blame management for failing to replenish the fleet with new buses. They also say they lack the proper tools and parts to maintain the older buses and complain that many depots are in abysmal condition. Even two newly constructed depots have design flaws that have made them almost unbearable on hot days.
To union leaders, the recent management efforts to crack down on mechanics has only hurt morale, resulting in lower productivity.
"They are just trying to mandate the times on the jobs without negotiating and that's causing a lot of animosity," said James Hood, vice president of the Transit Workers Union for the Manhattan and Bronx bus services. "They purposely brought in certain types of managers with the idea of breaking the union. Once they did that, the union members got their backs up."
 
Troubled Contractors
A Failure To Deliver
 Labor disputes aside, the major reason bus riders are waiting longer at stops is that transit officials made a serious miscalculation when they went to buy new buses in 1989, 1992 and 1993.
The two manufacturers under contract with the Transit Authority to build buses -- the Transportation Manufacturing Corporation of Roswell, N.M., and Bus Industries of America of Oriskany, N.Y. -- are both in financial trouble and have failed to deliver on contracts, transit officials said.
Most of the fleet was built by T.M.C. in the early 1980's, back when it was a General Motors subsidiary. Since then, the company has shown steady losses and has been sold three times.
In 1989, T.M.C. was the only company whose products had passed a rigorous 10-month road test, qualifying the company to make buses for New York, transit officials said. But in 1992 and 1993, the authority decided to give most of the new orders to Bus Industries of America, a New York State subsidiary of Ontario Bus Industries in Canada. The company makes Orion buses, which also passed the test.
Although the decision seemed good for the state economy, Bus Industries of America took a financial nose dive in 1993 and the company is now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, about 367 new buses that were supposed to arrive in the fall of 1993 were six months late, and another 334 buses that were to be delivered this year have not arrived.
To make matters worse, the buses that have been delivered have developed mechanical problems. The wheelchair lifts on 167 T.M.C. buses bought in 1992 were defective, and have had to be sent back for repairs. The rear-door switches on about 70 of the Orion buses were also faulty.
Transit officials say they had no choice but to contract with T.M.C. and Bus Industries of America because they were the only two companies who had agreed to its road test.
Indeed, few companies want to jump through New York's hoops at a time when the entire industry is in turmoil. Many are unwilling to build buses tough enough to last 12 years on the city's cratered streets.
"If you do business with New York, you go broke," said Dennis Howard, the president of the Gillig Corporation in Lafayette, Calif., a bus maker that has stayed out of the city's market.
Because of the trouble with the contracts, officials said the authority will not require a road test this year. Indeed, transit officials intend to buy about 50 buses from the Flxible Corporation, of Delaware, Ohio, which used to be owned by the Grumman Corporation -- a company essentially frozen out of the New York City market in the early 1980's after a shipment of their buses turned out to be poorly designed.
Meanwhile, the old T.M.C. buses are breaking down more often. More and more buses need new frames, engines, transmissions and differential gears, managers and mechanics said. There are 260 buses waiting for major repairs and at least 80 of those will require structural work.
"The reality is that we have a fleet that should have been replaced and has not been," said Theodore Basta, the Manhattan general manager of the Transit Authority.
With no new bus suppliers in sight, the authority plans to spend $11.4 million this year to rebuild 410 T.M.C. buses that were scheduled to be retired, Mr. Updale said.
 
Labor Relations
Charges And Reprisals
 The union's resistance to work-rule changes has exacerbated the service problems, transit officials say.
Labor tensions rose last year after Mr. Monheim took over and began trying to change some longstanding work practices.
To begin with, Mr. Monheim ended the practice in which depots with bad records fixing buses were able to cover their deficiencies by borrowing buses from better-performing depots.
Mr. Monheim insisted each depot rise or fall on its own. "The policy was we were not going to throw overtime at depots that aren't doing the work," Mr. Monheim said.
Under the previous system, most mechanics expected to receive at least three eight-hour overtime shifts a week, which were doled out by the union leader in the shop, several managers said.
"The union to a great extent ran these shops," said Sonia Maisonet, the Bronx general manager. "If the overtime was not there, they would create the overtime through vandalism, low productivity and high absenteeism."
Union leaders say management's attempts to speed work are laughable since there are still constant shortages of parts and tools. At the Hudson Pier Depot, in Chelsea, for example, 30 mechanics share three air-driven wrenches. And a check of last month's supplies reveals that the Coliseum Depot, in the Bronx, was completely out of 383 different parts.
"If they want to talk industrial standards, they better come up with better conditions," said James Whelan, a union official.
Labor relations in many depots have deteriorated into a game of charge and countercharge. The union has responded to attempts to increase productivity by accusing management of putting unsafe buses on the road and endangering riders to improve performance statistics. Management has accused the union of sabotaging buses and slowing down work to get more overtime.
Saboteurs have struck several times in the last year. In April last year, someone stuffed paper debris in the gas tanks of 28 buses at the 100th Street Depot in Harlem. On Oct. 20, an assistant shop steward was crushed to death at the Fresh Ponds Depot in Queens while trying to slash the air bags in the suspension system of a bus, the transit police said. The union vice chairman in the shop had been suspended two days earlier after fighting with a manager over work rules.
A few days later, someone shorted out the entire electrical systems of three buses in the Amsterdam Depot in Harlem. In early November, at least three buses had their fuel lines punctured at the Hudson Pier Depot a day after a manager had forced mechanics to pick up garbage around a trash compactor, and, on Thanksgiving evening, someone put glue in the fare boxes of about 18 buses at the 100th Street Depot, crippling morning service.
The tensions reached an apex at the Coliseum Depot last summer. A new manager who tried to change the overtime system met with stiff resistance. His office was broken into and a bullet was left on his seat. Later, a union official dismantled a surveillance camera installed after the incident and was suspended for 60 days.
Union officials deny the members are responsible for the sabotage and suggest managers may be doing it to build support for union busting. But managers scoff at that theory, and charge union members are to blame. "Here are demonstrable instances of either extreme actions of God or somebody did something," Mr. Basta said.
So far the vandalism has only disrupted service temporarily on isolated days. As a practical matter, however, the threat of sabotage intimidates managers from pushing the union too hard. Without labor peace, depot managers acknowledge it is impossible for them to get enough buses on the street.
Edward Matalevich, the manager of the Manhattanville Depot in Harlem, summed up his delicate relationship with the union this way: "Technically, the union has no control over the shop. But realistically, they do. They can always get the flu. If you come off full force, like dynamite, as strong as you are, they will throw up a resistance."

HEADLINE: A HOSTILE HOUSE TRAINS ITS SIGHTS ON FUNDS FOR ARTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The National Endowment for the Arts is preparing to fight for survival as House Republican leaders take aim at its budget and challenge its very existence.
The fight, likely to last throughout the year, turns on a fundamental question: What is the appropriate role of the Federal Government in financing arts? 
 "I would argue that it is not within the scope of Washington, not within the scope of the Federal Government, to be involved in funding arts activities around America," said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who is chairman of the Republican conference. "We are out there living high on the hog, funding all of these activities around the country, only to pass the bill on to our kids and grandkids."
House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia; Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and Mr. Boehner have all declared that the Federal Government has no business making grants to artists and arts organizations. Another powerful Republican, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the new party whip, joined them in an unsuccessful vote last year to eliminate all Federal money for the endowment, which has long been a favorite target of conservatives.
Senior members of Congress from both parties say that the budget of the endowment is sure to be cut and that the only question is how much. The budget this year is $167.4 million, down from $170.2 million last year. Artists and arts groups in New York City received $26 million, or 15 percent of the money, last year.
A similar fight looms for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes money to public radio and television stations. Leaders of state and local public television will meet here this week to plan strategy for defending the corporation, which is getting $285.6 million from the Federal Government this year. Mr. Gingrich contends that the corporation, like the endowment, is "eating taxpayers' money" and run by "rich upper-class people."
But the two institutions are very different, and the arts endowment, in political terms, may be more vulnerable than the corporation, whose radio and television programs reach into most homes in the United States.
The National Endowment for the Humanities also faces cuts this year.
By Federal standards, the budget of the arts endowment is small. The endowment, created in 1965, accounts for a tiny portion of all spending on the arts in the United States. Its appropriation is less than the operating budget of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which is $316 million this year. Private giving to the arts exceeds $9 billion a year, according to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, a private group that does annual surveys.
But the endowment is a potent political symbol.
Its defenders, including some Republicans, say that it supports mainstream culture and that its grants work as seed money to promote private-public partnerships. They say its programs help prevent crime, create jobs and combat illiteracy.
Mr. Gingrich, on the other hand, portrays the endowment as a sandbox for the affluent cultural elite.
Mr. Armey said that "the National Endowment for the Arts offends the Constitution of the United States."
In an interview last week on C-Span, Mr. Gingrich said: "I am for the Atlanta Ballet. I'm for the Metropolitan -- maybe the greatest art museum in America -- in New York City. But I'm against self-selected elites using your tax money and my tax money to pay off their friends." He was apparently referring to the system in which panels of artists evaluate applications from other artists seeking grants.
The actress Jane Alexander, who is chairwoman of the endowment, said, "A lot of these people really don't understand what the endowment does."
In an interview, Ms. Alexander said: "The Federal role is small but very vital. We are a stimulus for leveraging state, local and private money. We are a linchpin for the puzzle of arts funding."
Ms. Alexander said she had asked for a meeting with Mr. Gingrich. "It's only fair that he sit down with me and hear directly what we do," she said.
Ronald Feldman, a Manhattan art dealer recently appointed to the National Council on the Arts, which advises the endowment, said the endowment "gives direction, form and focus to arts policy." Groups that receive grants from the endowment must match the Federal money; in some cases they must raise $3 for each Federal dollar.
Officials at the endowment say their grants serve as a seal of approval, making it easier for artists and arts groups to raise money from other sources. Thus, they say, the grants foster the type of public-private partnership that Republicans say they want. Each dollar from the endowment attracts $11 for the arts from state and local agencies, foundations, corporations and other patrons, Federal officials say.
Conservative groups like the Christian Action Network and the American Family Association, led by the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, have long railed against the endowment, asserting that it supports pornographic, blasphemous and offensive art. But those attacks are not the main source of the agency's current problems.
At a recent breakfast meeting with journalists, Mr. Gingrich said: "Performance artists in a free society have the right to do the most extraordinary and bizarre things. That's called freedom of speech. But I don't believe they have a right to subsidized speech. There is no place in the Constitution that says the taxpayers must subsidize the weirdest thing you can imagine.
"This is a matter of practicality. The arts are freer and more able to pursue their own end when they are in fact private rather than bureaucratic and government-controlled."
The endowment, like other Federal agencies, is prohibited from lobbying Congress. But Cherie Simon, a spokeswoman for the endowment, said the agency was planning "a huge education effort," especially on the House side of the Capitol, to explain how it helps deliver the arts to every Congressional district.
The endowment now highlights the educational value of its programs. The basic argument is that Copland is better than cocaine, and Gauguin is better than guns. "A youngster with a paintbrush or learning lines for a play is a lot less dangerous than one with a gun," said Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico.
The American Arts Alliance notes that the Fort Wayne Philharmonic in Indiana has an anti-drug program for children that presents classical musicians as role models. The Seattle Opera offers discussions of opera as part of a rehabilitation program for young inmates.
Legislation to authorize the work of the endowment originates in the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, headed by Representative Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania. In an interview, Mr. Goodling said the question was not whether to reduce spending for the endowment, but how fast to do it.
"I've never been one to wipe out these programs, but I do believe that you have to wean off support," said Mr. Goodling, a former school principal. He would like to see the budget of the endowment reduced in "gradual steps," but he said most of his Republican colleagues favored sharper, more rapid reductions.
In the quest for money, the arts endowment must compete with other programs for which the committee is responsible, like school lunches, child nutrition and education for disadvantaged children. "I have to set priorities," Mr. Goodling said. "We'll probably have to take money from everything. I certainly can't start my cuts with school lunch and child nutrition."
Typically, Congress authorizes programs in one bill and provides money in a separate appropriations bill. The chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the arts endowment, Representative Ralph Regula, Republican of Ohio, said: "I have not been a big fan of the N.E.A. However, in fairness we should recognize the fact that much good is accomplished, and in many communities across this country the N.E.A. funds become the seed money that results in a lot of private contributions."
In the Senate, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, the chairwoman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, has generally supported the endowment, but recently asked Ms. Alexander for suggestions to improve its operations. "The challenge is not to dismantle the N.E.A., but rather to find ways to see it is better managed," the Senator said.

HEADLINE: Consumers Spending Freely, Confident About Their Jobs

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Billy Belford, a nurse's aide in Portland, Ore., has big plans for 1995. Feeling "pretty secure" about his job, Mr. Belford, 22, is ready to spend some money.
"Jan. 20 is payday," he said. "That day I have an appointment to go look at a car." 
 The holiday season might have disappointed many retailers, especially in apparel, who were forced by intense competition and too much inventory to cut prices and profits. But in fact, with incomes, jobs and confidence way up, the American consumer is still going strong.
Cars have been rolling off dealers' lots at the fastest rate since the late 1980's. Chain-store sales during the holiday shopping season were up a solid 5 percent or so from December 1993, even with all the price cutting going on. And total consumer spending rose about 4 percent after inflation last year, faster than in all but two years of the shopaholic 1980's.
"What gives spending some underlying momentum and makes it look solid is that consumers are generally looking toward their communities, jobs and shopping centers and seeing strength," said Richard Curtin, who runs the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumers. Indeed, consumer confidence, which slipped in the middle of the year, wound up as high at the end of 1994 as it was at the beginning, when the University of Michigan index reached a five-year high.
Whether consumers will be able to sustain their current pace for the whole year is a matter of some debate. For one thing, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times last year, and seems ready to do so again at the end of the month. The many shoppers with adjustable-rate mortgages and adjustable-rate credit cards will soon see their interest payments rise as past increases catch up.
The recent pace of spending, faster than the growth of Americans' income, is itself a reason for wondering when consumers will run out of gas. But for now, many Americans seem to have the means and the confidence to keep spending. And is there any reason to think that the brake of higher rates will work more quickly than the accelerator of sharply lower rates did in 1990? Remember, too, that higher interest rates also increase interest income.
Ricardo Gonzalez, 37, a shop steward at a General Motors plant in Detroit, is enjoying a new sense of security with the auto industry's boom. Mr. Gonzalez, who is married and has two children, has worked plenty of overtime. He is now driving a 1995 Cutlass Supreme, is moving into a four-bedroom house that costs four times what his old one is worth and is going to college part time.
Eileen Petriccione, a newly married customer-service agent at DHL Worldwide Express, the courier service, is not the mall regular she once was. She and her new husband, Mike, who live in Mamaroneck, N.Y., went to a pot-luck dinner at a friend's house on New Year's Eve, instead of spending a few hundred dollars at clubs, and she paid for most of her Christmas purchases in cash. Nonetheless, with a secure job and a sparsely furnished apartment, Ms. Petriccione is planning to buy some living-room furniture. Last fall, she and her husband spent $3,500 on a bedroom set.
Barbara Swanson is an artist and mother of two in Manhattan. At Christmas her family acquired electronics, clothes and toys. But even though Ms. Swanson is no impulse buyer -- she had her 20-year-old refrigerator repaired instead of replacing it -- she spent the first week of the new year hunting for a new computer that could play compact disks and provide color graphics.
Consumers are feeling better than they have in years mostly because of an abundance of jobs and greater job security. Job growth was solid all last year, and the unemployment rate is now as low as it has been at any time since the early 1970's. The economy created 3.5 million jobs and the pace, around 275,000 a month, has not really slowed yet. The figures for December, released on Friday, reported a gain of 256,000, after a November increase of nearly 500,000 jobs. And business hiring plans are upbeat.
"The big thing here is that there seems to be a feeling that there's going to be a job tomorrow," said Frank R. Anderson Jr., of Sir Walter Chevrolet in Raleigh, N.C., where the unemployment rate is 3.3 percent. "Even with the higher cost of money, it's an up economy."
All those jobs, plus record factory overtime and modestly rising pay, have pushed up income faster than inflation. After-tax income, after inflation, grew 4 percent in the 12 months ended in November, twice as fast as in 1993. Forecasters expect after-tax income to keep growing this year, even if the tax cuts that politicians have promised do not add many dollars or do not materialize until 1996.
The University of Michigan survey found that while consumers expect interest rates to slow the economy later this year, they do not think this will be enough to raise the unemployment rate. And they are upbeat about the economy five years from now, in contrast to the way they felt looking into the future a few years ago.
Another explanation for the continued strong consumer spending is that awareness of rising interest rates can become a reason to buy -- sending Americans shopping before things become more expensive. That happened in the 1970's, when there were expectations of higher inflation. And it is one reason now, economists say, that the housing market has not yet gone into a swoon.
In the University of Michigan's survey, for example, 26 percent of consumers polled said last month that it was a good time to borrow because rates would go higher; in December 1993, only 6 percent said it was a good time to borrow. In the latest survey, only 20 percent thought rates were too high for a major purchase.
And for all those consumers who want to spend more, getting loans is a breeze right now.
"Banks are throwing money at them," said Donald C. Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University. "At this point, the consumers are willing to spend because there are no financial constraints on them."
All kinds of lenders -- from Citibank to GE Credit to Sears, Roebuck -- are making loans eagerly, and bank analysts see no signs of an impending change of heart. Consumer loans by banks rose 14.4 percent in the 12 months that ended on Sept. 30. Credit card billings have jumped 25 percent in the last 12 months.
Mail Monitor, a newsletter that tracks promotional mailings, says the number of letters offering home equity loans and credit cards topped two billion in 1994, more than twice the 1992 volume.
As households' finances improve and delinquency rates on mortgages and installment credit have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, lots of lenders have raised credit limits for many customers. Many, like Citibank, have also reduced the minimum monthly payments on credit card balances to one-48th of the outstanding balance from one-36th.
The rapid increase in debt in recent months is potentially worrisome. But data gathered by the Federal Reserve on monthly payments suggest that debt payments are not taking as big a bite out of income as in the late 1980's, largely because of the record refinancings at lower interest rates in recent years and the efforts by many Americans to repay debts.
The ratio of payments to income now stands around 15.9 percent, roughly what it was in the mid-1980's, and considerably below the 17.9 percent of 1989.
There are signs that shoppers will not slow down in the coming months.
Take cars. The increases in interest rates have so far added $75 a month to payments on $20,000 trucks, enough to dent buying, one might think. But Ray Green, president of a Chevrolet chain dealership in Jacksonville, Ill., said he expected his 1995 sales to match last year's. The reason: Buyers couldn't get nearly as many trucks as they wanted because G.M.'s production fell far short.
"There's enough pent-up demand out there," he said. "Popular models will be more available and there are lots of new models that people have been waiting for."
If Mr. Green is right, the consumer boom may take a little longer to wind down than many economists have been predicting.
"If we have another great car year, if credit card use keeps rising and if people buy houses with adjustable-rate mortgages with teaser rates, consumers will be not in such a great position in a couple of years," said Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But we're not there yet."

HEADLINE: Peso Crisis Weakens Salinas Bid for International Trade Job

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
As President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon scrambles to overcome Mexico's peso crisis, former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is working hard to salvage his own reputation and his shaky campaign to head the new World Trade Organization.
Mexico's economic problems, caused by an abrupt devaluation of the peso by more than 35 percent just three weeks after Mr. Salinas left office, have cast a shadow over his reputation as an economic magician who transformed the country. They also have raised doubts about whether the economic reforms during the six years of his administration were really as successful as they had been portrayed. 
 Legislators from Mexico's second-largest opposition party say that they will introduce a motion on Monday to bring charges against Mr. Salinas and members of his Cabinet for crimes against the nation. They say he withheld the truth about Mexico's economy to safeguard his chances of being selected to lead the new international organization. However, it is unlikely that a legislature dominated by Mr. Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary Party would ever allow the charges to be filed.
Mr. Salinas has not responded to the accusations, but the leaders of his party have said it is wrong to search for scapegoats now.
Since leaving office on Dec. 1, Mr. Salinas has been campaigning almost nonstop to become the first secretary general of the World Trade Organization, which replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on Jan. 1. Last week he was in Israel, where a Mexico City newspaper tracked him down and tried to get him to talk about the economic problems in Mexico. His only response was, "No comment."
Mr. Salinas was once considered a strong candidate for the trade job, but even before the peso crisis it was widely reported that he had lost considerable ground to Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian Commerce Secretary, who had the support of the European Union and many former European colonies.
The dark-horse candidate, Kim Chul Su, a former Trade Minister of South Korea, was backed by the Asian block, but also had been losing ground. The selection is made by consensus, and the deadlock that developed forced the trade organization to extend the selection process to March 15.
"The possibility of electing any of the three candidates had disappeared even before the events in Mexico," said Isaac Cohen, director of the Washington office of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. "The devaluation was just another nail in the coffin."
Mr. Salinas had the strong backing of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen for the international trade job before he said in early December that he would leave office. However, since the peso crisis developed in mid-December, the United States has not publicly said anything in support of Mr. Salinas.
A Treasury Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the United States had not withdrawn its endorsement, it was not aggressively supporting Mr. Salinas, especially since Mr. Bentsen's replacement, Robert Rubin, has not yet been confirmed.
As angry Mexicans look for someone to blame for the current crisis, Mr. Salinas is being vilified. An attack from the political opposition could have been expected, but increasing numbers of Mexicans are willing to believe that Mr. Salinas manipulated the economy for personal gain. The cover of last week's Proceso news magazine carried a picture of Mr. Salinas with the headline, "The Guilty One."
Some people believe that even President Zedillo, a close friend and ally, tried to blame Mr. Salinas for the economic mess. "Before any concern for the presidential image or the renown of public officials, my commitment is to act responsibly, without evading or trying to conceal reality," Mr. Zedillo said in his speech to the nation on Tuesday.
In Mexican politics, the President always is at center stage. But as soon as he is replaced, his popularity plummets. Mr. Salinas appeared to be an exception.
But since Dec. 21, the day Mr. Zedillo's Government was forced to let the peso float freely against the dollar, Mr. Salinas and his six years in office have been rejudged.
The Mexican Government got into its current economic dead end by allowing imports to far exceed exports and by paying for that imbalance with foreign funds. When these funds dried up, Mexico was no longer able to defend the peso.
"It is very possible that Salinas de Gortari had not wanted to assume the cost of a devaluation in order to, firstly, maintain an impeccable image," wrote Jose Antonio Crespo, a political scientist. "For Salinas, it's always been a lot of work to admit he's made mistakes."
Previous Mexican Presidents have accepted the likelihood that public opinion would turn on them. They have been willing to make politically unpopular moves to protect their successors, who always have come from the same party. President Jose Lopez Portillo, who once vowed to defend the peso "like a dog," ordered a devaluation before leaving office. Mexicans sometimes still mock him by howling when they see him in public.
The selection of the new director of the World Trade Organization, based in Geneva, was supposed to have been completed by Jan. 1. When it was not, the former director of the GATT, Peter Sutherland, was asked to stay on until March 15.
Mr. Zedillo called in Mexico's ambassadors Thursday and instructed them to go all-out to build support for Mr. Salinas. The Mexican strategy is based on the belief that Mr. Kim will drop out of the race, with Mr. Salinas picking up the support of the Asian nations that had lined up behind Mr. Kim. Asian diplomats see that scenario as unlikely, however.
If the World Trade Organization is unable to pick among the current candidates, it could turn to someone not now in the running.
In the meantime, Mr. Salinas continues his campaign. And at least one columnist in Mexico City supports it.
"The support is not so much to get him into the international organization," wrote Fray Bartolome, a pseudonym for the editorial staff of the daily Reforma, "but to keep him out of Mexico."

HEADLINE: Russia, Criticized by West, Defers Exercise With NATO

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Russia has postponed peacekeeping maneuvers it was to hold with NATO next summer near St. Petersburg, German officials said today.
Although Defense Minister Volker Ruhe strongly criticized the "unprecedented brutality" of the Russian attacks against the breakaway southern region of Chechnya, he said the peacekeeping maneuvers and other plans for military cooperation should eventually go ahead. 
 "I am not in favor of breaking off relations with Russia," Mr. Ruhe told the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, "but I am in favor of clearly and openly stating which accords Russia has breached."
He accused Moscow of violating international agreements obliging it to notify neighbors of its deployment of 40,000 troops to Chechnya.
Agreements signed by all the NATO countries and members of the former Warsaw Pact in 1990 and 1992 require them to announce maneuvers of more than 9,000 troops within 72 hours and to invite observers if more than 13,000 are deployed. German officials said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, with headquarters in Vienna, had not received the required notification.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl telephoned President Boris N. Yeltsin on Wednesday to express dismay at the civilian casualties in Grozny, the Chechen capital, but has resisted calls to withdraw support for the Russian, whom most European Governments have considered the best hope for democracy in Moscow.
"We see people suffering, civilians, women and children," Mr. Kohl told a Berlin radio station on Saturday. "We see victims among the soldiers and regard it all as complete madness."
But despite calls by the French Defense Minister, Francois Leotard, and others for economic sanctions against Russia, the German leader said he was against such sanctions. Mr. Kohl, who has repeatedly insisted that Chechnya is an internal Russian affair, said the West should not create the impression that it wanted Russia's disintegration.
The European Union's executive commission in Brussels said on Thursday that it would delay an interim agreement intended to encourage more European trade and investment in Russia because of human rights violations in Chechnya. The 15 member countries of the European Union have called for action on the issue by the 53-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has no power to impose sanctions. The United States has backed the move.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of the security organization, condemned the conflict last week as "a serious threat not only to the security of the Russian Federation but of the whole region and the continent as well."
He called for an immediate stop to the offensive and said he was sending a representative to Moscow on Monday to propose ways the organization could help resolve the crisis.

DOLE AND GORE DIFFER
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (AP) -- President Yeltsin's failure to immediately stop his troops from bombing Chechen civilians raised debate today over who commands Russia's military.
While the White House said Mr. Yeltsin was in control, Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, disagreed. "I think in Chechnya it's pretty obvious either somebody's lying or somebody's not in charge," he said.
Hours earlier, on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Vice President Al Gore expressed concern over the fighting, but said of Mr. Yeltsin, "We believe that he is in control."
In Grozny, mortar and rocket fire continued today, but it was not clear whether the fighter jets in the air over the area actually dropped any bombs. On Friday, Mr. Yeltsin demanded to know why the city was being bombing despite his orders to halt.
"There is a difference between what he said would happen and what he later found out happened," Mr. Gore said.
He called Mr. Yeltsin's televised rebuke of his Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, over the bombings an "unusual episode," but said the Russian President retains a firm grip on the military command.
"I would predict that, in the aftermath of that public confrontation, that he will find a way to remove any doubts about the fact that he is in control," Mr. Gore said.
In an interview with CNN, Mr. Dole said United States support for Yeltsin is eroding "almost on a daily basis" because of the assault on Grozny. "When you're killing innocent civilians, it's not going to sell in this country," he said.

HEADLINE: The Yeltsin Problem

 BODY:
When the Russian Foreign Minister defends Moscow's military assault against the breakaway republic of Chechnya by comparing Boris Yeltsin to Abraham Lincoln, it is clear Moscow is anxious about the small but savage confrontation in the Caucasus. Andrei Kozyrev's desire to make the war more comprehensible to Americans is understandable. Mr. Yeltsin's mishandling of the Chechen rebellion is sure to strengthen those who want to end American assistance and return to a strategy of containing rather than befriending Russia. That would be a mistake, but some recalibration of long-term American policy is warranted.
Recognizing that the brutality of the attack has undermined Mr. Yeltsin, President Clinton has urged him to end the killing of civilians and accept an offer from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to help mediate a political settlement. Moscow should not refuse. Belatedly, Mr. Yeltsin says he is trying to put the military on a tighter leash and end the indiscriminate bombing of Grozny, the Chechen capital. Unfortunately, the army's sledgehammer approach has already dishonored the important principle that Moscow has a right to maintain the cohesion of the Russian federation, and in extreme cases like Chechnya, may use limited military force. 
 But the White House must look beyond the Chechen crisis, for it has altered the political picture in Moscow and Washington. Like Mikhail Gorbachev, who lost political traction at home before he lost his job, and who remained the pivot of American policy toward the Soviet Union long after his leadership had become illusory, Mr. Yeltsin is in trouble before his country or the world is prepared to deal with the consequences. Secretary of State Warren Christopher cannot wish away the problem with expressions of faith in Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin has lost the support of moderate political leaders, narrowed his circle of advisers and shed much of the moral authority he gained in his fight for reform. It is unclear how much control he retains over an army embarrassed by its performance in Chechnya and embittered by a loss of resources and stature. Mr. Yeltsin will find it hard now to rise above the fractious political forces in Moscow. His prospects for re-election in 1996 are declining.
All this makes it essential that Washington have a Russia policy, not a Yeltsin policy. While not writing off Mr. Yeltsin, President Clinton must avoid the sort of bear hug that left President George Bush locked in Mr. Gorbachev's embrace. American policy should be anchored in support of economic, political and military reform in Russia and the institutions and people making it happen. That means reaching out to other democratic leaders like Yegor Gaidar, the former Prime Minister, cementing ties already formed between American and Russian Government agencies, and expanding exchanges between senior military officials.
Cutting off assistance is not in Russian or American interests. Subsidizing the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, one example, is an indispensable investment in post-cold-war security. Congress has appropriated $1.27 billion for that purpose since 1992.
After long delay, the International Monetary Fund is negotiating intensively with Russia about providing $13 billion desperately needed to help stabilize the economy and slow the inflation rate. Delaying or conditioning the aid because of the Chechen conflict may have short-term political appeal; the one sure way to prevent the assistance from indirectly financing the war is to put it on hold. But further delay in helping to shore up the Russian economy would punish the Russian people for Mr. Yeltsin's error. If Mr. Yeltsin is truly committed to making Russia democratic, he must move quickly to end the war in Chechnya.

HEADLINE: President Clinton's Welfare Waffle

 BODY:
Everyone agrees that welfare needs reform; too many programs do far too little to boost recipients toward self-sufficiency. But House Republicans do not just want to reform the system's operation. They seek to demolish the core principle that any American who becomes truly needy is entitled to support.
It is dismaying, but unsurprising, that Speaker Newt Gingrich and his compulsive band of budget cutters would tear up the country's social safety net. The shocker came last week when a timid White House seemed ready to acquiesce. 
 Robert Pear of The Times asked Avis LaVelle, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, whether she would defend the entitlement status of welfare and Medicaid (health insurance for the poor). She answered -- reflecting White House thinking, officials there say -- "No, I can't. . . . It's just not smart for us to take an advocacy position one way or another. The ground is shifting under our feet."
The ground may be shifting. But when important principles are at stake, Presidents are supposed to lead, even if leadership requires digging heels into shifting terrain. The weak-kneed response contrasts sharply with the President's record: he worked to push the laudable 1988 welfare reform bill through Congress and focused his Presidential campaign around a promise of tough but compassionate reform. It would provide up to two years of training, education and child care, but then require able-bodied recipients to find work or take a government job.
What House Republicans propose is an annual national cap on welfare assistance and food stamps: the total amount of welfare money from the Federal Government would be fixed no matter how many applicants would qualify for assistance. Under Republican rules, mothers and children would wait in welfare lines and hope that the money would not run out before their names were called.
Putting annual caps on welfare programs is misguided. For starters, welfare is not draining the Treasury. Cash assistance, food stamps and Medicaid cost less than $150 billion a year; by comparison, two other entitlements -- Social Security and Medicare -- cost nearly $500 billion.
If welfare is lumped in with other discretionary programs, it will shrivel disastrously over time. Even without a balanced budget amendment, total discretionary spending will be held frozen over the next few years; the G.O.P. intends to drive it sharply lower. Congress would almost certainly chop welfare, which has no politically powerful constituency.
Besides cruelty, the proposal would make the economy increasingly vulnerable to recession. Now, as the economy slows and unemployed workers qualify for assistance, government automatically spends more money on welfare. This not only helps the needy but keeps spending levels high. States could pick up where Congress leaves off. But not many states will raise taxes during economic hard times to take care of the poor.
The G.O.P. is right to insist that Congress rethink who should and who should not qualify for welfare. Congress might want to change rules that currently allow upper-income families to play accounting games to trick Medicaid into paying for nursing home care. Congress might want to require able-bodied recipients to work. Washington might want to give states more flexibility to design lower-cost ways to deliver welfare assistance.
Mr. Clinton knows all this. Indeed, he has said as much -- in the past. But now he wants to duck the issue. When Secretary Donna Shalala of Health and Human Services goes to the House this week to testify, she should not be allowed to do the same. Capitol Hill is a perfect place for the Administration to find its political guts.

Yeltsin's Tiananmen

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Which great power is more unsta ble today China or Russia?
The quick answer, of course, is Russia. The elected leader, Boris Yeltsin, is besieged in Moscow after his bloody siege of Grozny, capital of the Connecticut-sized breakaway republic of Chechnya. 
 Russian television showed vivid pictures of the bombing of that city even as it showed Yeltsin saying it wasn't so; then the cameras showed Yeltsin upbraiding his Defense Minister for making him look like a liar.
As Helmut Kohl telephoned to tell him that world opinion frowns on the savage method his Russia Federation is using to preserve its borders, Bill Clinton wrote a "Dear Boris" letter reaffirming support of Federation unity but stressing how "distressed" he is at civilian deaths and suggesting mediation by an organization of 53 nations.
What's Yeltsin to do? The Chechens are dead serious about secession. If Russia lets Chechnya go, other Caucasian dominoes will fall and Moscow will be denied the Caspian oil it needs to rule a hundred nationalities across 11 time zones.
He tried negotiation, which was met by a declaration of independence; he tried an internal coup, which flopped; now he's trying force, which is bringing world obloquy on his head because the Chechens are fiercely fighting for their homeland and the Russian Army has no heart for a lengthy guerrilla battle, especially after its loss in Afghanistan.
All that -- added to Yeltsin's personal punchiness and isolation -- is why Russia appears unstable. We tend to equate the future of democracy with the future of Yeltsin, who is on his last legs.
But consider the political miracle taking place in Moscow today. An unpopular and unjust war is being denounced in the Parliament, with reformer Grigory Yavlinsky openly calling for Yeltsin's resignation. The military is publicly divided between conscience-stricken warriors and hard-line incompetents. Free speech is spilling out all over.
The newspapers, after centuries of czarist and Communist docility, are crusading: a picture of Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is captioned "the most talentless commander in Russia." And the television crews are bringing home the horror of the war just as American cameramen did in Vietnam, with similar impact on Russian public opinion.
This is wonderful. The world should be proud of the Russian people, who should be prouder of themselves for exercising their new-found freedom to debate a great issue.
Contrast that democratic turmoil to the facade of "stability" in China. With the death of Deng Xiaoping imminent, the leadership is cracking down on dissidents.
By jailing its leading independent thinkers, the regime in Beijing reveals its inherent weakness. The new imprisonment of the courageous Wei Jingsheng, China's Sakharov, was the tip-off that the leadership fears a popular uprising, this time led by angry workers rather than idealistic students. As Deng sinks, the number of panicky arrests rises.
This demonstrates again that succession in a Communist state is a ruthless wrestle for power within an impenetrable clique. It mocks the assurances of China's Western apologists that a market economy leads to political freedom.
In a litchi nutshell, here's the play:
Yang Shangkun, an old army leader whose powerful family was neutralized by Deng, is close to Adm. Liu Huaqing, the nation's top military leader. They may challenge Deng's proteges, party boss Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng, by backing economic chief Zhu Rongji or promoting a next-generation politician, Hu Jintao, or by backing Qiao Shi, the former national security adviser and now chairman of the rubber-stamp People's Congress, hereinafter known as "China's Newt Gingrich."
What do 1.2 billion Chinese have to say about all this? Zilch. (Analysts in Beijing, aware of the exclusive accuracy of my prediction of Mao's successor in the 70's, will have to puzzle out "zilch.") And therein lies real instability.
A monolithic, totalitarian state, repressing the spirit of freedom, only seems secure; we have seen how it can suddenly collapse. A noisy, unruly democratic state, drawing on the legitimacy of free elections, is more secure -- no matter how shaky the leadership. That's why Russia is in better political shape than China.

HEADLINE: Stalling on Social Security Makes a Worse Mess;
Seek Cuts Elsewhere

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your chart accompanying "Welfare Debate Will Re-examine Core Assumptions" (front page, Jan. 2) does make Social Security look like a logical candidate for cuts. 
 But if Social Security is a required investment in promised retirement income, then cutting it would be morally reprehensible and tantamount to fraud. This would be criminal behavior if a private organization attempted it.
If, rather, Social Security contributions are a general tax, and benefits are just one of many options for Government, then our country's tax structure is regressive beyond all limits of human reason.
So which is it?
Social Security funds were ruthlessly "borrowed" by Ronald Reagan, when not even the really massive deficits of his years could quite match his lust for armaments.
The deficit over which so many now grieve is a far lower percentage of the gross national product than it was in much of the 1940's and 1950's, when the country prospered, the economy grew, and the real income of workers grew with it.
The need to cut either welfare or promised retirement benefits exists only in the political posturing that is the Willie Horton of the 1990's. If cuts are wanted, one might look in the direction of an arms budget that persists and cries for more, long after the more paranoid minds among us have run out of people to target.

HEADLINE: Stalling on Social Security Makes a Worse Mess

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your Jan. 3 article on House Speaker Newt Gingrich's views on Social Security reform you quote from a C-Span interview in which he acknowledged that the Social Security program will need adjustments to remain solvent and prevent larger budget deficits. This is a welcome change of heart for Mr. Gingrich, who, with fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, effectively put Social Security reform off the table during the 1994 campaign. 
 The problem lies in Mr. Gingrich's timetable. He says re-examination of Social Security must be delayed until early in the next century and cites "a lack of moral authority" in the current generation of politicians as the principal reason for delay.
Social Security is a politically volatile subject that many politicians dare not honestly confront, despite the obvious burden these expenditures place on the budget and on future generations. But in not addressing the issue now, our leaders contribute to a self-fulfilling prophesy about lack of moral authority.
Our elected officials must face up to our entitlements crisis without delay, for we will pay dearly for inaction. Look at the numbers:
* Entitlement programs and interest on the debt consume more than 60 percent of the budget. In 2012, spending on entitlements and the national debt will exceed tax revenues, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. America will be broke.
* Federal outlays are 22 percent of the economy, and revenues are 19 percent. By 2030, outlays are projected to exceed 37 percent of the economy. The same year, spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Federal employee pension programs will exceed all revenues.
* In 2013, Social Security (the largest entitlement) benefit payments will exceed taxes collected to pay for the program. Contrary to popular wisdom, Social Security has always been a pay-as-you-go system, which means today's workers are paying the retirement benefits of people who are retired today.
* By 2029, the Social Security trust fund will have been used up because of radical demographic changes. When Social Security was created, there were 17 people working for every person who was retired and receiving benefits. Today there are only 3.8 working people for every retired person receiving benefits.
When Social Security was conceived, average life expectancy was just 63 years, yet people did not become eligible for benefits until they turned 65. Today, the average life span is 77 years, with Social Security eligibility at 67. This means more people receive benefits paid for by fewer workers, and for much longer periods than before.
It is self-defeating to wait until the next century to address the complicated and explosive issue of Social Security reform. By then, our nation will not possess the resources to meet the challenge equitably. The time to start making tough choices is now.

HEADLINE: For Whitman, A Political Star Adding Luster

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Wedged between Alexander and Kemp and only coincidentally to the left of Dole and Gramm, buttons touting Gov. Christine Todd Whitman for President are doing a brisk business this year at Political Americana, a Washington store that sells Presidential political memorabilia.
"Whitman is in with the pack," says Jimmy Warlick, the president of Political Americana and an amateur political prognosticator who has built his business largely around predicting who is politically hot with the public and who is not. "Right now, Governor Whitman is doing very well. Her buttons are selling good. It's hard to tell whether people are buying them because they view her as a potential Presidential candidate or as a Vice-Presidential candidate, but they are buying them." 
 In the year since Mrs. Whitman took office -- the first woman to run New Jersey's government -- and even before she gives her first State of the State speech on Tuesday, she has skyrocketed to national political stardom.
And while she is quite popular in her home state, she has also worked very hard positioning herself as a national player politically. She went around the country campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates, with the trips paid for in part by her own state's party. These trips garnered Mrs. Whitman a tremendous amount of national media attention.
She sent her State Commissioner of Commerce all over the world in 1994 and has her own plans to visit Canada and Mexico this year, setting the stage for the kind of international exposure that a national candidate needs. Today, Newt Gingrich, the new House Speaker, praised her as a model of leadership for the new Congress. And though she and a key adviser, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., the publisher and longtime champion of tax cutting, are coy about it, other political observers believe that Mrs. Whitman is moving herself toward the national political stage.
"Everybody knows she has certainly been preening herself for national office," said Gary Nordlinger, president of Nordlinger Associates, a Washington-based political consultancy that works with Democratic Party candidates.
"She has given speeches all over the place to Republican groups," Mr. Nordlinger said, "and she has campaigned across the country for Republican candidates in the off-year election this year, which are all the traditional signs for people who want national attention."
So far, whenever the subject of national office arises -- particularly the picture of Mrs. Whitman as an attractive Vice-Presidential choice -- she has responded with the politically obligatory brushoff.
"I'm tired of it," Mrs. Whitman said. "It's hard for some people to understand that I just don't pay a whole lot of attention to it because to me it's so silly, it's so outside the realm of possibility that it's not something that you should waste time thinking about it."
But, still, she leaves the door ajar.
"My brother keeps getting on me, saying you have to believe you can be a good governor to be governor," she said. "I hope I can be a very good governor for the state of New Jersey. Does that necessarily translate into doing something on the national scene? Well?"
The national political scene has long been on the mind of Mr. Forbes, even before he agreed to lead an economic advisory group for her 1993 campaign. He is chairman of Empower America, a Washington group affiliated with, among others, Mr. Gingrich.
The friendship and political bond between Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Forbes goes back to their childhood, when their wealthy families, both with deep Republican Party roots, were neighbors. Those ties have since grown considerably more sophisticated. Over the years, Mr. Forbes has sidestepped elected politics for himself and has instead been content to play an unofficial but nevertheless very influential role in the political fortunes of Mrs. Whitman and others.
In November, after Mrs. Whitman gave a showcase speech at the Republican Governors Association meeting in Williamsburg, Va., Mr. Forbes followed her to the stage to deliver a speech of his own.
But Mr. Forbes says the Governor is not consumed by national political ambitions.
"Whatever she may think in her mind, Christie has not put the buzz out, she has not called me up and said, 'How should I position myself?' " Mr. Forbes said.
"I imagine Phil Gramm, Lamar Alexander and others have been saying very nice things to her," Mr. Forbes said. "That's part of the mating dance. If you are not carrying the plague, outsiders will say nice things about you if they want your support. The question is who is going to get the ring in the morning, and you really can't tell at this point."
That has not stopped Mr. Forbes from offering Mrs. Whitman advice on the broader points of politics while pointing out where others, most notably George Bush, have failed.
"One of the arguments that really impressed her was that she had to have her own agenda, that if she just won the election without an agenda, she would be cut to pieces," Mr. Forbes said.
An important part of that agenda, co-written by Mr. Forbes, has been a tax-cutting program that has been Mrs. Whitman's springboard to the national political scene. She has also positioned herself at the forefront of the debate over abortion, where her stance is in favor of abortion rights, and she supports changes in the welfare system. And today she was in Washington with fellow Republican governors pressing for action on two constitutional amendments: one requiring a balanced budget and another prohibiting the Federal Government from passing mandates on to the states without coming up with the money to pay for them.
"If the price that I have to pay to finally stop all this speculation," Governor Whitman said in a recent interview, "is to stop doing things that I think are right for New Jersey and not speak out on some of the major issues, I'm not willing to pay that price."
The New Jersey Republican Party was willing to pay the price for many of Mrs. Whitman's 1994 campaign trips for Republican candidates outside New Jersey. Why?
"What the Governor wants, the Governor gets," a senior party official said.
From Rhode Island to California, Mrs. Whitman campaigned for 22 Republican candidates for major office and raised $3.5 million for their races -- collecting a wealth of political i.o.u.'s and political exposure along the way. And on Election Day, 18 of her candidates won, including George E. Pataki in New York and John G. Rowland in Connecticut.
Mrs. Whitman has also pursued an aggressive campaign to make New Jersey what she calls "business friendly." Not coincidentally, senior officials in the State Commerce Department say, the effort may also be opening the way for her to speak out on foreign affairs. Her Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, Gualberto Medina, has made a string of trips to Mexico, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain and Russia -- and State Commerce Department officials speculate that besides courting trade, he may be paving the way for visits by Mrs. Whitman.
Mrs. Whitman has already said she will visit Canada and Mexico in 1995 as the head of a state trade mission to expand business under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
"Nobody runs for Vice President," said Mr. Nordlinger, the Democratic political consultant. "But if you rattled off a half-dozen people who would be good Vice-Presidential candidates, Whitman would be on the list. But those decisions are 18 months away. Whatever her long-term future is will depend on how she will wear on the people of New Jersey."
So far, Mrs. Whitman is wearing extremely well with the majority of New Jersey residents and with a host of Republicans who have at least considered the idea of running for President.
Both Bob Dole, now the Senate majority leader, and Jack F. Kemp, the former Federal Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, made sure that their campaign trips to New Jersey during last year's United States Senate race included a courtesy visit with Mrs. Whitman. Mr. Alexander, the former Tennessee Governor, former United States Cabinet member and Presidential hopeful, has also visited the State House in Trenton.
Even for a politician, Mrs. Whitman has enjoyed a year of an almost embarrassing richness of attention.
Newsweek magazine listed the New Jersey Governor as one of the six most influential Republicans in the nation. (The others were Mr. Dole; Mr. Gingrich; Rush Limbaugh, the talk-show host and author; William Kristol, the Republican strategist who was chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle, and Ralph Reed, leader of the Christian Coalition.)
People magazine called Mrs. Whitman one of the 25 most intriguing people of 1994.
And then there are Mr. Warlick's buttons.
"My theory is when you do a telephone poll with voters, people might not be so straightforward," said Mr. Warlick, who has conducted a button poll among customers at his Political Americana stores during the last two Presidential elections, coming within 2 percent of the margin of Bill Clinton's victory in 1992. "But when people put three dollars down for a button, they are not apathetic."
Right now, Mr. Warlick said, Mr. Alexander's buttons are the hottest, while sales of Mr. Dole's buttons have been steady.
"Kemp has dipped," he said. "Whitman is the only woman in the pack and she is doing well."

HEADLINE: Group Homes, Havens for the Mentally Ill, Fight Mistrust

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SOMERS, N.Y.

 BODY:
The smell of ashes still lingers over a placid country road here seven weeks after someone set fire to a driftwood-gray house chosen as a home for 12 mentally ill men.
The fire in November at 6 Manor Lane, which authorities have ruled an arson, staggered residents, even those opposed to the arrival of the men. 
 William C. Harding, the Town Supervisor, said he told opponents of the home, "You've got bigger problems than you had before." He continued, "You now have someone who's crazy enough to set a house on fire."
But ultimately the arson has not changed many feelings in Somers, a northern Westchester County town, not even Mr. Harding's.
In December, two weeks after the fire, more than 100 residents crowded into Town Hall to protest the proposed group home. Two days later, the town board, including Mr. Harding, voted unanimously to ask the sponsoring agency, Rehabilitation Support Services, to delay the project until another site in Somers could be found. A hearing is now likely before the State Mental Health Commissioner.
For more than a decade, state-financed group homes -- ordinary houses with a dozen or so residents and 24-hour staffing -- have formed the heart of the state's effort to treat the mentally ill outside the locked wards of mammoth hospitals. In New York State, more people now live in group homes and supervised apartments (13,575) than in mental hospitals (9,075). The reason is as much financial as anything else. The yearly cost of keeping a patient in a group home is about $35,000, compared with $120,000 for hospitalization.
But as the battle in Somers and similar ones in the Westchester towns of Greenburgh and Mount Pleasant testify, the coming of a group home is not yet taken as nonchalantly as the arrival of a new neighbor. Indeed, there have been a half dozen cases of arson associated with group homes on Long Island alone in the last decade. As a result, state and county officials are increasingly reluctant to finance group homes.
[The arrest of a mentally ill New York City man who had escaped from a state hospital and was then charged with pushing a woman to her death under a subway train on Jan. 4 provided new ammunition for those who oppose such homes. But advocates for the mentally ill say group homes do not accept violent felons. They also say the incident points out the needs for more such intensively supervised community programs that monitor residents' medication and condition.]
In December 1993, the State Legislature allocated $153 million of the savings from hospital-bed closings for psychological and social support for people in group homes and apartments. But none of this so-called "reinvestment" money was earmarked for new group homes. Group-home operators say the decision was a concession to the political reality that opening group homes is more difficult than dispersing the mentally ill in apartments.
The problem with the apartment approach, said Dr. Peter Campanelli, president of Institute for Community Living, a group-home operator, is that "not everybody is ready to live in an apartment." Many require the daily supervision available in a group home, he indicated.
Whenever the site of a group home is chosen, neighbors have expressed fears about violent encounters or worries about finding buyers for their own houses. A woman who three years ago opposed a group home near her house in Yorktown admits there have been no problems, but she is still concerned.
"Maybe it's selfish to worry about property values, but we don't have much else," she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "This is where our money is."
Group home residents are familiar with such opposition. The 12 men waiting to move into the Somers house have been living since 1988 in a spacious hilltop mansion called Pleasant Ridge in Wingdale, N.Y. -- 45 miles north of New York City -- that used to house the director of the nearby Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center. The hospital was shuttered in February, and the group home is being closed since the residents no longer have easy access to the services once available at the hospital.
"The whole thing is an outrage," said one of the men, Rich, 32, a former Larchmont resident, who Rehabilitation Support Services insisted could not be completely identified. "I understand that economically they're afraid of being hurt, that their property values will go down. We live in a house right now that has great value. If you walk around the house, you'll see nothing misplaced. Great care is taken and we choose to live here."
The men all have what they call the "double trouble" of histories of drug or alcohol abuse on top of manic depression or other mental illnesses that they temper with medication. But none has a history of violent crimes and there have been no violent episodes, said Carol Bianco, director of program development for Rehabilitation Support Services.
Several men work part time, and all spend part of their days at drug and alcohol treatment programs, at therapy or at a social center. They divide cooking and cleaning chores. The home has a staff of nine counselors and social workers.
Rich is pursuing a master's degree in social work at New York University. Before his mental illness was diagnosed, he graduated from Iona College and owned a limousine business. "I was having lots of problems inside," he said. "I got a lot of money and proceeded to put that money into heroin."
The men take vacations together and last summer rented a house in Ocean City, N.J., where, Rich said, "We cooked hamburgers and hot dogs like everyone else." Sometimes, the men say, personal problems lead to relapses into drinking or drugs. But the staff and their fellow residents, they say, are teaching them to avoid such setbacks.
"I always thought I'd be able to make it, but I didn't have the skills," said another resident, Michael, 34, of Mount Vernon. "You come into this house, you learn how to cook, how to clean, how to keep yourself presentable. I never knew how to do any of that. I was always running the street."
The 12-room, $510,000 house in Somers where these residents still expect to live is much like any of the other older homes on Manor Lane. It is in a bucolic section of Somers, a middle-class town of 18,000 just a generation removed from its blue-collar roots.
"It's a back street full of houses where folks have scrimped and saved their entire life to move into a beautiful, expensive house, and they're concerned that this doesn't fit with the character of their homes," said Mr. Harding, the supervisor.
On Nov. 22, a week after Rehabilitation Support Services notified town officials of its plans for a home, someone broke into 6 Manor Lane and poured a kerosene-like accelerant near the back door and staircase, then lighted a match. The walls were severely damaged and the floor is still blackened with ash, but the structural beams are intact, and the state has pledged to finance the necessary repairs.
More than a week after the fire, someone invaded the house once more and stole its furnace and water heater. No arrests have been made.
"I'm embarrassed to admit that this would happen in Somers," Mr. Harding said. But, he added, "It does not mitigate the fears and concerns of people on Manor Lane."
Richard Taylor, an electrician who lives next to 6 Manor Lane, accuses Rehabilitation Support Services of pushing ahead without sufficiently telling the town about the psychiatric and criminal backgrounds of residents and the training of the staff. He said he worried that an untrained worker assigned alone at night would not be able to deal with quirks in the behavior of a former drug addict or alcoholic.
"If this was a home for autistic children, I'd be there swinging a hammer," he said. "But they're ramming it down our throats without giving us the answers to our questions."
Mr. Harding and Mr. Taylor have both visited Pleasant Ridge to see their prospective neighbors, and Mr. Harding said he was impressed with the residents' struggle to resume industrious lives. He particularly enjoyed meeting a resident named George who had attended his alma mater, Marist College in Poughkeepsie. George reminded him that there was a mental hospital next door to Marist and the campus joke was that if things got out of hand, that's where students would end up.
"I did," George said.
Not every neighbor on Manor Lane is adamantly opposed. A woman who lives a few doors away, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she had two small daughters and only wanted to be assured that no one had a "background of hurting children." But she is familiar with mental illness because her husband's brother has lived in a group home and, she said, "He's a sweetheart. He wouldn't hurt anyone."
Steven Greenfield, executive director of the Association of Community Living, an organization of group-home operators, said that in six years there have been two murders involving the 15,000 people who have passed through group homes in New York State. In one case the victim was a staff member, in the other a resident. He also pointed to several studies that found property values did not decline after a group home opens in a neighborhood.
"The people with mental illness are no more violent that the rest of the population and, in fact, tend to be more victims than victimizers," he said.
When a state hearing is held, Mr. Harding says the town will argue that it has enough institutional housing, with four group homes for the retarded and a residence for youthful offenders. That is the only argument that can block a group home. Rehabilitation Support Services vows it will not be turned back.
"It's an act of terrorism against a group of individuals," said Bill Schwarz, a spokesman for the organization. "A crime has been committed here and it would send a dangerous precedent if we didn't move forward."

Tourism

 BODY:
Tourism accounts for more than $20 billion in economic activity each year, and spending by visitors generated about 268,000 jobs in the region in 1992, according to a study released last month by the Port Authority. The report is the second part of the Port Authority's study of the economic impact of the arts and tourism on the New York-New Jersey region. While tourism in the area is expected to continue to grow, the region is facing increasing competition for visitors.
Promotion seems to be helping in the tourism industry. The state travel office budgets in New York and New Jersey for fiscal 1992-93 were $11 million and $5 million. Visitor spending in 1992 generated tax revenues of $630 million in New York and $130 million in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Modest Rally Seen for Dollar in '95

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
After a year of unexpected weakness, the dollar is set to appreciate modestly against other major currencies this year, in the view of many bankers and economists. The rally, they say, will be helped by the expectation of a narrowing United States trade deficit and pledges by the Republicans controlling Congress to start slaughtering sacred budget cows.
But in an age of global capital flows where the bias is still against the dollar, the American currency is not set to regain the strength it showed in the 1980's, when it reached 277.65 yen and 3.4525 marks to the dollar, or even the modestly bullish values at the beginning of the 1990's, when the dollar reached 159.90 yen and 1.8350 marks. 
 "The dollar remains structurally weak," said Robert D. Hormats of Goldman, Sachs International, pointing to America's history of persistent trade deficits that keep dollars pouring out of the country as imports of foreign goods exceed exports of American products. American investors are also discovering the allure of markets abroad and selling dollars to buy foreign currencies, stocks and bonds.
At the end of last week, the dollar was at 101.37 yen to the dollar, up from 99.58 at the end of 1994 and its highest New York close since August. Against the mark, the dollar was at 1.5650, up from 1.5495 at the end of last year but below its recent high of 1.5814 on Dec. 21.
A rise in the dollar would have varying effects. For the Federal Reserve, it could reduce inflationary pressures as foreign goods become less expensive and American producers hold back some price increases of their own to remain competitive. Trips abroad would be less expensive for American tourists.
On the other hand, American exports would be a little more expensive -- and a little less competitive -- abroad. But because the dollar is rising from record low levels, the impact should not be that severe.
The widespread expectation now is that as the Federal Reserve continues to raise short-term interest rates in 1995, foreign investors should find the dollar more attractive. In addition, imports will slow and exports pick up as the European and Japanese recoveries gather steam.
This will reduce America's current account deficit -- the balance of its trade and investment income flows with the rest of the world -- and strengthen the dollar.
The financial crisis in Mexico may also give the dollar a bit of help in coming weeks if it slows the flow of American investment into other emerging markets around the world.
"Eventually, additional Fed tightening moves, moderating inflation concerns, improving trade performance and a new decline in long-term U.S. bond yields should provide the U.S. currency with a modest lift versus European currencies and the yen," says Solomon Brothers chief economist, John Lipsky.
It is anyone's guess how far the Republican majority in Congress will go in carrying out the pledge it made in its "Contract with America" to cut the Federal budget deficit significantly while reducing taxes and increasing military spending.
But anything they do this year to start bringing down that deficit in 1996 "should have an immediate good expectational effect on the dollar," said Mr. Lipsky, who expects to see the dollar trading by year-end around 1.60 marks to the dollar and 108 to 110 yen.
A year ago most experts believed 1994 would see a rising dollar as the American economy cooled and there was a rise in exports to a recovering Europe and Japan, narrowing the trade gap. At the same time, Japan would continue to invest its export surplus in dollar securities. "That was definitely the consensus, but it never happened," said Stephen Roach, co-director of global economy at Morgan Stanley.
The American economy kept growing more vigorously than expected while the Japanese virtually stopped buying American securities altogether as the dollar sank to a record low against the yen.
From being worth 1.76 German marks and 113 Japanese yen at its 1994 high early last year, the dollar declined to a low for the year of 1.4909 marks and 96.61 in the fall before turning up a little at the end of the year. For 1994 as a whole, the dollar fell by 10.9 percent against the mark and 11 percent against the yen.
For many market watchers that late-year uptick in the dollar's fortunes was significant because it appeared to reflect the Republican election victory and the Federal Reserve's unexpectedly sharp monetary tightening in November, the two basic reasons for anticipating a stronger dollar in 1995.
"The Fed tightening and the Congressional elections had a good influence on foreign confidence," notes Mickey Levy, chief economist with Nationsbank Capital Markets Inc.
How far and how fast the current account deficit will contract remains a matter of some dispute, raising doubts as to exactly when the dollar will move unambiguously onto a firmer track.
As economies strengthen in Europe and Japan while the American economy slows, Robert Solomon, a former chief international economist at the Federal Reserve and now with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that he expected a "considerable improvement" in the current account deficit, predicting that it could fall to "well below $100 billion" from $138 billion last year. This would slow the dollar outflow and help bolster the dollar.
But David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, believes full order books will send American imports soaring this year, pushing the deficit on foreign trade alone up from $157 billion in 1994 to $200 billion this year, with a decrease coming only in 1996.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based club of rich industrial nations, sees even larger numbers in its latest forecasts published in December. These show the current account deficit rising to $173 billion this year and only slipping back marginally to $169 billion in 1996.
The key to a dollar revival, many experts say, will be a sense in financial markets that the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy enough to lower economic growth to the Fed's target range of around 2.5 percent and that the next move in American interest rates will be downward.
"The bond market is the best bellwether for the dollar" said Geoffrey Bell of Geoffrey Bell & Company, a New York investment advisory firm. "Fund managers are interested in total returns, not yields. When bond prices are weak, they keep away from that currency. But when interest rates turn down, you'll see investors piling into the dollar."

HEADLINE: A Personal 'Chronicler' for Newt Gingrich

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
In appointing an outspoken political supporter and former colleague from Georgia as the new House historian, Newt Gingrich is also gaining something no Speaker has ever had -- a personal "chronicler."
The new historian, 47-year-old Christina Jeffrey, an assistant professor of political science at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, where Mr. Gingrich once taught, said that her husband, Robert, also a professor from Georgia, would be "chronicling the Speaker and doing for the Republicans what academics did for F.D.R." 
 "It hasn't been done as well by Republicans and has never been done on a day-to-day basis for a Speaker," she said, "and Newt is very interested in that."
She said her husband, an assistant professor of political science at Dalton College in Georgia, would work without a salary. "This is an economy move for the House," said Mrs. Jeffrey, who will make $ 85,000 a year. "They are getting two academics for the price of one."
Nonetheless, the new House historian said today in a telephone interview that while she was an avid supporter of Mr. Gingrich, she would run the historian's office in a bipartisan manner.
Mrs. Jeffrey was actually named House historian by Mr. Gingrich in mid-December, but her appointment was never officially announced and did not become public until a few days ago.
Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, said the husband-and-wife team "raises all the questions about a Gingrich machine being lodged in the House."
"I look in amazement at how effective he has been and see the extraordinary transition he has led, and then I get disappointed in his lapse in judgment," Mr. Mann said. "This is a very questionable appointment."
The dispute over the historian's office comes just as criticism was subsiding over a $ 4.5 million advance that Mr. Gingrich had planned to accept for writing two books. Under pressure, Mr. Gingrich backed off the book deal, announcing that he would instead accept only a $ 1 advance, plus royalties, for the books.
The status of the historian's office has been shrouded in confusion since the week after Christmas, when its ousted employees said that the office had been abolished in an economy move by the new Republican majority and that they were packing their belongings.
But in an interview with C-Span that was recorded Dec. 30 and broadcast on Jan. 2, Mr. Gingrich said the office had not been abolished. "There will be an Historian's Office," he said, and he wanted it to help educate the public about the House. He did not mention that he had already appointed a supporter of his as the historian and that she and her husband had already rented a town house in suburban Washington.
Mrs. Jeffrey said today that as a political scientist at Kennesaw, situated in Mr. Gingrich's Congressional district north of Atlanta, she had supplied student interns for his district office. But she did not come to know him, she said, until he began teaching his course, "Renewing American Civilization," at the college in 1993.
While other professors opposed allowing a highly partisan elected official like Mr. Gingrich to teach at a publicly financed college, Mrs. Jeffrey supported him. "I like Newt's ideas," she said.
Mrs. Jeffrey said today: "I stood up for academic freedom and freedom of speech. The people involved in that controversy admitted the problem was Newt and his ideas. It would have been no problem if it was Sam Nunn. This was content-specific."
The course was financed by the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a conservative research organization started by a longtime associate of Mr. Gingrich, and had links to his political action committee, Gopac, which in the past kept its donors secret. The course and its financing are now being reviewed by the House ethics committee.
Mrs. Jeffrey said she believed in secret campaign financing because it protected contributors from revenge by incumbents. "I believe in leveling the playing field," she said. "I think incumbents have an unfair advantage, and that includes Newt Gingrich, and the disclosure laws increase that advantage.
"If I understand Gopac," she added, "it's a way of getting around the campaign finance disclosure laws so people can contribute to challengers and they aren't necessarily identified as an enemy of the incumbent. I would support doing away with most campaign finance disclosure laws."
She stated similar views in a letter to The Atlanta Constitution last fall, and that opinion is one of the reasons the appointment is already drawing criticism on Capitol Hill. Representative David E. Bonior, a Michigan Democrat who is now the minority whip, said it showed "poor judgment." Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, called it "tacky." Mr. Gingrich could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Mrs. Jeffrey received her master's degree and doctorate in political science at the University of Alabama.
She said she agreed completely with Mr. Gingrich's ideas for the office.
"Considering what the Speaker wants to do with the job," Mrs. Jeffrey said today, "I think I'm a perfectly logical person to do it. As a political scientist, I don't have any problem with patronage, as long as people are qualified, and elected officials ought to appoint people who share their vision, and I certainly fit that description."

HEADLINE: 2 Parties Do Balancing Acts on Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The new leader of the Senate's 47 Democrats said today that he was "absolutely" willing to make a detailed proposal to balance the Federal budget by 2002, just as his party's leaders are demanding of Congress's new Republican majority.
Still, the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, did not say he would actually do so. Instead, he and other Democrats indicated that they would not offer any budget-balancing plan until Republicans did. 
 And Republicans indicated that they would not present their own plan to erase the deficit -- at least not until Congress passed a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget, and perhaps not even then.
With some variations, this is pretty much what Republicans and Democrats have said in debates about the steadily growing Federal debt for close to a decade. Mr. Daschle and other leaders of both parties said it again in interviews on television news programs today, but it is more important now because a balanced-budget amendment may well pass Congress this year.
If so, one side or the other, or both, will either have to make good on its promises or find a way around them.
The White House says that the deficit has fallen from the $ 305 billion a year projected when Mr. Clinton took office to an estimated $ 203 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September, largely because of a growing economy and the $ 450 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases that Congress enacted in 1993. But without further restraints, fiscal experts say, the deficit will resume its rise in 1996.
The comments by Mr. Daschle today were notable because he is the sole Democrat in the party's leadership who supports a balanced-budget amendment, and who voted for one in the Senate last March. President Clinton and the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, have argued that an amendment with a specific deadline for wiping out the deficit could lead to drastic cuts in programs that millions of Americans need.
Mr. Gephardt called the amendment "a pig in a poke" last week, arguing that it was irresponsible for Republicans to promote a balanced-budget amendment without telling citizens what painful spending cuts would be needed to achieve that goal.
Today, on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Daschle was asked several times whether, as a supporter of a balanced-budget amendment, he was willing to offer the same kind of plan to end the deficit by 2002 that the White House is demanding of Republicans.
"Absolutely," he said. "Ask the Republicans if they're willing to join us."
Asked what that plan would include, Mr. Daschle replied, "We are willing to put that on paper; we're willing to work with them to make sure that it happens." But he then accused Republicans of "flipping around like fish on a deck right now, not willing to be specific with regard to how they're going to do it." He did not return to the subject of his own deficit-cutting plans.
Speaking on the same program, Mr. Gephardt said moments later: "Tom is willing to do that. We agree on how this should be done. People have a right to know in the country what this means in their life."
But Mr. Gephardt did not say when or how Mr. Daschle would offer such a plan, either.
For their part, Republicans who appeared on television today were little more specific.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority whip, said Congress would receive a Republican proposal this spring to cut $ 300 billion to $ 350 billion from the deficit over the next five years, a figure he called "a real serious down payment" on the deficit problem.
But by some reckoning, it will require much more -- $ 1.1 trillion in spending cuts or tax increases, or both -- to balance the budget in the seven years that most proposals for a constitutional amendment envision.
Mr. Lott and other Republicans, like Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who appeared today on the ABC News program "This Week," suggested some ways to come up with part of that money. Those tactics included proposals from Republican governors that Mr. Lott said could save $ 147 billion over five years, and a suggestion by Mr. Gramm that the Education Department be abolished and half of its budget given back to the states.
But when Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, was asked whether a realistic balanced-budget plan would demand deep cuts in most agencies and programs, he replied: "Well, there's all kinds of complexities because we haven't divested ourselves yet from the mythology of what is called current services baseline budgeting. So what's a cut? I'd have to ask that question."
Mr. Armey also said Republicans were unlikely to offer a specific plan for erasing the deficit until after the amendment was considered, because offering a plan first would cause too many political problems.
In a separate development, both Mr. Gephardt and Vice President Al Gore -- who appeared on the CBS program "Face the Nation" -- voiced strong support for an increase in the minimum wage. But Mr. Gore said the President has yet to decide what to do. Mr. Clinton is reported to be considering increasing the $ 4.25-an-hour wage floor by $ 1.
"It's farther behind reality than it's been in 20 years," he said, "so there's a very strong argument for it. And I think there's a consensus building in the country."
Back on NBC, the wage proposal led to a brief but intense debate between Mr. Gephardt, who called it a just reward for millions of hard-working people, and Mr. Armey, who asserted that it was a vote-getting stunt at odds with good economic policy.
"What they're saying," Mr. Gephardt said of the Republicans, "is that people that work at Wal-Mart and McDonald's should not get any increase in the minimum wage."
"Dick, you're in a state of denial," Mr. Armey responded.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 1995, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about Congressional debate over a balanced-budget amendment misstated the extent of its support among Democrats. While Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader, supports such an amendment, he is not alone. Others, including Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, agree with him.

HEADLINE: A Retreat on Denying Welfare to Immigrants

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
House Speaker Newt Gingrich today backed away from his party's plan to deny food, health and welfare benefits to hundreds of thousands of low-income immigrants who are in the country legally.
He said Republicans would "revisit" the plan to drop legal immigrants from welfare rolls, but said sponsors "should take a fairly significant responsibility" for the immigrants they bring to the United States. 
 "I think legal immigration has given America many of its most dynamic and creative citizens," Mr. Gingrich said at a news conference to promote the restaurant industry's role in welfare change, "and I think that we would be a very, very self-destructive country if we sent negative signals on legal immigration."
As he spoke, Mr. Gingrich was surrounded by restaurant managers, chefs, owners and corporate officials who began their careers washing dishes, sweeping floors and making salads.
Herman Cain, president of the National Restaurant Association and Godfather's Pizza Inc., promised that his industry would give welfare recipients jobs, training and a chance to gain economic success.
The "Contract With America," the blueprint on which many Republican candidates ran for the House in the last election, includes a welfare bill that would impose time limits and work requirements on welfare recipients while stripping most legal immigrants of public assistance.
Last week, an analysis of the Republican plan by the Social Security Administration found that at least 400,000 legal immigrants would be denied benefits from Supplemental Security Income, a welfare program for the elderly, blind and disabled.
The Republicans estimated savings from its ban on welfare to immigrants at $22 billion over five years.
But today, Mr. Gingrich said Republicans believed they could save much more by freezing welfare spending, collapsing hundreds of social programs and turning over much of the responsibility for the poor to the states, in block grants.
"The governors have just told us they are prepared to accept a cap for five years, which gives us $40 billion," Mr. Gingrich said. "The governors are prepared to say to us if we will radically decentralize, give them the job, they will do the job."
Under current law, the affidavits of support that sponsors are required to sign are legally unenforceable, said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates tougher immigration requirements.
Mr. Gingrich said, "I have no problems saying if you're going to sponsor somebody to come to the U.S., we're prepared to make that sponsorship real and binding."
He said sponsors could be held liable for the immigrant for three to five years, but declined to say that the Republicans had had a "change of heart" on the issue.
"We did not control the Congress," he said. "We didn't have access to the resources. We were trying to find the least destructive way to pay for a very, very important program."

HEADLINE: Tons of Cocaine Reaching Mexico in Old Jets

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In a daunting new turn in the traffic of Colombian cocaine into the United States, smugglers are buying old passenger jets, taking out the seats and using the planes to fly huge amounts of the drug into Mexico, American and Mexican officials say.
Traveling at night with their lights off, the Boeing 727's and French-made Caravelle jets are believed to be carrying as much as six tons or more of cocaine on a single flight. 
 The cocaine is then transported overland into the United States, where the wholesale value of such a load is about $120 million.
"This is creating new economies of scale," said a senior American official, who, like others, discussed the development on condition he not be identified. "They are able to bring tremendously large amounts of cocaine in on a single aircraft."
Although the traffickers have occasionally used 727-type aircraft of their own or smuggled their cargoes on passenger airlines in the past, drug-enforcement officials say a more ominous pattern has developed over the last eight months.
In that time, six such planes are confirmed to have landed in Mexico with big loads of cocaine bound for the United States. But drug-control radar and intelligence reports suggest that many others may have landed, unloaded and escaped back to Colombia, officials said.
Before the planes set out, false identification numbers are often painted or pasted over the old ones. The radar transponders that allow them to be tracked easily by air-traffic controllers are shut off. Whatever their flight plans, they file none.
The jets fly much faster than most of Mexico's drug-interdiction aircraft, mainly smaller Cessnas, and are inexpensive enough, in a market glutted with newer planes, for the traffickers to abandon them on a remote airstrip if they need to. Officials say that even when they are detected by the radar surveillance planes that the United States regularly flies over the Caribbean, the flights are difficult to catch.
There is no clear evidence that the traffickers' use of jets has yet had any significant effect on the amount of cocaine smuggled into the United States. But even so, the advent of the jets has raised new tensions between the United States and the Governments of Colombia and Mexico, American officials and foreign diplomats say.
American officials say the flights could not possibly take off from airports in Colombia and on the Colombian island of San Andres, in the Caribbean about 110 miles east of the Nicaragua, without the assent or aid of the local authorities. But the officials say their protests have been all but ignored by the Government of President Ernesto Samper.
"San Andres is completely in the hands of the traffickers," a senior American official said. "And the Colombian Government is doing zero about it."
The landings in Mexico have heightened American suspicions about collusion with the traffickers by Mexican aviation officials and a fast-growing Mexican airline with ties to one of the most prominent old-line politicians in the governing party. American officials say they take for granted the traffickers' corruption of police forces in Mexico, through which about two-thirds of all Colombian cocaine is believed to enter the United States.
Mexican law-enforcement officials respond that they are just as concerned about the flights as their American counterparts but have limited resources to stop them. Despite greater controls on airports and the sale of aircraft fuel and new efforts by the military to shut down clandestine airstrips, Mexico seized only about 18.3 tons of cocaine in the first eight months of last year, down from 46.2 tons in 1993.
Some American officials have suggested that the Mexican Air Force might use its F-5 fighter planes to pursue the jets. But a Mexican official, noting the Government's longstanding concerns about the potential for corruption in the armed forces if they are given drug-interdiction duties, said that the military would "absolutely not" be used.
After years in which smugglers flew tons of drugs into northern Mexico and directly into the southwestern United States in small planes, the Drug Enforcement Administration began building an elaborate curtain of radar and aircraft to keep them out. Although the barricade proved notoriously porous, it eventually forced the traffickers to land their planes deeper in Mexico.
Over the last two years, after the D.E.A.'s so-called Northern Border Response Force grew more effective in its coverage of the Mexican mainland in coordination with the Mexican Attorney General's office, the traffickers took to flying and air-dropping cocaine into southern Mexico from Guatemala and El Salvador. The loads are usually then transported to the United States border in cars and trucks.
Mexican and American law-enforcement officials say they are also seeing a worrisome rise in cocaine smuggling on big container ships. Mexican officials said the Attorney General's office was planning to open new offices in the ports of Veracruz, Acapulco and Ensenada in order to check the ships more closely.
Yet even after seeing cocaine parachute drops, trafficker-owned container ships and drug-bearing submarines, some American officials say they have been impressed by the brazenness and sophistication of the jet flights.
"It's almost predictable that they would start doing it," one official said. "But it's still amazing."
Officials familiar with the flights said the first, an old Boeing 727, landed in late May at an airfield used by the Mexican airline Taesa near the town of Lagos de Moreno, in the central state of Jalisco.
Two officials said Taesa employees at the field told the police that drug traffickers waiting for the jet forced them to light the runway and then let them go after the plane unloaded its cargo and took off.
A spokesman for the airline, Jose Henonin, denied that its employees had anything to do with such a flight. Still, the incident renewed suspicions among American agents that drugs were being moved on planes or through airfields used by Taesa, a Mexican airline founded in 1988 by Carlos Hank Rohn, the eldest son and business manager of one of Mexico's most powerful politicians, Carlos Hank Gonzalez.
In a long career in public service, Mr. Hank Gonzalez has amassed a fortune estimated at well over $1 billion. Taesa officials say his son has sold his 51 percent interest in the airline to his partners, who were longtime pilots for the family, but some competitors question whether the family ties have really been cut.
A flight into Mexico on Aug. 4 caused even greater concern among American officials. A French-made Aerospatiale Caravelle jet, similar to the 727, landed on the airstrip of an old mining company near the desert town of Sombrerete, in the north-central state of Zacatecas.
As the plane touched down, its landing gear broke, and federal highway police officers, alerted by Mexican drug-enforcement officials, reported that the cargo, estimated at six to eight tons, was being taken away. Only about 2.5 tons of the drug were recovered, however, prompting suspicions that the local or federal authorities might have been working with the smugglers.
A Mexican official familiar with the case said it was likely that traffickers had gotten away with some of the load. He strongly denied that the police had taken any of the drug or had anything to do with the traffickers' escape.
In another case, investigators found the traffickers' ingenuity at a new level. On Nov. 22, officials said, a plane, apparently a 727, dropped a cargo near the town of Hidalgo del Parral, in the northern state of Chihuahua. This time, they said, the plane landed on a mile-long airstrip fashioned by compacting the hard dirt of the desert with a steamroller.

HEADLINE: Singapore Judge Orders U.S. Scholar and Paper to Stand Trial

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Putting aside protests from the Clinton Administration, a Singapore judge ordered today that an American scholar and an American-owned newspaper be tried on criminal contempt charges involving an opinion article that criticized "intolerant regimes" in Asia.
The State Department has formally protested the contempt charges brought against the scholar, Christopher Lingle, and The International Herald Tribune, which published an article by Mr. Lingle on Oct. 7 in which he noted that some Asian governments use "a compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition politicians." 
 After a daylong hearing, Justice Goh Joon Seng found today that there was adequate evidence for prosecutors to pursue a full trial beginning next week against Mr. Lingle and The Herald Tribune, a Paris-based newspaper that is owned by The New York Times and The Washington Post. The Herald Tribune publishes a regional edition in Singapore.
Lawyers here say Judge Goh has the power to impose heavy fines and even jail terms in the case.
Although Mr. Lingle's article did not mention any country by name, Singapore's Attorney General, Chan Sek Keong, argued in court that Mr. Lingle's reference to a "compliant judiciary" was clearly aimed at Singapore, and that Mr. Lingle and the newspaper should be held in contempt because the article "scandalized" Singapore's court system.
"Such allegations are calculated to undermine the authority of the courts, public confidence," Mr. Chan said. "The passage implied that the judiciary was party to a subtle scheme to suppress public dissent."
A number of opposition politicians have been driven to financial ruin after losing defamation cases brought by senior officials of Singapore's governing People's Action Party, including the former Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. The Government has insisted, however, that judges in those defamation cases made their findings based on the facts, not because they bowed to pressure from the ruling party.
Mr. Lingle, an economist who was employed at the National University of Singapore, left Singapore last fall and returned home to Atlanta, and has since announced that he will not return here. He was not represented in court today.
The other defendants -- The Herald Tribune; its publisher, Richard McClean; its Asia editor, Michael Richardson, and a Government-controlled Singapore company that prints the local edition -- were represented in the hearing.
Mr. Richardson, an Australian who has lived in Singapore since 1971, has said through his lawyer that while he edited the article by Mr. Lingle, it did not occur to him that the offending passage about a "compliant judiciary" referred to Singapore.
A spokesman for The Herald Tribune said the paper would have no other comment outside the courtroom until after the trial was over.
Last month, The Herald Tribune published a "clarification" in which it apologized "unreservedly" to the Singaporean judiciary and to Mr. Lee. The clarification said that Mr. Lingle's article "could by reason of facts later drawn to our attention be understood as suggesting that Mr. Lee Kuan Yew had sought to suppress political activity in Singapore by bankrupting opposition politicians through court actions."
Despite the apology, Mr. Lee filed a separate libel suit against the newspaper and Mr. Lingle. The Attorney General said today that the apology amounted to "an admission of liability" by the newspaper.

HEADLINE: Cultural Groups Mobilize To Take On the New Congress

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Alarmed by growing attacks on Federal support for the arts, cultural groups around the country are mobilizing to press their case directly to the avowedly hostile House Republican leadership. Their message: The arts don't cost; they earn.
The effort to sell the arts as not just balm for the soul but as a boon to local economies drew representatives of some 50 national arts and humanities groups to a meeting last week in Washington, where they formed a new "cultural advocacy" coalition. Another group set up a 900 telephone number to raise money for messages to Senators and Representatives. The chairman of the President's Council on Arts and the Humanities, John Brademas, said yesterday that he would make his own appeal later this week. 
 Around the nation, arts councils and museums and opera and dance companies have begun surveying their benefactors and trustees for well-connected business people, Republican or otherwise, who might have the ear of influential legislators.
Newt Gingrich, the new House Speaker, has made no secret of his antipathy to the long-standing system of Federal grants to arts organizations and artists. He and Congressional allies have vowed to pare if not end the subsidies doled out by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is to distribute $167.4 million this year, down from a high in 1979 of what today would be more than $300 million. Other Government financing programs for humanities and museums are also under critical scrutiny.
There are additional uncertainties in New York State, where the new Republican Governor, George E. Pataki, has yet to put his own stamp on the State Council on the Arts, either formally reappointing the long-serving chairwoman, Kitty Carlisle Hart, or naming a successor.
"Everybody's nervous," said Robert T. Buck, director of the Brooklyn Museum, which has received more than $2 million from Washington over the last two years for special programs and exhibits. Though the grant is only a small part of the museum's $17.5 million annual operating budget, it is considered vital. "We are counting on these monies," Mr. Buck said. "We are planning our projects with their support."
In an effort at solidarity, representatives of the American Association of Museum Directors and about 50 other arts, civic and labor organizations from the United Conference of Mayors to Opera America and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. met last week at the offices of the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies to plan strategy.
"We're sharing what our Congressional friends are thinking, and figuring out collective ways of communicating," said Bob Lynch, president of the assembly and a former college instructor in poetry and writing.
He said the coalition would portray the arts as a $37 billion industry employing 1.3 million people, or 1.5 percent of the work force, and generating tax revenues of $3.4 billion. Although nonprofit arts groups are routinely misperceived as subsisting primarily on charity, he said, they actually generate 60 percent of their budgets with cash sales: tickets, T-shirts and the like. Most of the rest is raised privately. Even those groups that are subsidized by the National Endowment for the Arts average grants valued at less than 2 percent of their budgets.
"Those are conservative Republican principles," said Mr. Lynch, whose 3,800-member assembly is coordinating but not directing the coalition.
Another umbrella lobbying group, the Arts Alliance, last week set up a fund-raising toll number -- (900) 370-9000 -- with a message soliciting money for a campaign to sway Congress with the same economic argument.
"If the curtain doesn't go up, restaurants and taxis suffer and printers don't get paid," said the alliance's executive director, Judy Golub.
Similarly, the American Council for the Arts, another lobbying group, has been calling news organizations with figures on the economic impact of the arts.
Leading figures in arts philanthropy and education are also lending support to the effort. Though Mr. Brademas heads the President's arts committee -- a citizens and Government advisory panel to stimulate private and public support of the arts -- he said he had also been working on his own to organize "friends of the arts" in support of the two national endowments (arts and humanities) and the Institute of Museum Services, which helps defray operating expenses. Mr. Brademas, who has served as a Representative from Indiana and as president of New York University, said he would speak out on the issue in a program on Thursday at the National Gallery of Art.
For his part, Mr. Gingrich has said that while he supports free exercise of the arts, he does not believe that they should be taxpayer subsidized. In fact, he says, artists would be freer without Federal involvement.
Even managers, benefactors and trustees of large arts institutions that receive proportionately small Federal grants deplored cutbacks or a cutoff, saying the contributions stimulate other giving.
"The N.E.A. validates the arts in America; it's the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval," said Ardis Krainik, general director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, which is getting some $600,000 from the Government this year toward its $30 million operating budget. She recalled that a large cut in arts funds was also sought when President Reagan took office, but that Republican allies on the boards of arts groups proved persuasive in rolling back the effort.
Martin E. Segal, chairman of the New York International Festival of the Arts and former chairman of Lincoln Center, said arts groups were best advised to make their case for Federal funds through influential members of their boards rather than by scattershot lobbying of Congress, and he indicated that such efforts were already under way.
The president of Lincoln Center, Nathan Leventhal, said that although the Federal contribution made up a bare 1 percent of the performing arts complex's $340 million budget (which is roughly double the arts endowment's entire budget), it helped. Besides, he said, the endowment's contribution amounts to 66 cents a year for every American. "We spend more on military bands than on the arts in this country."
Like a number of others, Mr. Leventhal attributed the anti-financing backlash to recent controversial artworks that offended religious and conservative sensibilities.
Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, said: "I can't believe that out of thousands and thousands of grants they would latch on to two or three they found objectionable, whoever 'they' are."
"What happened after the $750 toilet seats?" she said in reference to military overcharges. "Did we attempt to shut down the Pentagon?"
To one major recipient of Federal arts and humanities grants, WNET/ Channel 13 in New York, one of the nation's largest public broadcasting stations, the threatened cutback or cutoff was particularly ominous.
Although the station gets about a fourth of its $100 million budget directly or indirectly from Washington, by its nature it cannot fight for funds, said its president, William Baker.
"Our strength is our weakness," he said. "We're very apolitical. We're not left or right and we feel uncomfortable at lobbying for anything, including ourselves."
The station could not be self-sustaining, Mr. Baker said, because its programs were "not economically viable." Fully half the schedule consists of children's programming, he said, and 9,000 schools a day used WNET programs in their curriculum. Public broadcasting has been threatened before, he said, but never so directly.
For all the concern among arts groups about Republican leaders in Washington, there was praise for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has maintained city arts financing even in the face of severe budget problems. Ellen V. Futter, director of the Museum of Natural History, said that Republicans in New York City had been "extremely sensitive and highly sympathetic to the arts."

HEADLINE: U.S. Buys The Peso, Yet Bolsa Takes Dive

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The Mexican stock market suffered its worst loss in more than five years today, as investors reacted negatively to the decision by Mexican authorities to raise short-term interest rates sharply and begin using an $18 billion international credit line to bolster the peso.
The stock market -- formally the Bolsa de Valores -- dropped 149.88 points, or 6.65 percent, to close at 2,104.05. It was the exchange's worst single-day loss since October 1989. Nothing that happened last year -- including the rebellion in Chiapas state, two high-visibility political assassinations or the uncertainty of a presidential election -- affected the stock market as much as the peso crisis seemed to today. 
 While stock prices plummeted, the peso itself strengthened somewhat, closing at 5.375 to the dollar, up 7.8 percent from Friday, when it closed at 5.795. Yet, most investors seemed unimpressed, attributing the peso's gain to the decision by Mexico's central bank to draw on its international credit line. The bank asked the United States and Canada to buy pesos in an effort to strengthen the currency.
The stock market here also reacted to what was seen as a brutal tightening of credit by the Mexican central bank. The bank is attempting to slow the flow of money out of Mexico and push up the value of the peso. But with currency losses exceeding 35 percent since mid-December, the fear is that a weaker peso might send inflation in this country out of control.
Overnight interest rates paid by banks on peso deposits doubled today, to 50 percent. Analysts said many banks and brokers pulled their money out of the stock market to take advantage of those higher rates, and other investors saw the tightening of credit as a sure sign that Mexican industrial companies would suffer even more than had been expected.
"With rates flying as high as 50 percent, it's almost guaranteed that no company can survive," asserted Kenneth R. James, senior vice president of James Capel Emerging Market Sales. "What you saw today was local investors telling you this whole thing is out of control."
Most analysts were less pessimistic than Mr. James. While short-term interest rates are steep, they do not immediately affect the rates paid by Mexican corporations or individuals. But under normal economic conditions, they are seen as important indicators of broader interest-rate trends. Today, some people considered the 50 percent rate a painful but encouraging sign that Mexican authorities were committed to taking steps required to attract capital to Mexico.
At first, the stock market here rose on news that United States authorities had entered the currency markets to purchase pesos for dollars. But analysts said that was because investors did not immediately understand that the Americans and Canadians were entering the market not on their own initiative, but at the request of the Mexican Government.
Later in the day, the Mexican central bank said that it had drawn $500 million of its credit line from Washington and $83 million (Canadian)-- about $59 million United States-- from Ottawa.
Much of today's stock market decline reflected a concern by traders that the Government actually had to use the credit line. "The real advantage of a credit line is psychological," said Eduardo M. Cabrera, manager of Latin American strategies for Merrill Lynch & Company. "Once you use it, investors realize that it is a finite amount." Mr. Cabrera said he believed that the selling was overdone today.
Several analysts said it was not clear whether the Mexican central bank had used its own money today to help stabilize the peso, or had just relied on the money from its North American trading partners. Mexico's reserves have shrunk from $28 billion last February, to $6.15 billion as of Dec. 31, to $5.55 billion on Friday.
In total, foreign nations and international financial institutions have made available about $18 billion for Mexico to use in solving its current crisis. In addition to $9 billion from Washington and $1.5 billion (Canadian) from Ottawa, the package includes $5 billion from the Bank for International Settlements and $3 billion from foreign commercial banks.
Most analysts said the market's big worry continues to be the Government bonds known as tesobonos that are paid in pesos but indexed to dollars. A total of $685 million worth of these bonds mature this week. Next week, the total rises to $942 million, and climbs further to $1.3 billion in the final week of January.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said last week that the Government was working with American investment banks and brokers to develop a series of longer-term, high-yield bonds that would encourage investors, many of them foreign, not to withdraw their money when their holdings matured. But the new bonds have not yet reached the market.
Some analysts think that the Government will have to draw on the credit line again Tuesday to prop up investor confidence. Luis R. Luis, chief of emerging-markets research at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in Boston, said that while the high overnight interest rates and the use of the international credit line would help stabilize the peso, "it will come at a huge cost to the stock market."
Marla S. Marron, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, said it was unrealistic to expect the Mexican Government not to use the available credit to stabilize the peso.
"What people will be watching now as the tesobonos come due," Ms. Marron said, "is whether investors actually make the determination to buy into the Government's emergency economic plan," and thus keep their money in Mexico, rather than withdraw it.

HEADLINE: County's Crisis Is Conservatives' Lab

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif.

 BODY:
Orange County, in bankruptcy, has become the laboratory that some conservatives have always hoped for.
Because the taxpayers wouldn't stand for it, the county cannot turn to tax increases to help cover a $2 billion loss from a risky investment portfolio that went bad. That means the county will need to reduce the size of government -- a long-held conservative goal -- well beyond anything done elsewhere. 
 For starters, this would mean selling to private investors such public assets as the local airport and some landfills as well as cutting employees and the services they provide.
"I believe that less government is the best form and that too many people depend on government," said Gaddi Vasquez, the new chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors. "If ever there were the optimal conditions to make the changes that many have yearned to make, this is it. We must seize the moment."
But as the county undertakes these changes, its anti-tax stance could hurt it. To cover its losses, the county may have to return to the credit markets for more money. Yet Wall Street wants to be assured that Orange County will do whatever is necessary, including tax increases, to pay back its lenders.
"The message to lenders is, 'We'll pay you back if we've got it, but don't ask us to go out of our way,' " said Richard Larken, director of municipal finance at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the bond-rating agency. "Yes, they've got an ability to pay. But that is a moot issue. What matters is their willingness to pay."
Still, reducing the size of government and returning to the credit markets are at the center of the county's recovery plan. And many conservative policy makers are excited by the chance to put into practice some of their longstanding ideas, like a gigantic selloff of public properties.
The Orange County Lincoln Club, comprising Republican business leaders, has asked the Reason Foundation, a libertarian policy group in Los Angeles, to help them work on promoting the sale of the John Wayne Airport, assorted buildings and parcels of property, parks and several landfills.
"To get the dollars the county needs, they've got to sell assets in a big way, and that is where history will be made," Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation, said. "We're likely to see more dramatic privatization in Orange County than anywhere else, because they've run out of the easy alternatives."
Mr. Poole estimated that the county could have a "realistic goal" of $1 billion in asset sales. "For a municipality to sell $1 billion in assets is big news," he added.
The downside of selling assets is that the sales will not help ease the immediate cash shortage. Mr. Poole estimates that significant asset sales will take at least six months to a year to accomplish. The county's financial advisers say a $172 million budget gap must be closed within six months to maintain a least a modicum of financial credibility.
Having ruled out tax increases -- "dead issue; next question," Mr. Vasquez said bluntly -- the county faces a bind. Other than tax increases and spending cuts, the only significant option is to borrow money. But lenders say the anti-tax attitude makes it difficult for investors to be confident of being repaid.
John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County Employees Association, which is seeing layoffs among its members, said, "When you live in the midst of a county of such success and affluence, a certain smugness develops that insulates citizens from a feeling that anything can go wrong."
Orange County has a gross economic output of $68 billion a year, larger than the economies of Greece, Thailand or the Philippines. Despite this underlying economic strength, the county government's budget had been built more on investment earnings than on taxes -- highly unusual in municipal finances.
"There's very strong resistance to tax increases here," Marian Bergeson, a newly elected county supervisor, said. On the day Ms. Bergeson and other supervisors were sworn in, many vowed not to raise taxes. Others expressed reluctance to make spending cuts beyond the $40.2 million already announced. Mr. Vasquez says the county will announce more cost-cutting measures soon, including asset sales and, possibly, employee layoffs.
"Our record $40.2 million in cuts are as far as we could go and still deliver services to the county," said Brad Gates, the county sheriff and a member of a three-member team recommending cuts in county services. "We stopped at the point when we could not deliver any more essential services."
Besides the problems at the county level, 186 cities, local agencies and school districts in the county lost money in the investment fund. Many of them have delayed road improvements, laid off lawyers for the poor, frozen hiring or cut other services. Already at least one school district has declared a "financial state of emergency" and cuts in school budgets are expected.
One option being widely discussed is to ask noteholders who are due $600 million in July to wait longer for their money. While the terms of any such arrangement have not been determined, officials here are openly raising the possibility of lengthening the maturity of some of these notes.
Officials also say that longer-term borrowings may be needed to cover investment losses, which total $700 million for the county government alone. "Borrowing is likely to play a significant role in Orange County's recovery," Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer, said.
But some credit market experts say investors will ask this question: Why would anyone lend to Orange County when its residents do not seem willing to raise the revenues to pay back lenders? It has long been a tenet of municipal finance that behind any bond lies the willingness of the issuer to raise taxes, if necessary, to protect bondholders.
Daniel Heimowitz, director of the public finance group at Moody's Investors Service, noted that in other municipal crises new taxes were always imposed and dedicated specifically to the new bonds that helped bail out the government. For example, in New York City, a dedicated sales tax backed the Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds issued during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's; in Philadelphia, additional income taxes supported borrowings that averted a default, and in Chicago, two property tax increases prevented a default of school bonds.
"The posturing in Orange County of no new taxes is not helpful in finding a solution," Mr. Heimowitz said. "They are going to have to show that they have the intention of taking their wealth and directing it to make good on their losses."
Orange County, like all other local governments in California, is unable to increase property taxes because of Proposition 13, the tax-limitation measure approved by voters in 1978. Given that, the county's only realistic choice would be to increase sales taxes, perhaps by a percentage point or so, dedicating the revenues to repaying bondholders. But no one is expecting anything like that.
On Friday, Moody's lowered its rating on the county's debt securities to "below investment grade," in effect, labeling them junk bonds.
"It is clear that each debt-service payment will be decided by the county on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether they have the cash or not," said Barbara Flickinger, a Moody's assistant director, who attended a recent briefing by Orange County officials.
Existing bondholders are waiting to see what will happen. "We're going to try to deal with an impending default on these notes by achieving some form of a workout with the noteholders," Mr. Bennett, the bankruptcy lawyer, said. In a workout, the borrower and the noteholders negotiate a schedule for repayment, often extending the deadlines and reducing the amounts due.
"The county may go to the noteholders and say, 'We don't have the money to pay you back,' " said Zane Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Adviser, a newsletter. "So they might give them more paper. But the money still has to be paid back. The county either has to cut services more, raise taxes or isolate some income to assure repayment of the debt."
Some people, however, predict that a point may come where service cutbacks are so severe that attitudes will change, even here.
Mark Baldassare of the University of California at Irvine, who has been studying Orange County since 1982, observed: "The basic attitude is that there is plenty of waste in government and there is no need to raise taxes. That's a constant backdrop. But people here are also particular. They are educated and skeptical of government. They need to be convinced that government has done all it can, and then they might decide there are some circumstances where taxes are warranted."
Chris Varelas, a Salomon Brothers investment banker who is advising the county, asked: "What happens when they call 911 and get a recording? They might define things differently."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
A Shift by Bullish Investors Prompts a Decline in Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
A broad array of commodity prices fell yesterday, led by steep declines in orange juice, coffee and wheat futures, in which previously bullish investors became disappointed sellers.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index fell 1.59 points, to 233.65. 
 January orange juice sank 6.3 cents on the New York Cotton Exchange to settle at $1 a pound, the lowest level for a nearby contract in three months.
"There was disappointment over the market's technical performance and the lack of significant cold weather in Florida, which is already in the hard freeze period," said Celeste Georgakis of Dean Witter.
Coffee prices were also undermined by a letdown after recent bullish rumors that Central and South American coffee producers would restore a withholding plan inaugurated last year as a way to firm up prices.
March coffee lost 5.85 cents on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to 169.10 cents a pound.
After a week of uncertainty about the plans by large coffee growers to renew the export retention program, investors decided to sell.
There was general skepticism about whether Brazil and Colombia, the world's top two coffee producers, would participate in the plan.
Commodity funds were big sellers of wheat contracts, after a Government report showed that the speculative funds were increasingly acquiring long positions, a prescription for a sudden selloff. March wheat dropped 11.25 cents, to $3.83 1/4 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
On other markets, crude and heating oil prices sank, as winter weather that was warmer than normal continued to reduce demand. February crude oil fell 27 cents, to $17.40 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while February heating oil shed 1.19 cents, to 48.33 cents a gallon.
But copper prices rose to new contract highs, helped by strong underlying fundamentals from booming economic sectors that used the most copper. March copper jumped 2.75 cents, to 139.05 cents a pound, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Mixed; Inflation Data Awaited

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders stayed on the sidelines yesterday in advance of the Labor Department's release of the December Producer Price Index today and the Consumer Price Index tomorrow.
The price data will go far in calming or alarming traders over the course of inflation, the economy and the interest-rate policy of the Federal Reserve. The Fed's policy-making meeting is scheduled to begin Jan. 31. 
 If the data point unambiguously to increasing inflation, traders may conclude that not only will the Fed raise interest rates later this month, as widely expected, but will also continue to do so throughout the year.
As a result of the anticipation, stocks closed mixed but little changed, bond prices fell, the dollar dropped sharply and the price of gold inched up a little.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.06 points, to 3,861.35, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.15 point, to 460.83. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.40 points, to 752.09.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal, with 279.3 million shares changing hands, about 4 percent below last year's daily average of 290 million shares.
Unlike most sessions, where stock prices track bond prices, the price of American equities seemed to follow the fate of the dollar much more closely and the dollar was having a bad day. The dollar fell sharply against most major currencies in part because of continuing turmoil over the Mexican peso.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced yesterday morning that it was buying pesos to help support the foundering Mexican currency, which has lost 40 percent of its value since Dec. 19. Such purchases by the New York Fed have the effect of increasing the supply of dollars and thus driving its price down.
The fate of the dollar is significant for stock investors because the dollar's value will influence whether foreign investors will want to buy assets valued in dollars, like stocks. The dollar was also weakened by fears of new trade tensions between the United States and Japan and by a strong German mark.
The Dow Jones has gained 0.7 percent in the first five days of trading this year, but fallen 0.06 percent in terms of marks. Since June 1985, the dollar has fallen about 50 percent against the mark.
Pillsbury, a unit of Grand Metropolitan of London, agreed to buy Pet Inc. for $2.6 billion. Pet is a food processor whose brand names include Old El Paso Mexican food and Progresso Italian food. Pet established a 52-week high of 25 3/4 before closing at 25 1/2, up 5 3/8. It was also the most active stock, at 16.1 million shares.
The Deerbank Corporation, a savings and loan, also established a 52-week high of 43 before closing at 42 3/8, up 9 5/8. Deerbank agreed to be bought by NBD Bancorp for $120 million in stock.
Duracraft, a maker of heaters and humidifiers, rose 4, to 34, after management met with securities analysts, several of whom raised their 1995 profit estimates.
Harleysville Savings Bank in Harleysville, Pa. fell 5, to 21, after it reported first-quarter earnings of 68 cents a share versus a profit a year ago of 61 cents. The earnings apparently disappointed some investors but earnings projections for the company were not immediately available for comparison.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.01 point, to 251.58, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,188 to 1,011. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.05 points, to 434.17.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 17 fell, led by Union Carbide, which dropped 1 1/8, to 29 3/8. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 235 rose, led by Ford, which rose 5/8, to 28 7/8.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Fall as Price Data Are Due

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as investors worried that inflation reports due this week would continue to suggest that rising interest rates had not yet slowed the economy.
To subdue future inflation, the Federal Reserve, which raised short-term interest rates six times last year, may continue ratcheting rates up this year. 
 The debt market was also kept on the defensive as the dollar tumbled in world currency markets. The dollar slid against the Japanese yen after Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador to Japan, said that the United States would consider trade sanctions on Japan it it did not agree to import more American goods during trade talks in Washington.
The 30-year bond fell 7/32 , to a price of 9521/32 for a yield of 7.88 percent, up from 7.86 percent on Friday.
George R. Mateyo, chief executive of the Carnegie Capital Management Company, Cleveland, said market expectations for today's producer price report for December ranged from a gain of five-tenths of a percent to seven-tenths of a percent.
But Mr. Mateyo said he did not think the figure would be that high. "We're looking instead for a gain of three-tenths of a percent in the P.P.I," he said, adding that he expected an increase of three-tenths or four-tenths of a percent in the Consumer Price Index, which is to be reported tomorrow.
"With the Mexican situation not entirely solved and the Fed expected to act at its next Federal Open Market Committee meeting this month," Mr. Mateyo said, "we could easily find ourselves going from 8.10 percent on the high end of trading for long bonds to 7.65 percent on the low side over a 30-day period. It's a tremendous trading range, but it also represents a lot of trading opportunities."
He also noted that given problems with derivatives and the Orange County, Calif., bankruptcy, enough negatives remained to stifle buying. "But that's what makes markets," Mr. Mateyo said, "the uncertainty."
The Treasury's weekly bill auction drew strong demand yesterday, as the average rate rose to 5.87 percent for a three-month bill, from 5.78 percent last week, and the six-month bill rose to 6.42 percent, from 6.37 percent. Traders report that noncompetitive bidding, representing retail interest, continues to be impressive at these auctions, with strong demand driven by the attractive yields now that the market has priced in what it expects will be a 50-basis-point -- or one-half percentage point -- rate increase by the Fed at its next monetary policy meeting at the end of the month.
Banks, by comparison, are offering a rate of 3.83 percent for a three-month certificate of deposit and 4.48 percent for a six-month C.D., according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.
On the long end of the market, traders and investors expect bond yields will once again break above 8 percent sometime this quarter before the Fed's six inflation-fighting rate increases begin slowing the economy sufficiently. Because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments, investors are reluctant to buy bonds with long maturities.
Investors as a rule sell the long maturities and buy shorter maturities to get away from market volatility. The yield on a two-year note rose 7.66 percent, as the gap between it and the 30-year bond yield narrowed 2 basis points, to 22, from Friday. Two weeks ago, the spread was just 12 basis points. According to analysts, a wider spread typically reflects increased investor concern that the Fed is not raising interest rates fast enough to subdue inflation.
The following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month bill auctions:

HEADLINE: Consumers Again Raise Credit Debt

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Consumers used their credit cards freely in November, contributing to an increase of $12.88 billion in total installment debt during the month, the Federal Reserve said today.
Every major category of credit, from new-car loans to credit card balances, grew as total debts climbed for a 24th consecutive month. 
 November's rise, at an annual rate of 17.3 percent, was up from an $11.64 billion, or 15.9 percent annual rate, expansion in credit during October. It was the largest monthly increase since a $15.1 billion jump three months earlier in August.
The big rises in consumer credit during both October and November lend weight to analysts' estimates that the economy's pace of growth may have accelerated to a rate as high as 5 percent a year in the closing quarter of 1994.
The year "has begun with a full head of steam," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "Consumer spending, capital expenditures, inventories, commercial construction and exports are barreling ahead," he said.
Consumer spending on goods and services continues to grow despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of the economy. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times since February and is widely expected to increase rates again at the end of the month.
Auto credit outstanding climbed in November by $4.77 billion, at an 18 percent annual rate, after rising $2.88 billion, at a 10.9 percent annual rate, in October.
Credit card debt shot up in November by $6.72 billion, at a 24.6 percent annual rate, compared with a $4.88 billion October advance, at an 18.2 percent annual rate.
Other credit, which includes consumer bank loans for things like boats, trailers and vacations but not real estate mortgages, increased by $1.39 billion, at a 6.8 percent annual rate, down sharply from a $3.88 billion, or 19.3 percent, October increase, the Fed said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Takes Sharp Drop On U.S. Efforts to Aid Peso

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against leading currencies yesterday, weighed down by United States efforts to halt the slide of the Mexican peso and by renewed worries about trade tensions between the United States and Japan.
The dollar was also weakened by the strength of the German mark, which has gained as investors have fled political turmoil in Italy and Spain. 
 The dollar tumbled against the yen in its steepest one-day drop since Aug. 18, after the United States Ambassador to Japan, Walter F. Mondale, said the United States might impose trade sanctions on Japan if trade talks failed. Mr. Mondale spoke in Washington, where negotiations with Japan are being held.
The comments prompted fears that the Clinton Administration would revive an earlier trade strategy of talking up the value of the yen against the dollar. A stronger yen would make Japanese exports more expensive.
"The U.S. brought out the trade-sanction bogyman and that hurt the dollar," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Concern about the Federal Reserve's dollar sales for pesos also drove the dollar lower. The Fed said yesterday morning that it was selling dollars for pesos on behalf of the Bank of Mexico. The Fed sold an estimated $75 million to $150 million for pesos in two rounds, traders familiar with the Fed's action said.
The Fed's trades "certainly won't make anyone buy dollars," said Richard Vullo, currency sales manager at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank. "Granted, the intervention is against the peso, but the Fed is still selling dollars," he said.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 99.91 Japanese yen from 101.37 yen on Friday. The dollar also fell to 1.5375 German marks from 1.5643 marks.
Pressure on the dollar from the mark has come as the German currency has surged to record highs against the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira. In Spain, the markets have slumped as the Socialist Government has been rocked by a scandal. In Italy, there has been political uncertainty since the Dec. 22 resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The mark, the currency of the Continent's strongest economy, often benefits from political turmoil in Europe.
In other currency trading, the dollar fell to 1.2840 Swiss francs, from 1.3105 francs on Friday. The British pound rose to $1.5640 from $1.5495. But the Canadian dollar fell to 70.96 United States cents from 71.41 cents.

Mother of 4 Finds Help And Sheds Long Misery

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Not long ago, he followed her home from church and discovered where she had moved to escape his abuse. But he stopped at the corner, and Sonia K. believes he will not come any closer to her new apartment and the life she has begun there.
She was 13 when they emigrated from Belize together, leaving their families and childhoods behind. She loved him then, and said she would follow him anywhere. A year later, they had a baby daughter, and it seemed all the world was within their grasp. 
 But by the time Ms. K. was 21, her boyfriend had developed health problems that she said affected his personality. He had become angry and controlling, and refused to let her out of his sight. She says he never beat her or the children, but the emotional abuse they suffered was almost as bad.
"He didn't want me to make friends, and he wouldn't let me go anywhere without him," she said in a small voice. "Slowly, it got worse and worse."
The problems peaked in the winter of 1993, when Ms. K.'s boyfriend was unemployed and harassing neighbors in their Washington Heights building. The family was evicted, she said, and they spent a week at the city's Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx.
"It was January, freezing cold, and we were sleeping on benches with a lot of other people," said Ms. K., who is now 26. "It was one of the lowest times in my life."
Then the family moved into a city shelter in Harlem, where she said they shared a tiny, roach-infested apartment. They spent more than a year there, and Ms. K. joined a church in the neighborhood. But all the while, her boyfriend was becoming more difficult.
One night last March, he threatened another shelter resident with a butcher knife. When the police arrived, he barricaded himself in the apartment with Ms. K. and the children. That episode, she said, was the turning point.
"They took him to jail, and they said I would have to give up the children if I let him come back," she said. "I knew I had to get away from him."
The next day, Ms. K. filed for a restraining order against her boyfriend. She also called her parents in Belize, whom he had not let her contact in six years. Later that month, the Child Welfare Agency referred her to the Children's Aid Society, one of the charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, now in its 83d year.
Darleen Brown, a social worker with the society's prevention services unit, started counseling Ms. K. and her children, who are 12, 9, 7 and 5. With her help, they found a three-bedroom apartment in a Harlem brownstone. In June, the family moved in. They had lost all their furniture when they were evicted, so the society bought them a couch, dressers, linens and kitchen equipment. The rooms are small and dark, but Ms. K. has hung lace curtains and pictures of the children, and there is no trace of the misery she left behind.
"I prayed real hard for so many years, and finally my prayers were heard," she said the other night as her children watched cartoons in their living room. "We are just happy to have a place of our own."
Ms. Brown still visits the family twice a month, and Ms. K. recently completed a parenting class sponsored by the society. Before, she said, it was hard to concentrate on the children because of her boyfriend's behavior. But now she is focusing all her energy on their well-being. Among other things, she is trying to help them recover from their past.
"They feel bad because their father is on the streets now, and he has no one," she said. "I tell them he still loves them even though he's sick, and what happened isn't their fault."
Ms. K. receives public assistance, but she is taking a computer class and plans to return to school and find a job. She has made friends through her church, and said she finally has the emotional support she lacked for years. When she sees her children's father on the street, she said, she feels more sorrow than fear.
"He watches us sometimes, but he doesn't come near," she said. "He knows he can't come near."

HEADLINE: State of the State Message Salutes a Year in the Life

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
New Jersey state government is slimming down just as the economy is adding jobs in private business, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman accepted credit for both developments in her State of the State Message, whose text was released here today.
In a document that could just as well have been called "The State of My Administration," Mrs. Whitman offered no new initiatives and no surprises; instead she devoted a 30-page booklet to her administration's still sometimes vague plans to wring savings and better services out of state and local government. 
 Despite Mrs. Whitman's blunt Republican devotion to fiscal restraint and smaller government, the Governor's message committed the state to social and economic agendas usually associated with Democrats: improving failing schools, lifting economically stagnant cities, breaking the dogged poverty of many households, and slowing the spread of AIDS.
The Governor has, after a year in office, made a name for herself in national Republican politics as an executive who has so far managed to balance two ideas that usually seem contradictory -- cutting taxes while expanding the state's responsibilities.
However, her political opponents point out that to fulfill her pledge of reducing state taxes 30 percent during her administration, the most painful cuts are yet to come, and for that reason her budget message in two weeks may be considerably more revealing than today's broad policy paper.
Mrs. Whitman took pains to repeat her administration's commitment to ethnic and gender diversity and tolerance under a program, begun last summer, called "Many Faces, One Family." And she surprised no one by restating her determination to cut taxes further:
"My biggest promise is based on a simple premise: when tax rates go up, jobs disappear and state revenues go down," she said. "We will continue to cut taxes in New Jersey because our people deserve tax relief and because it will provide more of what every family needs: jobs and economic opportunity."
Today's State of the State Message followed custom by recapitulating the administration's last year and by pointing in only general terms to the future. Mrs. Whitman will deliver a shorter version of the same report in a speech to the Legislature at noon tomorrow, and her press office said today that the speech may include some ideas not mentioned in the formal report released today.
"The state of the state is one of promise," the Governor wrote in a cover letter for the document. She said the state has added nearly 60,000 jobs in the last year, the fastest job growth since the boom years of the 1980's. Her four-year, 30 percent income tax cut reached the half-way point toward completion in the first of the year, when the latest round of cuts brought the reduction in income tax rates since her inauguration to 15 percent, for a savings to taxpayers of $625 million per year.
The Governor has already committed herself to continuing the tax cut plan, and the only question remaining is how big a cut she will propose for the 1996 tax year. That information, and a more detailed accounting of the costs of her other programs, will be outlined in her Jan. 23 budget message.
"With our economy brightening, more families are feeling confident about their futures," Mrs. Whitman said in her statement. "But not everyone is better off. Although we've added tens of thousands of jobs, more than a quarter million New Jerseyans remain out of work. Despite spending far more per pupil on education than any other state, we rank 35th in S.A.T. math scores, 38th in verbal scores, and 49th in the percentage of school funding that reaches the classroom."
By the Governor's own account, the Whitman administration is still a work in progress, with numerous important policy initiatives awaiting the recommendations of advisory groups whose work Mrs. Whitman reviewed in her report. The Dredged Materials Management Team is trying to balance the environmental and economic trade-offs of dredging Port Elizabeth, she said. The Government That Works Task Force is reviewing which state programs work and which should be scuttled. Urban Coordinating Councils are intended to involve inner-city poor in still-undecided economic development programs. Another commission is studying the Garden State's farm issues.
Mrs. Whitman repeated her intention to try a state-financed voucher program in Jersey City schools, despite only lukewarm interest in the effort in the Legislature and a full-blown campaign to defeat the plan by the teachers' union.
In a cryptic catch-phrase Mrs. Whitman often favors, the Governor said of the voucher plan today, "We have nothing to fear but success."
One of Mrs. Whitman's strengths as a politician has been her ability to connect her policies to the lives of New Jersey's citizens, and she used that approach again today. Throughout her report, she scattered short letters written by New Jerseyans who supported her programs: Edwin A. Reimon of Jersey City wrote to thank her for fostering opportunities for minorities to bid on state business; Marla and Robert Laverty of East Windsor urged her to crack down on child molesters like the one charged in the slaying of Megan Kanka of Hamilton last summer, and Marty Sullivan of Fair Haven asked for more help for the cities.
In the opening paragraph of her message, the Governor went so far as to note that as she was taking the oath of office last Jan. 18, a baby named Monica Monique Spencer was being born in Jersey City. The Governor saluted Monica, a one-year-old administration to a 1-year-old citizen of the state, in her closing statement as well: "I'd like to think that in these past 12 months, because of a growing partnership between government and the people it serves, Monica's prospect for a life of personal achievement and public good have brightened."

HEADLINE: Feeling Poor in a Rich Economy

 BODY:
Like matter and antimatter that coexist in the universe, two economies appear to exist side by side in the U.S. One economy has generated stagnant earnings for the average American over the past 20 years, producing a frustration that turned against the party in power last November.
The second economy is measured in buoyant statistics: Production has grown steadily for four years, unemployment has fallen to levels as low as any during the past 20 years, and consumer confidence has risen to record levels. Even beleaguered cities like Detroit and Chicago have achieved fiscal stability. 
 There are two ways to explain how these mirror-image economies can coexist. One is that statistics do not always reflect common experience. Recent economic gains, though substantial on average, have been concentrated among high-income families and selected regions like the Southeast. The wages of most workers -- those with high school educations -- have languished or, after accounting for inflation, fallen over recent decades. Similarly, city budgets -- excluding New York's -- are moving into surplus. But part of the reason is a decision to cut back desperately needed services. That cities have, in times of fiscal exigencies, turned their backs on inner-city schools is no cause for celebration.
High expectations are another factor that can produce frustration amid seeming plenty. The U.S. economy exploded after World War II. Productivity, the long-term basis for earnings, roared upward at two or three times its usual pace. Americans developed the notion that the halcyon days of the 1950's and 60's would continue and that their children could expect to live substantially richer lives than their parents did. A decade later OPEC helped send the economy down, but back-to-back recessions did not so easily shatter firmly entrenched expectations.
The sober lesson from historians is that the good fortune of the 50's and 60's was odd and unlikely to be repeated. But even as expectations catch up with reality, frustration will not dissipate quickly. Important pockets of the country may not rebound soon. California is racked by defense cuts; Wall Street follows the roller coaster of stock and bond markets. Foreign competition threatens the jobs of white-collar managers through no fault of their own -- a threat that had until now been mostly reserved for factory workers. Poverty is increasingly entrenched in urban ghettos, immune so far to public policy and, alarmingly, to the general health of the economy.
Productivity grew at a 3 percent clip annually after World War II, but only by about 1 percent a year since 1973. That is the economy that causes frustration. The political consequence is sobering because there is no obvious remedy.
The G.O.P. promises tax cuts and less regulation, which is almost surely unrelated to sweeping long-term forces in the economy. President Clinton had a deeper answer -- to steer public and private spending toward productivity-enhancing investment in training and education. But his policies might not make a dent in living standards for a generation. The voters took out their anger on Mr. Clinton. By 1996 they may be looking for other targets.

HEADLINE: U.S. Effort to Return Farm Land to Natural State Wins Praise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
WITH the Endangered Species Act under assault by political conservatives and property-rights advocates, another federally sponsored approach to saving wild creatures' habitats has quietly won broad praise and is being widely promoted as a successful alternative.
It is the Conservation Reserve Program, a provision of the 1985 farm bill that pays farmers to take land out of production and return it to something approaching a natural state. 
 Under the program, 36 million acres of habitat, mostly in the country's midsection, have been restored at a cost of about $1.6 billion a year. The decadelong effort is credited by wildlife experts with, among other things, helping to reverse a steep decline in North America's duck population by greatly expanding the birds' nesting grounds.
The program embodies a conservation principle long held dear by conservatives and proponents of market solutions to environmental problems: inducing property owners to become willing stewards of ecologically valuable land by offering them financial incentives.
By contrast, say advocates of this approach, the Endangered Species Act forces landowners to give up the economic use of property containing the habitats of critical species without compensating them. Sometimes, critics say, property owners resort to pre-emptive strikes by simply destroying habitat before it can be formally declared the home of an endangered species.
The issue is expected to get a thorough airing in the new Republican-dominated Congress, since both the Endangered Species Act and the farm bill, including the Conservation Reserve Program, are up for reauthorization this year. Property-rights advocates have many allies in Congress, including some conservative Democrats, and it appears certain that they will press the attack on the Endangered Species Act.
The Conservation Reserve Program, on the other hand, enjoys wide support, including that of Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, the new chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Advocates of the market approach to conservation, both environmentalists and political conservatives, in theory favor extending the principle of financial incentives from the farm bill to the Endangered Species Act. But that would cost more, and so is problematical given the Republicans' announced determination to cut spending. For that matter, it is not certain whether the Conservation Reserve Program will continue to be financed at its present level.
Some conservationists say Congress's treatment of the issue will reveal much about the professed commitment to species protection that usually accompanies conservatives' denunciations of the Endangered Species Act. If they are not willing to put up the money to provide market incentives for conservation, "then I think their professed goal of protecting endangered species will be revealed as a sham," said Michael Bean, an advocate of the incentive approach who specializes in conservation issues for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington.
In the meantime, the Clinton Administration has announced that as 10-year contracts under which farmers enrolled their property in the Conservation Reserve Program begin expiring next year, some of the program's funds will be withdrawn from acreage where the conservation benefits are determined to be marginal and redirected to land where the conservation payoff is higher. A number of proposals have been made to link this redirection of money directly to the protection of endangered species.
For instance, the Pacific Rivers Council, a regional organization devoted to protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems, has proposed that some funds be redirected to the Pacific Northwest, where they would be used to encourage farmers to protect and restore stream-side vegetation and flood plains necessary to the survival and reproduction of dwindling salmon populations.
The National Marine Fisheries Service is expected to propose soon that the coho, one of the most important and formerly most abundant species of Pacific salmon, be listed as endangered throughout much of its range. Using Conservation Reserve Program money to protect parts of watersheds on private property on the coho's behalf would be "a tremendous step forward," said Bob Doppelt, the Pacific Rivers Council's executive director. It could also remove much of the potential sting for landowners if and when the coho is declared endangered.
Interest groups representing other areas of the country and other types of ecosystems have also expressed interest in obtaining Conservation Reserve Program funds. Whether a competition develops remains to be seen. Ducks Unlimited, a private conservation group based in Memphis whose interests have been handsomely served by the Conservation Reserve Program, is not opposed to some redirection of money, said Jeff Nelson, the organization's chief biologist. While the organization would, of course, like to see the middle of the country remain the primary target of the program, he said, more efficient use of the funds might allow expansion to other areas.
"There's a good chance you could get the same environmental benefits for 75 percent of the cost if it were made more efficient," he said.
The various uses that might be made of the funds do not compete but rather complement one another in terms of the overall conservation goal, said Tom Hebert, the deputy undersecretary of agriculture for natural resources and environment. The problem, he said, is how to "meet all these laudable objectives with one program and with funds that are not unlimited."
Senator Lugar recently criticized the Department of Agriculture's plan to extend and retarget Conservation Reserve Program contracts on the ground that it was an attempt to extend the program's financing administratively rather than by Congressional appropriation. Mr. Lugar is determined to reassess the program to make sure that it delivers "the best environmental bang for the buck," said a spokeswoman, Minda M. Markle. No decision has yet been made on redirecting some of the funds, she said.
The program's original purpose was to take fragile, highly erodible land out of production at a time when Government stocks of grain were soaring. But as farmers planted grass and trees and allowed natural vegetation to return, conservation benefits began to emerge. Millions of acres of wildlife habitat were regenerated and water quality was improved, benefiting countless species large and small, from freshwater mussels to big-game animals in the West. Improved water quality and wildlife habitat were subsequently included as goals of the program.
Many farmers joined the program partly because taking the acreage out of production improved crop prices. Whether owners of more valuable lands would respond to incentives of this order -- typically, $50 per acre per year -- is uncertain.
In any case, a large body of literature exploring the efficacy of financial incentives for conservation and advocating their use has emerged in the last few years from conservative research groups and environmental organizations.
"I, of course, applaud the idea" embodied in the Conservation Reserve Program, said Dr. John Baden, an economist at the University of Washington in Seattle who is the chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment. The organization promotes "freedom and ecological integrity" by searching for economic means to achieve environmental ends.
At the same time, the incentives approach is advocated by Hank Fischer, the northern Rocky Mountains representative of the Washington-based Defenders of Wildlife. Mr. Fischer, based in Missoula, Mont., directed a 1993 study on building economic incentives into the Endangered Species Act. Given the present political climate, he said, "probably the more likely route at this stage is to take existing programs and modify them." In that regard, he said, "people with lands with endangered species ought to receive priority" in the redirection of Conservation Reserve Progam funds.
"I don't think expansion of the Conservation Reserve Program is in the cards," he said, "but I think retargeting is."

HEADLINE: CLINTON & CONGRESS;
Let's Privatize Congress

BYLINE: By Arthur Miller; Arthur Miller's last play was "Broken Glass."

DATELINE: ROXBURY, Conn.

 BODY:
It is great news, this idea of selling a House office building now that the Republicans are dissolving so many committees and firing their staffs. But I wouldn't be surprised if this is only the opening wedge for a campaign to privatize Congress. Yes, let the free market openly raise its magnificent head in the most sacred precincts of the Welfare State.
The compelling reasons for privatizing Congress are perfectly evident. Everybody hates it, only slightly less than they hate the President. Everybody, that is, who talks on the radio, plus millions of the silent who only listen and hate in private. 
 Congress has brought on this hatred, mainly by hypocrisy. For example, members are covered by complete Government-run health insurance -- while the same kind of coverage for the voters was defeated, with the voters' consent and support, no less.
The voters, relieved that they are no longer menaced by inexpensive health insurance administered by the hated Government, must nevertheless be confused about not getting what polls show they wanted.
The important point is that even though they are happy at being denied what they say they want, they also know that the campaign to defeat health insurance was financed by the big private health insurance companies to the tune of millions of dollars paid to Congressional campaigns. The net result is that with all their happiness, the voters are also aware of a lingering sense of Congressional hypocrisy.
Health care is only one of many similar issues -- auto safety, the environment, education, the use of public lands, etc. The way each issue is decided affects the finances of one or another business, industry or profession, and these groups naturally tend to butter the bread of members of Congress.
We can do away with this hypocrisy by making Congress a private enterprise. Let each representative and senator openly represent, and have his salary paid by, whatever business group wishes to buy his vote. Then, with no excuses, we will really have the best representative system money can buy. No longer will absurdly expensive election campaigns be necessary. Anyone wanting the job of Congressional representative of, say, the drug industry could make an appointment with the council of that industry and make his pitch.
The question arises whether we would need bother to go through the whole election procedure. But I think we must continue to ask the public to participate lest people become even more alienated than they are now, with only 39 percent of the eligible voters going to the polls in November.
A privatized Congress might well attract a much higher percentage of voters than the present outmoded one does because the pall of hypocrisy would have been stripped away and a novel bracing honesty would attract voters to choose whichever representative of the auto or real estate industries or the date growers they feel most sympathy for.
Once Congress is privatized, the time would have come to do the same to the Supreme Court and the Justice Department. If each Justice were openly hired by a sector of the economy to protect its interests, a simple bargaining process could settle everything. The Auto Industry Justice, wishing to throw out a suit against General Motors or Ford, could agree to vote his support for the Agribusiness Justice, who wanted to quash a suit by workers claiming to have been poisoned while picking cabbages.
Some will object that such a system of what might be called legalized corruption would leave out the public and its interests. But this is no longer a problem when you realize that there is no public and therefore no public interest in the old sense. As Margaret Thatcher once said, "There is no society," meaning that the public consists of individuals, all of whom have private interests that to some degree are hostile to the interests of other individuals.
Possible objections: the abstract idea of justice would disappear under a system that takes only private economic interests into account. Secondly, the corporate state, which this resembles, was Mussolini's concept and resulted in the looting of the public by private interests empowered by the state.
Objections to the objections: we already have a corporate state. All privatization would do would be to recognize it as a fact.
Conclusion: we are in bad trouble.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: DIARY;
Developments in Congress

 BODY:

HOUSE -- Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve Board, offered Republicans a painless way to cut the budget: changing the way the Government calculates inflation. He told a joint meeting of the House and Senate Budget Committees that the Consumer Price Index now exaggerates annual inflation by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points, leading to higher payments for Social Security and Government pensions and lower revenues from those taxes that are pegged to inflation. Correcting those estimates, Mr. Greenspan said, could save the Federal Government $150 billion over five years.
Republicans welcomed his suggestion, but it did not distract Democrats from demanding that Republicans "show us the fine print," as Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri and House minority leader, put it. 
 Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, told the House Ways and Means Committee that the Administration would support separating children from their parents in some cases in which the parents repeatedly refused to work while receiving cash welfare benefits.
While calling for many changes in the House Republicans' welfare proposals, Dr. Shalala sought common ground with the Republicans on other points. "We are committed first and foremost to insuring that everybody who can work does work," she said. If able-bodied women refused to comply with work requirements, she said, they should lose their welfare benefits, and the children could be taken away from the parents by state authorities and placed in foster care or group homes or put up for adoption.
 
SENATE --The Senate debated, but did not act on, legislation that would subject Congress to most of the same civil rights and employment laws that private employers must already obey. The House acted on the measure in 20 minutes last week.
Robert E. Rubin, nominated by President Clinton to succeed Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury Secretary, won swift and unanimous approval from the Senate without debate, only hours after he had appeared for a cordial confirmation hearing before the Finance Committee.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MEXICO DEEPENS DAMAGE IN LATIN MARKETS

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Any hope that the Mexican Government's austere economic recovery plan and an international loan package would calm the nation's financial markets seemed to evaporate today as the stock market here plunged and the peso flirted with a new low against the dollar.
The damage in Mexican financial markets carried over to other Latin American stock exchanges, with some losses exceeding 8 percent 
 There was growing concern here that the emergency plan announced last week by President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon was not strong enough to stabilize the peso and avoid uncontrolled inflation.
The Government's agreement with Mexican labor and business to hold down wage and price increases now seemed threatened by indications that inflation this year would far exceed official estimates -- making it likely that labor unions would demand wage increases higher than the 7 to 10 percent they have been offered.
Some analysts predicted that the Government would have to ask for even more help from its trading partners, particularly the United States. One option would be for Washington to help renegotiate Mexico's debt and then guarantee bonds issued by the Mexican Government to help pay that debt. This is essentially what the United States Government did to help Mexico out of its 1982 debt crisis.
Mexican officials were in Japan and Britain today, negotiating for further funds to add to an $18 billion international credit line that Mexico can tap to support its sagging currency and meet its debt obligations.
On Monday, Mexico used the credit line to buy pesos and, it hoped, bolster their value. But today, the currency continued to slide, closing at 5.85 pesos to dollar, a one-day decline of 8.1 percent. Since the forced devaluation and floating of the peso late last month, the currency has deteriorated against the dollar more than 40 percent.
Talks also continued with the International Monetary Fund and other international groups in an attempt to restore Mexico's financial health and line up additional money.
The turmoil in the markets today was set off by different sparks -- including a Government debt auction that failed to attract enough investors, and a short-term interest rate of 50 percent that may have prompted stockholders to sell those securities and instead buy short-term Government bonds and notes.
All this reverberated in other Latin American markets, as traders tended to view Latin America as a monolith. Exchanges in Argentina, Brazil and Peru all reported huge one-day losses. In New York, the American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, the telephone monopoly, were the most actively traded issue, skidding to a new low.
"It was very near a panic" in Mexico, said Jonathan E. Heath, a financial consultant in Mexico City. "Nobody was buying anything."
United States Treasury and Federal Reserve officials in Washington refused to discuss the Mexican crisis. Of the $18 billion credit line, the United States has put up $9 billion, and the possibility of further American assistance is now considered limited. Direct aid would have to be approved by Congress, and the new Republican majority appears to have little enthusiasm for foreign aid.
Mexico's stock exchange was roiled by these and other perceptions throughout the day, and by early afternoon was down as much as 11.3 percent. At that point, the Government started buying stocks to help stabilize the market, which eventually closed at 1,972.33, down 131.72, or 6.26 percent, from Monday's close.
The selloff followed a 6.65 percent decline on Monday and left the Mexican market with a drop of 31.5 percent, in peso terms, since its record high level of last February.
Investors today were also said to be concerned by reports from the southern state of Chiapas that a confrontation between local officials and angry peasants had resulted in an exchange of gunfire and several deaths. Officials said that the rebel Zapatista army had not been involved in the shooting.
Today was the third straight Tuesday in which the stock market recorded sharp declines. That reflected uncertainty among investors both in Mexico and in the United States over what the Government would do with $28 billion in bonds that come due this year. Each Tuesday in recent weeks, the Government has tried to auction new bonds with little success. The bondholders must be paid in pesos, but the amounts they receive fluctuate with the dollar exchange rate, and thus represent a high risk for Mexico.
At present, Mexico's international reserves stand at about $5.5 billion. Even with the $18 billion credit line from the United States and other nations, Mexico has access to less than $24 billion.
Officials here have said that they intend to offer new, more attractive bonds in about two weeks to entice investors to keep their money in this country. But after today's dismal stock and bond performances, some analysts thought that the Government would have to make those alternatives known much sooner.
"If anything, what happened today may accelerate events," said Jorge O. Mariscal, manager of the Latin American Equity Group at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "There still is not a very good sense that these guys are in control of the situation."
Mr. Mariscal and other analysts said that the interest rates now offered by the Government, ranging from 20 to 50 percent, did not sufficiently outweigh the risk of further deterioration in the peso's value. Although the Government's own estimates of inflation for 1995 are less than 20 percent, many private economists think it could reach as high as 40 or 50 percent.
At those rates, even interest of 50 percent on short-term Government debt notes would be unattractive.
The Government tried today to auction $400 million in bonds pegged to the peso-dollar exchange rate. However, it was able to sell only $63 million of that, despite an interest rate of 20 percent.
The Government's actions in response to the financial crisis have been focused on strengthening the peso, not the stock market. The central bank has raised interest rates to induce investors to consider buying a relatively small amount of Government bonds trading today in secondary markets. With rates as high as 50 percent, the Government hoped to bolster the peso in that separate arena.
But the high short-term interest, payment of which is guaranteed by the Mexican Government, hurt the stock market by luring away investors' money.
"The Government is not worrying about the stock market right now," said John F. H. Purcell, managing director of Emerging Markets Research at Salomon Brothers in New York. "At this point, they probably view the market as a short-term problem that they're going to take care of in the future."
United States investors in the bellwether Telefonos de Mexico were among those battered in today's brutal stock trading. American depository receipts of Telmex were the most widely traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, plunging $3.125 to close at $33.375. At its peak last February, Telmex sold for $75 a share.
Analysts said many investors had followed J. P. Morgan's downgrading today of Telmex from a "strong buy" to "market performer," which means that the company could no longer be expected to outperform other Mexican stocks.
"Portfolio managers were saying that their chances of recovering in 1995 are not too good," said Bette A. Massick of S. G. Warburg in New York. "They probably decided to dump Telmex now and maybe get back in later on."
President Zedillo met with legislators here this morning and told them that Mexico would come out of the current crisis stronger than before. Yesterday, he announced a new set of austerity measures, including a prohibition against first-class airline travel for Government officials.

Stocks Plunge in Region
 SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 10 (Reuters) -- Latin American stocks plunged today in volatile trading in reaction to the deepening financial troubles of Mexico.
The Argentine stock market fell 9.59 percent, while Brazil's leading stock index dropped 9.86 percent. Peru's smaller market plunged 8.42 percent -- all of those selloffs well exceeding the 6.26 percent fall in Mexican stocks.
Not even Chile, considered one of the most solid economies in the region, survived the market turmoil. The leading Chilean stock index fell 4.86 percent.
"It a total regional panic on the part of both local and foreign investors, sophisticated and unsophisticated investors alike," said Brian Barish, head of Latin American equity strategy at Lazard Freres. "Everybody is basically freaking out."
Many Latin American stock markets have fallen since Mexico devalued its peso on Dec. 20, though individual country markets have bucked the trend from time to time, rising unpredictably. In all of today's financial carnage, for instance, the Colombian stock market 0.39 percent.
Today's plunge stemmed in large part, analysts said, from selling by mutual fund managers who were raising cash by salvaging profits in Latin America's better-performing markets. "If you're getting redemptions in a Latin America fund or global fund, you'd probably sell what you have a profit in, and that's Brazil, Peru and Chile," said Rod Harada, Latin America analyst at Nomura Securities.
There were obvious fears that Mexico's problems could spread to other Latin American countries.
Argentina's Economy Minister, Domingo Cavallo, met with bankers in New York today in an attempt to convince them that the Argentine economy was sound and that there was no risk of a devaluation.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: THE OVERVIEW;
As Parties Skirmish Over Budget, Greenspan Offers a Painless Cure

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
As Democrats kept demanding that Republicans spell out their plans for cutting the budget, the head of the Federal Reserve Board offered them an initially painless way to do it: changing the way the Government calculates inflation.
Alan Greenspan told a joint meeting of the House and Senate Budget Committees that the Consumer Price Index now exaggerates annual inflation by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points. That leads to higher payments for Social Security and government pensions and lower revenues from those taxes that are pegged to inflation. 
 Mr. Greenspan said correcting those estimates could save the Federal Government $150 billion over five years, which could be used for tax cuts or spending without increasing the deficit.
A change in calculating the Consumer Price Index could cost typical Social Security recipients $3.49 to $10.47 a month. Phil Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said today that the current average monthly benefit is $698. One and a half percent of that, the high range of overestimating cited by Mr. Greenspan is $10.47, while 0.5 percent of it, his low estimate, is $3.49.
It would also affect pensions tied to the rate of inflation and union contracts with automatic adjustments based on inflation. The index is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it would be politically difficult for the Labor Department in a Democratic Administration to move directly to change those estimates.
Republicans welcomed his suggestion, even though it could bring attacks from the Social Security lobby, one of the nation's strongest. It also failed to distract Democrats from keeping up a drumbeat of demands that Republicans "show us the fine print," of their budget balancing plans as Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, put it.
Mr. Gephardt, testifying first before the House Budget Committee and then before the Ways and Means Committee, argued that a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget should be approved only if supporters would first spell out the cuts they would make to reach that goal. He said he would introduce an "honest budget bill" to require such accounting.
Orrin G. Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said supporters of any proposal like Mr. Gephardt's were "not serious about a balanced budget amendment because they know that kills it."
His committee today put off a vote on the proposed amendment for a week, and opponents began to speak hopefully of their chances of defeating it in the Senate. It would take 34 votes to deny the measure the two-thirds majority required for a constitutional amendment, and 33 of last year's 37 opponents are still in office. They hope the "honest budget" argument can win them a few more critical votes. The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote on the amendment Wednesday.
Another House committee actually began the process of cutting spending. The Appropriations Committee began looking for ways to take back money that has already been committed for spending in the current fiscal year. Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman, said "we are looking for billions" in cuts.
Mr. Gephardt also told the Ways and Means Committee that Democrats were working on a tax plan with fewer tax breaks and fewer tax brackets. He said he would not go as far as many Republicans who favor a "flat tax," with only one rate for all taxpayers. But he said he could back a "flatter tax," under which most Americans except those with very high incomes would pay only about 10 or 11 percent.
He said he ultimately favored this approach because most efforts to change social policy through tax incentives had failed. "I don't think you can micromanage society through the tax code," he said. But in the short run, he urged a tax cut for workers earning less than $75,000 a year.
The Greenspan proposal was an unusual departure for the Fed chairman, who habitually declines to advise Congress on budget matters. Mr. Greenspan volunteered that changes in the index would cut spending and increase tax revenues and thus help reduce the deficit.
That would help solve the Republican problem of trying to balance the budget without formally raising taxes.
Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Budget Committee, initially said after hearing Mr. Greenspan's that the Government's calculations of the Consumer Price Index should be adjusted. He said he had already discussed the idea with Representative Bill Archer, the Texan who heads the Ways and Means Committee.
"We will attempt to incorporate accurate C.P.I. estimates," he said. Later, during a break in the hearing, he was more cautious in speaking to reporters. "Clearly the fact that we may have been overstating the C.P.I. and may have been having more entitlement spending than mandated under the law is something we are going to look at very, very carefully."
The idea that the C.P.I. overstates annual inflation is not original with Mr. Greenspan. The Congressional Budget Office estimated late last year that it exaggerated inflation by from 0.2 to 0.8 percentage point. Top Labor Department officials have also acknowledged that the index is an exaggeration.
It is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and adjusted about once each decade, so that it fails to capture fully such changes as suddenly successful inventions like television sets in the early 1950's or the introduction of more sophisticated computers, which reduce prices and enhance efficiency.
Mr. Greenspan based his $150 billion estimate on a one percentage point reduction in the Federal Government's inflation estimates. "If the annual inflation adjustments in the indexed programs and taxes were reduced by one percentage point," he said, "and making the admittedly strong assumption that there are no other changes in the economy -- the annual level of the deficit will be lower by about $55 billion after five years, with cumulative five-year savings, I might add, of about $150 billion."
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is now working on a regular revision of the price index, a process likely to take another year or two to complete.
A more direct approach, one Mr. Greenspan suggested as a possibility today, would be for Congress to pass a law providing that current laws that adjust benefits based on the Consumer Price Index be amended so that the adjustment would be lower by a percentage point, or half a percentage point.
Such an approach would be almost certain to invite opposition from groups representing Social Security recipients, who are probably the nation's most effective lobby.

HEADLINE: Moscow Reaches for Moral High Ground as Truce Fails

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 10

 BODY:
With its ground troops tightening their grip on the besieged city of Grozny, Russia today declared a 48-hour cease-fire, but it collapsed within hours.
The reprieve to battle-weary combatants in Grozny, the Chechen capital, was scant. But the politically battered Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, seized on the cease-fire declaration to try to win back some of the international and domestic support that has drained away during the brutal month-old Russian military operation. 
 Even as Russian troops exchanged fire with Chechen rebels in the center of Grozny, Oleg Lobov, the secretary of Mr. Yeltsin's security council, told reporters in Moscow that the Russian proposal, which included an offer of amnesty to Chechens who laid down their arms, was a "historic moment" and "generous offer" to allow the rebels to "come to their senses" before a final Russian offensive.
Mr. Yeltsin, whose reputation was tarnished dramatically after he sent troops to restore Russian rule in the oil-producing, mostly Muslim republic, was working hard today to appeal to critics at home and abroad, painting the short-lived cease-fire as Russia's effort to give peace a chance.
In Moscow, representatives of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe said that the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, had told them that Russia would allow a fact-finding delegation from the 52-member security organization to visit Chechnya soon. Moscow had previously rejected such requests by foreign governments.
The Russian Government also said it would begin an independent inquiry into whether the armed forces had continued to bomb civilian targets even after Mr. Yeltsin had ordered a halt in the air strikes. Russian air raids on Grozny, which have killed hundreds of civilians and destroyed apartment houses and schools, horrified Russians and eventually prompted the United States and other countries to criticize Moscow's actions.
In an effort to recruit alienated Russian politicians into his tent, Mr. Yeltsin offered the Speakers of both houses of Parliament permanent seats on his security council, which until now has been made up of Cabinet ministers and national security advisers. The Speakers eagerly accepted.
The invitation, made on the eve of an emergency session on the Chechen crisis in the lower house of Parliament, seemed aimed at easing Mr. Yeltsin's strained relations with the country's elected officials.
But Yegor T. Gaidar, the liberal leader in Parliament who at one time served in the Cabinet and spearheaded Mr. Yeltsin's economic reforms, said his Russia's Choice faction would sponsor legislation to win back for Parliament some of the powers he had helped Mr. Yeltsin strip away.
"Our initiatives are aimed at blocking all legal ways for the Government to go ahead with hostilities in Chechnya," Mr. Gaidar said in a news conference.
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who was recently assigned to head negotiations with the Chechen leadership, met with Chechen emigres in Moscow and assured them that he was working on a plan to "resolve the Chechen conflict without the use of force." He added, "Our key task is to stop the bloodshed."
Russian television reported that Mr. Chernomyrdin also met privately today with Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the leader of Russia's ultranationalist party. Mr. Zhirinovsky's press office did not confirm the meeting. Throughout the crisis, the firebrand politician has been unusually silent, torn between his unbridled contempt for Mr. Yeltsin's leadership and his nationalistic desire to see Chechnya's bid for secession squelched.
But Sergei A. Kovalyov, the dissident who heads Mr. Yeltsin's commission on human rights and who first suggested the cease-fire in a phone conversation with Mr. Chernomyrdin, bitterly denounced the Russian Government's amended version of it as an ultimatum.
Mr. Kovalyov, who had hoped the truce would allow the removal of casualties from the battle zone, said he would return to Grozny to help evacuate the wounded. He had spent two dangerous weeks in the city drawing public attention to the hundreds of civilians killed in bombing raids and artillery attacks. He has been Mr. Yeltsin's most outspoken critic.
Described in Moscow as a humanitarian action aimed at exchanging captured, wounded and dead soldiers, the cease-fire declaration did not bring gunfire in Grozny to a halt, although a brief lull was reported in heavy fighting was reported. The Interfax news agency reported that some wounded and dead soldiers were evacuated from the bombed-out and blackened presidential palace during that lull, and that trucks delivered bread and water to the building.
"The cease-fire declaration is to some extent a recognition of public sentiment about the war," said Sergei Rogov, a military expert at the U.S.A.-Canada institute in Moscow. "Russians have been tremendously shocked by all this -- it's a new experience for us to watch civil war in Russia on our television sets."
Mr. Rogov predicted that Russian troops might still be able to seize Grozny within a week while claiming that, with the truce offer, they had given peace a chance. "It will be a hollow victory," he said, referring to his belief that a prolonged guerrilla war in Chechnya would spread to other volatile regions of the Caucasus. "But this will allow some politicians in Moscow to claim victory."

Relief Team Held Up
 UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 10 (Special to The New York Times) -- A United Nations relief team, waiting to fly into of Chechnya, has been forbidden permission to leave Moscow for two days, and the only explanation offered is that weather conditions make landing in the area too dangerous, a United Nations spokesman said today.
The spokesman said that other aircraft had been allowed to take off and land in the area.
The Russian Federal Migration Service, which is responsible for refugees, requested relief aid from the United Nations for Chechnya on Dec. 27. Two planeloads of medical supplies, food parcels and plastic sheeting have been waiting to depart from the Netherlands and Turkey as soon as the United Nations team has viewed conditions in Chechnya and prepared an assessment of the needs of the region's civilian population.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Ease Economic Curbs On North Korea This Month

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
As part of an effort to get North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, American officials said today that they planned to ease some economic restrictions against North Korea in the next two weeks.
In addition, the officials said they planned to urge nations in Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia to help finance new power plants for North Korea. 
 Administration officials welcomed the announcement that North Korea made on Monday to end its ban on trade, financial transactions and telephone links with the United States. These officials said the United States would soon reciprocate, most likely by easing its four-decade-old embargo against North Korea, a move called for in an agreement last October settling Washington's dispute with North Korea over its nuclear program.
In the October agreement, North Korea promised to freeze, and ultimately dismantle, its nuclear power program in exchange for a pledge to provide it with the two light-water reactors. The spent fuel from those reactors is far harder to turn into weapons-grade material than the fuel from North Korea's existing graphite reactors.
Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, said that the Administration had not yet decided which restrictions to ease. But State Department officials said the October agreement calls for easing the sanctions on trade, telecommunications links or financial transactions.
Administration officials acknowledged they were moving gingerly on easing restrictions in light of the recent incident in which North Korea shot down an American helicopter. One pilot died and the other pilot was released only after tense negotiations between the two countries.
State Department officials met here today with Japanese and South Korean diplomats to discuss the best way to raise $4 billion to finance the two new light-water nuclear reactors for North Korea. American officials said they hoped to persuade as many countries as possible to join Japan, South Korea and the United States in financing the project. Japan and South Korea are expected to put up the major part of the money.
Robert Gallucci, the Administration's chief negotiator with North Korea, plans to go to Europe later this month to seek additional financial pledges, while Thomas C. Hubbard, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, will travel to Southeast Asia to do likewise. Other officials will visit Persian Gulf countries as well as Australia and New Zealand to urge them to contribute.
The White House also announced today that it would send officials to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang from Jan. 31 to Feb. 4 to examine sites to set up a liaison office there. Under the October accord, the two countries promised to establish liaison offices.
Fearing that Republicans in Congress might block the North Korea agreement, Administration officials said today that they hoped Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan, who arrived in Washington today for a visit, would impress upon Congressional leaders that his country strongly backs the agreement.
"One of the questions we've been getting from Republicans is, how come you're so strongly in favor of the agreement when the South Koreans and Japanese don't like it," a State Department official said. "It will be useful for Murayama to tell the Hill that Japan is strongly in favor of the agreement."
In addition, the Administration has sent Walter F. Mondale, the Ambassador to Japan, to Capitol Hill to help shore up support for the accord. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, has said Congress will hold hearings to examine the agreement, especially the Administration's promise to provide some economic aid to North Korea.
Under the agreement, the Administration promised to furnish North Korea with 50,000 tons of heavy oil by Jan. 21, a move intended to help provide the country with energy until the new reactors are built. The agreement calls for foreign countries to provide North Korea with 500,000 tons of oil per year for approximately 10 years.

HEADLINE: Photos Show Iraqis With Stolen Kuwaiti Arms

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The United States offered the Security Council pictures today to prove that when Iraqi troops moved toward the Kuwaiti border last October they were armed with advanced equipment stolen from Kuwait during the Persian Gulf war.
The presentation, complete with detailed lists of captured equipment still believed to be in Iraqi hands, was Washington's opening salvo in a review of sanctions imposed on the Government of President Saddam Hussein. Under a 1991 Security Council resolution, Iraq must return stolen Kuwaiti property before sanctions are lifted. 
 Iraq has said in the past that the missing Kuwaiti equipment was destroyed or not under its control. The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, challenged that assertion today with satellite photographs showing some of the material, including armored personnel carriers and missile launchers, deployed with the elite Iraqi Republican Guards. Hardware and vehicles of Russian and American origin were included.
"This equipment had been used in an offensive capability during the October events by the Republican Guard," Ms. Albright told reporters after the closed-door Council session. "This is not latent equipment, but equipment that is being used to enhance the capability of the Iraqi military."
Pressure is building in the Council to begin relaxing a web of sanctions and embargos that has crippled Iraq's economy. A more comprehensive review will take place in March, when Russia and France are expected to propose formally that sanctions be lifted piecemeal as Iraq meets certain demands.
The United States and Britain strongly oppose rewarding Iraq in any way until President Hussein has demonstrated good faith as well as technical compliance.
British and American diplomats seized on a new report today by Rolf Ekeus, leader of a team monitoring the destruction of Iraqi weapons, which again proved that Baghdad had been withholding information on its past chemical weapons program.
"Miraculously, after his rather tough report in December, the Iraqis found a lot more material," Sir David Hannay, Britain's chief delegate, told reporters after the briefing by Mr. Ekeus. "They always do seem to find a lot more material when they have to."
Sir David said that by confronting the Iraqis, Mr. Ekeus had elicited confirmation of information found elsewhere about the extent of their chemical weapons program in the mid-1980's.
"We are still adrift post-1987," he said, adding that there were also problems with machine tools apparently used in ballistic missile systems that would have to be destroyed and some questions remaining about the history of Iraq's biological weapons.
During her Council briefing, Ms. Albright showed photographs of 29 launchers for Soviet-era Frog-7 short-range missiles deployed at Taji, in southern Iraq. Before the gulf war, Iraq was believed to have only 25. She also showed Russian armored personnel carriers code-named BMP-2, and mentioned that the Soviet delegate, Sergei V. Lavrov, could attest to their qualities.
Lists of captured equipment, prepared by the United States and Kuwait, were distributed to Council members. Among the missing equipment are about 1,750 Jeeps and Land Rovers, at least 2,000 trucks, 4,000 TOW antitank missiles, ambulances, firefighting vehicles, buses, motorcycles and thousands of radios.
Kuwait had both Soviet and American equipment in its arsenal, as did Iraq. But Kuwait had certain models of Soviet-made arms and tracked vehicles that Iraq did not possess. That rules out the possibility that at least some of the weapons and vehicles photographed in October were Iraqi all along, and not Kuwaiti, a Kuwaiti diplomat said.
Security Council Resolution 686 of March 2, 1991, requires that Iraq "immediately begin to return all Kuwaiti property." A similar demand was made in Resolution 687 the next month.
The Council also demanded that Iraq release prisoners and account for Kuwaiti citizens listed as missing after the war. Russia has been trying to help Iraq speed up accounting of the prisoners and missing Kuwaitis, Mr. Lavrov told reporters.
Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia was instrumental in talking the Iraqis into a formal recognition last year of Kuwait in its postwar borders. That important step, coupled with progress in accounting for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, led to increased pressure from Russia and France to begin lifting or easing sanctions.

HEADLINE: Americans Say Gains Won't Come Quickly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
An agreement to open a range of Japanese financial markets to foreign competition was not greeted with unbridled enthusiasm by American money managers yesterday, even though the accord gives them access to more than $1 trillion of pension fund assets.
Even as they expressed pleasure that the agreement to open Japan's private and public pension funds to foreign firms had finally been reached, representatives of some of the nation's largest brokerage firms, mutual fund companies and investment banks said enacting the agreement could prove even more difficult than the negotiations that produced it. 
 "The key to any agreement is implementation," said David Strongin, vice president and director of international finance at the Securities Industry Association. "But to the extent the agreement does provide procedural protections, that is significant. Basically, it makes the laws more open and more fair."
Even with the agreement, officials at American firms said, the economics of pension fund management in Japan are far different than in the United States. It will take years to generate significant profits from the business, they added.
Compounding that problem is the Japanese investment culture, in which longstanding financial and economic relationships between pension funds and their managers remain formidable barriers to entry.
Still, executives at American firms said they were happy to have the chance.
"For the first time in quite a while, we have some agreements that on their face open up new opportunities," said Robert Pozen, general counsel and managing director at Fidelity Investments. "This is the first major progress in years."
Until the Japanese pension funds form a substantial base of business -- something that could take as long as a decade to accomplish -- doing business with them is unlikely to generate significant returns, because fees are relatively low and the costs are high.
"The margins are thin because newcomers in Japan normally get a small amount of exposure, like $10 million to $20 million," one senior executive in New York for a Japanese securities house said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
"And unlike sponsors of American pension funds, Japanese pension funds require a lot of different services from their managers," the executive said. "It is very time-consuming and costly. Any serious manager has to be patient, and has to respond to all those requests."
Under the terms of the agreement, foreign firms will have more access to public pension funds than to corporate pension funds.
Public pension funds are the fastest-growing segment of the pension fund market in Japan, Mr. Strongin said. By the end of the decade, those funds may have around $400 billion of assets.
Foreign firms had some access to the corporate pension fund market before the agreement, and they may see competition freed up a bit more. But trying to forge a niche between big Japanese companies and their fund managers will be a challenge.
"This is very much a relationship-driven business," said a Wall Street analyst who follows Japanese companies, "because the companies which have asset management relationships are often clients in other businesses, and shareholders as well. The links are extremely tight."
George A. Murnaghan, a vice president at Rowe Price-Fleming International, said: "We will not be able to establish ourselves in Japan tomorrow and expect to see significant assets coming to American firms. The concept of giving money to non-Japanese asset managers will evolve over time. And that has more to do with Japan's culture than the law."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Merrill Cites Warning to Big County

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
In a belated effort to defend itself against the heavy criticism it has received since Orange County, Calif., declared bankruptcy last month, Merrill Lynch & Company released letters yesterday showing that it had warned the county as early as 1992 about the risks that its ill-fated investment fund was taking.
The letters were to the Orange County treasurer, Robert L. Citron, whose management of the county's investment fund led to more than $2 billion in losses and touched off the county's bankruptcy and current financial crisis. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Merrill for possible fraud in connection with its dealings with Orange County. In addition, holders of some of the county's notes underwritten by Merrill have filed suit against the Wall Street company, which had done business with Orange County for more than two decades.
While the documents shed some new light on the relationship between Merrill and Mr. Citron, they also raise new questions and leave others unanswered.
Merrill for the first time released some of the correspondence between Mr. Citron and Michael G. Stamenson, the Merrill salesman whom some blame for masterminding the county's ultimately disastrous investment strategy.
The key to the strategy was to borrow heavily against the fund's assets, making big bets that interest rates would remain low. The fund also bought derivatives, which are financial instruments whose value depends on the performance of underlying assets like stocks or bonds.
The correspondence discloses that Merrill warned Mr. Citron as early as 1992 that he might be taking too great a risk with the county fund. In March 1993, Merrill offered to buy back at a profit to the fund all the derivative securities that Merrill had sold to it.
The derivatives purchased by Mr. Citron were extremely vulnerable to large losses if there was a sharp jump in interest rates. But Mr. Citron, in his April 26, 1993, response, declined Merrill's offer, saying that he was aware of the volatile nature of the fund's investments.
"It is typical -- but nonetheless disingenuous -- that some now maintain that they were not aware of the potential risks involved in the county's investment strategy," Daniel P. Tully, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, wrote to the company's employees in Southern California yesterday in a memo in which he referred to the warning letters.
David Wiechert, Mr. Citron's lawyer, declined late yesterday to comment directly on the correspondence, which he had not seen. But he said that Merrill itself was being disingenuous by trying to keep itself at arm's-length from Mr. Citron.
"For Merrill Lynch to distance themselves from this crisis, would be akin to Exxon distancing themselves from the Valdez," he said, referring to the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground in 1989, spilling oil in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
Among the unanswered questions, Mr. Tully's memo does not mention the $600 million one-year note underwritten by Merrill for Orange County last July which was deposited into the fund only a short time before rising interest rates began drying up its cash. If Merrill was aware of the risks the fund was taking, why did it agree to underwrite the notes? And why did it not include in its prospectus for the issue the kind of warning that it sent to Mr. Citron?
Merrill has said that all the proper disclosures were made in the offering document circulated to investors.
Mr. Tully also asserted that the derivatives it sold Mr. Citron were not "as exotic or high-risk as some accounts have inaccurately described them." But if this was the case, the company did not say why it had offered to buy them back?
In a June 1993, letter, Mr. Stamenson, the Merrill salesman, explained that the company was making the offer to allow Orange County the opportunity to lower its risk at a profit.
"While the decision is yours to make, it was our hope to assist you in bringing the O.C. portfolio in line with a risk that is less leveraged and better positioned to perform in the event of unanticipated movements in interest rates," Mr. Stamenson wrote.
But Mr. Citron would not be swayed. "It was only after extensive consultation with highly placed Merrill Lynch officials by conference call, in person, and in writing well over a year ago that we felt secure in investing an even larger percentage of our portfolio in derivative securities," he wrote in April 1993.

HEADLINE: Businesses Face the Facts of Curbs on Smoking

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
After months of fighting it, businesses have begun dealing with the reality of the smoking law signed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday.
Frank's, an Italian steakhouse in Manhattan's meatpacking district, is moving around the corner to a new space with enough room for a segregated smoking lounge. Chanterelle, the elegant TriBeCa restaurant, says it deeply regrets not being able to allow a practice it thinks it has been able to control, but will comply with the law and refer all complaints to City Hall. 
 Leisure Time Bowling in the Port Authority Building welcomes the new restrictions and promises to enforce them aggressively. But Bowlmor Lanes on University Place despairs over having to confine smokers to designated areas. "I'm not the police," said Theodore Bournis, who owns the alley. "There's nothing I can do, believe me."
Mayor Giuliani signed the law after a heated two-hour hearing yesterday that featured, on one side, business representatives who said the city's restaurant and hotel trade would suffer, and on the other, a bartender and a beauty queen in a rhinestone crown who said they resented second-hand smoke.
The law goes into effect on April 10. It strengthens current law by imposing further restrictions on smoking in restaurants and work places and, for the first time, extends restrictions to outdoor areas like parks and stadiums. The old law allowed smoking in contiguous smoking areas in restaurants seating more than 50 people and did not regulate smoking in restaurants seating 50 people or less. The new law allows smoking only in restaurants seating 35 or fewer people.
In work places, the new law restricts smoking to separately ventilated smoking rooms and to private offices, as long as no more than three people are present and all agree to allow it. The old law did not regulate the number who could be smoking at any one time in private offices.
Across the city yesterday, many restaurants and business places said they were unsure what the law would mean or how they would respond to it. Others, like Chase Manhattan Bank, which has a single smoking lounge for 5,000 employees, said it already complies. And still others, grumbling, said they would comply.
The Mayor had left little doubt during yesterday's hearing that he would sign the measure. More than 100 cities and 4 states have passed no-smoking ordinances for public places. "This is where the rest of America is going," Mr. Giuliani said. "New York City is going to get there a little bit slower than others and a little bit faster than others."
William Althaus, an official of the Smokers Alliance, a smoking group that claims 200,000 members in the city, said he and his allies had entertained no hope of changing the Mayor's mind. "We're here to plant the seeds of doubt," he said. "We want economic data collected to be used to evaluate the harm of this law within a year."
During the 10 months the law was debated in the Council, officials heard from lobbyists and business people who said the law could put some restaurants out of business. Philip Morris, which has its headquarters on Park Avenue, said it would consider leaving town.
In November, the Council loosened some of the original restrictions. Philip Morris said yesterday that it was examining its options, and a spokeswoman, Ellen Merlo, emphasized that any decision would be made in accordance with "courtesy and good manners."
She said the company already has policies to safeguard the 70 percent of its employees who do not smoke. "We don't believe nonsmokers should be subjected to smoke if they don't want to be," she said.
At Frank's yesterday, the restaurant's owners swore they would never ask their most elderly patrons -- one of whom, they say, is 104 and has been coming in since the restaurant's inception -- to extinguish their beloved stogies.
But they are careful to emphasize that they plan to comply fully with the city's new law, after they move from their current address at 431 West 14th Street around the block to a new location on 15th Street, which will feature a smoking lounge, designed in scrupulous compliance with the new regulations.
"Some customers have been smoking cigars in here since before I was born," said Christopher Molinari, whose family has owned the restaurant for three generations.
At Chanterelle, at 2 Harrison Street, Karen Waltuck, the owner, said she was sad that her customers could no longer have everything they want. "We like to take care of people's vices too," she said.
But she added: "In a way, it's nice to have all the responsibility taken from us as far as this question is concerned. But that's not something I'm seeking."
Diners at the restaurant also criticized the law. "Like Fidel said, I enjoy a good Havana after my meal," said James Brown, a business executive. "I think it's very discriminatory."
At another table, William Higgins, a portfolio manager, agreed: "In my own view, the legislation is discriminatory, and I speak as a nonsmoker. I begin to feel solidarity with a new oppressed class, the smoker."

HEADLINE: Suspect Told Police He Found Firebomb in Bag

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
The paper bag was crumpled up on the floor in the subway car when he first saw it. He looked in and saw two jars containing what looked like chicken soup. Suddenly, it just "went up." And he was on fire.
That is the account Edward J. Leary gave detectives as he was being arrested in the firebombing that injured 40 people on a crowded subway train in Manhattan three weeks ago, according to a court document released yesterday. 
 The document, which was released as Mr. Leary was arraigned yesterday in his room in New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, is the first official account of what he told the authorities about the incident on a southbound No. 4 train on Dec. 21. He pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder, assault, attempted grand larceny and possession of a weapon.
In interviews a few hours after the firebomb went off and the next day, when he was arrested, Mr. Leary, a 49-year-old unemployed computer expert, told the police he was on his way to leave his resume with an employment agency when the bomb ignited.
He told Detective Michael Sapraicone on Dec. 22 at the hospital that he usually avoids subway cars that "smell" of "homeless people" and found himself in a car that was crowded.
"He stood in the center of the train where he saw a brown paper bag on the floor," the detective wrote. "It was crumpled up. He kicked it towards the back door where he stood by it."
Detective Sapraicone wrote: "I asked him why he kicked it. He said because he had dropped his resume. It had fallen under the bag. He looked into the bag. It had two jars in it that looked like it was chicken soup."
The train pulled into the station and the doors opened. "As he picked up his resume," Detective Sapraicone wrote, "the bag just went up."
Detective Sapraicone said that Mr. Leary could not understand how anyone could do "such a terrible thing," and that he noticed that Mr. Leary "looked as if he had a tear in his eye."
When the detective pressed on, saying it was good for a person to own up to his mistakes, Mr. Leary "sobbed and shook his head and a tear came out of his left eye. He then said, 'You have the wrong guy.' "

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Stay Low, With Gain for '94 Only 1.7%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Despite hefty cost increases for many industrial materials, the prices of finished goods rose only modestly in December, the Government said today. For all of 1994, the advance in the inflation index for goods at the final stage before reaching consumers was just 1.7 percent.
Producers thus continued to absorb higher manufacturing costs, as fierce competition in many industries has largely prevented them from passing increases along to customers. 
 But while visible inflation remains largely at bay -- up only two-tenths of 1 percent last month -- economists said they did not expect the fresh data to dissuade the Federal Reserve from further increases in short-term interest rates. That is because of fears that unless the economy cools off, the higher costs at the earlier stages of production could feed into a broader rise in inflation.
The main concern is at the earlier stages of production, where prices for intermediate goods, like a bolt of cloth, and for crude goods, like raw wool or cotton, have risen substantially in recent months.
After two consecutive years with increases of only 1 percent, the Labor Department's index of intermediate goods climbed 4.4 percent during 1994. And even though the prices of intermediate goods rose a moderate three-tenths of 1 percent last month, they jumped six-tenths of 1 percent when the wide-swinging food and energy components were removed.
And crude goods, though also up three-tenths of 1 percent for the month, jumped 2.5 percent without food and energy. That lifted the so-called core crude prices 17 percent higher than the December 1993 level.
"While price pressures at the finished goods level remain remarkably benign, we feel the Fed is paying closer attention to what's happening to prices at the crude and intermediate stages," said Joseph Liro, economist at S. G. Warburg. "These prices are forward looking measures."
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that wholesale inventories increased for a fifth consecutive month in November, while sales were slightly lower. Inventories held by merchant wholesalers grew 1.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $235.12 billion, after a sharply revised rise of 1.5 percent in October.
The steady rise in stocks of goods on hand in the final months of 1994 indicated that wholesalers were anticipating strong holiday sales. It also helped overall economic growth in the closing quarter by keeping production at brisk levels.
The department's report on consumer price inflation for December is scheduled to be published on Wednesday. Economists expect an increase of about three-tenths of 1 percent, meaning that 1994 is all but certain to be the third consecutive year with inflation at less than 3 percent.
Still, there is little doubt now that earlier-stage price pressure on industrial items like aluminum and copper are too strong to be fully contained. Durables used in manufacturing climbed 1.4 percent last month, after an increase of 1.7 percent in November. Those prices are now 9.8 percent higher than a year ago, nearly four times the 1993 increase, the department said.
"This is slowly filtering through -- and that's likely to continue," said Robert T. McGee, economist at the Tokai Bank Ltd. in New York. "It's a case of moving from no inflation to low inflation."
The finished goods index was dominated in December by gyrations in which a big leap in food prices was offset by sharply lower prices for energy.
Food rose 1.6 percent. In contrast, energy tumbled 1.5 percent, as gasoline prices fell 4.5 percent, to reverse an increase in November. Nearly one-third of the decline for gasoline reflected an adjustment for quality improvement, the introduction of reformulated fuel needed to meet environmental standards in certain parts of the country.
Though many companies are being squeezed by higher costs, some find no price pressures in either direction.
"We haven't seen any" significant increase in costs, said Billy T. Burney, president of the Burney Valve Company, a small maker of oilfield equipment in Sulphur Springs, Tex. But, he added, demand in the industry is so sluggish that "if there were any, we couldn't pass them on."

HEADLINE: New Tax Cut Is Promised By Whitman

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman promised a third round of tax cuts in her first State of the State address today, but she opened at least a semantic crack in her no-new-taxes pledge by saying she needed to renew an expiring vehicle surcharge to keep a state transportation fund afloat.
Mrs. Whitman also beat a temporary retreat on her vaunted school voucher plan for Jersey City by postponing for another year the measure, which had been meeting increasing resistance among legislators. The Governor appointed a study team to examine the idea until next year, when, she promised, she will move ahead with the program to give parents a free, subsidized choice of public or private schools in the city. 
 These concessions to political and fiscal reality hardly dampened Mrs. Whitman's exultant mood as she and her fellow Republicans in the majority in both houses of the Legislature awarded themselves the credit for New Jersey's steady economic recovery.
The Governor drew nothing but cheers from the Republicans when she delivered a rhetorical back of the hand to the former Governor of New York, Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat who frequently derided Mrs. Whitman's tax policies as he campaigned unsuccessfully for re-election last fall.
"A year ago, the Governor of New York looked at New Jersey and laughed," Mrs. Whitman said as knowing smiles turned to laughter and applause from the Legislature's Republican majority. "He said our plan to cut taxes and stimulate economic growth would never work. Well, today New York has a new Governor, George Pataki, and he has a copy of our plan on his desk. And nobody's laughing at New Jersey anymore!"
Democrats responded to the speech by reiterating their view that Mrs. Whitman's real interest was in national office and that any cuts she makes in state taxes and spending would have to be made up by raising local property taxes.
"The Governor's obvious theme is when in doubt, announce another tax cut," said John A. Lynch, the Senate Democrats' minority leader. "It's simple and it makes for a good sound bite, especially when you're talking to a national audience and not to New Jersey residents who have to pay the bills."
Whatever these detractions, the Governor's address was buoyant to the point of braggadocio: as a result of her policies, she said, her state is a regional leader in job growth and New Jersey has become a lodestar for tax cutters around the nation.
"We are growing faster than New York, faster than Pennsylvania, faster than Connecticut," she said, calling the state "the pocket of hope in the region.
It was the first time Mrs. Whitman had delivered a State of the State address. Her inauguration last year came a week after the formal opening of the Legislature, when the State Constitution calls for such a report. The Governor issued a report on the State of the State on Monday, but it lacked both the political edge and the fiscal news of the speech delivered at noon today.
In addition to the auto registration fee and school voucher issues, Mrs. Whitman repeated her promise to cut the state income tax rate again in her next budget, which is to be released on Jan. 23. She did not say how much the cut would be.
Mrs. Whitman also pledged to work for a variety of other changes in government: the merger of the Motor Vehicles Division into the Department of Transportation to save money, a guarantee to refund permit application fees to companies whose paper work is not cleared by a state regulator on schedule, a limit on the ability of state and local police and firefighters to win large wage settlements through binding arbitration, a revision of the state tort law to discourage frivolous lawsuits, and creation of a $40 million public-private Community Development Bank to finance small-business loans for urban areas.
Mrs. Whitman's new timetable on her voucher plan, a founding tenet of her administration, came after a year of pressure from the Legislature. The state teachers' union is raising money especially to fight the measure, and Assembly members, up for election this fall, were concerned that the Governor's plan required them to take political risks for a city outside their own districts.
The issue will instead be studied by a 15-member advisory commission for a year. Mrs. Whitman said she would, in any case, introduce legislation to begin the program for the 1996 school year.
Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, a rising Republican star like Governor Whitman, could barely conceal his disappointment at the postponement of a plan he had made his own. "Justice for our children will never be secured as long as their futures are in the hands of politicians who, as a group, will always be primarily concerned about their next election," the Mayor said in a statement.
Asked whether he was referring to Mrs. Whitman as well as the legislators, the Mayor said, "I'm trying to say, all politicians."
Democrats also accused Mrs. Whitman of playing politics by pretending that the motor vehicle fee was not a tax.
The state began charging a surcharge on motor vehicle registrations in 1990, under Gov. Jim Florio, to bail out a bankrupt bad-driver insurance fund. The insurance fund's deficit will be paid off, but now the Whitman administration has been casting about for sources of money to renew the Transportation Trust Fund, an $850 million-a-year subsidy program for road and bridge building and mass transit.
Extending the registration surcharge will produce $120 million a year, and the Governor will also seek a constitutional amendment to shift to the transportation fund an additional 3 cents of the existing state tax of 10.5 cents per gallon on motor fuel, for an additional $193 million a year. Currently, 2.5 cents of the fuel tax is earmarked for the fund.
Mrs. Whitman quickly rejected any idea that the surcharge extension amounted to a tax increase. "No," she said of that notion, "because we are not raising them, we are extending an existing fee, and we are doing it in a way that guarantees that we will not see fare increases in New Jersey Transit in the foreseeable future."
Besides taking credit for streamlining the state's regulatory system last year, the Governor noted that she had created an economic development commission whose plan to improve New Jersey's business climate is to be released on Wednesday. The commission is one of several set up by the Governor to work on state problems, with members drawn from business, education, labor and other nongovernment groups.
On Thursday, Mrs. Whitman plans to convene a meeting of state employee union leaders to solicit their ideas on the budget, for example.
"We are getting so good at bringing everyone to the table that we're thinking about offering our services to Major League Baseball," Governor Whitman joked during her address today. "But they haven't called yet."

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: WELFARE;
Clinton Has Tough Plan on Refusal to Work

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, told Congress today that the Administration would support separating children from their parents in some cases in which the parents repeatedly refused to work while receiving cash welfare benefits.
Dr. Shalala made the statement while testifying for more than two hours before the House Ways and Means Committee, which plans to recommend a comprehensive bill to revamp the nation's welfare system. 
 The Secretary, like other Democrats, called for many changes in the House Republicans' welfare proposal. But on some issues, she sought common ground with the Republicans.
"We are committed first and foremost to insuring that everybody who can work does work," Dr. Shalala said. If able-bodied women refuse to comply with work requirements, she said, they should lose their welfare benefits, and the children could be taken away from the parents by state authorities and placed in foster care or group homes or put up for adoption.
Dr. Shalala's comments came today as she offered an explanation and interpretation of the President's welfare bill, sent to Congress in June. Her comments were drawn out of her by Republican members of the committee.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the panel, said the Administration's position was somewhat similar to a Republican proposal that would make Federal money available to states "to establish and operate orphanages."
Dr. Shalala, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democrats, have harshly criticized the Republicans for proposing greater use of orphanages. And Administration officials said today that there was little similarity between their proposal and the ones made by Republicans like Speaker Newt Gingrich.
But Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said the difference between the plans of the Administration and the House Republicans was only a matter of degree. "When you cut off welfare because the parents don't comply with work requirements, you're punishing innocent children, and that's unacceptable," Mr. Stark told Dr. Shalala.
On other issues, Dr. Shalala urged Congress to be wary of proposals to give states a lump sum of money for welfare and food assistance. The danger with such "block grants," she said, is that the amount of money will not automatically grow to meet the need in time of recession.
The House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, told the committee that if Congress turned large amounts of money over to the states, it should set performance standards and demand specific results. "Let's tell the states that in return for a welfare block grant, they must insure that children in the poorest families -- say, those under 90 percent of the poverty level -- all have decent nutrition, housing and health care," Mr. Gephardt said.
Republicans said they were reconsidering their earlier proposals to cut off welfare and social service benefits for legal immigrants. But they said they might let states cut off such assistance.
Mr. Gephardt said he favored a tax cut for all workers earning less than $75,000 a year -- a simple credit, not tied to the number of children in a family or the amount of college tuition paid by the family. President Clinton and House Republicans have proposed a tax credit of $500 for each child. In addition, Mr. Clinton has proposed a tax deduction up to $10,000 a year for amounts spent by a taxpayer on college tuition.
Mr. Gephardt said House Democrats were working on proposals for a "flatter tax," with fewer tax breaks and fewer tax brackets. He said he had concluded that efforts to achieve social policy goals through tax laws had largely failed.
"I don't think you can micromanage society through the tax code," he said.

HEADLINE: Murray N. Rothbard, Economist And Free-Market Exponent, 68

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
Murray N. Rothbard, an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. A resident of Manhattan, he was 68.
The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Lew Rockwell. 
 Mr. Rothbard, who was born in New York City, received his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University in 1956. From 1963 to 1985, he taught at New York Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn.
Mr. Rothbard was the author of some two dozen books and many articles on economic theory. At the time of his death, he was a professor of economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and vice president of academic affairs at the Ludwig von Mises Institute at Auburn University in Alabama.
The Ludwig von Mises Institute is named for an Austrian economist who fled the Nazis and became Mr. Rothbard's mentor. Mr. Rockwell, who is the head of the institute, called Mr. Rothbard "the founder of right-wing anarchism."
Mr. Rothbard's admirers consider "Man, Economy and State," a 1962 book whose thesis is that the free market is the extension of the natural order, to be one of his most influential works. But Mr. Rothbard probably caused bigger stirs with his free-flowing, often acerbic observations.
In his view, for instance, Khrushchev and Eisenhower were on equal moral footing because the actions of both had caused many deaths. And, as he wrote in opinion pieces, the wage and price controls imposed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971 signaled that "fascism came to America," and that American farmers were not noble tillers of the soil but "businessmen, no more and no less, no more noble or wicked than other entrepreneurs."
Mr. Rothbard is survived by his wife of 41 years, JoAnn.

HEADLINE: NEW JAPAN ACCESS FOR WALL STREET

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The United States and Japan reached a broad accord today to open a range of Japanese financial markets to foreign competition, allowing American investment firms for the first time to vie for the right to manage nearly a trillion dollars in Japanese pension funds.
The accord was reached just hours before Japan's first Socialist Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, landed here for a meeting with President Clinton on Wednesday. 
 Wall Street brokerage houses and investment advisers have complained for years about a web of government regulations and corporate relationships that froze them out of the world's second-largest pool of pension funds. They greeted the accord with guarded optimism, questioning whether in practice they would get more than a narrow slice of the market. [Page D5.]
The last-minute agreement allows both Washington and Tokyo to avoid a repeat of the embarrassment that surrounded the last visit of a Japanese prime minister to Washington. That meeting in February resulted in a nasty disagreement and a breakdown in negotiations that lasted nearly eight months.
Clinton Administration officials hailed the financial services agreement today as further evidence that their high-pressure negotiating strategy has produced major changes. There have been agreements involving half a dozen industries, all except the one that probably means the most to the American economy -- autos and auto parts.
Japanese officials, in turn, expressed hope that the agreement would deflect the focus of the Wednesday meeting away from last year's record $60 billion trade gap between the United States and Japan. Their aim is to turn to the problem Japan most wants addressed at the session: finding a way to keep the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in August from turning into an exercise in recrimination.
For Mr. Murayama, who is holding onto power by only a thread, the financial services accord is also a chance to show that he can manage a relationship with the United States, which, as a Socialist, he once denounced as harmful to Japan's interests.
For years American investment advisers and brokerage houses have cited Japan's restrictions on the management of pension funds as a prime example of regulations intended to keep foreigners, along with Japanese newcomers, out of a lucrative market.
Rules issued by the Japanese Finance Ministry, the most powerful organization in a bureaucracy that runs the economy largely unchallenged by politicians, allowed only trust banks and insurance companies to manage pension funds. While there are some foreign entries in both markets, they have been prohibited from managing the bulk of the funds.
The United States Treasury has estimated that foreign firms manage just 1 percent of the assets held by Japanese pension funds.
Under the accord reached today, Tokyo's regulations would be wiped away beginning later this year. In perhaps the biggest achievement, Japanese firms would be required for the first time to disclose details of how well their fund managers perform in handling pensions.
Until now, Japan's pension funds have gone to great lengths to obscure any measurement of their performance. If the numbers were made public, American companies have long contended, they would show that Japanese fund managers significantly underperform their foreign competitors.
"This is an area that U.S. firms are very good at, and it is a very dramatic opening," said Frank N. Newman, the Acting Treasury Secretary. He has been filling the post until action was taken on the nomination of Robert E. Rubin, whom the Senate confirmed tonight as the next Treasury Secretary.
Under the accord, American and other foreign firms would have unlimited rights to compete to manage the roughly $200 billion in public pension funds for Japanese government employees. They would also have expanded access to roughly $130 billion in new assets in the private pension market, but other parts of that market would remain off limits. There would be varying levels of access to specialized Japanese pension funds.
Japan also agreed to drop its requirement that foreign investment firms offer a wide range of services, a rule that effectively excluded the many American firms that specialize in limited product lines, like bonds or annuities.
The Japanese also won some concessions. At the insistence of the Finance Ministry, which jealously guards its control over Japan's largest financial institutions, foreign investment advisers will have to maintain some formal connection with a trust bank or an insurance firm. "It makes sure that the Finance Ministry is not cut out of the loop," one American official said today. "The old-line Japanese firms will still take their slice."
Treasury officials said they could not estimate the extent of the revenues American firms could expect or how much of the market they were likely to get. But they said Japan had agreed to a series of "benchmarks" -- an artful term used in trade negotiations to sidestep Japanese complaints that Washington wants to manage trade to guarantee a certain market share for American firms. The benchmarks are supposed to measure how much the fund-management market has been opened to competition.
But penetrating that market will still be an enormous task. Many of the pension funds are managed by Japanese banks and insurance companies with strong ties to companies and government agencies that control the pension pools. Those ties, called keiretsu relationships, have often proved practically impossible to unknot, even after the conclusion of government-to-government agreements.
A senior Treasury official, briefing reporters today on the condition he not be identified, said Washington had an explicit right to withdraw privileges from Japanese financial institutions operating in the United States if the agreement was not fulfilled.
"It is our experience, though," the official said, "that Japan has always lived up fully to its commitments in the financial services arena."

HEADLINE: Early Gains in Stocks Pared in Late Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market rallied early in heavy trading yesterday only to retreat for just a small gain at the end of the session, despite a Government report indicating scant inflation at the wholesale level.
An inflation-is-coming comment from a Federal Reserve official helped depress stocks, as did the continuing turmoil in Mexico, whose troubles spread to depress markets throughout Latin America, including those of Brazil and Chile. 
 The uncertainty of the market was reflected in the stocks of the New York Stock Exchange. The number of advancing stocks exactly equaled the number of declining stocks at 1,145 against 1,145.
But the American stock market may rally in earnest today, if the Consumer Price Index, scheduled for release this morning, also indicates scant inflation. Moreover, Latin America's troubles may spell good news for American stocks and bonds, analysts said.
"Tomorrow we could see the market rally as fresh money comes in from the stocks and bonds being sold in the emerging markets," especially Latin America, said Bill Allyn, director of listed equities trading at Jefferies & Company.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.39 points, to 3,866.74, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.85 point, to 461.68. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 4.43 points, to 756.52.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 351.3 million shares changing hands, about 21 percent above last year's daily average of 290 million shares.
The big news of the day was the Labor Department's report of a 1.7 percent increase in the December Producer Price Index, in line with analysts' expectations and relatively modest, given the strength of the economy in the fourth quarter. Prices for tobacco, beef and gasoline even fell.
The leading stock indexes climbed steadily until 1:30 P.M. or so, when Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, said in a speech in Washington that the outlook for wholesale inflation in 1995 was "not as favorable" as that of 1994. He also said that the job-creation rate of the last two months, when nearly three-quarters of a million jobs were filled, could not be sustained "for an extended period."
Meanwhile, the other big news of the day -- the turmoil over the peso -- battered Latin American stocks traded in the United States. Telefonos de Mexico, the most active stock yesterday at 16.6 million shares, set another 52-week low of 32 1/2 before closing at 33 3/8, down 3 1/8. The shares of Grupo Televisa of Mexico, a broadcasting company, also set a 52-week low of 21 3/8 before closing at 21 3/4, down 3 3/8. And Compania de Telefonos de Chile also established a year's low of 70 before closing at 70 5/8, down 5 7/8.
Motorola, the wireless-telephone and semiconductor company, set a 52-week high of 63 before closing at 61 3/4, up 2 7/8. It reported after the market closed Monday that fourth-quarter profit had risen more than 50 percent over the quarter a year ago. Texas Instruments, another semiconductor company, also rose sharply. Its shares closed at 75 1/4, up 3 5/8.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.11 point, to 251.69, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.32 point, to 434.49.

HEADLINE: Bonds Gain on Modest Inflation Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, aided by a Government report that producer inflation rose only modestly last year and by a firming of the dollar in world currency markets.
The price of the 30-year benchmark issue rose 6/32 of a percentage point, to 95 27/32 , for a yield of 7.86 percent, down from 7.88 percent on Monday. Bill rates declined sharply, with a three-month bill off by nine basis points, to 5.73 percent, and a one-year bill down five basis points, to 6.73 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said the market's positive response yesterday was more widely felt in the shorter maturities, where he believed the real buying was going on. "I suspect the buying was tied to the producer price report, which showed declining price pressures," Mr. Burtnick said. "But than we still have the consumer price data due Wednesday."
The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose just two-tenths of 1 percent overall in December and two-tenths of 1 percent for the so-called core rate, which excludes food and energy prices. For all of 1994, producer prices were up just 1.7 percent.
The market consensus for today's Consumer Price Index is an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent over all and in the core rate.
For some market participants, yesterday's soft inflation data suggested that the Federal Reserve may decide to raise short-term interest rates only half of a percentage point at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting Jan. 31 and Feb. 1.
Some traders said that the buying of Treasury bills was probably helped by the plunge in the Mexican stock market over the last two days. Some of the investors fleeing that stock market may have put their money into United States Government securities, and more specifically the bills market.
"Investors and traders are looking more towards the plain vanilla type markets, like Treasury securities," Mr. Burtnick said.
While yesterday's trading could be interpreted as somewhat positive for bonds, he cautioned that there were still plenty of additional economic data due soon that could sour the market, including today's consumer price report.
While the producer price data for December indicated that finished-goods inflation remained subdued, the core rates at the intermediate and crude levels of production suggested that there could be inflationary pressures in the pipeline, according to Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Fears the Safety Net for Poor Is Fraying

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
As politicians engage in a vociferous battle over welfare reform, others are airing their opinions in a subtler fashion. In letters to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, dozens of donors have criticized plans to cut government funding for social service programs. Fearing that the nation's safety net for the poor is fraying, many have increased their gifts to the fund.
"We have doubled our contribution this year because it seems the neediest ranks may swell, judging by the harsh rhetoric of some politicians," wrote Jim and Jackie Perry of Wilton, Conn., who sent $200. "With all the talk of reducing the budget deficit, it seems that those who need help the most may be the hardest hit by cuts in funding for shelters, soup kitchens, counseling and job training." 
 When she sent $100 to Neediest Cases instead of her usual $50, Isabel Andrews enclosed a terse note of explanation.
"Because of the increasing calls for help this year and because of all those 'lean and mean' mouthings of pompous government prigs, I am doubling my contribution to the fund this year," wrote Miss Andrews, who lives in Massapequa, L.I. "Should I win the lottery, I will share it with you."
Since the early years of this century, the Neediest Cases Fund has helped thousands of people lift themselves out of poverty. Although the campaign has raised slightly more money than last year at this time, there have been fewer donors, indicating that many New Yorkers are still feeling the aftereffects of the recession. As of last Friday, 7,221 individuals and foundations had contributed to the fund, compared with 7,897 last Jan. 7. This year's campaign will end Feb. 28.
Many Neediest Cases donors have expressed frustration with the House Republicans' "Contract With America," especially its proposal to place impoverished children in orphanages.
"Please earmark the enclosed check for a family in danger of disintegration," wrote Howard and Phyllis Berk of Manhattan, who sent $200. "Perhaps it will help keep a child with his or her parents instead of headed for an institution (read 'orphanage')."
"Too often, the answer to making New York's streets safe and hospitable is to clean them up by locking people up in prisons and orphanages," Mr. and Mrs. Perry wrote.
Even at a time when many middle-class families are struggling, the threat of budget cuts has only intensified their sense of social responsibility. In a letter he sent with his 30th annual donation, R. Gnanadesikan pondered why his urge to contribute was stronger than ever this year.
"The perception of political leaders these days seems to have a harsh edge toward the less fortunate in society, and there is an unseemly competition on seeing who can come up with the meanest solutions to long-standing problems," wrote Mr. Gnanadesikan, who lives in Chatham, N.J., and sent $150. "Thank you for reminding us to the contrary that all of us, the more and the less fortunate, are inextricably bound together."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Traders' Flight to the Mark Further Weakens the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against many leading currencies yesterday, hurt as investors continued to flee the Spanish peseta and Italian lira for the safety of the German mark.
"The dollar got caught in the crossfire of mark-buying for peripheral European currencies," said Tom Hoge, corporate currency trader for the Bank of New York. "While that's going on, it's tough for the dollar to gain any headway against the mark." 
 The peseta dropped to a record low against the mark amid worry that the Cabinet of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez might fall. Mr. Gonzalez has vigorously denied accusations of Government involvement with antiterorist death squads aimed at Basque separatists.
The lira also dropped to a record low against the mark. Political uncertainty in Italy has intensified since Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi resigned on Dec. 22.
The Portuguese escudo fell along with the peseta. The Portuguese and Spanish economies are closely linked by trade, and their currencies often track one another.
To sell these less actively traded currencies against the mark, traders must sometimes sell them first against dollars and then sell the dollars for marks. That circuitous transaction weakens the dollar against the mark.
Yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5292 marks, its lowest level since Nov. 11, before recovering later in New York. It ended the day at 1.5325 marks, down from 1.5375 marks on Monday.
The dollar rose to 100.09 Japanese yen from 99.91 yen. It got some support after Japan agreed to allow American brokerage houses and investment advisers to compete for business from Japanese pension funds, said Jeffrey Yu of Sanwa Bank in New York.
The peseta's weakness prompted speculation that the currency might have to be devalued within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The system was created to keep eight European currencies trading in a range. Members' central banks are required to buy and sell their currencies to keep them within those prescribed bands.
In other trading, the Canadian dollar fell yesterday to an eight-year low of 70.69 United States cents, amid concern that the Canadian central bank had not raised short-term interest rates sufficiently to compete with rising rates in the United States. In New York, the Canadian dollar settled at 70.91 United States cents, down from 70.96 cents on Monday.
The pound slipped to $1.5620 from $1.5640. The dollar fell to 1.2825 Swiss francs, from 1.2840 on Monday.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Deadline Passes But Players Get New Offer

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
The deadline was dead, but the possibility of a hockey season was still alive last night when the National Hockey League offered yet another "final" collective bargaining proposal to its locked-out players' union. Only one issue -- the age when veterans would be eligible for free agency -- divided the sides, and only two years of it were in dispute.
The proposal came after two days of intense negotiations and two conference calls among divided and emotional team owners. Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, presented the revised offer to Bob Goodenow, executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, at a meeting in Manhattan. 
 Goodenow and other union bargainers took the document back to their hotel rooms and were expected to study it overnight, consult with the rest of their bargaining committee by telephone to Toronto in the morning and then respond to Bettman.
Although some executives around the league implied that the proposal was a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum, this wasn't made explicit in a statement issued by Arthur Pincus, a league spokesman.
"Gary Bettman was directed to present a revised proposal to the N.H.L. Players Association and to effectuate the cancellation of the 1994-95 season if a new collective bargaining agreement is not reached promptly," Pincus said.
Pincus didn't make clear if this meant that a new deadline had been established or if the revised proposal left room for further compromise. Last Saturday, when offering another proposal with somewhat different details -- which he also called "final" -- Bettman had said the remainder of the season would be canceled if there were no agreement by noon yesterday. But that deadline passed with negotiations in progress.
It would appear that the union is left with three options:
(1) Accept the deal as written
(2) Suggest another meeting and another compromise
(3) Reject the proposal, head back to Toronto, and see if Bettman and the owners are willing to call off the season over the free-agency differences.
Another question, for examination in the future, is Bettman's relationship with his employers after almost two years in the job. His stated goal was to obtain a salary cap or a payroll tax or some other system linking payrolls to revenues.
The players steadfastly fought against that, calling it a deal breaker, and the league ultimately dropped this concept from the negotiations. Although Bettman's aggressive tactics won numerous, significant concessions to establish a drag on salary inflation, it would appear from recent owner votes, and the heated debates that accompanied them, that many teams aren't happy with the deal he has fashioned.
During yesterday's first conference call, Bettman presented the owners with what he and Goodenow thought was the basis for a settlement. But the owners, some often angry during the two-hour session, rejected the plan and several of them criticized Bettman.
Most vocal among them was Abe Pollin of Washington. Also finding fault with the terms were Bill Wirtz of Chicago, Mike Ilitch of Detroit and the owners of Canadian teams that play in smaller cities.
Several people who heard the call, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were embarrassed for Bettman, and one suggested that such treatment of a chief executive might lead the commissioner to re-consider remaining in his current position.
As for the free-agency issue, the latest owner offer, approved by a 17-9 vote during yesterday's second conference call, mandates that players will become unfettered free agents at the age of 32 for the first three years of the contract and at the age of 31 for the second three years of the contract. In addition, the proposal would allow either side to re-open the contract in either 1997 or 1998.
Earlier in the day, Bettman had taken a slightly different proposal to the owners, one that called for free agency to begin at age 32 in the first year of the contract and at age 31 for the remaining five years. The owners voted that down by a 14-12 vote.
Over this proposal, the owners and their top executives listened and debated, sometimes angrily, for about two hours. After getting revision suggestions by fax machine, Bettman then composed the latest offer to end the lockout, which has delayed the start of the season since Oct. 1.
The free-agency provision was to be the only significant gain for the union in a struggle during which the owners have demanded and received many concessions over the previous agreement, particularly in the areas of entry-level salary caps, harsher arbitration rules and weakened free-agency opportunities for most players. Some union members feel that, in view of these givebacks, they deserve freedom in the marketplace after more than a decade of service to a team. The owners and Bettman have said they need a drag on salary inflation to avoid losing money.
Other major differences appeared to be settled.
The owners wanted a new right to walk away from two arbitration awards per team each year. The players had offered one such option. The two sides apparently compromised on three per team over two years. Players in this category will become free agents, but may have the right to rejoin their former teams at a predetermined rate of pay that is less than the arbitration award.
As for the rookie salary cap formula, the players wanted a maximum of $900,000, applied to any round of the draft. The owners demanded $825,000 for the first round and lesser rates for lower rounds. The compromise appeared to be at $850,000, with no difference between rounds.
It is also thought that the two sides had reached a compromise on the age of the entry draft. The players wanted age 18, as has been the case for many years. The owners wanted age 20; the settlement was at age 19, with 18-year-olds having the option to volunteer.
These provisions, and all the others, are tentative and could change with any change in the age for veteran free agency. It is all part of a package, as Bettman frequently said, with each piece linked with the others. The players also asked for retroactive pay to replace some wages lost when locked out; it wasn't known if they were able to gain any of this.
Along with Chicago, Detroit and Washington, much of the opposition to veteran free agency was thought to be from teams in small markets in Canada. Owners such as Marcel Aubut of Quebec and Peter Pocklington in Edmonton have said the recent league proposals don't do enough to help them compete with teams from larger cities and those who deal in more valuable American dollars. It's a plea that gets lukewarm support from players, especially in larger markets.
Mike Richter, the goalie for the Stanley Cup champion Rangers, said, "I guess if we can have some of the larger teams pay for the mistakes or shortcomings of the smaller teams and still come up with a deal, I guess that's what we're aiming for now."
The Canadian teams have said they fear that free-agency opportunities will encourage players to leave small markets in Canada for teams in bigger cities in the United States.

HEADLINE: Clinic Violence Sets Off Push For Wider Abortion Training

BYLINE: By SUSAN GILBERT 

 BODY:
THE anti-abortion violence that has helped cause a critical decline in the number of places where women can go to end unwanted pregnancies has also inspired a ground swell of activism among doctors and medical students intent on reversing the trend.
"We have been making progress," said Dr. Wendy Chavkin, editor of The Journal of the American Women's Medical Association, which devoted its December issue to the shortage of doctors willing to provide abortions. "The most recent shootings have not weakened our resolve." 
 Efforts are being made on several fronts to teach more doctors how to perform abortions. In 1993, Planned Parenthood of New York City started a training program for residents and practicing doctors. Using that program, six New York City hospitals that had not offered abortion instruction to residents began doing so within the last year or two: Lenox Hill Hospital, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn, New York Downtown Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. Planned Parenthood of New York City has helped 15 clinics around the country start similar programs.
In addition, the American College of Graduate Medical Education, the organization that sets requirements for residency programs, is scheduled to vote next month on a proposal to make abortion training mandatory for residents in obstetrics and gynecology. And more medical schools are for the first time offering courses on abortion, primarily because students have demanded them through a new national organization called Medical Students for Choice. Among these medical schools are Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in Philadelphia and the University of California at San Francisco Medical School.
To be sure, these efforts constitute an uphill battle. The number of doctors available to perform abortions has fallen by 8 percent since 1988 and the percentage of obstetric and gynecology residency programs in this country that require abortion training has declined to 12 percent, half what it was in 1985, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that does research on reproductive issues. Eighty-four percent of counties in the United States now have no doctor who performs abortions.
"The activism against abortion providers has made doctors who were trained to perform abortion afraid to continue doing so, and it is the reason why many residency programs don't offer abortion training," said Dr. Robert H. Gifford, assistant dean for education and student affairs at Yale University School of Medicine, one of the few medical schools that offer elective courses on abortion and that require clinical instruction for obstetrics and gynecology residents.
Another reason for the declining number of residency programs that require abortion training is that fewer hospitals are performing abortions, and hospitals are where most residency programs are based. The Guttmacher Institute found that hospitals, which provided more than half of all abortions in 1973, accounted for just 7 percent of abortions in 1992. Although many hospitals no longer offer abortions because of economic reasons (they have trouble competing with abortion clinics for patients because their costs are much higher) political pressure has played at least as big a role, Dr. Gifford said.
"Fewer hospitals provide abortion because influential donors who oppose abortion won't give money if they do," he said. The result of the provider shortage that all these factors have created is that "the quality of care women get is being compromised," he said.
It is that realization that has attracted residents to the Planned Parenthood training initiative. (Practicing physicians can also enroll on their own.) Thirty-three doctors, mostly from the six New York hospitals, have completed the five-week program and 23 others are going through it now. Each participant spends 8 to 10 days at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Manhattan, Brooklyn or the Bronx attending lectures, observing and assisting with abortions and, after the first weeks, performing the procedures.
"We're anxious to learn how to do this," said a third-year obstetric and gynecology resident from New York Downtown Hospital who completed the program last month but would not give her name because of her fear of violence. "Most of the ob-gyn residents I know plan to perform abortions," she said.
Dr. Charles Lipton, a former Army surgeon, came out of retirement last year to take the Planned Parenthood course because of a memory from the days before abortion became legal. "When I was a resident at the Hahnemann University ob-gyn clinic in 1962, a 13-year-old girl who had been raped came in wanting an abortion," he said. "When she was told she couldn't have one, she went home and committed suicide.
"My decision to get in touch with Planned Parenthood for abortion training was in response to the murders of Dr. Gunn and Dr. Britton," he said, referring to the doctors who worked at abortion clinics in Pensacola, Fla. "I want to go on the road and perform abortions in needy areas."
The murder of Dr. David Gunn nearly two years ago was one of two events that gave rise to Medical Students for Choice, a national student group that has made inroads for increased abortion instruction at every level of medical education. The other event was an anti-abortion mailing that, at about the time of Dr. Gunn's murder, went to the homes of one-third of medical students around the country. The mailing, seemingly intended to intimidate the students, was a 12-page comic-book-style publication of gruesome cartoons depicting abortionists. It came from a group called Life Dynamics Inc. in Texas.
Many students were frightened because the anti-abortion group knew where they lived, said Jody Steinauer, a third-year medical student at the University of California at San Francisco who helped found Medical Students for Choice. "But most students, even the pro-lifers I know, were mainly offended," she said. "Dr. Gunn's murder and this mailing made us wake up. They made us realize that we're potential abortion providers, but we don't have enough education on abortion in medical school to make a choice on whether we want to be providers or not."
Courses on abortion have always been scarce at medical schools. But the group, which has members from 105 of the country's 126 medical schools, has persuaded several schools to incorporate abortion instruction in their curriculums.
The University of Pennsylvania Medical School, for example, has an elective course on clinical abortion for fourth-year medical students. The University of California at San Francisco Medical School gives third-year medical students the option of watching abortions and abortion counseling. Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons offers a lecture on the history and practice of abortion for third-year students. Thomas Jefferson Medical College has invited doctors who perform abortions to speak to the students about what they do and why they do it.
"My generation has no consciousness of what things were like before abortion was legal -- hospital floors full of women with perforated uteruses because of botched abortions," said Eliza Byers, a second-year student at the Jefferson medical school who is a member of Students for Choice. "A lot of medical students today don't want to do abortions because doctors are getting shot. They think of doctors who do abortions not as doctors but as abortionists. They think abortion is for promiscuous girls. We're trying to destigmatize abortion."
A major step in that direction that is under consideration would be a requirement that all obstetric and gynecology residents learn how to do abortions, unless they have religious or moral objections. "It's being considered because of a perception that abortion is being overlooked by obstetricians and gynecologists," said Dr. Paul O'Connor, executive secretary of the residency review committee of American College of Graduate Medical Education. "Medical Students for Choice and the American College of Obstetricians are behind it. It's likely to be passed."
Dr. Gifford of Yale said the requirement would ultimately help protect doctors and patients from violence. "The political reality is that abortion is isolated, and that makes providers easy targets," he said. "If abortion could be more a part of obstetrical practice and not isolated into abortion clinics, we'd be a lot better off."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
To Earn Subsidies, Must Art Be Useful? Must It Be Sweet?

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
"All art is quite useless," wrote Oscar Wilde, but of course he never encountered the National Endowment for the Arts, which is predicated on the premise that the arts are the most useful thing in the world. They solve social problems, they keep people happy, they make communities shine with enthusiasm and, best of all, they inject a shot of money into sagging economies. The arts establishment in the United States operates on a nearly messianic certainty that the arts are not merely good, but good for you.
Is it really so? Surely the economic impact of the arts is real. The explosion of interest in culture in the United States over the last generation has turned the arts into a potent industry. Study after study shows the multiplier effect of arts dollars, sowing prosperity all through the economy. The Metropolitan Museum is now the most popular tourist attraction in New York, where big exhibitions fill not only its own coffers but also those of hotels and restaurants. People clamor to get seats for major events at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. The arts are for everyone, and everyone seems to be for the arts. 
 Except, of course, on Capitol Hill, where the new Republican majority, building on years of discomfort among conservatives about Federal support of the arts, seems increasingly hostile to keeping the National Endowment in business. The endowment's entire appropriation is only $167 million, but no $167 million anywhere in the entire Federal budget is debated with such intensity. To the endowment's opponents, this comparatively tiny sum of money is a vast boondoggle, a pork barrel for the cultural elite. To the endowment's supporters, it is anything but a gift to the elite; it is money that spreads the pleasures of art around and assures that the experience of culture will be accessible to all.
The situation is rife with paradoxes, not the least of which is the way in which the arts establishment has tried to save its skin by portraying art as sweet and lovable, leaving to the endowment's opponents a much more realistic view of art as challenging and difficult. Both sides claim to represent the democratic ideal, which is why $167 million, which is a mere fly speck in the Federal budget, is given such overwhelming symbolic importance by both sides. The endowment's minuscule budget, less than half of what it costs to keep Lincoln Center going for a year, less than a quarter of what the city of Berlin spends on arts subsidies annually for a population that is less than 2 percent of that of the whole United States, is often portrayed as the crucible for the future of the arts in this country.
End the endowment and we will stop the free ride for unpopular artists and get back to the good kind of art that pays for itself, goes the conservative argument. We end the endowment at our peril, retorts the other side; without it, the arts will be finished and we will become a nation of philistines.
The likelihood is that the sky will neither fall nor rise if the endowment's modest appropriation disappears. Art will go on, as it always has. But if the endowment is sharply cut or eliminated altogether, the nation will be sending an important signal about its attitude toward culture, which is that it expects it to play by the rules most other things do, and pay for itself.
It sounds, on the surface, as if it couldn't be more fair. Why shouldn't culture do what other things do, and take care of itself? The only problem is that it doesn't work, as history proves. Culture has never been able to support itself. There is a reason that the popes and the Medicis hired Michelangelo, that royalty paid Mozart to write concertos, that the histories of creativity and of patronage are intimately intertwined. The marketplace has never been a testing ground for artistic validity; history shows few correlations between what is popular enough to pay for itself and what is good enough to last.
Subsidizing art runs against the grain of American independence, the tradition of self-reliance that seems so often to tie into populism. But that very populist instinct often contradicts what art strives to do, which is not to coddle but to challenge. Great art is rarely created with popularity in mind, and when it manages to achieve tremendous appeal, it is often nothing more than a miraculous accident.
Surely the saddest aspect of this moment is the way in which the arts establishment, to fight the political opposition it faces, has been forced to retreat into a position of defending the popularity of art and denying its challenge. Jane Alexander, the earnest and determined chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, has labored mightily to convince Congress and the voters that the endowment is spreading sweetness and light throughout the country, that art is bringing happiness to all who are touched by endowment grants.
But the Republicans are not so quick to buy this, and maybe they are right. They know the arts at their most vital are something other than sugar-coated candy. The arts often undermine, they often seek to be subversive to established orders, and the opposition to the endowment wants to protect the country from this evil, or at least make sure that government funds play no part in propagating it. Picasso may be easy to swallow now, but he wasn't in 1910. Why should our tax dollars support the next crazy radical to come down the pike?
The ultimate paradox is that now, at a time when public interest in the arts is greater than ever, the arts establishment has come to promote what is fundamentally an anti-intellectual view of culture, while the right-wing opposition operates from a more sophisticated view. The opponents of the endowment who complain loudly about the homoerotic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe or the urine-drenched crucifix of Andres Serrano, hostile though they may be to any esthetic messages in these works, are actually more accepting of the notion that art consists of ideas and not merely pretty pictures, that it is more than entertainment and that it often seeks to challenge society's standards.
The arts establishment, engaged in the act of trying to protect the economic interests of cultural organizations and institutions that depend on masses of people attending, has increasingly been blurring the line between art and entertainment. These supporters of the arts endowment increasingly see culture in terms of what is consumed, not in terms of what is created. How else to protect their turf? Yet in doing so, they abandon to the other side the very view of art that they should be holding most dear, a recognition of art as creativity and challenge.
Today, as advocates attempt to save the endowment by portraying art as democratic, accessible and unthreatening, it is left to their opponents to see it in terms of creativity, and to admit the tremendous, terrifying power that art at its most intense can possess.

HEADLINE: Governor Whitman at Year One

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman's first year as Governor of New Jersey has been marked by tax reduction and national celebrity. With her fellow Republicans in control of both houses of the Legislature, she had no trouble starting the tax cuts she promised. With her fresh appeal, she campaigned far and wide for Republican Congressional candidates last fall and got herself far-and-widely mentioned as potential for "national office."
On those counts she had a good year, but she has yet to undertake many initiatives that would entail serious controversy. She has, in large part, ducked the hard work of cutting popular programs and relied too much on one-shot budget gimmicks to pay for popular tax cuts. 
 Whitman-watchers will recall that she handled her first crisis deftly when her campaign manager, Ed Rollins, boasted about -- but later denied -- lavishing cash on black churches to discourage get-out-the-vote efforts for Gov. Jim Florio. Mrs. Whitman immediately denounced Mr. Rollins and reached out to the offended black clergy.
Powerful personal instincts have also served her well on the abortion issue. A believer that women have the right to choose, she has publicly implored her party to drop its anti-abortion stance, and continues to do so.
National economic recovery has helped her. As she noted in her State of the State address yesterday, New Jersey is growing faster than its big neighbors. Tax cuts may well have contributed to the faster growth, as she contends; so presumably have her efforts to accommodate private industry.
Her tax pledge remains the centerpiece of her agenda -- 30 percent reduction in the state's personal income tax in three years. Of that, 15 percent is already in place, and she is expected to propose an additional 5 or 10 percent cut in her fiscal 1996 budget on Jan. 23. But keeping the budget balanced while cutting state revenue takes imagination.
A large part of the first year's reduction was covered by reducing contributions to public pension funds and other one-shot maneuvers. Naturally, she avoids proposing new taxes, but yesterday she said she wants to keep an old one that is expiring -- a temporary surcharge on motor vehicle registrations. Governor Florio had proposed repealing it early, because it was not needed. Now Governor Whitman, who made her name and won her office fighting for lower taxes, proposes not reducing this one.
On spending, she has basically held the line, at roughly $15 billion, but hard cuts and layoffs are expected now. Democrats try to attribute local property tax increases to her tightness with state aid, but there is no clear proof of a link. Rather, she rates credit for dispatching state experts to help local governments control their own budgets.
Mrs. Whitman's first year was smooth. But she has pledged to attack failing schools, stagnant cities, poverty and AIDS while shrinking taxes and government. Tougher battles lie ahead.

Japan Fatigue

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
Here is a little-known fact for you: In the 1930's, three-quarters of the cars in Japan were Fords. World War II and 50 years of Japanese protectionism reduced that to zero, but Ford is now spearheading a resurgence of U.S. car sales in Japan. Ford boosted its Japan sales by 198 percent this year by improving quality, acquiring 300 showrooms, letting Japanese auto writers drive across America in a Taurus and even sponsoring the Hiroshima professional soccer team, which won the national championship with the Ford logo on its jerseys. Last year Ford sold out its allotment of Mustangs for Japan in two months.
This is not a Ford commercial. But the Ford example is worth highlighting because it comes at a time when so many other U.S. businesses are giving up on Japan, saying that it is just too expensive and aggravating to keep trying to break into the closed Japanese market. Better, they argue, to focus sales -- and U.S. trade diplomacy -- on more open emerging markets in Indonesia, Malaysia, China and India. They call this "Japan Fatigue," and it is a virus that has infected large segments of the U.S. business community and Government. 
 Nothing could be more wrongheaded, and President Clinton should use his meeting today with Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, to make clear that he too hasn't caught the dreaded disease. The Japanese quietly believe they have worn the Clinton team down. Here's why Mr. Clinton should tell them they are wrong:
First, commerce is like tennis. If you don't play with better players you never get better yourself. If American designers and salesmen are not in Japan following Japanese product research and development and competing against the best Japanese companies for some of the world's most sophisticated consumers, they will never beat their Japanese competitors in China, India or Indonesia either. "If Ford can win in Japan, Ford can win against Japanese cars in the U.S., Europe and Asia," says Konen Suzuki, the renegade Toyota executive who now heads Ford Japan and tools around Tokyo in his white Mustang.
Second, if a U.S. company, like Ford, cedes the huge Japanese market to Toyota, that means Toyota can safely reap all sorts of profits at home, amass a financial war chest, then use that to cut prices on what it sells abroad and to outspend others for new plants in Thailand or China to tie up those markets as well.
Third, there is a lot of ambivalence in the U.S. public today about the merits of free trade. There is no way any administration can maintain the fragile consensus for free trade if Japan, the world's second-largest economy, continues to get away with murder -- using hidden quotas, opaque regulations and business cartels to block U.S. imports.
Fourth, the Japanese claim that Ford's success proves what they have been saying all along -- that if U.S. companies just came up with better products and more effort they could break into Japan. That's only half true. Yes, the products and effort have to be there, but if it were not for U.S. Government pressure on Tokyo to squeeze its car dealers to give more showroom space to U.S. autos, Ford never would have broken in there, says Mr. Suzuki. Economists complain that such government pressure to open markets constitutes "managed trade." You bet it does. In the managed Japanese economy you are either managed in or managed out. (Ford's Japan sales, despite its upsurge, are still less than 1 percent of the Japanese market.)
Finally, the tide of history in Japan is turning our way. I went to the new Toys "R" Us superstore outside Tokyo. It was packed with holiday shoppers hauling away bargains while the Muzak played Motown hits. Thanks to their recession, Japanese consumers are eager to be Kmart shoppers. They want the sort of U.S.-style retail competition and discounting they have never had. This is no time to turn away from this market. You don't get better playing tennis with Malaysia; you don't get rich either. It would be a shame if the only thing produced by 20 years of Sisyphean U.S. trade policy toward Japan was to open the Japanese market for Korean contractors, German auto makers, French farmers and Japanese discounters.

HEADLINE: Israelis and Arabs Back Regional Bank

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's push for a regional development bank in the Middle East moved ahead today when Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization jointly proposed to set it up..
At a meeting here, officials from more than 30 countries hailed the Israeli-Arab plan, saying it should go far toward overcoming opposition to the idea from the European Union and Saudi Arabia. 
 The diplomats say a regional bank is needed to finance major infrastructure projects like highways and water purification and to foster economic cooperation.
After a two-day meeting at the State Department, representatives from 39 countries and financial institutions agreed to set up a group to work out details for creating the bank. The group is also supposed to propose a separate institution to promote regional economic cooperation.
Joan Spero, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said the Administration's goal was to win approval for such a bank at a high-level meeting scheduled for October in Amman, Jordan.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Urges New Agenda For Cities: Self-Reliance

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Positioning himself for the nation's new Republican era, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday called for New York to become a model for how other cities can solve their own problems if freed from state and Federal mandates that tell them what services to provide.
In his second annual address to the City Council, Mr. Giuliani began to lay out the bare bones of what he called a "new urban agenda" of self-reliance that he is expected to describe further at Yale University next week. Aides said the Yale address would be the first of many national appearances by the Mayor devoted to urban affairs. 
 While just months ago Mr. Giuliani had crossed party lines to support Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, an icon of Democratic liberalism, and spoken skeptically of the Republican House leadership's "Contract With America," the Mayor yesterday tried to move back into his party's fold. He called the Republican ascendancy in Washington and Albany an opportunity to restructure city government.
"We are asking of New York City precisely what we are asking of people on welfare and everyone else in the city: self-reliance," Mr. Giuliani said. "The old agenda was based on looking to others to solve our problems -- look to Albany, look to Washington, someone will come along and bail us out. The new urban agenda should declare that we can solve our own problems, without direction from state or Federal authorities."
Speaking in the vast City Council chamber, Mr. Giuliani devoted much of the address to a summary of his achievements in his first year in office, pointing to reduced crime and the first decline in city spending in 16 years. He said he had defied the "conventional wisdom" that he would not succeed.
Often accused by critics of being too combative, Mr. Giuliani also pledged to cooperate more with the City Council as he draws up a plan in the coming month to close a gap of $500 million or more in the current budget. Through much of 1994, the Mayor and the Council clashed over his efforts to cut billions from the budget, a fight that eventually wound up in court.
Instead of presenting the Council with a "fait accompli," Mr. Giuliani said to the audience full of Council members that the plan would be negotiated in advance so it "incorporates your views, your ideas, your thinking, and hopefully we can agree completely."
Mr. Giuliani's olive branch to the City Council was welcomed by Speaker Peter F. Vallone. Yet the Democrat also expressed some caution, since the speech came a day after the Mayor's most recent confrontation with the City Council -- over the issue of removing fire boxes on city streets.
On Tuesday, Fire Commissioner Howard Safir said the administration would begin dismantling the city's fire boxes within days even as a Council committee approved a bill seeking to delay the plan for three months while Council members reviewed it.
Mr. Giuliani also singled out labor leaders and individual lawmakers for praise, among them several black officials -- Representative Charles B. Rangel, Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields and State Senator David A. Paterson -- with whom he had clashed in his first months in office.
Mr. Giuliani's call for self-reliance and a new urban agenda came toward the end of a 53-minute address that was interrupted by applause 30 times. But even as the Mayor urged New York to stand on its own he also put new packaging around an idea long espoused by Democrats -- that the city and its downstate suburbs send billions of dollars more in tax money to Albany and Washington than they receive in aid.
"It's time for New York City and cities across America to get rid of the stereotype that portrays us as a drain on the national economy," he said. "We are not." United States Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, a Democrat, has been making the same case for 18 years.
Yet rather than seek new aid, Mr. Giuliani instead put his focus on the elimination of Federal and state requirements that affect such major items as the amount the city must spend on the poor and how much money it must devote to schools.
He is expected to follow up today with a long list of Federal, state and court mandates that he wants removed or modified. It ranges from the state requirement that the city pick up half the non-Federal share of Medicaid, at a cost of $2.4 billion, to a state formula setting the minimum the city can spend on education, to a court order establishing the supply of toilet paper that must be kept in foster homes, according to a report prepared by the administration.
The Mayor gave few specific initiatives for the coming year in which the city, struggling with the worst fiscal problems since its brush with bankruptcy in the 1970's, again faces a $2 billion budget deficit.
Continuing his emphasis on fighting crime, Mr. Giuliani, a former Federal prosecutor, vowed an intensified effort to combat drugs, focused on drug buyers as well as dealers and on drug use among young people. He said drug abuse by youths was largely to blame for the increase of serious crime in schools by 15.5 percent in the 1993-94 school year over the previous year and around schools by 47.5 percent, even as citywide crime statistics declined drastically.
"So today, I would like to make it very plain to everyone listening, to buyers as well as sellers of drugs, that our policy will be to arrest and prosecute not only those who sell drugs, but also those who buy drugs because they create the demand that is helping to destroy the lives of other people," he said.
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said later that drug fighting had been "the mantra for the past year" and that ways to expand the policy were still being developed.
Foreshadowing the expected centerpiece of his second budget, Mr. Giuliani said the city would need to cut $1 billion or more from welfare and health care spending on the poor. And he again asked for changes in how school system budgets and for a reduction of bureaucracy in the Board of Education.
"Let's face reality," he said. "New York City's public school system isn't working. That's not an accusation. It's a fact. I believe in facing facts, not pretending, particularly when the lives and education of our children are at stake."
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, who was recently reappointed by the Board of Education over Mr. Giuliani's objections, did not attend the speech.
The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer; Manhattan's Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger; and Public Advocate Mark J. Green, Democrats who are considered possible challengers to the Mayor in 1997, each said Mr. Giuliani had spoken in generalities and not provided a full accounting of how he would lead the city out of its fiscal problems and at what cost to services.
"Here we're facing the greatest fiscal crisis and service crisis in at least 20 years; yet the Mayor appears largely interested in again touting crime data and trouncing the Board of Education bureaucracy," Mr. Green said. "It is an act of self-denial to talk up self-reliance on the same day the administration is quietly planning to close an estimated 10 day-care centers that service poor kids and working mothers who would otherwise find themselves on the welfare line."
Ms. Messinger said, "Noble sentiments and setting a tone and defining an image are important when you're giving the State of the City, but they're not sufficient." She said that even while the Mayor was defining education as a priority, Manhattan Community College was being forced by the city's budget problems to cut by 50 percent its incoming class for next year.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Confident U.S. Trade Deficit With Japan Will Narrow

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
After two years of confrontational meetings with a succession of Japanese leaders, President Clinton changed his tone today, expressing confidence that his Administration's blitz of recent accords with Tokyo would soon bring down the United States' $60 billion trade deficit with Japan.
In its businesslike quickness and its low-key style, the meeting between Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, a 70-year old Socialist who abandoned many of his party's principles in a deal last summer that propelled him from obscurity to the Prime Minister's office, seemed to reflect the Administration's battle fatigue in its dealings with Tokyo. 
 Mr. Clinton's aides insist that he has lost none of his verve for pressing Japan for major reforms in its economy and major new openings of its markets. Today, they noted, he pressed Mr. Murayama for quick progress in talks over autos and auto parts, which make up more than 60 percent of the trade imbalance. On Tuesday, the two countries reached an agreement to partially open Japan's financial services markets to greater foreign participation.
In recent weeks, however, several officials close to the negotiations have acknowledged that the White House has lost any hope of speedy changes in Japanese economic policy. When Mr. Murayama's advance team submitted a draft communique last week that would be issued at the end of the meeting. American officials rejected it out of hand because it made no mention of trade or Japan's contribution to the building of nuclear power reactors in North Korea, part of the deal to dismantle the Communist country's nuclear weapons project. But rather than fight, they just decided to issue no communique at all.
Today Mr. Clinton steered far away from the kinds of comments he made two years and three prime ministers ago, when he told the first Japanese leader who visited him, Kiichi Miyazawa, that broad cooperation "can happen only if we make real progress on the trade deficit." Instead, he spoke of cooperation between the two nations that "no one could have dreamed of 50 years ago, or perhaps even 20 years ago."
Those were words the Japanese desperately wanted to hear, and it even mollified some Japanese diplomats who had complained privately that the 2-hour meeting, with no full press conference or big welcome, was a snub compared to the treatment of past prime ministers visiting here.

HEADLINE: Jobless Data Show Blacks Joining Economic Recovery

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Unlike other economic recoveries in which blacks were often left behind, the current upswing helped push the unemployment rate for blacks to below 10 percent last month for the first time in more than two decades.
"In the scramble for jobs in 1994, blacks were winners for the first time in many years," said Andrew Brimmer, a former Federal Reserve Bank governor who now runs a consulting concern in Washington. 
 Indeed, officials say the unemployment rate for black adults dropped faster in 1994 than it did for white adults and that black employment prospects appear better now than they were during the upswing of the late 1980's.
Even during the robust economic recovery of the late 1980's when the white unemployment rate was -- as it is now -- under 5 percent, black unemployment never dipped below 10 percent, and sometimes topped 12 percent.
"In the last 20 years there was a higher floor for black unemployment," said Everett Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. "It appears to have been around 11 percent. We've broken through that barrier conspicuously in this recovery."
Economists and other analysts of labor trends say they are uncertain whether the 9.8 percent unemployment figure for blacks in December -- as against the 4.8 percent overall rate for whites -- was an aberration or a sign of increased long-term job security for more African-Americans.
"I hope that it's a signal of a turn-around in the jobs prospects for African-Americans," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. "Unfortunately the data are not altogether clear."
Even with the decline in the overall unemployment rate for African-Americans, the rate for black youths from 16 to 19 years of age is 34.6 percent -- as against 14.7 percent for white youths.
"You can celebrate the fact that it's below 10 percent," said Thomas J. Plewes, associate commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the jobless rate. "But both in terms of an unemployment rate that is twice as high for blacks and more than twice as high for young people, there is still a very long way to go."
Mr. Plewes noted that the unemployment rate merely measures the percentage of the labor force that has looked for a job in the four weeks before the monthly survey is taken. A more meaningful index, he said, is the employment population ratio, which measures what percentage of people at least 16 years old -- and not in jail or confined in some other way -- are working.
Using this measure, which includes those who are not actively looking for employment, 23.9 percent of black youths are working, as against 48.5 percent of white youngsters.
"What's going on is that young blacks are not getting a lot of exposure to labor market, still," Mr. Plewes said.
The news of the sharp decline in the black unemployment rate brought a muted response from some civil rights organizations. Cheered by the news of improvement of black employment gains, they stressed the large number of blacks who have simply dropped out of the labor market and are therefore not counted in the unemployment statistics.
"We're pleased by the report, but skeptical of its true significance," said Wade Henderson, legislative director of the N.A.A.C.P. "It only covers people who are actively in search of work. Many in the African-American community, having been frustrated by long periods of unemployment and an unreceptive -- and often hostile -- job market have been discouraged and are no longer actively seeking jobs."
Still, the black jobless rate was the lowest it has been since August 1974 when it reached 9.9 percent. And the drop below the 10 percent barrier represents a milestone for the economy as a whole and for African-Americans. Blacks traditionally have had the hardest time finding and keeping jobs and the improvement in the rate reflects the vigor of the economic recovery.
Harry Holzer, a professor of economics at Michigan State University, said, "It's been known for a long time that the best thing you can do to bring down the unemployment rate for blacks is to bring them down for everybody. If you believe that blacks are the last hired and first fired, then the tighter you can get a labor market, the more disproportionally good effect you will have on black unemployment."
One factor in the reduction in the black unemployment rate has been the revival of the manufacturing sector, Mr. Brimmer said. During the strong recovery years from 1985 to 1990 the economy saw a slight decrease in the number of manufacturing jobs, and from January 1989 to September 1993 more than 1.5 million manufacturing jobs disappeared.
But since a higher proportion of black workers are employed in manufacturing than are white workers, they benefited significantly from the 301,000 manufacturing jobs that were created in the last 16 months.
"In the 1990 recession, blacks lost jobs substantially because of the cutback in manufacturing, where they were heavily concentrated," Mr. Brimmer said. "When expansion started this year, black employment lagged for long time but in the last year they have made major gains."
Mr. Brimmer cautioned that the relatively rosy picture in black employment rates could turn dark this year if the economy slows down under the weight of higher interest rates. "This is a cyclical pattern," he said. "If we hit another recession and if the cutback in factory jobs is substantial, than black gains will erode. Whether these gains persist will depend entirely on whether a high rate of growth in the economy is maintained."

HEADLINE: Hanoi to Accept Refugees Now in Germany in Exchange for Aid

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Germany said today that it would soon begin forcibly repatriating some of the 40,000 Vietnamese immigrants here illegally, and that Hanoi agreed to accept them by 2000 in exchange for increased trade and economic aid.
About 60,000 other Vietnamese whose status as refugees or immigrants has been recognized would not be affected, officials said. 
 The accord will eliminate a legacy of the cold war and enable Germany to compete more effectively with the United States and Japan in the emerging market economy in Vietnam, but official rejected criticism that the agreement sacrificed human rights for business aims.
"There are about 20,000 Vietnamese whose applications for asylum have been rejected, and these would be the first to be considered for repatriation," said Bernd Schmidbauer, who helped negotiate the agreement. "We assume there will be some Vietnamese citizens who will want to go back voluntarily, but we do not know exactly how many there will be."
Phan Huy Oanh, a Vietnamese refugee who has lived in Europe for 20 years, said, "Only a small percentage want to go back voluntarily."
Long delayed by Vietnam's refusal to guarantee that the returnees would be welcome, the agreement commits Germany to provide $130 million in aid over the next two years, part of it to help the refugees get a new start in Vietnam.
Bonn will also make available $65 million next year to underwrite risk insurance for German investment projects and exports to Vietnam. Daimler-Benz A.G., the automotive giant, said today that it was planning to build a $70 million bus factory in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).
West Germany offered political asylum to thousands of Vietnamese during and after the Vietnam War, which ended with a Communist victory in 1975. Others were Vietnamese workers and their families brought in as laborers and students by Communist East Germany in the 1980's.
There were about 62,000 Vietnamese in East Germany when Communism collapsed in 1989, and about 12,000 stayed after unification in 1990 despite a Government offer of a plane ticket and $2,000 cash for every one who agreed to return home.
In 1993 Germany eliminated a constitutional guarantee of an asylum hearing for anyone who could get into the country and apply.

<rr>Old Glory in Hanoi
 BANGKOK, Thailand, Jan. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- United States diplomats say they are within days of raising an American flag over a modern nine-story office building in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, to mark establishment of limited diplomatic ties 20 years after the last American diplomats were forced to flee Vietnam.
The building is expected to be opened this month after the signing of an agreement on American and Vietnamese properties seized at the end of the Vietnam War.
"We've already got the flag here, and it's ready to go up," said an American diplomat in Hanoi, speaking on condition that he not be named.
The building is expected to be converted into an embassy when the two countries establish full diplomatic relations, although that move is thought by some diplomats to be months away, if not years. The United States has said that it will withhold full diplomatic relations until there is further progress in determining the fate of more than 1,600 Americans still listed as missing in action in Vietnam.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: WELFARE;
Republicans' Philosophical Discord Stalls Plan for Changes

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Negotiations over the future of the nation's welfare programs have been slowed by the emergence of deep philosophical disagreements between Republican governors and Republican members of Congress.
In general, participants in the negotiations said, governors want the fewest possible restrictions on their use of Federal money to help poor people with the costs of food, shelter, clothing and child care. By contrast, conservative Republican members of Congress say they want to regulate use of the Federal money to change the behavior of welfare recipients, to reduce out-of-wedlock births and to penalize welfare recipients who refuse to work. 
 The Republican governors and members of Congress agree that the states should have much more flexibility in designing and operating welfare programs. They also agree that each state should receive a lump sum of Federal money for purposes defined by the Federal Government in only the broadest terms. But they disagree on many details, including whether states should be allowed to cut their own spending on welfare.
"What some of the governors want is for us to put the Federal money on a stump in the middle of a forest in the dead of night," said an aide to the new House Republican leaders.
Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican, said the Republican governors shared the goals and values of the new Republican majority in Congress. But in an interview today, Mr. Branstad said: "We don't want Congress to replace liberal prescriptions with conservative prescriptions. We don't want to see Federal bureaucrats replace liberal micromanagement with conservative micromanagement."
The priorities of House Republican leaders were set forth in the original version of their welfare-overhaul proposal, the Personal Responsibility Act, which would have denied welfare benefits to noncitizens, to the children of unmarried women under 18 and to children whose fathers had not been identified to the state. But in the last two weeks, Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia has embraced proposals by Republican governors who simply want to replace the existing welfare programs with the lump sums known as block grants.
Republicans say the Federal Government would save money because, under the block-grant proposal, it would freeze or cut spending on programs that would otherwise grow steadily.
Governor Branstad said that Congress could hold governors accountable for use of the money, but should not impose new requirements. For example, he said, Congress should not require states to maintain their current levels of welfare spending. "I don't think there should be a maintenance-of-effort requirement," he said.
Thirty of the 50 governors are Republicans, and Congress, now dominated by Republicans, is listening to their advice as never before.
A proposal sent to Mr. Gingrich by the Republican Governors Association says, "G.O.P. governors support block grants in three major areas of welfare and social spending: Aid to Families with Dependent Children/ cash assistance, food and child care." The Republican governors said they wanted to explore block grants in five other areas: child welfare, social services, employment and training, health and housing.
Confidential records of the negotiations obtained from Republican governors and members of Congress show disagreements in these areas:
*Under the House Republican proposal, "states cannot use Federal dollars for cash aid to minor mothers giving birth outside marriage." The Republican governors' proposal has no such requirement, leaving states free to set policy as they choose.
*House Republicans would require states to "limit receipt of cash benefits to a specific number of years," probably two to five years. The governors' proposal has no such requirement.
*Under the House Republican proposal, at least 20 percent of welfare recipients would have to participate in work programs by the year 2002. The Republican governors' proposal contains no such requirement.
*House Republicans stipulate that as a condition of receiving Federal money, states must spend "at least as much on child care as they did" last year. The governors' proposal contains no such requirement.
*Under the governors' proposal, "the block grant is an entitlement to states," meaning that each state would be automatically entitled to a lump sum of Federal money for welfare each year. Under the House Republican proposal, "the block grant is not an entitlement to states."
*Republican governors want to eliminate an unusual provision of the Medicaid law that prohibits states from reducing welfare payments below the levels in effect in May 1988. The Congressional proposal does not discuss this issue.
The Republican governors said that the food stamp program, the school lunch program, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children and the Meals on Wheels program for the elderly should all be consolidated in the block grant for food and nutrition. They listed Head Start as one of a dozen programs to be consolidated in the child care block grant.
John Truscott, press secretary for Gov. John Engler of Michigan, said the governors and Congressional leaders were close to agreement on block grants. But he said the agreement could founder if Congress insisted on dictating details such as a prohibition on welfare benefits for unmarried teen-age mothers.
"Decisions like that should be made at the state level, not in Washington," Mr. Truscott said. "We would not choose that route. Our welfare reforms in Michigan are based on incentives, not a punitive approach. We're not going to punish innocent children."
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is the chairman of the National Governors' Association, said Mr. Gingrich and other Republican Congressional leaders were negotiating with "a handpicked group of governors" who did not reflect the views of the association.
"I'm adamantly opposed to putting school nutrition programs into a block grant," said Mr. Dean. "Nowhere in the Republicans' 'Contract With America' does it say that starving schoolchildren is one of their aims."
Mr. Dean also voiced a fear that millions of people could suffer hardship if the welfare and food stamp programs were converted to block grants and no longer expanded automatically to meet the additional need in time of recession. In such a case, he said, the states would have to "raise taxes or throw people in the streets."
Michael J. Horowitz, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who is advising House Republicans on welfare policy, said the block grants would be a great step forward.
"But in the long run," he said, "states cannot get protection against Federal intrusion if they use Federal revenue. Conservatives should ultimately be shooting for a federalism in which the Federal Government surrenders sources of revenue equal to the cost of the Federal programs being turned over to the states, as we proposed in the Reagan Administration."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Blame for the Cold War Falls on the Soviet Side

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Those on the political right who have been inveighing against the leftish tendencies of PBS documentaries can find solace in "Messengers From Moscow," an account of the cold war that echoes decades of messages from Washington that Soviet ambitions were behind the long East-West confrontation.
Relying on recently opened Soviet archives and testimony from former high Soviet officials and apparatchiks, the four-hour retrospective centers on Kremlin machinations in the pursuit of power. The first program, tomorrow night, deals with postwar Europe, particularly Germany, which Stalin saw as the key to a Soviet takeover of the Continent. 
 Reminiscences of Vyachelsav M. Molotov, Stalin's Foreign Minister, who died in 1986, set forth his boss's goal "to expand the limits of our motherland as far as possible." And Wolfgang Leonhard, a German refugee from Hitler, tells of being sent back to his devastated country in 1945 as part of a team of commissars to make sure that control remained in Moscow's hands. The main tactic, in Germany as elsewhere in Europe, says this messenger from Moscow, was to beat down or co-opt the Social Democrats, the Communists' main opponents on the ascendant left.
A former high-ranking French Communist, Auguste Lecoeur, defines the real meaning of the benign sounding "united front" that seemed so appealing to many on the left, even in the United States: "In a united front there'd be just one party, controlled of course by the Communist Party. It was a way of getting rid of the Socialist Party completely." This aged stalwart remembers Stalin as "a terrific guy," "a wonderful fellow with a nice sense of humor."
For no good reason, the program goes in for peculiarly lighted scenes of a movie projector showing pictures of Molotov in his last days, and E. G. Marshall's heavy narration seems to have been influenced by old radio shows about the F.B.I. But newsreels of the time are reminders of the ruined Germany into which the Soviet Army moved (the red flags hung out in welcome had been made from pieces of Nazi flags) and of the staged rallies that masked political takeovers in much of Central and Eastern Europe.
By this account, the United States was compelled to move from a desire for cooperation to economic and military confrontation as Soviet intentions became clear. The narrator credits the Marshall Plan (named for George C., not E. G.) with blocking Soviet intentions in West Germany. Stalin, says E. G., created "a world of enemies."
Next week, "Messengers From Moscow" turns to Asia and the complicated relations between Mao Zedong and Soviet leaders that figured in Soviet involvement in the Korean War. Moscow's role in the Cuban missile crisis and the Vietnam War is covered later, and the series ends with the collapse of the Soviet economy and the Communist ideology.
This steadily interesting, emphatically nonrevisionist history, written, produced and directed by Daniel Wolf, a former BBC man, was paid for in part by conservative groups like the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation. Doubtless some historians will find it overly kind to the United States. Fine. Let them have a hearing, too. As long as PBS keeps opening up debate on a reasonably serious level, it is earning its keep.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Prices for Natural Gas Drop As Mild Weather Continues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Natural gas futures traded at their lowest price in more than two and a half years yesterday as a decline linked to mild winter weather in much of the country continued.
Analysts said the slide appeared to be slowing after seven consecutive sessions of losses, but new forecasts for above-normal temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast through at least Jan. 21 offered little hope for a price recovery. 
 "It's the winter that never was -- unless you happen to live in California or the Rockies," said Tom Knight, a trading manager in New York for Fina Oil and Chemical.
On other commodity markets, crude oil futures rose strongly and precious metals advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau's index rose 0.54 point to 234.41.
Natural gas for February delivery finished 0.2 cent lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $1.437 for 1,000 cubic feet. Prices recovered after falling early in the session to $1.375, the lowest price for near-term deliveries since April 28, 1992.
Natural gas demand is running as much as 22 percent below normal in the Northeast and 19 percent below normal in the Midwest this winter because of mild temperatures, Jon Davis, a Smith Barney meteorologist, said.
"Everybody's way below normal, and from this point on it's hard to change these numbers," he added.
Meanwhile, crude oil, gasoline and heating oil futures rallied in response to weather-related problems in loading North Sea crude onto ships, and weekly industry data showing tighter American supplies.
February crude oil rose 35 cents, to $17.72 a barrel; February heating oil rose 0.60 cent, to 47.98 cents a gallon, and February wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.88 cent, to 54.54 cents a gallon.
Elsewhere, gold and silver futures rose strongly on the Commodity Exchange of New York as the financial crisis in Mexico spurred investment buying of precious metals, long regarded as a safe haven in troubled times. February gold rose $2.20, to $377.30 an ounce, while March silver rose 5 cents, to $4.735 an ounce.

HEADLINE: A Pay Raise's Impact

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, which appears to be advocating a higher minimum wage as one of its major policy objectives, is doing so at a time when most economists find less damage from raising the minimum wage than they once did.
A chief argument against raising the minimum wage, among both economists and politicians, is the fear of job losses. The threat is that employers will dismiss thousands of workers on the ground that they lack the skills to be worth more than the minimum wage, which is $4.25 an hour. But nearly all these estimates of job losses have shrunk as research continues. 
 "The main thing about this research is that the evidence of job loss is weak," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "And the fact that the evidence is weak suggests that the impact on jobs is small."
That does not quiet the debate. The new Republican leaders in Congress have vowed to reject any bill to raise the minimum wage, invoking the prospect of job losses as the chief reason. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, House majority leader, said last week that he not only opposed an increase in the minimum wage, but would also like to repeal the law.
Still, Vice President Al Gore and the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, in recent appearances have publicly supported a higher minimum wage. President Clinton may endorse the move this week or next.
"Lifting the minimum wage is one of several major initiatives designed to lift the wages of all working Americans," a senior Administration official said. He ranked its importance with the President's recent tax cut proposals for middle-income families.
For all the political controversy surrounding the minimum wage, economists who study the issue have managed to agree on several key findings. These agreements help to explain why the minimum wage debate, as Mr. Gephardt put it, has become "a metaphor for the differences between Democrats and Republicans."
Contrary to popular wisdom, for example, economists have found that only one-third of the roughly four million minimum-wage earners are teen-agers. The rest are adults older than 25, a significant number of whom -- some say as many as 45 percent -- provide nearly half of their families' incomes. Raising the minimum by 75 cents an hour, the amount being considered by the Administration, would bring a gain in living standards, but only for those who do not lose their jobs.
Economists have also found that raising the minimum wage produces a net gain in total income. That is, the total income growth for minimum-wage workers who keep their jobs exceeds the income lost by those who lose theirs.
The gains in income, for some economists and politicians, can thus outweigh the loss in jobs. "If your objective is to make work pay well enough so that it takes fewer wage earners in a family to keep the family out of poverty, then raising the minimum wage is a worthy goal," said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
That is a goal mentioned by Administration officials. But for many Republicans and for Finis Welch, a labor economist at Texas A & M University, saving jobs should be the higher priority. "We are in effect telling unskilled people that if they are not worth the wages we set, they cannot work," said Mr. Welch, who added that he believed most employers would do little to train low-skilled workers so they could become more valuable and eventually worth the higher minimum wage.
But Mr. Welch and other economists agree that a higher minimum wage tends to lure people out of idleness and into jobs by making work more valuable than, say, the alternative of government welfare programs. As a result, the cost of low-income workers shifts a bit to business from the public sector.
Finally, there is agreement that a higher minimum wage has a ripple effect, pushing up wages for those earning as much as 50 cents more than the previous minimum. More than 5.5 million workers, or nearly 5 percent of the workforce, receive wages within 50 cents of the minimum, which rose to $4.25 in 1991 from $3.80. That's one reason that business regularly opposes increases in the minimum wage.
Yet the principal battle cry against raising the minimum wage -- job losses -- is no longer as powerful an argument as it once was. A decade ago, most studies concluded that 1 percent or more of all minimum wage workers lost their jobs for each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage. The most recent studies put the job losses at less than 1 percent, or roughly 40,000 people if Congress were to increase the current minimum by 75 cents, a jump of nearly 18 percent.
Some studies go even further. Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, contend that there is little evidence of any job loss at all from increasing the minimum wage. Mr. Krueger recently became chief economist at the Labor Department, where he is an adviser to Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor and a principal advocate within the Clinton Administration of lifting wages at the low end of the job ladder.
By contrast, Mr. Welch at Texas A & M insists that the traditional view about job loss is still correct. His new study, done with two colleagues, Donald Deere of Texas A & M and Kevin M. Murphy of the University of Chicago, was made public on Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Washington. It estimated that a 10 percent rise in the minimum wage between 1989 and 1991 produced job losses of at least 1 percent of all minimum wage workers. That would be roughly 60,000 people if the current minimum were raised by 75 cents.
Alone among the most recent studies, said Charles Brown, a University of Michigan labor economist, "the Welch findings go back to an older thesis that there was a bigger job impact when the minimum wage rose."
President Clinton promised, in the 1992 election campaign, to raise the minimum wage. But he took no action while he pursued a health insurance bill. Now Administration officials argue that raising the minimum, which has lost a third of its purchasing power since 1979, would help narrow the wage gap between low- and middle-income workers.
Professor Solow of M.I.T. agrees. "When the minimum wage has deteriorated so much in purchasing power," he said, "there are probably enough people who would be worth the higher wage and would not lose their jobs."

Job categories covered by the minimuim have varied over the years; some states set higher minimums. Figures are plotted monthly and are adjusted for inflation based on the consumer price index (seasonally adjusted starting in 1972). (Source: Datastream)

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S FINANCIAL TURMOIL: THE MARKETS;
Remarks by Clinton Halt Slide of Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton's willingness to lend Mexico more money to overcome its economic crisis reassured investors today and buoyed the Mexican stock exchange after two days of steep losses.
The peso recovered some strength, closing at 5.675 to the dollar, compared with Tuesday's close of 5.85. Mexican companies and funds on the New York Stock Exchange rebounded in active trading. 
 Interest rates on Mexican Treasury certificates rose to 40 percent from about 33 percent last week as the Government offered higher rates to attract investors. Yet, demand for the notes was tepid.
On the stock market, the intense volatility of the last few days continued today in spite of the surprising turnaround. At one point in midmorning, the Mexican stock market was down 6.7 percent, exceeding Tuesday's 6.26 percent loss. But investors began feeling more confident after Mr. Clinton's backing.
"The U.S. offer to be lender of last resort to Mexico is very comforting," said Soraya Betterton, manager of Latin American equities at G. T. Capital Management in San Francisco. "What he said was that however many billions it takes, for however long it takes, the United States will be willing to fund Mexico's short-term funding needs."
Mr. Clinton said "it is in America's economic and strategic interests that Mexico succeeds." He was prepared, he said, to increase the $9 billion the United States had already committed to assisting Mexico.
Stock exchanges in other Latin American countries followed Mexico's lead and also recovered some today. Argentina, Brazil and Chile all posted gains, after heavy losses Tuesday.
Throughout the three and a half weeks of the crisis, the biggest worry of many investors has been the $28 billion worth of Mexican Treasury bonds that are indexed to the dollar and scheduled to fall due in 1995. Foreigners hold 80 percent of those bonds and have recently redeemed some of them for dollars, rather than rolling them over, pulling their money out of Mexico.
Mexico can draw on an $18 billion international loan package, but in recent days even this has not been sufficient to calm the market. President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon said today that additional help from "the multilateral financial organizations, of which Mexico is a member" would be announced soon.
In his speech, Mr. Zedillo recognized the dangers of an unsteady market, but he predicted that additional help would put things in order. "We are confident that in a few days, we will have been able to stabilize the main financial factors, including the exchange rate," he said.
A team from the International Monetary Fund has arrived in Mexico to work with the authorities on the possibility of a loan for as much as $1.6 billion. President Clinton asked the fund to help Mexico as quickly as possible, but officials there say it will take at least six weeks for a loan decision to be made.
Mexico has already started drawing on the $18 billion loan package, which includes $9 billion from the United States. On Monday, it borrowed $500 million from the United States and the equivalent of $59 million from Canada.
Mexico will have six months to repay the United States at interest rates equal to the three-month Treasury bill rate, which is slightly above 5.5 percent. Mr. Clinton offered today to give Mexico more time to repay the loans, if such a move became necessary.
The Mexican Government's focus has been on shoring up the peso and keeping money from flowing out of the country -- today offering 40 percent for 28-day Treasury notes, and 44.9 percent for those extending to 90 days.
However, even at those rates, the supply of notes exceeded demand. Buyers took 57 percent of the 1.3 billion pesos worth of 28-day certificates.
Although the stock market here regained some ground, many analysts remained worried by its continuing unpredictability. "I've never seen such volatility before," said Patricia Tyler, an analyst at S. G. Warburg in New York.
The exchange's price index swung more than 200 points during today's trading, finally settling at 2,027.87, up 2.82 percent. Despite the modest rally, the Mexican exchange is still down from the beginning of the week, the result of a combined 12.5 percent drop Monday and Tuesday.
Francisco Drohojowski, a portfolio manager with Ethos Capital Management in New York, said the market was still running on panic.
"Rationality is not prevailing on Wall Street," he said, "Now we are truly getting into a hallucinatory mode. It's panic, but a very unfounded panic."
The peso crisis has already forced some companies to adjust their outlook for 1995. Volkswagen de Mexico has decided to suspend production for the last week of January to compensate for an expected reduction in demand caused by the devaluation.

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S FINANCIAL TURMOIL: THE FALLOUT;
Argentina Striving To Regain Confidence

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 11

 BODY:
As Mexico's financial crisis continues, and markets around Latin America are jolted, Argentina has been hit hardest among the Latin nations.
Although Argentine stocks rebounded today, the financial markets have plummeted in recent days and short-term interest rates have spiraled, sending officials scrambling to allay investor concerns. 
 Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo has been meeting in New York this week with bankers and investors, trying to convince them that while Argentina's economy closely resembles Mexico's, their fates are not interwined.
In a recent interview here, Mr. Cavallo said, "In Argentina it is impossible to have the sequence of events that occurred in Mexico last year." He argued that there were distinct structural differences between the economic policies of the two countries. And he added that Argentina would have no trouble meeting its future debt payments.
Unfortunately, Mr. Cavallo said, nervous investors tended to view Latin America as a monolith because many Latin nations had undertaken similar economic reforms with varying success. Argentina and Mexico have both opened their economies to foreign investment and have privatized state industries. Both also have huge current-account deficits, which makes them dependent on flows of outside capital.
"That explains the reason investors are very nervous when they hear the words Latin America after what happened in Mexico," Mr. Cavallo said. "Many think that what happened in Mexico is destined to be repeated elsewhere, but nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to Argentina."
He said that while the stock and bond markets had declined, overall investment remained strong and the economy continued to expand. Still, if stocks and bonds continued to be depressed over the long haul, there would be a significant increase in the cost of credit for public projects and private business and this would result in less growth for 1995.
"Argentina shouldn't have a crisis like Mexico's," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "The current-account deficit is smaller, and the reserves are higher, and the domestic money supply is dollar-backed."
While analysts and economists agreed that Argentina was not Mexico, they warned that if Argentina did not regain investor confidence, it faced a daunting choice: much slower economic growth or a currency devaluation.
"We do tend to think of Argentina as different from Mexico," said Lawrence Goodman, a Salomon Brothers economist, but the spillover from the Mexican peso crisis has "impaired investor confidence that is absolutely critical for Argentina's continued success."
"There is clearly a risk here of capital drying up quite dramatically, which could effectively send the Argentine economy into a period of very slow growth," he said.
The main distinction between the two countries is Argentina's exchange-rate policy, or convertibility plan, which fixes the peso by law at a 1-to-1 ratio to the dollar and prohibits printing of local currency unless it is backed by new capital.
Officials have said that under the plan, every Argentine peso in circulation is backed by a dollar reserve in the central bank and that transactions can be performed in either currency. Mexico never had such a system, and last month, under market pressure, it decided to let the peso float freely. Since then, the Mexican peso has declined 39 percent against the dollar.
Mr. Cavallo attributed much of Mexico's problems to a sharp reduction in the level of foreign reserves last year just as the Government greatly expanded domestic credit. "That dangerous combination is impossible under the rules of convertibility," he said, "because in the case of Argentina, whenever there is a reduction in reserves, there has to be a necessary contraction in the printing of local currency."
Eduardo Tapia, director and country manager for Baring Securities here, said Argentina's convertibility law provided an open window on the level of foreign reserves that back up the monetary system and protect against the flight of capital. "If Argentina sticks to its convertibility plan, it seems virtually impossible," Mr. Tapia said, for the Argentine peso to suffer a devaluation.
Analysts and economists agreed that the peso-dollar parity was the cornerstone of the country's economic liberalization and that uncoupling the two would have dire effects, perhaps echoing conditions being experienced in Mexico. Mr. Cavallo said that a devaluation was "no way out, but added: "How can you devalue if you are ready to have the whole economy functioning in dollars? It imposes a tax on the people and reduces living standards."
Argentina's convertibility plan, which took effect in 1991 with other economic changes, opened the economy to international competition and investment, reducing inflation to less than 5 percent today from more than 5,000 percent in 1989. Economic and industrial growth since 1991 have been among the highest in the world -- 6 to 9 percent a year, fueled by significant increases in investment and productivity.
Last year, Argentina had new capital investment equal to 20.2 percent of its gross domestic product, the total of goods and services, of which 3 percentage points was from abroad and 17.2 points worth from local investors, according to Mr. Cavallo.
Under the most optimistic assumptions for this year, he expects investment to equal 21.5 percent of the gross domestic product, with 2.6 percentage points of that coming from abroad and the remaining 18.9 points to be financed locally.
He acknowledged, however, that the crisis of confidence set off in Mexico, combined with the possibility of still higher American interest rates, might make it harder for Argentina to continue attracting foreign capital.
In an effort to obtain capital and balance the budget, Mr. Cavallo said Argentina would sell $3 billion of state assets this year, including hydroelectric and nuclear power plants and a petrochemical plant, inviting foreign companies to bid directly.
On what he called the optimistic assumption that foreign confidence revived quickly, Argentina hoped to attract enough outside capital to finance an $8 billion deficit in its current account -- the difference between what Argentines take in from exports and what they pay for imports, plus the amount needed to meet foreign debt obligations -- allowing the economy to continue growing at 6.5 percent this year.
On the pessimistic assumption that foreign capital became harder to find, the Finance Minister said economic growth would fall to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 1990.

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S FINANCIAL TURMOIL: THE ASSISTANCE;
White House Moves to Increase Aid to Mexico

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration moved today to increase its aid package for Mexico, warning members of Congress that more money may be needed for new, subsidized loans.
Declaring Mexico's prosperity and stability to be an important American interest, President Clinton also said today that the United States was ready to increase its existing $9 billion line of credit for Mexico and give it longer to repay the money. 
 Mexican stocks rose sharply and the peso recovered a bit following the President's declaration, his first official response to the peso's plunge. But interest rates in Mexico continued to climb.
Lawrence Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, told lawmakers at a closed-door meeting this evening that the Administration was looking into ways to provide subsidized loans to Mexico for the first time, according to a Congressional aide who insisted on anonymity. The aide did not know how large the loans might be. Treasury officials had no immediate comment. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, joined Mr. Summers at the meeting.
The current line of credit is not technically subsidized because the Mexican Government is required to post an equal sum in pesos as collateral. The credit line also uses money from discretionary funds at the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. These funds receive little Congressional oversight.
Subsidized loans might require Congressional action because a 1991 law requires that Congress appropriate an amount equal to the subsidy of each loan. The Clinton Administration presented top members of Congress with a plan that they said would not require any appropriation because Mexico would cover the subsidy. But Congressional leaders neither accepted nor rejected the idea, asking Mr. Summers to refine the concept.
In 1992, the Bush Administration briefly considered a similar plan to require Israel to pay fees equal to the subsidy value of Federal guarantees for $10 billion in loans for the construction of housing in Israel. But the Bush Administration ended up persuading Congress to appropriate the subsidy money.
The President said in his statement this morning: "We have a strong interest in prosperity and stability in Mexico. It is in America's economic and strategic interest that Mexico succeeds."
During a news conference this afternoon with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan, Mr. Clinton also praised Mexico for working with the United States on illegal drug and immigration issues. Solving Mexico's current troubles is important for the rest of Latin America, he added. "Mexico is sort of a bellwether for the rest of Latin America and developing countries throughout the world," he said. "So we have to work on the confidence and the liquidity crisis, and I think that it's in our interest to do so."
On Tuesday, stock markets across Latin America plunged in response to Mexico's problems. They stabilized today. Many economists have played down the risk of trouble spreading beyond Mexico because few Latin American countries have trade deficits nearly as large as Mexico's. The trade deficit, while not the only factor, is widely considered to be at the root of the peso crisis.
Administration officials left vague how much extra money the United States might lend following President Clinton's comments today. That prevented financial markets from determining whether the credit line would be enough to cover Mexico's enormous need for cash to prop up the peso and redeem Government bonds.
The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve made the $6 billion line of credit available to Mexico on Dec. 22 and expanded it to $9 billion on Jan. 3. Mexico borrowed $500 million of this money on Monday.
The current rules for the line of credit require that Mexico repay all loans within six months, at an annual interest rate equal to that on the three-month Treasury bill. President Clinton indicated today that Mexico would be given longer to repay the money if it needed more time.
"If appropriate, I am prepared to authorize the extension of the maturity of our existing credit facility and to increase those commitments to assist Mexico in meeting its short-term financial obligations," the President said in his statement.
The President also called on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to lend substantial sums to Mexico. An I.M.F. negotiating team arrived on Tuesday night in Mexico City, but it could take two months or more to strike a deal because Mexico allowed its previous lending program with the fund to expire in 1993. Details of a new program must be negotiated from scratch.
The World Bank already lends $1.5 billion a year to Mexico, and has flown two dozen advisers to Mexico City in the last week to help the Mexican Government prepare for the sale of state-owned enterprises to raise money.
There has been some criticism from Congress and even within the Federal Reserve over the way the Administration is freeing up funds for the bailout package.
Half the money for the Mexican line of credit is coming from Federal Reserve currency dealings and the other half from the $20 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund, a highly unusual Treasury Department account that is largely exempt from Congressional oversight. The Exchange Stabilization Fund can be spent by the Treasury Secretary, "for the purpose of stabilization of the exchange value of the dollar and maintaining orderly exchange arrangements."
A Treasury official who insisted on anonymity said that the current assistance to Mexico was legal because the department was trying to maintain order in foreign exchange markets.
Seeking to forestall any Congressional criticism of today's pledge of further assistance, President Clinton called the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate on Tuesday night, White House officials said.

HEADLINE: MEXICO'S FINANCIAL TURMOIL: THE COSTS;
For American Corporations, a Tie That Binds Too Tightly

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 11

 BODY:
These days, Mexico's troubles are increasingly becoming the United States'.
The risks presented by the rapidly growing Mexican operations of American corporations seemed clear today as more companies announced setbacks. The Federal-Mogul Corporation, a maker of auto parts, said its 1994 and 1995 earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates partly because of the peso's decline and the slumping Mexican economy. The company's stock fell $5.375 yesterday, to $17.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Banks and drug makers thought to face Mexican tangles, including Citicorp, J. P. Morgan, Warner-Lambert and Schering-Plough, saw declines in their share prices of a dollar or more.
Under a new trade pact that took effect last year, many American companies have been treating Mexico, like Canada, as part of a unified North American market. Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the financial panic in Mexico should remind American companies that Mexico remainedmore similar to Thailand or Indonesia than to Canada.
"If anybody was thinking that Mexico had entered the population of developed countries," he said, "this takes care of that expectation."
Some companies, including General Electric and General Motors, said they had shielded themselves against the peso's decline. But even these companies fear a decline in Mexican demand for their products.
"It's going to hurt," John F. Smith Jr., chief executive of G.M., said in an interview. "The market in Mexico will no doubt fall off significantly."
While the Mexican Government is trying to impose a 60-day price freeze, companies like General Electric and Chrysler have asked officials to permit increases to offset their dollar costs.
Chrysler says its Mexican sales have nearly halted. The dollar costs of importing cars and parts, the company said, now sometimes exceed the company's retail car prices in pallid pesos.
"In some cases we just cannot be offering products for sale until we work out the pricing with the Government," said James D. Donlon, the controller of Chrysler. He was speaking from home, stricken by the flu or perhaps by devaluationitis. "It's what made me sick," he said.
Among the companies that have already said that the peso's collapse has hurt their earnings are Mattel, Chemical Bank, Kimberly-Clark, the Russell Corporation and Pilgrim's Pride, a poultry processor.
Kimberly-Clark, which is deducting $39 million from 1994 earnings, said the devaluations were forcing its Mexican unit to pay more pesos on its dollar debts and on imports of wood pulp that go into Kleenex tissues, diapers and other products.
Although Kimberly-Clark has looked at investing in financial instruments that rise in value as the peso declines, the costs of hedging are prohibitive because so few investors want to take the opposite side, betting on a rising peso. "Those who are willing are going to charge you a huge premium for the privilege," said Tina S. Barry, a spokesperson for Kimberly-Clark.
Mattel, taking a $20 million pretax charge against 1994 earnings, had an opposite problem: fewer dollars in rather than more pesos out. The peso plunge caught Mattel just at the height of the Christmas season, when its Mexican customers owed the most. Their peso debts are now worth fewer dollars.
General Electric, having ridden out 99 years of Mexican tumult, has become adept at smoothing its course. The output from its Mexican plants passed $1 billion last year; G. E. Capital, its financial arm, has invested more than $400 million in the last three years.
The company, which had expected a peso devaluation, went to the expense of hedging. G. E. Capital has concentrated on financing projects like real estate or export-oriented companies that can pay their debts in dollars.

HEADLINE: Another Year Of Little Rise In Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Despite fears of inflation that have dominated economic policy in the last year, consumer prices for 1994 rose only 2.7 percent, the fourth consecutive year in which inflation failed to advance any more than 3 percent or so, the Government said today.
Consumer prices in December crept up just two-tenths of 1 percent, held down by a rare decline in the cost of housing. 
 Looking at the figures apart from the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called core inflation rate rose last year at the lowest rate since 1965. The core rate was 2.6 percent last year, after a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in December.
Particularly impressive last year, some analysts said, was the modest rise in prices in the service sector, where inflation was only 2.9 percent in 1994, compared with 3.8 percent in 1993. Traditionally, that labor-intensive area has been more prone to inflation than manufacturing, where production is highly mechanized and subject to intense competition that helps keep down costs.
"The forces of disinflation are really powerful," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. He called the slackened price pressures in services a "breakthrough" that would likely mean that inflation remained in check.
Mr. Roach noted that inflation in services was running two full percentage points less than at the comparable stage in 1986, when the business expansion of the 1980's was nearing its fourth anniversary.
He and other analysts cited a number of factors for the economy's resistance to inflation, from consumer bargain-hunting to cost-conscious companies that are finally reaping the productivity benefits of investments in computers and telecommunications equipment like voice mail and fax machines.
"Everybody's got a laptop at work and a PC at home," said Irwin L. Kellner, senior economic adviser to the Chemical Bank in New York.
But while the prospects may seem bright, the extent to which inflation actually increases in the future primarily rests with the Federal Reserve. By raising interest rates in a bid to prevent the economy from overheating, the Fed is hoping that its restraining effect will offset sharp increases in various commodity prices and the prices of goods at intermediate stages of the production process.
The economy is now believed to have speeded up in the fourth quarter, to a pace roughly twice the 2.5 percent or so it can sustain in the long run. Consequently, the Fed is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates again soon. The most likely time, analysts said, is at its next policy meeting in three weeks.
Still, a few more voices are warning that the Fed risks overdoing its credit tightening in the face of continued subdued inflation and the acknowledgment, from the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, on down, that the Consumer Price Index significantly overstates price pressures.
"Monetary policy makers must tread lightly in 1995," said James Coons, chief economist at the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. "One more 50-basis point hike in the Federal funds rate, to 6 percent, may be warranted. But any increases beyond that level would begin to put the expansion at risk."
A dire warning came from R. David Ranson of H. C. Wainwright & Company in Boston. He told clients this week that the last Fed increase, on Nov. 15, made a recession "virtually inevitable" in 1996.
While the overall inflation results for December were as expected, causing little reaction in securities markets, some components of the index raised eyebrows. Housing, which accounts for 41 percent of the index, posted its first decline since 1986, as the price of hotel rooms and other out-of-town lodging eased. New cars were unchanged in price, after seasonal adjustment, despite increases announced by producers.
Pushing in the other direction, however, was a second sharp rise in the cost of medical care in the last three months -- six-tenths of 1 percent in both October and December. Some analysts suggested that may reflect the death of health care legislation, which occurred in late summer.
Still, medical inflation for 1994 as a whole retreated to 4.9 percent, continuing the moderation from a peak of 9.6 percent in 1990. That was the lowest annual increase since 1972, when Federal price controls held much of the American economy in their grip.
The 2.6 percent core rate of inflation, which removes the erratic food and energy components, was down from 3.2 percent in 1993 and the lowest since a rise of 1.5 percent in 1965. Food, which accounts for 16 percent of the C.P.I., rose 2.9 percent last year. Energy, accounting for 7 percent, rose 2.2 percent.
For December, food and beverages jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent, mainly reflecting an increase of 11.6 percent for fresh fruits and vegetables, partly because of crop losses from tropical storm Gordon in the Southeast. Gasoline was unchanged last month, but would have risen nine-tenths of 1 percent had it not been for an adjustment for the introduction of reformulated fuel in many areas.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Maurice Saatchi Is Forming A New Independent Shop

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Eight days after Maurice Saatchi's ouster as chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi led him to quit the world's fifth-largest agency company in anger, the colorful British advertising executive is forming his own breakaway shop.
Mr. Saatchi, 48, whose roller-coaster career has made him one of the most significant industry figures of the last quarter century, said yesterday that he would start an agency with three top executives who resigned in solidarity from the Saatchi & Saatchi Company on Monday. 
 "Events have moved much more quickly than anyone could have imagined," Mr. Saatchi said in a statement. "In order to avoid any more uncertainty, I have decided to announce the foundation of a new agency."
Not since 1979, when Carl Spielvogel and William Backer left the Interpublic Group of Companies to open their own shop, have such well-known senior executives departed for as high profile a start-up. Mr. Saatchi is expected to open the new agency in London around May 1, and he is expected to be joined at some point by his once and future colleagues David Kershaw, Bill Muirhead and Jeremy Sinclair, or "the Three Amigos," as the British media have dubbed them.
Mr. Saatchi's decision to start anew -- underscored by the working name of his entrepreneurial enterprise, the New Saatchi Agency -- is another stunning blow for his former employer since institutional shareholders unhappy with his tenure as chairman convinced the Saatchi & Saatchi board to depose him Dec. 16. He rejected an offer of a less prominent position and left the company Jan. 3.
Saatchi & Saatchi's difficulties were compounded when an important advertiser with longtime ties to Mr. Saatchi, British Airways, said it would review its account and cancel its contract, effective in May, with the London office of the company's flagship agency, Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. A second client, Mirror Group Newspapers, said it would leave without a review, and a third, the Dixons Group retail electronics chain, said it would begin a review.
Although British Airways said it might re-sign with Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising U.K., its account, with billings estimated at $125 million, and that of Mirror Group, with billings estimated at $5 million, are expected to be the foundation of Mr. Saatchi's new venture.
Top Saatchi & Saatchi executives from Britain and the United States meeting in London intensified their bitter tones against the ex-chairman and his compatriots.
"There are a lot of great people who work for Saatchi all over the world, and a lot of them are extremely angry," said Michael Bungey, chief executive at Bates Worldwide in New York, the other big Saatchi & Saatchi international agency.
Referring to Mr. Saatchi and the three other executives, he added, "This is a callous attempt to totally destabilize the company that provided them their livelihood."
Thomas Russell, a private investor in Sarasota, Fla., who is a nonexecutive director at Saatchi & Saatchi, said, "Maurice's attack on the company now is outrageous."
"The people remaining in the agencies are angry at Maurice, and now it's personal," he added. "They're going to service accounts like our clients have never seen."
Mr. Russell defended the board's decision to oust Mr. Saatchi after the large shareholders complained, saying it averted "a protracted proxy fight" by "over 70 percent of the shareholders who would've voted" for Mr. Saatchi's removal.
However, Sir Tim Bell, a leading British public relations executive who is Mr. Saatchi's spokesman, said the ensuing dislocations prove that if "you can't have a successful company without financial men," it is also true that "you can't have an advertising business without advertising men."
"You can't have the dominance of one over the other," he added. "There has to be a partnership."
The crisis underscores the tempestuous and volatile nature of the ad business and the crucial role that personal relationships play.
In a touch reminiscent of the soap operas on which Saatchi & Saatchi agencies buy so much commercial time, the company even charged yesterday that Mr. Saatchi and his brother, Charles, who co-founded the company in 1970, removed 15 filing cabinets from their London office. (The cabinets have since been returned.)
"I wish these people would go away and let us do business," said Martin Puris, president and chief executive at Ammirati & Puris/Lintas in New York, referring to all sides in the clamorous dispute.
"They've done more harm than we've managed to do in the last 100 years," he added. "Industry critics who say the advertising business is flaky and catastrophe is around the corner will say, 'Aha!' "
Mr. Saatchi's attempt to recreate the success he and Charles enjoyed until the late 1980's -- Saatchi & Saatchi was once the world's largest agency company -- also jeopardizes the delicate recovery from the financial difficulties that resulted when the Saatchis' grandiose expansion plans fell prey to the recession.
"The profit recovery at Saatchi & Saatchi will be delayed by a year by virtue of whichever accounts leave," said Alan J. Gottesman, advertising industry analyst at Paine Webber in New York.
In addition to the executives who resigned Monday, four more who worked on the British Airways and Mirror Group accounts, all at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising's London office, left yesterday. Other clients, like Mars Inc. and the Conservative Party in Britain, have previously announced reviews of their accounts, and rumors circulated in London that accounts like Toyota and the new national lottery were shaky, too.
And the price of Saatchi & Saatchi shares on the London Stock Exchange has plunged about 24 percent so far this week. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, American depository receipts equal to three shares each fell for the third-consecutive day, losing 62.5 cents, or about 12 percent, to close at $4.75.
In its counterattack, Saatchi & Saatchi is pointing out the daunting obstacles the breakaway executives face: the restrictive covenants, long-term contracts and noncompete clauses that bar them from recruiting clients or employees.
Michael Henman, a Saatchi & Saatchi spokesman in London, said: "Suffice it to say that all the people who have resigned are bound by employment contracts they will be required to fulfill. We will be making use of those legal covenants to make sure our business will not be damaged by their departure."
Sir Tim, in response, played down the importance of those restrictions.
"Nobody's going to hold them a year, two years, three years," he asserted. "It's pointless." Besides, Sir Tim added, Mr. Saatchi considers his contract void because he believes "he was dismissed."
A second defensive strategy for Saatchi & Saatchi is to replace defectors quickly. Five executives at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising U.K. were promoted to replace the four who resigned yesterday (all likely to land at Mr. Saatchi's new shop.) To replace Nick Hurrell and Moray MacLennan, joint managing directors, Adam Crozier, vice chairman and executive media director, and Tamara Ingram, group director, were named to the new positions of joint chief executives. And to replace two creative directors who left, Simon Dicketts and James Lowther, three new creative directors were named: Cliff Francis, Adam Kean and Richard Myers.
A final Saatchi & Saatchi counterthrust has been to raise doubts about Mr. Saatchi's abilities to find the funds for an agency, given the company's severe financial problems after what Mr. Russell called his "ill-fated acquisition binge."
Similarly, Mr. Spielvogel, who retired in October from Bates, the successor to the agency he and Mr. Backer founded and subsequently sold to Mr. Saatchi, said, "With his track record, who would back him?" Mr. Spielvogel, who often crossed swords with Mr. Saatchi, added, "If Maurice had worked at it the first time, he wouldn't have to work at it the second time."
Sir Tim, in response, said the new Saatchi agency "is being financed by Maurice Saatchi personally." Mr. Saatchi and his brother, who has remained at Saatchi & Saatchi as a consultant, early last week sold all their remaining Saatchi & Saatchi stock, 1.8 million shares, raising about $4 million.
Two potential sources of financing mentioned by advertising executives yesterday denied any involvement with Mr. Saatchi. Richard McGowan, a spokesman for Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York, said, "We're absolutely in no way involved whatsoever."
And Richard Humphreys, a friend of Mr. Saatchi's who is president at the Adcom Inc. investment firm in New York, said that neither Adcom nor N. W. Ayer & Partners, of which Adcom owns 60 percent, was involved with the start-up.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Crisis Drags Down U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
To traders, the peso loomed larger than inflation yesterday. The stock market rallied for all of 10 minutes because of a report showing moderate inflation. But the continuing financial crisis in Mexico quickly dragged down stock prices as traders wondered which American companies would be hurt by the declining peso.
"Some stocks are taking a hit even though nothing has come out yet that even hints that they're going to take a hit," said Paul L. Hennessey, a senior trader at Boston Company Asset Management Group, which manages about $18 billion worth of stocks. 
 After rising 16 points following the release of the December Consumer Price Index, the Dow Jones industrial average fell for almost two hours before rising somewhat the rest of the day.
The Dow closed at 3,862.03, down 4.71 points, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.01 point, to 461.67. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 0.78 point, to 755.74.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with 346.3 million shares changing hands. This was about 16 percent above this year's daily average of 297 million shares.
The Mexico debacle clearly worried traders. One of the biggest decliners of the day was Federal-Mogul, whose share price hit a 52-week low of 16 3/4 before closing at 17 1/2, down 5 3/8.
Federal-Mogul said after the market closed Tuesday that its 1994 full-year earnings, while likely to exceed 1993 earnings by 30 percent, would still fall short of Wall Street expectations by some 6 to 8 percent.
Besides rising raw material costs and higher interest rates, Federal-Mogul on Tuesday cited as a cause of the profit slowdown the "severe devaluation of the peso."
The company, a huge maker of auto parts, is still looking forward to a strong year. For 1995, Nelson Publications' survey of Wall Street analysts, taken before the peso crisis, put Federal-Mogul's mean estimate of full-year earnings at $2.19 a share, up from $1.57 in 1994.
Citicorp shares, and for a time BankAmerica, were down sharply in active trading, perhaps because of their dealings with Mexico. Citicorp fell 1 3/8, to 40 3/8; BankAmerica fell as low as 39 7/8 before closing at 40 7/8, down 1/2.
Also, J. P. Morgan fell 1 3/8, to 56 3/8, and Bankers Trust fell 1, to 56 1/2. But Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, other money-center banks with dealings in Mexico, were unchanged.
Judah Kraushaar, a bank analyst with Merrill Lynch, said stock traders were overreacting to any possible Mexico problems. He said the total Latin American exposure, in terms of loans, bonds and other potential problems, was far less than the exposure in the 1970's and 1980's.
For these six international banks they range from 16 percent of equity for BankAmerica to 40 percent for Bankers Trust, with Citicorp at 23 percent, he said.
"The market is in a panic mode," Mr. Kraushaar said.
The biggest Mexican stock advanced yesterday. The most active stock, at 16.6 million shares, was Telefonos de Mexico, whose American depository receipts gained 2 1/4, to 35 5/8. Telmex has traded at least 10 million A.D.R.'s a day for 14 of the last 15 sessions. Each of its A.D.R.'s represents 20 shares.
The Mexico debacle overshadowed good inflation news. The Labor Department's December Consumer Price Index echoed the mild December Producer Price Index of Tuesday. The C.P.I. rose two-tenths of 1 percent from the month before.
A few stocks rose sharply. Apple Computer established a 52-week high of 48 before closing at 46 3/4, up 31/16 , on continuing speculation about a buyout of the company, this time by I.B.M. Earlier speculation had centered on Oracle and other companies. I.B.M. declined to comment.
Xtra, a trucking company, jumped 4 5/8, to 50 1/2, after the company's largest shareholder, Tiger Management, said it was exploring ways to increase shareholder value, including sale of the company.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Are Up On New Price Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday for the second consecutive session after another report showing moderate inflation.
The Commerce Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December. The so-called core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy prices, rose one-tenth of 1 percent. 
 The 30-year bond initially gained as much as 16/32 , or about $5 for every $1,000 invested, after the Government said inflation rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate last year, the same as for all of 1993.
Although the report showed moderate inflation, the bond market still expects the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates after its policy-making committee meets at the end of the month.
The price of the 30-year bond ended 4/32 higher. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.83 percent, from 7.86 percent on Tuesday, and the lowest since last Wednesday.
Bill rates were also lower yesterday, narrowing the yield spread between the short and long maturities. Typically a narrowing of the spread between the two-year note and a 30-year bond suggests that investors are feeling more confident that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates to subdue inflation.
Yesterday's report on consumer prices and Tuesday's report on producer prices suggested to some in the market that the Fed would need to raise short-term interest rates by only half a percentage point.
Some investors had been afraid that the inflation numbers would come in high, said Theodore Ake, government trading manager for Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, and that as a result, the Fed would be forced to raise rates at least 75 basis points at end of month. The soft numbers in the consumer price report alleviated the pressure that the Fed would have to aggressively tighten credit, he said.
The market was also bolstered by the turmoil in the Mexican financial markets, he said. "There is money flowing out of those markets, some of which may be flowing here."
Another positive for the market was technical. Many traders are "in a short position, or more simply, selling more than they own, betting rates are going higher," Mr. Ake said. "Most of those traders are looking at information that we may not get for another two to three weeks yet."
"Market expectations that the Fed will tighten and an expected increase in the supply of securities from the Treasury's next quarterly refunding is expected to weigh heavily on market," he said. "So there are dealers who are going to be short because they are expecting downward pressure on prices."
In other trading, municipal bonds were higher for the third day this week amid a scarcity of new bonds for investors looking to reinvest some of those coupon and principal payments coming this month.
Traders report that demand is strong as the visible supply is down from last year. The amount of bonds scheduled to be sold in the next 30 days is $2.2 billion, down 66 percent from the corresponding time a year ago.
The average yield to maturity of the Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues fell 3 basis points, to 6.84 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Among the day's largest issues was a $90 million sale of debt by the Minnesota Public Facilities Authority through competitive bidding won by Merrill Lynch.
The issue was priced to yield up to 5.80 percent for a bond due in 2005. Before the sale, Standard & Poor's raised its rating on the $231 million of water pollution control revenue bonds the authority has outstanding to AAA from AA-.
Traders said the new rating would save the state money because higher ratings reduced the cost of borrowing.

Despite the turmoil in Mexico, some companies have seen gains.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
IN the rubble of the Mexican stock market, it has been almost impossible to make dollars by owning Mexican stocks. Only one large company has seen its value rise enough in pesos to offset that currency's collapse against the dollar since its first devaluation on Dec. 19.
And few stocks have gained even in pesos, no surprise considering that Mexico's leading index has tumbled 9 percent in pesos since then. In dollars, the loss has been 45 percent, even with yesterday's rally, which sent the market up 2.8 percent in pesos and, with the peso also bouncing back, up 6 percent in dollars. 
 Mexico remains a wild market, suitable only for those with a willingness to incur the risks attendant with huge volatility. But it is clear that some companies stand to lose less than others, and some might even gain, from the problems now confronting the country. And a look at companies that have done well, compared with those that have done especially badly, shows the bets investors have been making on what will happen after Mexico stabilizes.
The winner is Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, the country's largest maritime shipping company. It says 92 percent of its revenues, but only 70 percent of its expenses, are in dollars. As a result, it expects profits to improve.
The company has two classes of shares, traded in both Mexico and as American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange, and differing only in voting rights. One class is up 16 percent, to $7 from $6, in New York, while the other has risen 12 percent, to $5.75 from $5.125. In pesos, they are up 75 and 59 percent, respectively.
Even Transportacion Maritima, however, has suffered a bit since the end of 1994. It clearly benefits from the fact that it keeps its books in dollars. But while the sinking peso may stimulate Mexican exports, imports seem likely to plunge, perhaps damaging the company's business.
Another relatively good performer is Corporacion Industrial San Luis. Since the devaluation, it has risen 37 percent in pesos and fallen 16 percent in dollars. But it has gained a bit in dollars since the new year began.
The company has an unusual combination of businesses: silver mining and auto parts. Each of them, however, arguably could benefit from the peso's devaluation. Many of their costs are in pesos, while most of their revenues are from exports and denominated in other currencies. That could be a recipe for rising profits, even though the company will eventually have to raise salaries for Mexican workers.
Industrias Penoles, which claims to produce 11 percent of the world's silver, has also done relatively well. It has lost 21 percent in dollars during the debacle, but gained 29 percent in pesos.
Those two companies have more in common than silver. Neither of them trades in New York, through A.D.R.'s. That may have hurt them a bit when Mexico was soaring, because it was harder for Americans to buy them.
But it also means that panicking foreigners have had fewer shares to sell. In general, companies with A.D.R.'s seem to have suffered more than companies without them during the selloff.
Tubos de Acero de Mexico, which operates a steel plant in Veracruz, has also found some support. Its production costs, in dollars, seem likely to fall, while its revenues on exports can rise. But it also does business in Mexico, where buyers may have to cut back on projects. In pesos, its price has soared 37 percent. But its A.D.R.'s, traded on the American Stock Exchange, have fallen 24 percent during the period.
The worst performers in Mexico are the ones dependent on both the Mexican economy and appropriations from the Mexican Government, which is going to have to pull in its horns. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrolla has fallen 65 percent in dollars since the crisis began, while Empresas ICA has lost 61 percent of its value.

Dollar Gains Against Mark As Peseta and Lira Recover

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday as turmoil in European markets abated, easing demand for marks.
Recoveries by the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira helped the dollar rise from Tuesday's eight-week low against the mark. 
 The weak European currencies "got a little bit of a reprieve, so the dollar held in there a little better than expected," said Ken Nixon, currency adviser for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in New York.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5365 marks from 1.5325 marks on Tuesday and edged up to 1.2880 Swiss francs from 1.2825 francs. The British pound fell to $1.5600 from $1.5620. But the dollar slipped to 99.96 yen from 100.09 yen.
On Tuesday, the dollar slumped against the German currency as investors sold pesetas and lire for dollars and then sold dollars for marks. Traders use the dollar in the transaction because the other currencies are less actively traded against one another.
Investors had fled the peseta and lira for the safety of the mark -- the currency of Europe's strongest economy -- because of domestic political turmoil in Spain and Italy.
But the lira recovered yesterday on speculation that an interim government would emerge in Italy today, when President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is expected to announce the appointment of a new Prime Minister-designate to succeed Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who resigned last month.
The peseta rose after Moody's Investors Service said it might upgrade ratings of Spanish debt because local budget deficits appeared poised to shrink.
Though higher, the peseta and lira could resume their tumble against the mark if political problems persist.
"Political problems will continue in Italy and Spain," Mr. Nixon of Harris Bank said. "And that hurts the dollar."
In other currency trading, the Canadian dollar continued to weaken. The currency has been weighed down by concerns about the country's fiscal and monetary policies and by worries over the the Quebec separatist movement. Investors are concerned that Canadian interest rates are not high enough to compete with rising rates in the United States.
After falling to an eight-year low on Tuesday, the Canadian dollar settled at 70.83 United States cents in New York yesterday, down from 70.91 cents on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Journal;
Separated at Birth

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Was it last week's photo of those huge heads side by side at the White House, each gleaming with the identical Doublemint smile? Or was it the new Speaker's compassionate opening address to the House in which he felt poor people's pain? Or was it the television debut of Kathleen Gingrich, colorfully strong-willed Middle American Mom, who is as unapologetic about her cigarette addiction as the late, great Virginia Kelley was about her two-dollar bets?
Whatever clue you find most compelling, the evidence keeps mounting that Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich were separated at birth -- never mind the three-year age difference. And now that we've had two weeks of Newt in ascendancy, the similarities between the two men seem less superficial than predictive: the Speaker's behavior increasingly seems to follow the President's as Vermont once did Maine. 
 Some of the biographical parallels are trivial. It's not terribly telling that both men are Baptists, overeat, own '67 Mustangs, participated in student protests and once worked for candidates (McGovern, Rockefeller) more liberal than they are. Nor is it a surprise that these two ambitious boomers both smoked dope and ducked Vietnam.
But the more we learn about Mr. Gingrich, the more his twinship with the President becomes too idiosyncratic to dismiss. Both men are self-invented American archetypes, presenting a persona more at odds with their origins than Mark Twain was from Samuel Clemens. As Bill Clinton, the man from Hope, was actually born William Blythe and mostly raised in unidyllic Hot Springs, so Newt Gingrich, son of the resurgent G.O.P. South, was born Newton McPherson and, in his mother's words, raised as "a Yankee" -- originally in Harrisburg, Pa., and later at Army bases all over the map.
Dig deeper, and you find that both the President and the Speaker were favored eldest children, brought up by tough mothers who survived spouse abuse. As boys, neither knew his biological father and both had difficult relationships with their adoptive fathers. As adults, both had marital troubles of their own.
Strong and doting mothers, broken homes, tenuous roots -- how do these traits play out in men who finally realize their largest ambitions for power? If Mr. Gingrich's Speakership to date is any indication, nurture overrides even ideology. Though he's been king of the Hill only since New Year's, the Speaker is already looking Clintonesque.
His maiden speech, with its magnanimous bows to Democrats and its empathy for the victims of racial and economic injustice, could have been written by Clinton the compulsive conciliator. Since then, Mr. Gingrich has talked far too much on his and the equally narcissistic President's preferred medium of television, risking Mr. Clinton's level of overexposure. The Speaker's once-rigid backbone is also suspect; this week one of his most fervent journalistic supporters, The Washington Times, used the verb "waffles" in a headline to describe his flip-flop on a "Contract With America" plank denying welfare to legal aliens.
And let us not forget the not-really-aborted book deal, so reminiscent of Clinton-family investment windfalls back in Arkansas, or Historygate, the Gingrich replay of Travelgate. The question raised by this affair is not so much whether the Speaker's short-lived choice for House historian, Christina Jeffrey, has crackpot views about teaching the Holocaust, but why Mr. Gingrich gave jobs to so obviously ill qualified a Georgia crony and her husband (Bloodworth-Jeffrey?) in the first place -- and in secret. Is Kennesaw State College now a talent pool for the House as the Rose Law Firm was for the White House?
The Speaker and the President do differ on occasion. While Mr. Clinton plays the sax on TV, Mr. Gingrich would rather blow his own horn. The President is an Elvis idolater while the Speaker is said to impersonate Red Skelton. And though Mr. Clinton tends to moralize in psychobabble, Mr. Gingrich's verbal soporific of choice is cyberbabble.
So identical twins they're not, no matter how lookalike their negative poll numbers or how much they battle like siblings. Indeed, their reconciliatory impulses may yet lead them to converge in the political center for compromises that each is certain to sell us as "change."

HEADLINE: MOGUL HOMES

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
In 1895, when locomotives drove the American economy, a railroad scion named George Washington Vanderbilt built the ultimate bachelor pad: a 175,000-square-foot chateau with 225 rooms. It remains the largest home in the United States. A century later, microchips rule, and Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, and his wife are settling for just 34,000 square feet, most of it underground. The number of rooms? Who knows? Their architects aren't talking. Given inflation (and considering the wall-to-wall high-tech gadgetry that is being installed), the Gates house will probably be up to the mogul standard set by Biltmore -- costing around $30 million. So if you ever strike it rich, here's a primer to kingpin style. MITCHELL OWENS

HEADLINE: Bally Gaming Sale Plan Rejected by Regulators

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
A Louisiana gambling commission has rejected a bid by Bally Gaming Inc. to sell slot machines to a planned casino in the state, after finding that the company's management and directors had allowed it to be infiltrated by "elements of organized crime".
In a decision by its president this week, the Louisiana Economic Development and Gaming Corporation said Bally Gaming apparently knew that two Louisiana companies with which it had a business relationship had ties to organized crime. 
 Bally Gaming also advanced large sums of money and credit to one of the companies, Worldwide Gaming of Louisiana, without a proper business plan or controls for accountability, according to the agency, which regulates land-based gambling.
Louis Tavano, a spokesman for Bally Gaming, which is based in Las Vegas, Nev., said the company rejected the decision and planned to appeal it before the agency's full board.
"We reject any finding by anybody that our board was not diligent in conducting our affairs or that our board was infiltrated by organized crime," Mr. Tavano said.
Bally Gaming was seeking a license to sell about 500 slot machines and related computer equipment to a planned casino in New Orleans that will be operated by the Promus Companies. Robert Dowd, a spokesman for Promus in New Orleans, said the company had decided to look elsewhere for the equipment.
A temporary version of the casino, which will be the nation's largest, is expected to open in April.
"If the board said you can't do business with them, you can't do business with them," Mr. Dowd said.
The news of the gaming board's action shook the stock of Bally's corporate parent, Bally Gaming International Inc. The shares plummeted $ 1.50, to $ 8.50, in Nasdaq trading yesterday.
If the company is unable to overturn the commission's decision on appeal, Bally Gaming could find it more difficult to get state licenses to sell gaming equipment elsewhere.
Bally Gaming is no longer connected with the Bally Entertainment Corporation, a casino operator based in Chicago, which spun off its slot machine unit in 1991. Bally Gaming machines are currently used, among other places, on riverboats in Louisiana.
Last May the United States Attorney in New Orleans indicted 17 men, including various members and associates of the Marcello, Gambino and Genovese crime families, on Federal racketeering charges in connection with allegations that organized crime had infiltrated Worldwide Gaming and Route Operators of Louisiana, a subsidiary.
Worldwide Gaming had an agreement with Bally Gaming to distribute gaming equipment. Bally Gaming agreed to furnish Worldwide Gaming with about $ 20 million of credit, inventory and cash, Federal prosecutors have said.
But rather than repaying Bally, officials of Worldwide Gaming skimmed profits from their video poker operations, prosecutors contended.
Both Worldwide Gaming and Louisiana Route Operators filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1993. They are now under the control of a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, who was not available for comment yesterday.
The decision of the gambling commission stands in contrast to the conclusions of Federal prosecutors, who described Bally Gaming as a victim of the profit skimming. They also said the company had cooperated fully in the case.
A spokesman for the Louisiana Economic Development and Gaming Corporation declined to comment on its initial finding or discuss any matters connected to its inquiry. But it appears that Bally Gaming is in part paying a price for the actions of its former president, Alan Maiss.
Last month Mr. Maiss, who resigned from Bally Gaming in 1993, pleaded guilty to charges that he failed to tell Federal authorities he knew that a key official of Worldwide Gaming and its subsidiary was an associate of organized crime. Mr. Maiss, who was also a director of the subsidiary's parent, was also apparently aware that Christopher Tanfield, the Worldwide Gaming official, was not licensed in Louisiana to distribute video poker machines.
Mr. Tavano, the Bally Gaming spokesman, said that whatever Mr. Maiss might have known, he did not share that knowledge with other people at the company.
"To the best of my knowledge, everything that Bally knew was reported to the company," he said.
But information about Worldwide Gaming's possible ties to organized crime had appeared in news reports going back to 1992. That year, The Village Voice reported that Christopher Tanfield, a founder of Worldwide Gaming, was an associate of Eugene Gilpin, an amusement park operator who was convicted for his role in running a gambling operation for the Genovese crime family.
In addition, Bally Gaming's officials conducted their own internal inquiry of Worldwide Gaming and debated on at least one occasion the wisdom of getting involved with individuals associated with organized crime, The Times-Picayune in New Orleans has reported.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 28, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Jan. 12 about the denial of a gaming license to Bally Gaming Inc. by Louisiana regulators misstated the charge to which Alan Maiss, the company's former president, pleaded guilty. The charge was that he failed to tell Federal officials that Christopher Tanfield, the president of the company that distributed Bally's video poker machines in Louisiana, was not licensed to conduct gambling business in that state. Mr. Maiss did not plead guilty to failure to tell Federal officials that he knew Mr. Tanfield was a reputed associate of organized crime.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: CONGRESSIONAL ROUNDUP;
G.O.P. TAX PLAN MAY LACK SUPPORT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
It is starting to look as if a major subparagraph of the House Republicans' "Contract With America" -- one that is intended to make it almost impossible for Congress to raise taxes -- lacks enough Republican support to survive.
And it now appears that a more moderate proposal has the best chance of winning House approval, and perhaps Senate approval, too, as part of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
 On a Capitol Hill day that Republicans devoted almost wholly to showcasing their agenda and feuding with Democrats, the politics of the balanced-budget amendment debate sounded a lone off-key note.
The House took the day off. The Senate met but spent the day in languid discussion of a Republican proposal to prevent states from bearing the costs of carrying out Federal mandates, and it took only procedural votes.
By contrast, the balanced-budget amendment was the object of maneuvering, as support appeared to diminish for the clause in the Republican leaders' version of their amendment that would require that all tax increases be approved by a three-fifths "supermajority." Current law requires only a simple majority of voting lawmakers to increase taxes.
Last week, in its first session, the House voted to change its own rules to require a similar supermajority for passage of any bill that would increase taxes. But that change applied only to the House and, unlike a constitutional amendment, can easily be reversed.
When the House Judiciary Committee voted on Tuesday to approve a balanced-budget amendment, the supermajority requirement for tax increases was part of it. But in an interview, a senior Republican aide who spoke on condition that he not be named said that such a hurdle to future tax increases "ain't gonna fly" when the amendment reaches a House vote, later this month.
And Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a conservative Democrat from Texas, said today that he has secured the backing of at least 65 Democrats for an amendment with a lower barrier to tax increases.
That is significant because constitutional amendments require approval by two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, a number that Republicans cannot muster without at least 53 Democratic votes in the House. The Republican leadership's version of the amendment has little Democratic backing in either the House or the Senate.
Mr. Stenholm said today that his amendment "is the only one that's got a chance of passing" in the new Congress.
Republican leaders in the House stopped short of admitting that. But an aide to the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, said that lawmakers will get a chance to consider both versions of the amendment when the matter comes to the floor, and the most popular version will be adopted.
Mr. Armey told reporters on Tuesday that he "can live with" Mr. Stenholm's less restrictive version of the amendment, the newsletter Congress Daily reported today.
Mr. Stenholm's amendment, also sponsored by Representative Dan Schaefer, a Colorado Republican, would require an absolute majority of senators and representatives -- that is, a majority of the total membership of each house -- to approve a tax increase before it becomes law.
An identical measure was considered in both the House and the Senate in the last Congress, but failed to pass. The current version favored by the Republican leadership -- the three-fifths version -- is getting its first review. "A strong component of Democrats, and even some Republicans," oppose it, said Jane Guerrero, an aide to Mr. Schaefer.
"Some freshmen want the three-fifths," she said. "But the choice is our version, or no version, and the leadership agrees. Once the freshmen realize that's the lay of the land, we'll say it's what we can get."
 
Welfare
 Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, affirmed today that House Republicans wanted to end welfare and food stamps as entitlement programs, which pay benefits to anyone who meets certain eligibility criteria. "We will end entitlements as we have known them," he said.
The Republicans want to replace them with lump sums of money, paid to the states as block grants.
Mr. Archer and Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., chairman of the subcommittee that will begin considering welfare legislation on Friday, said that they still wanted to make immigrants ineligible for Federal aid under Medicaid, welfare, school lunch programs and other programs.
Republicans proposed such a prohibition as part of their Contract With America. The prohibition would apply to legal and illegal aliens. The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said recently that he was reconsidering the proposal. But Mr. Shaw, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, said he did not take Mr. Gingrich's "offhand comment" as an instruction to revise the legislation.
At a hearing of the Ways and Means Committee today, two Republican Governors, George E. Pataki of New York and William F. Weld of Massachusetts, praised the tax and welfare proposals in the contract. Mr. Weld said he was willing to accept less money from the Federal Government for welfare programs if he had more flexibility in running the programs.
But Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, expressed concern, saying that "kids will be the victims" if they lose their entitlement to welfare benefits. "In the next recession, children will be the ones in trouble," said Mr. Dean, who is chairman of the National Governors' Association.
 
Line Item Veto
 The Republican effort to give Presidents their first-ever veto over individual items in Federal spending bills -- a proposal the White House supports -- got decidedly mixed reviews from a dozen politicians, budget analysts, anti-waste muckrakers and other experts.
Senate and House committees are considering bills that would effectively give a President control over even the smallest Federal expenses by allowing him to simply wipe unpalatable spending items out of budget bills after the legislation has been signed into law. Both versions would also let the President delete special-interest tax breaks from tax bills.
In both cases, what would follow amounts to a political pas de deux: The Senate and the House of Representatives would have a limited time (20 days in the House version) to restore the repealed expenses by a majority vote; the President could veto that restoration, and each house would then have to override the veto, by a two-thirds vote, to keep the spending items intact.
Politicians and officials of government-watchdog groups generally liked it. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said studies show that Congress has larded military-spending bills with $50 billion in non-military spending over the last six years, and he argued that a line-item veto would help put a stop to it.
Governor Weld testified that he had wielded the line-item veto in his state more than a thousand times, mostly to cut pork-barrel spending put in legislation to win someone's vote.
Forty-three-states have some form of line-item veto; the former Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, used it 11 times during his tenure.
Amid all the fervor, however, even supporters sounded some cautionary notes.
The White House budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, testified that President Clinton supports legislation giving him the broadest veto power of spending that Congress can devise -- or, roughly, what the present bills contemplate. But Ms. Rivlin advised the lawmakers not to expect Mr. Clinton to use the veto much, or to achieve great savings with it.
"I'd think it would be a relatively small proportion of discretionary spending that would be a candidate for the line-item veto," she said, adding that Mr. Clinton would wield it as a "targeted" weapon on spending he felt was particularly egregious, not as a broad brush to wipe out vast amounts of spending he dislikes.
Others said the bills being studied cede an extraordinary amount of legislative power to the White House with no guarantee, they said, that future Presidents would use it responsibly.
The legislation gives the President power not only to strike expenses listed in the text of Federal spending bills, but also to dip into individual spending accounts and eliminate projects that are not explictly listed in the bills themselves. Moreover, a President would be able to save his spending cuts from a hostile Congress -- and avoid a vote on the House or Senate floor -- if he could round up enough votes to bottle up a veto message in committee.
Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, testified that only 11 of the 43 states with line-item vetoes give that much power to their chief executives. And studies show that most governors use the veto not to hold down spending, but to enforce their own spending priorities over those of legislators, he said.
Norman Ornstein, the veteran analyst of Congress at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization, advised lawmakers drafting legislation to look to Presidents like Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, who could use the Federal budgets as blunt instruments to bend others to their will.
"What you're dealing with, more than anything else here, is a transfer of power, not a case of spending restraint," Mr. Ornstein said. "Be careful about how much power you want to move."
Both the House and Senate panels plan votes on final versions of their bills later this month. If they pass -- as expected -- the full House will take up the issue on Feb. 6.

HEADLINE: A Pataki-Whitman Honeymoon Hits a Bump, on Port Authority

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
All last fall, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey acted as political pathfinder for George E. Pataki, plugging the elixir of tax cuts to New York voters on the campaign trail and praising the era of Republican good feelings that would reign across the Hudson once Mr. Pataki was installed in Albany as Governor.
But Mr. Pataki has been Governor less than two weeks and already the two sides are sniping at each other. The cause is Mr. Pataki's intention to nominate one of his political allies, Conservative Party leader George J. Marlin, to head the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the multibillion-dollar economic development engine -- builder and operator of airports, bridges and tunnels -- that the two states share. 
 Mrs. Whitman's aides say she was perturbed both by the choice of Mr. Marlin, who is inexperienced in management on the scale of the Port Authority, and by the fact that she expected to be consulted, but learned of the appointment in a call from a reporter. Her first formal notice from the Pataki administration was a fax of Mr. Marlin's resume on Monday.
By tradition the executive director of the Port Authority is a New Yorker picked by Albany, and the chairman is a New Jerseyan chosen in Trenton, but part of the process has always been the courtesy of consultation, aides say.
Today Mr. Pataki's people were offering no apologies. "If she has concerns, she can certainly relate those concerns," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's director of communications, when asked for a comment by reporters. "But the fact of the matter is, this is the Governor's appointment to make. The Port Authority is a massive bureaucracy that needs to be reined in and what the people there are trying to do is preserve their very existence. They're all overpaid. The productivity level is as low as it's ever been and we want some changes. And we think George Marlin is the person to make those changes."
Mrs. Whitman has organized a meeting in Newark with Mr. Pataki for Friday, their first get-together since the New Yorker became Governor. Its purpose is to remind Mr. Pataki, among other things, that, as one of her aides put it, the full name of the Port Authority includes the words "and New Jersey."
Ms. Mucha's statement left Mrs. Whitman's staff open-mouthed. "If this is how they feel, there's no need for a meeting," one of them said. Carl Golden, Mrs. Whitman's spokesman, refused to be drawn in, however.
"The Governor is not going to have anything to say about this until after the meeting tomorrow," he said.
The first clouds in the stormlet formed last weekend when Governor Pataki rather clumsily, it seemed to the Whitman camp, used the New York governor's traditional right to appoint the Port Authority's director as coin for the repayment of political debt to Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President who was an early supporter in the Governor's bid for office last year.
While the Whitman people did get advance notice of the offer to Mr. Molinari, they were told it was only tendered because Mr. Molinari had agreed beforehand to bask for a day in the glory of it all and then decline for personal reasons, according to Whitman aides.
Already unsettled by the Molinari feint, Whitman administration officials were astonished by the Marlin punch.
"Our understanding was that, before any public discussion took place of any potential appointees, there would be some consultations with us," a ranking Whitman aide said on condition of not being identified. "And then all of a sudden out comes this fellow Marlin.
"I'm not suggesting that the Governor is upset or irritated," the aide went on, "only that we expect to be consulted on this matter."
The Whitman camp has made it clear that New Jersey would not seek to block the Marlin appointment, although each governor has the statutory right to veto any action by the authority's Board of Commissioners. Instead, Mrs. Whitman's aide said, the Governor planned to propose that one or more deputies with strong fiscal and public management backgrounds be installed to assist Mr. Marlin.
"I think through inexperience the Pataki people got the idea that this was their appointment and that Whitman, if she was consulted, would go along," the Whitman staff member said. That was before today's statement from the Pataki administration, however. A Whitman adviser suggested that he felt Mr. Pataki ought to disavow the statement that the choice of director was his alone, and apologize to the Port Authority staff.
The Port Authority operates the region's three airports and the cross-Hudson tunnels and bridges, and has traditionally operated as the only agency with the financial power to build long-term, high-risk projects. It owns the World Trade Center, for example, a project that was derided as a fiscal white elephant when it was built, but which has since turned into a cash machine for the authority.
The authority's officers prize its autonomy from the two states' often fractious politics. There was speculation here -- and it may have been hinted at in Ms. Mucha's statement -- that someone within the authority's World Trade Center headquarters leaked Mr. Pataki's choice of Mr. Marlin in an effort to scuttle it.

HEADLINE: Initial Claims By Jobless Up

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing for first-time state unemployment benefits climbed by 17,000 last week, to 355,000, the Labor Department said today in a report showing that the job market may not be as strong as previously thought.
The total for the week that ended last Saturday was up from a revised 338,000 the previous week, and well above the 327,000 that Wall Street economists had forecast. The department said it was the highest total since the week that ended on July 16, when claims reached 390,000. 
 The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations and is considered a more accurate indicator of jobless trends, rose to 334,750 from a revised 326,750.
A total of 2,510,000 people were receiving state benefits in the week that ended on Dec. 31, the department said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Finish Mixed As Peso Worries Persist

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After seesawing in active trading, the stock market closed mixed but essentially unchanged yesterday, as worries persisted about the economic crisis in Mexico and new worries emerged about the home mortgage business.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.03 points, to 3,859.00, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.03 point, to 461.64. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.77 point, to 756.51. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was normal, with 312.6 million shares changing hands, about equal to this year's daily average of 313 million shares.
Turmoil in the international currency markets did not help the American stock market. The United States has committed itself to lending dollars to Mexico so the Mexican central bank can halt the fall in the peso's value. But the United States commitment prompted a flight by currency traders out of dollars yesterday and into less debt-laden currencies like the German mark and the Japanese yen.
A less valuable dollar makes stocks and bonds in the United States less valuable and therefore less attractive to foreign investors. The dollar has fallen about 1.5 percent in value against the yen and 3 percent against the mark since the Mexican crisis began last month.
The weaker dollar hurt the bond market. Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.88 percent from 7.83 percent, indicating that bond buyers were demanding a premium for long bonds. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
The effect of previous increases in long-term interest rates hurt the mortgage business. The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, which is the nation's largest source of home mortgages, reported earnings below Wall Street expectations. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, creates securities from home mortgages. Its shares fell sharply after news of the Fannie Mae earnings.
Both developments signaled profit worries for the housing business, which is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Shares of Fannie Mae dropped 4 5/8, to 70 7/8, while those of Freddie Mac fell 2 3/8, to 51 3/8.
Citicorp, which has major dealings with Mexico and Latin America, went out of its way yesterday to deflect market suspicions that the peso crisis would hurt earnings. Releasing its earnings several days early, Citicorp again denied problems in Latin America. Nonetheless, shares of Citicorp fell for the second day, closing at 39, down 1 3/8.
Other stocks fell for other reasons. Tech Data established a 52-week low of 11 3/8 before closing at 11 7/8, down 4. The computer distributor acknowledged a disappointing outlook for fourth-quarter earnings.
Meanwhile, Xerox rose 4, to 103 7/8, after the company said it would increase its stake in Rank Xerox, a European joint venture. Analysts said the move would help profits.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed unchanged at 251.72, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks 1,128 to 1,057. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.23 point, to 434.89.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 15 fell, led by Caterpillar, which fell 1 1/8, to 56 3/4. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 184 fell.

Ford Raises Many Prices

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 12

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it was raising prices on some of its hottest-selling models in the United States by as much as $444 and increasing prices in Mexico by 10 percent in response to the recent plunge of the peso.
The company said the price increase affected all vehicles Ford builds in Mexico. Prices in Mexico will also rise for vehicles imported from the United States and Canada. 
 In the United States, Ford said it raised prices on these models: the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer; the Ford Mustang; the Bronco sport utility vehicle; the Econoline and Club Wagon vans; the Ranger compact pickup, and the F-series truck, the nation's best-selling vehicle in 1994.
Ford said that some of the price increase reflected higher equipment costs, like the addition of a driver's-side air bag on the Ranger, and that some of it paralleled recent price increases announced by other car makers. Ford also raised destination and delivery charges an average of $15.

HEADLINE: Orange County in Suit Against Merrill Lynch

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Seeking to recover some of its bankruptcy losses, Orange County, Calif., sued Merrill Lynch & Company today, contending that the brokerage firm sold risky and unsuitable securities that are barred by California law.
The long-awaited lawsuit, which asks for $2 billion in damages, is the first in what is expected to be a series of claims against the brokers, bond lawyers and financial advisers who did business with Orange County. 
 In response to the suit, Merrill Lynch quietly sold $1 billion in collateral from securities in the ill-fated investment portfolio that it had been holding. Lawyers representing Orange County sought to block the move by rushing to the bankruptcy court today, but they were apparently unsuccessful. Other brokerage firms with exposure to the fund sold their securities at least a month ago, helping to prompt the bankruptcy.
In a suit filed in United States Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, the county supervisors contend that Merrill Lynch sold Orange County's former treasurer, Robert L. Citron, a variety of highly risky securities for the county's ill-fated investment pool that are not permitted under California law. The suit contends that Merrill Lynch knowingly allowed Mr. Citron to borrow securities beyond permissible debt levels.
The suit also contends that Merrill Lynch misrepresented the securities it was selling, in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of United States securities laws.
"Merrill Lynch abused the trust and confidence of the people of the county," said Gaddi H. Vasquez, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. The Wall Street firm, he said, encouraged "the investment of public funds in volatile financial instruments that were neither authorized by law nor suitable for the investment of taxpayer dollars."
A spokesman for Merrill Lynch in New York called the contentions "absurd."
James Wiggins, the Merrill Lynch spokesman, said: "The supervisors knew exactly what the leverage was. This reminds me of the classic Claude Raines line in 'Casablanca': 'You mean there's gambling going on here?' "
Orange County declared bankruptcy last month, after losing more than $2 billion in its investment fund that made aggressive bets on interest rates using borrowed securities and a risky trading strategy.
James W. Mercer, a lawyer representing the county, said the fund, which had borrowed about $13 billion, was limited by state law to borrow no more than $1.5 billion, the size of its annual revenues. In addition, he said, the borrowings used to leverage the size of the fund were used for speculation and not simply to "supplement income," which is the only use permitted by California law.
Mr. Mercer, a lawyer with Howrey & Simon in Los Angeles, said the lawsuit was based on the precedent established by San Jose in its case against Paine Webber in a similar case.
Merrill Lynch is also facing a barrage of lawsuits in the Orange County bankruptcy, but this is the first one from the county. Other lawsuits have been filed against the firm by the holders of Orange County securities and by some of the 187 municipalities in California that invested in the Orange County fund.
Merrill Lynch is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is looking into the possibility of fraud in Merrill Lynch's dealings with Orange County. The brokerage firm's chief salesman to Orange County, Michael Stamenson, is scheduled to testify next Tuesday along with Mr. Citron before a state Senate committee in Sacramento.
Merrill Lynch, in a written statement, said it would "contest the lawsuit vigorously." It said Orange County's political leaders "for years reaped high rewards," adding: "Now they want to deny the risks. In effect, they're saying, 'Heads we win, tails you lose.' "

S.E.C. Studies Problems
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (Bloomberg Business News) -- Some local governments across the country have put themselves into financial problems like that in Orange County, Calif., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt Jr., said today.
Citing confidentiality laws, Mr. Levitt declined to disclose the number of local governments with financial crises that the S.E.C. was studying. But, at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on the situation in Orange County, he made it clear that the commission was reviewing some municipalities that faced problems because of inappropriate investments.

HEADLINE: On First Washington Trip, Pataki Walks a Tightrope

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
On a frenetic first lobbying trip to Washington today, Gov. George E. Pataki found himself caught between his instinct to show loyalty to the new Republican leaders of Congress and his need to protect his state from the potential impact of their budget-cutting policies.
To balance those interests, Mr. Pataki expressed his support for the central fiscal tenets of Speaker Newt Gingrich's "Contract with America," saying he favored balancing the Federal budget, cutting taxes and replacing Washington's antipoverty programs with block grants to the states. But he conditioned his support by seeking guarantees that none of those measures would reduce the Federal government's traditional level of support for New York. 
 "We need to control government," Mr. Pataki said while testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee. "We don't need to pass the buck from one level of government to another."
After Mr. Pataki testified before the committee, he was squired through the Capitol by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, his political patron. They sped through meetings with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, and Mr. Gingrich before joining New York's congressional delegation for lunch in a Senate dining room.
When Mr. Pataki emerged from lunch for a scheduled news conference, he found that Representative Charles B. Schumer, the videotropic Democrat from Brooklyn, had already staked a claim to the bank of microphones in a Capitol corridor. "We've got to get a hook to keep Schumer out of there," a passing Mr. Dole said to Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Pataki as they waited for Mr. Schumer to finish. "I tried to tackle him but I couldn't get him."
Throughout the day, Mr. Pataki brushed off warnings that the Republican Congressional agenda would force deep cuts in Federal aid to the states, and that urban states like New York would be most vulnerable.
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who testified with Mr. Pataki before the Ways and Means Committee today, projected that should the balanced budget amendment be passed, New York would stand to lose $ 11.2 billion in annual Federal aid by 2002, the year such an amendment would take full effect. Mr. Dean, the chairman of the National Governors Association, said that New York State taxes would have to be increased by 24 percent to compensate for the loss in Federal funds.
Mr. Pataki, however, dismissed those figures as "hypothetical." And rather than dwell on the potential for danger, he went to Capitol Hill armed with a profit-sharing proposal that he said would give New York and other states new incentives to rein in Medicaid spending, thereby helping the states and the Federal government balance their respective budgets.
Although the cost of Medicaid is shared by the state, local and Federal governments, the states largely control the amount that is spent by setting reimbursement rates for health care providers and by determining which medical services will be covered. Mr. Pataki proposed that any savings generated for the Federal Government by state decisions to cut Medicaid be shared with the states.
"If we can lower the costs to Washington of some of our entitlement programs through changes we make, why doesn't Washington share that savings with us to create an incentive?" he asked.
Mr. Pataki said a program that would allow the state to keep 20 to 25 percent of the Federal savings would help encourage his Legislature, which has a Democratic Assembly and a Republican Senate, to enact his proposed cuts. When he presents his budget on Feb. 1, Mr. Pataki plans to recommend cutting about $ 1 billion of the approximately $ 6 billion in state tax revenue that is spent annually on Medicaid, a reduction that would generate about $ 2 billion in savings for the Federal government.
After his 15-minute meeting with Mr. Pataki, Mr. Gingrich said he was "very interested in pursuing the idea of a savings incentive plan for local governments." He added, "We're going to have a meeting on this right away."
Mr. Dole added: "These are ideas we ought to take a look at. They may work."
Democratic congressmen from New York City greeted Mr. Pataki with far less enthusiasm, with many saying that he should take a hard line against the Republican congressional agenda. After listening to Mr. Pataki's testimony to the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan said: "Was that testimony? I didn't want to embarrass him but I don't recall that he endorsed the contract, he didn't talk too much about what it might mean for New York State, and he didn't talk about what happens if there's a recession."
Mr. Rangel said that Mr. Pataki should be fighting for minimum standards for entitlement programs and guarantees that the Federal government would raise the amount of social services block grants to states in times of rising poverty and unemployment.
Mr. Schumer echoed Mr. Rangel's advice. "The contract is certainly not going to be good for New York State," he said. "Being a realist, I wouldn't expect a new Republican governor of New York to attack it publicly. But I would hope he would work behind the scenes to blunt it."

HEADLINE: Workfare Not Just a Program To Save Money, Adviser Says

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's senior adviser on a new program to make more able-bodied, childless welfare recipients work for their benefits and to scrutinize new applicants more aggressively said yesterday that the main focus of the initiative was not to save money.
The adviser, Richard J. Schwartz, said the program, which Mayor Giuliani initially promoted as a major budget-cutting measure, was intended to "restore integrity" to the public assistance system by screening out people who try fraudulently to qualify for benefits. In addition, he said, the workfare plan would "build a sense of reciprocity" by requiring those who are physically able to work for the city in exchange for their grants. 
 "This program is not built around how much we expect to save," said Mr. Schwartz, who has previously estimated that within a year the plan would save the city about $80 million annually from Home Relief, the public assistance program that serves primarily childless adults.
Mr. Schwartz's comments were clearly aimed at minimizing expectations that the new welfare initiative would be critical in reducing the city's looming budget gap. His remarks came on a day when he and other city officials led reporters on a tour of the offices at 330 Jay Street in downtown Brooklyn where Home Relief applications are to be examined more thoroughly and applicants interviewed more attentively.
The city spends about $381 million to cover benefits for the roughly 244,000 people currently receiving Home Relief, which is mandated by the state and paid for jointly by the city and the state.
"We believe in the final analysis, when the program is fully operational, there will be some kind of savings," Mr. Schwartz said. "It's possible they will be very modest. It's possible we will not save any money. The economy could deteriorate and many more people than we anticipated could legitimately qualify for Home Relief. These are factors out of our control. The factors within our control are building integrity and a philosophy of reciprocity, and that is regardless of the financial payoff.'
Through the new program, which began to be phased in on Jan. 3, city officials said they expect about 15 to 20 percent of new applicants and existing recipients to be found ineligible for benefits through a tougher screening process that will now include unannounced home visits, a rigorous hourlong interview and computer checks to verify Social Security numbers, credit ratings, bank accounts and tax records.
Officials also expect to cut welfare rolls when people fail to report for mandatory work assignments, possibly because they have undocumented jobs they did not report.
Mr. Schwartz said the cost to the city for the program was about $15 million a year -- $10 million for the salaries of 270 fraud investigators and about $5 million for other expenses, like supervising work assignments and remodeling the Jay Street offices.
He said that as of Jan. 3, about 90 of the 270 new fraud investigators had begun the new in-depth investigations, called Eligibility Verification Reviews. The city takes about 45 days to notify people whether their applications for Home Relief have been approved. The next 90 investigators are to begin work on Feb. 1. Mr. Schwartz said the program was to be fully operational by March 1.
So far, only 2 of the city's 40 income maintenance centers, where people first apply for Home Relief and other forms of public assistance, are sending people for the new eligibility reviews within two weeks of their applying for benefits. Those centers are the Waverly and Amsterdam Centers on the West Side of Manhattan. People applying now at the other centers are to have similar evaluations within 60 days.
At the same time that the city is imposing a new welfare initiative, the city's Human Resources Administration has proposed cutting city spending on welfare by $270 million -- or more than a quarter -- for the 1996 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. In a document submitted to the city budget office, the agency suggested eliminating many special grants intended to help poor people in emergencies and to prevent homelessness, city officials said.
Among those grants are emergency utility funds to help people avoid cutoffs of electricity, restaurant allowances for those who have no kitchen or who live doubled up with friends or family, moving expenses for welfare recipients leaving a shelter or moving to a bigger apartment, and brokers' fees for those moving into a new apartment.

HEADLINE: LEADERS OF G.O.P. IN CONGRESS BACK CLINTON ON MEXICO

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton won approval from top Congressional leaders today for what is expected to become an enormous package of loan guarantees to rescue the Mexican economy.
The agreement, described by the White House as a significant test of bipartisanship in a foreign financial crisis, is aimed at trying to keep Mexico's growing financial crisis from erupting into a clash with the Republican majority and dissident Democrats. 
 The new Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, agreed to a rescue plan put together by the Clinton Administration that will require Mexico to pay a fee, similar to an insurance premium, to the United States for taking the risk of guaranteeing Mexico's debts. The plan avoids a potentially raucous Congressional argument over foreign aid by allowing Congress to approve the guarantees without allocating funds from the Federal budget.
But the Administration refused to say how much the loan guarantees would total. Officials clearly hoped that the announcement alone would restore the confidence of private investors and commercial banks, making use of the guarantees unnecessary.
"We agreed to do what is necessary to restore financial confidence in Mexico without affecting the current budget at home," Mr. Clinton said in a joint statement with the Republican leaders and the minority leaders of the Senate and House, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
Vice President Al Gore; the new Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, also attended the White House meeting.
The announcement came today after it became clear that an $18 billion credit line for Mexico, created last week by the United States, Canada and several other nations, would prove insufficient to stem the crisis created by a 35 percent devaluation of the peso.
In Mexico City, reports today that Washington was working on the huge aid package, which was rumored to total as much as $40 billion, helped push the Mexican stock market up 4.5 percent from Wednesday's close.
Investors in Mexico were encouraged that the action might bring the economy back from the brink of collapse and took the chance to buy stocks at what might turn out to be bargain-basement prices after a 12.5 percent drop earlier this week.
 The Mexican peso also strengthened today, closing at 5.45 to the dollar. That is 4 percent above the close on Wednesday.
Despite the last two days of market gains and peso recovery, however, analysts say Mexico is far from overcoming its crisis.
"When you have the market moving as much as it has on rumors, it shows that there still is a lot of uncertainty," said Walter T. Molano, an economist at CS First Boston in New York. "I'd expect to see a high level of volatility throughout January, and then gradually diminishing into February."
The Administration acted out of a fear, White House officials said, that if the currency crisis escalates further, it could ripple throughout the rest of Latin America and perhaps into the markets of other developing countries in Asia that are highly dependent on foreign investors.
Moreover, they are concerned that a resurgence of inflation in Mexico could result in political turmoil there, perhaps leading to uprisings among workers angry that prices for necessities are beginning to soar.
They also fear the impact of the crisis on the United States. Immigration authorities have already warned that a sharp economic downturn in Mexico could cause a flood of illegal immigrants across the border in search of dollars that are now far more valuable once they are converted into pesos back home.
Mr. Clinton is also trying to save one of his Administration's greatest economic successes: The North American Free Trade Agreement.
After hailing the agreement in recent weeks as a huge boon for American workers, creating an export market for American goods and thousands of new jobs for its workers, Administration officials now concede that exports to Mexico could grind to a slow halt unless the peso recovers. Labor unions are already warning that the American market will be flooded by Mexican goods that have suddenly become 30 percent cheaper.
"If Mexico's economic growth slows or stops because of this crisis," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers said, "the impact on trade, on immigration and the whole strategy of spreading free trade in the region could be enormous."
Already, many of the Democrats and some conservative Republicans who opposed the free trade accord because they saw it as a threat to American jobs are contending that the crisis has vindicated their view.
Other political leaders said that American taxpayers should not be asked to clean up after the mess created by what they said was incompetent management by Mexico's past and current leadership.
Jack Kemp, who is considered a possible candidate for the 1996 Republican nomination for President, said neither the Clinton Administration nor the Congress should join in "Mexico's repudiation of more than 30 percent of its national debt, which is all that devaluation means."
He added, "The only people who benefit are the wealthiest people of Mexico, whose inherited wealth is held in dollar assets and whose debts have been held in pesos."
The joint announcement at the White House tonight consisted largely of another in a series of statements of support for the Mexican Government, asserting that "the United States has an important economic and strategic interest in a stable and prosperous Mexico."
After the statement was read by the White House press secretary, Michael McCurry, Mr. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, and Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, took the podium. Their entrance into the the room was carried by Cable News Network, which was broadcasting the briefing session live. But they insisted on speaking only under the condition that any quotations be attributed only to United States officials.
The officials deflected any effort to quantify the loan guarantees, and denied that they would be open-ended. But at the same time, they would not describe any limits to the loans, leaving the impression that Mexico could buy more guarantees from the United States if its troubles worsened over several months. The guarantees would presumably cover loans far larger than the $18 billion in credit lines that the United States and others have already established, even though Mexico has only used a fraction of that amount so far.
Later in the evening, a senior United States official, asked about estimates that the guarantees could cover loans totaling anywhere from $15 billion to $40 billion, said the estimates were "in the right basic ball park."
The current rescue plan is modeled on a $10 billion program that the Bush Administration set up several years ago for Israel to help it borrow money for the construction of housing for refugees fleeing the former Soviet Union.
At the heart of the Administration's plan -- and the rationale for contending that it will cost taxpayers nothing -- is the kind of calculation that insurance companies make when they guarantee a home mortgage. The fee charged will be based on an estimate of the odds, perhaps anywhere from 1 in 20 to 1 in 100, that Mexico will actually default on its loans.
If it did default, American taxpayers would be the losers, and the United States would have to pay off billions of dollars in debt. If the loans are repaid, however, the Treasury will be the winner, pocketing the fee that Mexico pays.
The package announced tonight was largely the work of Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist who now serves as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, and Mr. Greenspan, who is ordinarily not a visible participant in top policy decisions. But his open association with the policy seemed intended to lend the Federal Reserve's credibility to the plan for the benefit of Republicans and the financial markets.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: WELFARE;
War Over an Overhaul Appears to Be No Contest

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Scarcely believing how much ground they have lost in the past six months, advocates for welfare recipients are beginning to regroup for what is widely expected to be an uphill battle against an array of Republican proposals to fundamentally restructure poverty programs.
They face these immense hurdles: A public clearly fed up with the ineffectiveness of existing welfare programs; a Democratic Party on Capitol Hill still reeling from its losses in November, and an Administration eager to identify itself with "welfare reform" that has at times seemed reluctant to challenge major elements of the Republican plans. "The silence of the White House is startling," the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in an interview this week. 
 Moreover, some of these advocates and their allies say, they cannot hope to engage in a war for public opinion even remotely like the one waged in the last great struggle over social policy -- health care. "Low-income people don't send generous checks to advocacy groups to represent their interests," said Jennifer Vasiloff, executive director of the Coalition on Human Needs, an alliance of about 100 social welfare, charitable and religious groups that was originally created in 1981 to try to counter the Reagan budget cuts.
"You have a lot of organizations that operate on a shoestring trying to get information out," she said. "This is not the health care debate, where you have monied interests with a great stake in the outcome."
For all of that, the advocates and their allies have begun generating news conferences, reports and news releases, trying to change the terms of the debate, which will escalate when hearings begin on Friday in the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources. That panel is expected to begin writing and voting on actual welfare legislation next month, and the full House is committed to voting on a welfare overhaul as part of the Republicans' agenda for the first 100 days.
As the process lurches on, the advocacy groups hope to shift the attention of a frustrated public away from the mothers on public assistance and toward the children who, these groups argue, would be the ones truly punished by many of the proposals now being advanced. Among those proposals are automatic time limits for welfare, the denial of benefits for the children of unwed teen-age mothers and capping the spending growth of several major welfare programs.
"When the American people voted for change, and for less government, I don't believe they voted to hurt millions of children, or to make them hungrier or homeless, or to take them away from their families," said Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, at a news conference this week.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat who is a member of the Human Resources Subcommittee, said, "While we're doing this political thing, whether it's Clinton or Gingrich or Clay Shaw, the bottom line is we're talking about children not being cared for." Mr. Shaw, a Florida Republican, is the chairman of the subcommittee.
"I just cannot believe that as frustrated as the American people are, knowing that the system is breaking down, knowing that it creates a dependency, I just really don't believe that these are solutions they can live with," Mr. Rangel said.
Critics like Mr. Rangel clearly hope to capitalize on the public ambivalence identified in a survey made public today by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University. It found that two-thirds of Americans supported a time limit on welfare benefits, but only 16 percent would favor it if the beneficiary could not find a job.
Another major part of the liberal critique is targeted at governors. Advocates for welfare recipients hope to persuade the governors that the Republican proposal to replace many of the existing poverty programs with lump sum payments to the states, known as block grants, might sound attractive, but is in reality a fiscal time bomb. No longer would Federal aid to the states automatically expand as the caseload expands, they say, which is the case with the current "entitlement" programs.
"The first reaction of state officials is sometimes an interest in having more flexibility and the belief that with fewer Federal requirements they could do a better job," said Mark Greenberg, who is with the Center on Law and Social Policy, a public interest legal group in Washington that specializes in antipoverty policy. "However, no block grant formula is able to predict a recession -- or to predict accurately the number of people who will need help a year or two or three years in the future."
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is the chairman of the National Governors Association, said that in such a situation, "states are faced with a choice of raising taxes dramatically in a recession, which in this environment is unlikely, or cutting people off, which is basically children." Mr. Dean asserts that in his conversations in recent days, he found considerable uneasiness among Republican governors about this element of their party's plan.
A spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee said the panel's chairman, Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, wanted to explore ways of adjusting for regional differences in times of recession. More broadly, the spokesman said: "Nothing is crueler to our children today than the present welfare status quo. It's not working and it has to be changed."
In fact, a central political reality in the coming struggle is that nobody wants to defend the status quo. Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who is a longtime advocate for the poor, said: "I think we all believe there must be changes. I think we have to continue to say that we're a caring and compassionate nation, but our compassion and sense of caring doesn't mean that we do something that's inefficient, or something that's not working."
But many liberals seem downright stunned by how fast the debate over welfare has moved to the right, a development that gained even more momentum with the Republican victories in the November elections. "Two years ago, I thought my biggest fight would be against Clinton's proposals," Mr. Rangel said.
So far, many analysts say, there has been no downside for a politician to broadly embrace the idea of "welfare reform." But the same was once true of the health care overhaul, and that ultimately derailed on the details. Sharon Daly, deputy director of Catholic Charities USA, said she had been urging the organization's agencies around the country to meet with their representatives in Congress and to explain those details.
The Child Welfare League, a 75-year-old association of 800 such agencies, is adopting a similar strategy. "We're going to fight like hell," said David Liederman, executive director of the league. "Why go through this exercise to create more poor kids, more orphans, to put more and more children below the poverty line?"

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Bruised in Stampede Of Investors to Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen and the German mark yesterday, accelerating a decline that reflects investor concern about the financial crisis in Mexico and the weakness of currencies in Spain, Italy, Sweden and Canada.
A big concern is that the economies and currencies of emerging-market countries like Mexico will be under pressure this year if investors decide to take their money to countries where the risks of losses are lower. Analysts say the current weakness of currencies in developed countries like Canada and Spain was also sending investors into more stable and stronger alternatives, in this case the yen and the mark. 
 All of these countries -- and the United States -- depend heavily on foreign capital to cover their debt and their trade deficits, making a flight by investors even more damaging.
The dollar has traditionally served as the premier safe haven for investors fleeing economic or political trouble, especially during the cold war. But in the current turmoil, traders say the United States suffers from being sandwiched between Mexico and Canada, two victims of the crisis.
"It's a rolling flight into quality around the world as investors get out of assets they no longer trust," Ravi Bulchandani of Morgan Stanley's international economics department said. "At first, when it was just Mexico in trouble, the dollar benefited. Now the contagion has spread to Asia and everything weak, and the money is moving into Germany and Japan."
Against the yen the dollar dropped 1.4 percent, to 98.60 yen, down from 99.96 on Wednesday. Against the mark, the dollar fell half of 1 percent, to 1.5280 from 1.5365.
The dollar has been falling against the yen and the mark for several days as money flowed into these currencies from emerging market economies in the developing world. Since Friday, the dollar has fallen 2.7 percent against the yen and 2.3 percent against the mark.
But traders said the movement accelerated overnight in Asia, where investors, worried about prospects for the region, moved money out of local currencies and into the yen. While the yen is a traditional safe haven for footloose money in that part of the world, traders say its attraction is increased by Japan's large trade surplus.
Meanwhile, downward pressure has continued on the Canadian dollar, the Swedish krona, the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira as money flowed out of these countries and into the traditional European safe havens of Germany and Switzerland. In New York, the Canadian dollar fell to 70.51 United States cents, from 70.83 Wednesday, its lowest level in almost nine years.
Analysts said many investors were worried that all emerging market economies might face slower growth this year as investor concerns over the Mexican crisis and the likelihood of higher American interest rates reduced the inflow of foreign funds that these countries rely on to finance their trade deficits.
"Earlier assumptions that funds will continue flowing into developing economies with large payment deficits are coming into question," explained John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. He added: "Investors are pulling back. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."
But another concern, Mr. Lipsky said, is that President Clinton's offer of additional aid to Mexico, combined with the Bank of Canada's efforts to support its currency today, could lead to "large-scale intervention against the dollar."
Many experts said yesterday that the $18 billion credit package central banks and the United States assembled for Mexico last month was not enough to stabilize the peso against the downward pressure generated by maturing short-term foreign debts, as well as a flight of private capital and the selling of foreign-owned stocks.
Last night, the Clinton Administration announced a new package of loan guarantees for Mexico, but did not disclose its size.
"They need $40 to $50 billion probably," said Geoffrey Bell of Geoffrey Bell & Company, a New York investment advisory firm.

Xerox Lifts Stake in Foreign Venture

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Jan. 12

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation said today that it would increase its stake in Rank Xerox, which makes Xerox products for sale in Europe, Asia and Africa, in a $960 million deal.
Xerox will pay its European partner, the Rank Organization of Britain, 620 million in cash for an additional 20 percent share of the company, increasing its controlling stake to 71 percent. Xerox said the deal would increase its share of Rank Xerox's profits to 80 percent from 67 percent. 
 Rank Xerox, based in Marlow, England, makes Xerox products and sells them in Europe, Asia and Africa. With annual sales of $4.6 billion, it accounts for a third of Xerox's total worldwide sales.
Xerox said the transaction, expected to close at the end of March, would improve its earnings potential and expand its global presence. Xerox is the world's second-largest copier company after Canon Inc.
With the increased stake, Xerox "will have more access to European sales and the Far East," said Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst at Argus Research in New York, "and things are going quite well economically in those countries."
Shares of Xerox surged $4, to $103.875, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Xerox, based here, will assume about $500 million of debt, mostly through commercial paper, to pay for the transaction.
Some analysts speculated that Xerox would eventually acquire the rest of Rank Xerox. Bob Spremulli, an investment officer at the College Retirement Equities Fund, which owns 2.7 million Xerox shares, said if that were to happen, Xerox would own all of Rank Xerox's 50 percent stake in Fuji Xerox, the business entity through which Rank Xerox sells to Japan and Asia. "If Fuji Xerox were ever listed on the Tokyo exchange, Rank Xerox's share could be worth $25 to $30 a share," he said.
For the Rank Organization, the sale will let it trim debt and refocus on its core leisure and entertainment business. The giant British conglomerate owns interests in the Hard Rock Cafe chain and in the Universal Studios theme park in Florida. The Rank Organization said it would report a gain of 325 million, or $508 million, from the sale.
As part of the Xerox transaction, the company also said it would buy the remaining 13.8 percent of A. Kershaw & Sons, an investment company that indirectly owns 19.8 percent of Rank's interest in Rank Xerox, at a price of 11.50 a share.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
The Migration From the South In 60 Images

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
IN the late 1930's and early 40's, the young Jacob Lawrence was a man with a mission: to recount different chapters of the black American experience in visual terms. Reared in Harlem during its cultural flowering and trained in art, Mr. Lawrence had by the age of 20 evolved a slightly archaic, Cubist-inflected style that held abstraction and representation in perfect balance. By 1940, when he turned 23, he had already executed three cycles of small tempera paintings, each numbering around 30 works, which chronicled the lives of Toussaint L'Ouverture, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.
Mr. Lawrence's activities did not go unnoticed: his work was exhibited not only in group shows but also in two solo shows, and he received a Rosenwald Fund fellowship. With this support, he waded into his fourth and longest cycle early in 1940, executing "The Migration Series," whose 60 captioned images have been reunited for the first time in 20 years in a compelling exhibition that has just arrived at the Museum of Modern Art. A bittersweet saga whose mixture of words and images has a circling, fuguelike rhythm, "The Migration Series" is Mr. Lawrence's greatest achievement. 
 This narrative cycle recapitulates the heroic migration of blacks from the rural South to the urban North in the early decades of this century. By 1915, Jim Crow and poll tax laws were nearly universal in the South; the Ku Klux Klan was pursuing its dreadful business with little opposition, and lynchings were frequent. Shut out economically and politically, often fearing for their safety, blacks, the majority of them poor tenant farmers, voted with their feet.
Over the next two and a half decades, hundreds of thousands crossed the Mason-Dixon line seeking a better life in the cities of the North. Their relocation radically changed American culture, politics and economics, producing, among other things, jazz, the country's first internationally accepted art form, and the Harlem Renaissance, in which Mr. Lawrence came of age.
The migration was a story close to Mr. Lawrence's heart, one that his own parents had lived and that he had often heard as a child. He tells it exceedingly well in "The Migration Series," avoiding both propaganda and sentimentality, distilling an immense saga of political and economic cause and effect -- and aftereffect -- into images in which form, color and sometimes brilliant spatial distortions give the forces of history an uncanny emotional immediacy.
Exhibited in November 1941 at Edith Gregor Halpert's Downtown Gallery in Manhattan and partly reproduced in Fortune magazine, "The Migration Series" was something of an instant success. In short order it was acquired by two museums, the Modern and the Phillips Collection in Washington, which divided the 60 panels according to odd and even numbers. The Phillips originated the current exhibition in 1993.
Happily, the show at the Modern is bracketed by two nearby exhibitions. On Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, the Midtown Payson Gallery has mounted a 44-work survey of Mr. Lawrence's career. Dominated by images of life in Harlem, it provides a fuller picture of his temperament, showing a more relaxed, almost humorous side, as in two works from the late 1930's, and also a penchant, especially strong after 1960, for images with striking decorative patterns, like "Nigerian Series: Meat Market" of 1964.
The Whitney Museum of American Art, at its Park Avenue Philip Morris branch, is displaying "The War Series," a 14-image cycle that Mr. Lawrence painted in 1946-47 after serving in the Coast Guard in World War II. Its emphatic patterns and often Expressionistic sense of form and movement have a character altogether different from the measured ease and flow of the "Migration" images. Less consistent in visual quality and less compelling narratively than its predecessor, "The War Series" nonetheless includes several outstanding images, especially those of P.O.W.'s behind wispy strands of barbed wire, a mourning mother, a boat full of wounded soldiers and finally a depressed black G.I.
A result of these concurrent shows is a kind of Jacob Lawrence festival that no one interested in American art or American history will want to miss. Mr. Lawrence's distinctive ability to render the political in adamantly visual terms is also something that many contemporary artists should attend to.
The center of the festival is unquestionably the Modern's show of "The Migration Series," a work of epic span yet intimate proportions. (Also noteworthy is the show's excellent catalogue, which has several essays and a detailed chronology.) Mr. Lawrence is not a great painter, but in the tiny panels of "The Migration Series," he is a great visual storyteller, a kind of historian in paint.
His style is an astute blend of the overt and the subtle, combining elements of Cubist composition, folk-art directness, Egyptian abbreviation and the narrative acumen of early Italian Renaissance painting. His palette is a spate of slightly off-key, darkened primaries set against carefully textured browns that variously account for barren fields, shanty floors, railroad stations, tenement stairs and factory walls.
Accompanied by terse captions that make their meanings hard and clear, these images amount to more than an excellently condensed documentary account of their subject, a kind of story-book for adults. This is because their full impact comes only with looking, with sorting out the semi-abstract forms and absorbing the different spatial distortions and emotional moods.
As is often noted, "Migration" begins, ends and is regularly punctuated with scenes of railroad stations, crowded with people whose piled belongings often achieve a Cubist complexity. In between are emptier scenes that isolate one or two figures, usually in closed interiors from which there seems to be no escape. In some of the best of these, tables or beds, dramatically tilted, acquire the proportions of life rafts. And there are occasional landscapes, some with withered plants to illustrate that floods and boll-weevil blights also contributed to the migration. Others, like the image captioned "The migration gained in momentum," depict further bunches of people joining forces as they trudge across an open terrain that implies both freedom and miles to go.
Some scenes sum up elaborate systems of exploitation. One, in which a black tenant farmer brings his bag of cotton to the planter for weighing, is captioned, "The migration was spurred on by the treatment of the tenant farmers by the planters," and leaves no doubt as to the latter's intent. Two more depict labor agents from Northern factories signing up black workers who are innocent of the fact they are being hired as strike breakers. But often the rhythm of explanation is broken by statements of stark bluntness, like the simple image of a man and woman at a bare table, whose even simpler caption is, "They were very poor."
Mr. Lawrence's sympathies are complex, and he occasionally resorts to metaphor. An image of a prison's high stone wall punctuated by a single cell-window whose bars are clutched by two white hands is cryptically labeled "The South," as if to imply that discrimination oppressed everyone in the region. And images of race riots, overcrowded tenements and well-dressed Northern blacks (who looked down on the new arrivals) indicate that the end of the arduous journey was not entirely a promised land.
In telling his story, Mr. Lawrence does not shrink from or gloss over its hard truths. Nonetheless, "The Migration Series" is at heart a work of sustaining optimism. This is partly because the tale itself is momentous, the expression of a great collective will, and partly because Mr. Lawrence tells it with such ingenious efficiency, fueled by his sense of mission and secure in his art.
"Jacob Lawrence: The Migration Series" is at the Museum of Modern Art through April 11; "Jacob Lawrence an Overview: Paintings, 1936-1994" is at the Midtown Payson Galleries, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, through Feb. 25. "Jacob Lawrence: The War Series" is at the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42d Street, through March 24.

HEADLINE: Why We Don't Get Federal Tax Dollars Back;
Leaving Town

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I do not dispute Representative Charles E. Schumer's data about the money to be lost under the Republican "Contract With America" (editorial, Jan. 6). But New York officials are blaming the wrong culprit. 
 During Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's tenure, New York State lost a majority of the Fortune 500 companies who called New York home (down from roughly 75 to 25). Many found the cost of doing business here too high.
This has created two problems: (1) Tax revenues are lower; (2) the number of jobs is shrinking. State and local officials talk about raising taxes to make up the shortfall.
Regardless of what the top Federal tax rate has been, tax revenues have remained constant at 19 percent of gross domestic product. When tax rates are raised, people hide income or lose incentive to work extra hours. In New York these evasions also result in relocation.
As a twentysomething soon to enter a managerial position after graduation, I will be tempted to move outside this city, where I have lived all my life. As a single person here, I will pay close to half of every dollar in taxes. Though half this burden will go to the Federal Government, what incentive have I to stay?
Better services? Probably not. Lower crime? Definitely not! Better restaurants, theaters? Yes, but with the money I save in taxes, I can stay in a hotel after the theater!
New York can lower taxes and be business-friendly or seek more Federal and state money. The choice is obvious.

HEADLINE: Action at City Hall! Movie Politicians Take Over

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
In a place accustomed to cameras, the spotlight and constant notoriety, the film crews that spent several weekends over the last few months working at City Hall still produced an unmistakable giddiness in even the most blase and cynical of city officials.
The source of the excitement was the shooting of "City Hall," a movie that uses the 183-year-old downtown landmark building as its centerpiece. This week, the film crews were at Gracie Mansion. And with the crews and movie stars roaming about City Hall, the actual inhabitants of the building have been tickled to rub elbows with the fictional ones. 
 Perhaps it was the sight of Al Pacino sitting casually in the same spot where City Council members had argued about a bill a day earlier. Or seeing John Cusack studying his lines on the steps of City Hall, the frequent site of press conferences.
It might be that some public officials were forsaking governmental roles -- if for a moment -- to take smaller parts on the big screen.
In addition to Mr. Pacino, Mr. Cusack, Bridget Fonda and Danny Aiello, the "City Hall" cast includes Jerome X. O'Donovan, the Councilman from Staten Island, who plays the role of Council Speaker. Kevin R. McCabe, the chief of staff to the real Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio of Queens play members of the City Council. Even former Mayor Edward I. Koch has a part, as a television commentator.
Filming, which also took place last weekend, is to continue until next month, although work in City Hall has been completed.
Some two dozen City Hall employees have been delighted to work as extras. "I stood shoulder to shoulder with John Cusack in one scene," said Richard B. Hogan, a City Council sergeant-at-arms who plays the same role in the film. "It has kind of made me interested in doing some acting. I've already made some inquiries about joining the Screen Actors Guild."
Councilman O'Donovan, who has played bit parts in the television programs "Law and Order" and "Equalizer," has a guild card, but his two days on the set of "City Hall" represented his first speaking part. "It was an unbelievable amount of fun," he said. "We shot from 6 in the morning until late at night, longer than my regular days."
But "I don't think I'm ready to give up my day job," he said.
The screenplay for "City Hall" was written by Kenneth Lipper, a Wall Street financier who was a deputy mayor in Mr. Koch's administration. The story is about the aftermath of the deaths of a police officer, a drug dealer and a Brooklyn child, all of whom are killed in a shootout. The event becomes a scandal with reverberations that ultimately consume the municipal powers in City Hall. Mr. Pacino plays the fictional Mayor John Pappas.
Mr. Lipper, the chief technical adviser on the film, said it was important for the film makers to capture the energy of City Hall as a crossroads for government officials, the media and ordinary citizens.
"This is a relatively small facility where so many people from such diverse positions are close enough to bump into each other, interact with each other and feed upon each other," Mr. Lipper said. "We have been trying to capture the look and feel of this place. In addition to the movie being a political thriller, we're trying to communicate what the culture of this building is all about."
The movie is the first to benefit from a decision by John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, to change city policy and allow filming in City Hall for a fee. The money is to be used for renovation and maintenance.
Many who work in and around City Hall have been captivated by the degree to which the makers of the movie, Castle Rock Entertainment, have tried to replicate the real thing. Because much of the real City Hall is in use around the clock virtually every day, the filming was confined to weekends and to the eastern half of the building, the side used by the City Council.
Judith O. Rubin, who handled protocol in the Dinkins administration, was hired to offer advice on, among other things, how a mayoral dinner would be conducted. Mr. McCabe was hired to offer advice on City Council meetings, and the City Hall security officers were consulted on methods of protecting the Mayor.
The production designers duplicated a mayoral podium, adding a step-stool for Mr. Pacino. Stationery was printed with the city's crest. Historical paintings retrieved from city archives were cleaned and restored by the film makers.
The production designers also roamed antique stores throughout the city to find a desk that most closely resembled the one used by Fiorello H. La Guardia; the authentic La Guardia desk is being used by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Many in the film's cast did extensive research. Mr. Cusack, who plays an idealistic deputy mayor, spent time with city officials and attended a City Council meeting. He and Mr. Aiello spent time with Anthony J. Genovesi, a Brooklyn Assemblyman and Democratic district leader.
Mr. Pacino spent an entire day with Mr. Giuliani. "He's very nice," the Mayor said of Mr. Pacino. "He's one of my favorite actors, and a very natural, easy person to talk to.
"He was also unobtrusive in the way he went about things, the way he was hiding behind the cameras and watching. None of the press saw him, but he was there throughout an entire press conference."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the filming of the movie "City Hall" in New York City misstated the position of Kenneth Lipper. He is a co-producer of the film, not the writer of the screenplay. It was written by Bo Goldman.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Much of "City Hall" is being filmed in City Hall, with usual Hollywood license. The Al Pacino character at the microphones is a stand-in, and the Blue Room is a set inside City Hall designed to look like the Blue Room. Some roles are authentic; Edward I. Koch plays a television commentator. (Andrea Mohin/The New York Times); Al Pacino plays the fictional Mayor John Pappas in the movie "City Hall." Mr. Pacino, who is reticent about his height, uses a step-stool. (Andy Schwartz/Castle Rock Entertainment)

HEADLINE: Wide Rally Sends Dow Up by 49.46

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Wary stock traders, caught off guard by the good news on inflation in yesterday's retail-sales report, suddenly bid prices up in the broadest rally for stocks since last summer.
The unanticipated slump in December retail sales prompted optimism among traders that the Federal Reserve would either raise interest rates only slightly at its policy meeting Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, or might even wait until its next meeting in March. 
 The Fed has raised rates to slow what it regarded as an overheating inflationary economy, but the slump in retail sales may indicate the economy has cooled faster than expected.
Bond prices surged, with the yield on the 30-year bond dropping to 7.78 percent, from 7.88 percent on Thursday. [Page 49.] The price of gold, often a fever chart of market anxieties about inflation, fell sharply. But the dollar was still mixed in international currency markets, a measure of continuing international wariness of the United States rescue of the Mexican economy.
Yesterday's rally culminated a hesitant week when the Dow Jones industrial average barely budged off dead center for four sessions in a row. The Dow jumped 49.46 points, to 3,908.46, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.33 points, to 465.97. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index advanced 5.65 points, to 762.16.
The New York Stock Exchange had the largest number of advancing stocks since July 29, when advancing stocks outnumbered declining issues by 1,015. Yesterday, advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,680 to 658, or a margin of 1,022. And the number of stocks posting new 52-week highs in price yesterday totaled 52; the new-low total was 46.
"It was a very good day today, considering the last couple of days," said Paul Hennessey, senior vice president for the Boston Company Asset Management Group, which manages $18 billion of stocks.
Mr. Hennessey noted that companies like Citicorp had been able to defuse concerns about the Mexican crisis and raise its falling share price. Yesterday, Citicorp rose 1 5/8, to 40 5/8. And Telefonos de Chile, after falling for several days, gained 3 7/8, to 78.
"The rally can be traced back to the pressure coming off stocks with operations in Latin America and the retail sales coming in and surprising people," Mr. Hennessey said.
"There's still a lot of money coming out of bond funds and a lot of reinvestment dollars being used," said Dudley Eppel, managing director in charge of listed equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Also, this market was clearly oversold and there are just fewer people around on a Friday to keep things from getting out of hand, even on the upside."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 336.7 million shares changing hands, about 7 percent above this year's daily average of 316 million shares.
Stocks rallied so strongly that the Dow jumped 50 points at 3:55 P.M. and the New York Stock Exchange put into effect its so-called circuit-breaker rules designed to slow down high-speed computer-guided trading.
The big news yesterday was the Commerce Department's December report on retail sales. At $191.8 billion, monthly sales during the Christmas season fell one-tenth of 1 percent instead of rising as much as seven-tenths of 1 percent, as Wall Street economists had predicted.
Except for restaurants and bars, which saw a jump in sales, business at a variety of establishments dropped, including department stores, food stores, gas stations, clothing stores and drugstores.
Some stocks increased for reasons unique to them. Quaker Oats was up in active trading because of takeover rumors first reported by Dan Dorfman, the CNBC financial journalist. He reported that Coca-Cola had offered $60 a share, but that Quaker rejected it. Quaker shares rose 4 1/4, to 35 7/8. Coca-Cola, in an unusual statement, scoffed at Mr. Dorfman's reporting, saying, "Dan Dorfman does not have a clue."
Two computer-related stocks fell. Lotus Development, a leading software developer, dropped 1 1/4, to 43, after analysts said a rival, Microsoft, might post strong earnings at the expense of Lotus and others. Mr. Dorfman said that America Online shares could fall more than 15 percent without citing a reason why. America Online, a leading computer information service, dropped 1 7/8, to 50.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.23 points, to 253.95, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.24 points, to 436.13.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 26 advanced, led by J. P. Morgan, which rose 2 3/4, to 59 7/8. Of the 500 component stocks of the S.& P. 500, 313 rose, led by AT&T, which climbed 1 1/4, to 49.
The most active stock, at 10.9 million shares, was again the American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, which gained 3/8, to 36 5/8.

HEADLINE: Rates Tumble on Weak Retail Sales

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Interest rates fell sharply yesterday, pushed lower by surprisingly weak retail sales figures that reduced the odds, market participants said, of a big increase in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve later this month.
Monthly retail sales figures are notoriously volatile and are often subject to major revision. Even so, the one-tenth of 1 percent decline in December sales reported by the Commerce Department, accompanied by a downward revision of a full percentage point to the November sales figures, left most analysts rubbing their eyes in disbelief. 
 "I have a lot of problems with these numbers," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "There is too much conflicting evidence that says the sales pace was stronger at the end of the year than the Commerce Department said it was in this report."
Nevertheless, the figures set off major sparks in the market. Within 20 minutes from their release this morning, traders had pushed down yields on two-year Treasury notes, a key barometer of expectations on Fed policy, by 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Bond prices, moving in the opposite direction meanwhile, rallied by nearly a point, pushing yields down to their lowest level in three weeks.
By late yesterday, the price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 31/32 , to 9622/32 , for a yield of 7.78 percent, down from 7.88 percent on Thursday.
The drop in rates was even more pronounced among shorter-term maturities.
Two-year notes, offered at a price to yield 7.55 percent late Thursday, rallied strongly after the retail sales figures, and by late yesterday were offered at a price to yield 7.32 percent. Rates on short-term Treasury bills also moved sharply lower.
"For the first time since last February, when the Fed began to tighten monetary policy, market participants are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the fixed-income and foreign exchange markets.
Despite the weak numbers, Mr. McCarthy said, "I still think the Fed will raise short rates by half a percentage point" when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee holds two days of meetings beginning Jan. 31.
"But now that increase is a debatable issue," he added. "Before these numbers, it was not debatable."
As Mr. Liro of Warburg noted, the sudden weakness in retail sales came as a shock because other recent measures of consumer activity, including healthy car sales and continued strong increases in consumer installment debt, suggested otherwise.
"If they can revise November's numbers down by a full percentage point, they can certainly revise the December numbers up by a similar amount when the January numbers are released," he said. "This sort of thing happens all too often."
Even though he has doubts about their accuracy, Mr. Liro said the retail sales figures were likely to help persuade the Fed to limit any increase in short-term rates to half a percentage point.
"A month ago I would have said there was as much as a 90 percent probability of the Fed tightening in early February," said Steven Roach, co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley & Company. "Now, I think it is a really close call."
In conjunction with the lower sales figures, Mr. Roach said the Fed would be contemplating a rate increase in the context of continued good inflation news, Mexico's financial crisis and Orange County's problems.
"Those factors will make it the toughest call the Fed has had to make in quite a while," he said.
For nimble corporate borrowers, yesterday's drop in rates provided a useful window to offer new debt, and more than $1 billion in securities were priced.
The day's biggest issue was sold by the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, which offered $300 million of 30-year noncallable debentures through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 8.50 percent debentures were priced at par, or $100, 68 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Tresury's 7.5 percent bonds of 2024 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service, and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Prices of tax-exempt municipal bonds rose for the fourth day in a row, as cash continued to flow into municipal bond funds. The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer's index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell to 6.80 percent from 6.85 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Mark But Remains Weak vs. Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark but continued to be weak against the Japanese yen yesterday.
In a stormy week on the currency exchanges, the dollar had fallen sharply against the mark and the yen, as those currencies assumed the dollar's traditional role as a safe haven. Investors fled Italian and Spanish markets for the mark and left emerging markets in Asia for the yen. 
 But yesterday, the strength of the mark waned somewhat as the Italian lira, which has set record lows against the mark since the resignation last month of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, recovered somewhat on expectations that a prime minister-designate would be nominated. Later in the day, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro named Lamberto Dini, a former top executive of the Bank of Italy, as his choice to lead a new government.
The Spanish peseta also posted gains against the mark. Traders said that there was widespread speculation of Spanish intervention throughout the session but that there was no comment from the Bank of Spain.
With the mark weaker, the dollar was able to climb as high as 1.5385 marks before easing to 1.5337 marks in late New York trading from 1.5280 marks on Thursday.
The dollar continued to feel pressure from the yen as investors moved out of emerging Asian markets and into safer Japanese investments.
The continuing financial crisis in Mexico has prompted investors to scale back holdings in other emerging markets.
"There has been a lot of battering of the Philippine currency and the Hong Kong dollar," said Amy Smith, a currency analyst at the consulting firm IDEA. "The pressure is still very acute and it is helping to keep the yen firm."
In New York, the dollar slipped to 98.50 yen, from 98.60 yen on Thursday.
In other currency trading, the Canadian dollar recovered after hitting its lowest level in almost nine years on Thursday. The Canadian dollar rose to 70.90 United States cents, from 70.51 cents on Thursday.
Anne Pankowski, vice president at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said two increases in short-term interest rates by the Bank of Canada this week had helped to restore investors' confidence. But the central bank has been criticized for not raising rates enough to compete with rising rates in the United States.
The dollar rose to 1.2880 Swiss francs, from 1.2815 on Thursday. The British pound fell to $1.5680 from $1.5740.

HEADLINE: Mexico Says It Will Pay Loan Fees

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Mexican officials promised today that the huge package of loan guarantees announced by President Clinton Thursday night would not cost American taxpayers anything because Mexico would pay all the fees involved.
President Clinton's support, with the backing of Congressional leaders, helped the Mexican market to rally today by 4.6 percent, enough to recover losses from earlier in the week. The Mexican peso also strengthened again today as the American dollar fell. The peso closed at 5.25 to the dollar, well above the Thursday close of 5.495. 
 "This is not foreign aid," said a senior Mexican official who spoke about the loan guarantees on the condition that he not be identified. "This is not a transfer of money. It is not going to cost the U.S. taxpayers one cent."
Officials here would not disclose the size of the package, which is reported to run as high as $40 billion. This is in addition to an $18 billion credit line that the United States, Canada and several other countries recently created for Mexico.
If Mexico uses the guarantees, it will issue bonds underwritten by Wall Street and sold to banks and investors. Backed by the United States, Mexico would technically have to pay investors only the United States Treasury rate or a rate slightly higher.
At the moment, a one-year United States Treasury bill pays 6.44 percent interest. A one-year Mexican bond auctioned by Mexico on Tuesday, and pegged to the dollar exchange rate, offers almost 20 percent.
Mexico will also have to pay a fee to the United States for the risk that Mexico may default on the loans. The senior official would not give details on how much that fee would be. But he said Mexico would pay the fee from the proceeds of whatever money it borrowed. In essence, that is what many American homeowners do when they add a bank's origination fee, or points, to their mortgage.
The Mexican stock market ended a topsy-turvy week with a gain of 4.61 percent today. The price index closed at 2,100, up almost 98 points from the Thursday close.
This was a sharp turnabout from the beginning of the week, when the market was battered for consecutive days. Investors expressed doubt that the $18 billion credit line announced only last week was big enough to calm the Mexican market, which is reeling from the effects of a devaluation of the peso. In two days, the market plunged more than 12 percent.
Investor attitudes turned abruptly on Wednesday with news that Washington was willing to give Mexico additional financial assistance. By the end of the week, the exchange price index was 112.5 points above where it started on Monday.
The economic crisis in Mexico has shaken other markets around the world. During the week, rattled investors and fund managers who withdrew their money from Mexico also fled many other markets.
But as Mexico has regained lost ground, so have the other markets. "President Clinton's announcement immediately benefited the peso, which had a spillover effect in the rest of Latin America," said Thomas J. Trebat, head of emerging markets research at Chemical Bank in New York. "We saw strong buying in Mexico today not only by hedge funds, but also some of the big mutual funds."
While Mexico ended the week in a much stronger position than when it began, most analysts do not think the crisis has ended.
"From what we saw in the market today, the loan guarantees have been very positive, but there's a lot that has yet to be done," said Rafael Bello, a vice president at Morgan Stanley in New York. "They've got to go ahead with their privatization plans, continue to have very tight fiscal policy, and more."
But Guillermo Ortiz, the Mexican Finance Minister, said today that the American loan guarantees had not changed the Government's plans to introduce a new longer-term bond within the next two weeks to replace maturing bonds pegged to dollars. More than $25 billion worth of such bonds are outstanding, and the question of Mexico's ability to cover them was at the base of much of this week's uncertainty.
"We are going to take exactly the same steps that we mentioned we were going to take," Mr. Ortiz said in an interview. He acknowledged that the American loan guarantees might have produced enough investor confidence to make replacing the dollar-denominated bonds less urgent.
In a statement released today, Mexico's Finance Ministry indirectly addressed the members of the United States Congress who are trying to place conditions on the loan guarantee package, including a demand that Mexico use its oil resources as collateral.
The statement said Mexico was constitutionally prohibited from using the oil in that way, because it is the nation's sovereign property. But the Government has for 12 years used revenues from oil export sales, or anticipated revenues from such sales, in connection with several kinds of financial transactions.

HEADLINE: Orange County Officials May Defer Payments

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 13

 BODY:
Orange County, Calif., may defer debt payments through 1996 as it tries to recover from bankruptcy, county officials said today.
The county's Board of Supervisors is considering directing the county's financial advisers to begin negotiations with holders of its general fund obligations to defer payments for the remainder of this year and all of the 1996 fiscal year. 
 Ernie Schneider, the county administrator, released a report Thursday saying the cash-short county wants to defer the payments so it can maintain essential services and provide for immediate cash needs. The county faces a $172 million budget deficit for the fiscal year ending in June.
Holders of the county's taxable and tax-exempt notes coming due in June and July 1995 are subject to the most exposure, analysts said. Proceeds from the taxable notes were deposited in the county's failed investment pool and were scheduled to be repaid with money from the fund, which lost $2 billion this year.
Moreover, the plan could lead to a default on existing securities under current agreements and possibly hinder the county's ability to borrow money in the future, analysts said.
"It sounds like they're planning on defaulting," said Michael Johnston, director of municipal research at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. "Clearly no one is going to be happy with that."
Holders of the Orange County's debt are expected to pursue legal action if the county goes ahead with the proposal to miss the debt payments, analysts said. But efforts to collect payments could be hindered because of the county's bankruptcy.
"In municipal bankruptcies, the court is usually under significant limitations to intervene in daily operations," Mr. Johnston said. Apparently, the county "intends to use the court as protection in the best sense of the word."
Still, by deferring debt payments, the county may end up harming future efforts needed to extricate itself from bankruptcy protection by having debt holders wait for their payments.
"This is a very serious thing in the municipal bond market," Mr. Johnston said. "People in this market have long memories."
 Orange County and its failing investment pool filed for bankruptcy from its creditors last month after the pool's risky investments plunged in value when interest rates rose.
Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered their ratings on up to $1 billion of the county's short-term debt, reducing it to junk bond status. The two credit-rating agencies said the county did not have the ability to make the payments on most of the securities.
Standard & Poor's said today that the investor confusion and concern resulting from the county's bankruptcy filing could shake up the California note market, costing municipalities millions in dollars in increased borrowing costs.

HEADLINE: 2 Governors Seek to Agree On Port Job

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York emerged from a meeting here today with a public display of warmth and glad tidings. But it was by no means clear that the two Republicans had smoothed over differences regarding Mr. Pataki's choice of a political ally to be the next executive director for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 What did seem clear was that the selection of the new executive director, who is traditionally nominated by New York's governor, would involve New Jersey too. Mrs. Whitman made clear time and again in a news conference that she wanted Mr. Pataki's choice, George J. Marlin, to meet with her and with New Jersey's six representatives on the Port Authority board before she gives her approval. 
 "I don't know him," Mrs. Whitman said after the one-hour meeting in her Newark offices. "There is a process. I will meet him and sit down and talk with him. He will meet with and talk with the commissioners from New Jersey. And then we will see if the Governor makes this recommendation."
 Aides to Mrs. Whitman had said that she was upset at not being consulted about the selection of Mr. Marlin, a Conservative Party leader and investment banker, before his name was made public in newspaper articles earlier this week. Relations became more strained on Thursday when Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman said that though Mrs. Whitman was welcome to express concerns about Mr. Marlin, the decision was ultimately Mr. Pataki's to make.
 Today, Mr. Pataki sought to damp the fire by saying that the spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, was wrong in suggesting that he could make the selection without the consent of Mrs. Whitman. "She made a mistake," Mr. Pataki said of Ms. Mucha.
 But whether such public apologies would be sufficient to win approval of Mr. Marlin remained unclear. Aides to Mr. Pataki said that they had received no assurances from Mrs. Whitman during the meeting that she would ultimately agree to Mr. Marlin. The aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said that Mr. Pataki has no plans to withdraw Mr. Marlin's name from consideration. Accompanying Mr. Pataki to the meeting was Ms. Mucha; his chief of staff, Bradford Race, and his deputy secretary for authorities, Louis Tomson. Mrs. Whitman brought several aides, including her chief of staff, Judith Shaw, her chief counsel, Peter Verniero, and her director of communications, Carl Golden.
 Mr. Pataki refused to acknowledge today that Mr. Marlin actually is his first choice for the job -- although aides say that is the case -- in an apparent nod to the protocol of first winning Mrs. Whitman's consent before making the nomination public. But he did not stop Mrs. Whitman from saying that she viewed Mr. Marlin as the leading candidate.
 Pataki administration officials have also spoken to New York's Port Authority commissioners about Mr. Marlin. Vincent Tese, who was appointed to the board by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said today that he has already notified Mr. Pataki's aides that he will support Mr. Marlin if and when his name if formally given to the board for final approval.
 "I think as a basic premise, the New York delegation will want to support the nominee of the Governor," said Mr. Tese, who is the vice chairman of the board. "Right now, I don't have any real concerns. I talked to George Marlin about his views. He has an open mind. He seems to be a quality individual."
 Mr. Tese added that he thought Mrs. Whitman's aides were raising concerns about Mr. Marlin as a way of gaining advantages in negotiations over Port Authority policies and personnel decision. Aides to Mrs. Whitman have said they will ask that Mr. Marlin, if approved, appoint deputies who have strong public management backgrounds and some of whom are from New Jersey.
 "There's always a little play between the states and a little jockeying between who gets what and does what," Mr. Tese said.
 Mrs. Whitman's aides have also expressed concerns about Mr. Marlin's credentials for the job, because, though he is a municipal bond expert, he has no experience in public administration. With an annual budget of $2.6 billion, 9,000 employees and control of the region's three airports, its port and numerous bridges and tunnels, the Port Authority has direct impact on the lives of most people in the region.
 Today, Democrats on both sides of the Hudson echoed concerns about Mr. Marlin's background.
 "It's not the place for on-the-job training," said the Speaker of New York's Assembly, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
 Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Teaneck, sent a letter to Mrs. Whitman urging her to block Mr. Marlin's appointment on the grounds that he has made comments promoting "an intolerance of gays and lesbians."
 "This is hardly 'smaller and smarter government,' " Ms. Weinberg said. "Indeed, such action would constitute a padding of the public payroll by making Mr. Marlin the highest paid political hack in the country."
 The executive director is paid $170,000 a year.
 Mr. Pataki said today that he would not recommend someone "who sought to impose their social views on basically an economic authority." And he added that his choice would not be a political payback.
 "I would not recommend anyone to Governor Whitman who I didn't believe had the intelligence, the experience and the vision to run the agency in an outstanding way," he said.
 The two governors emerged from the meeting all smiles, with Mrs. Whitman laughing heartily at one of Mr. Pataki's comments as they entered the news conference.
 Asked if the good relations of last year's campaign, when Mrs. Whitman stumped with Mr. Pataki, still existed, Mr. Pataki said, "I think we're going to have a great relationship throughout our terms."
 Mrs. Whitman, though acknowledging that she was unhappy that Mr. Marlin's name had been released to newspapers before she had heard it, said she did not blame Mr. Pataki for the leaks.
 "I was unhappy with the fact that everything was being played out in the press," she said. "But again, I don't believe this was any kind of a premeditated ploy on the part of the Governor of New York to get his nominee through or sneak him through the back door."

HEADLINE: Welfare Overhaul Chorus Begins on a Cautious Note

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Members of Congress from both parties promised today to give states much more control over a wide range of welfare programs. But they said they could not surrender as much authority as governors wanted because the Federal Government was ultimately responsible for the proper use of Federal money.
As the House Ways and Means Committee opened hearings on the future of welfare, there appeared to be substantial bipartisan agreement on the issue, boding well for passage of comprehensive legislation this year. 
 Lawmakers said they expected to make vast changes in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal-state welfare program, created 60 years ago. They said they were sympathetic to the governors' pleas for more flexibility but could not give up all control over the use of money raised through the taxing and borrowing power of the Federal Government.
"If we raise the revenues, if we impose the taxes at the Federal level, why shouldn't we control the program?" asked Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana.
Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa, said the Federal Government must set some minimal standards and goals for the use of Federal money by the states. Otherwise, he said, Federal and state officials may be accused of mismanagement after the first revelations of fraud and abuse.
Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, appealed to Congress to trust state officials and kick the habit of prescribing precisely how Federal money must be used in programs like welfare and food stamps.
"Conservative micromanagement is just as bad as liberal microman agement," said Mr. Engler, who is negotiating with Congressional leaders on an ambitious proposal by Republican governors to give states control over more than 330 Federal programs worth $125 billion a year. "States must have the freedom, with no strings attached, to implement change. Washington had 60 years to tackle the welfare problem. It's time to give the states a chance."
Gov. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, a Democrat, said he feared that the new Republican majority in Congress would "replace one overly prescriptive approach with another overly prescriptive approach."
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, said he could scarcely believe the lengths to which Mr. Engler was taking his argument.
"You don't see any role for the Federal Government to set minimum standards for our sick and our aged?" Mr. Rangel asked.
Governor Engler replied, "That's right."
Mr. Engler said state officials were offended by the suggestion that the United States would return to the Dark Ages if states took control of welfare, food stamps and other anti-poverty programs.
Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is critical of the Engler proposals, said Mr. Engler was seeking "not reform but a revolution -- total devolution of authority to the states."
"It's really a call to go back to the Articles of Confederation," said Mr. Levin, underlining how last year's elections prompted Congress to re-examine the most basic principles of Federal-state relations.
At the end of today's hearing, Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Resources, predicted that the panel would approve a bill with "majority support from both parties."
Officials from the Clinton Administration, testifying before the subcommittee, agreed with Republicans on many points. They said the current welfare system fostered dependence by guaranteeing an independent income to young, unmarried mothers. They agreed that welfare recipients should generally be required to work and said Congress should impose a time limit, stopping the payment of cash benefits after two years in most cases.
Governor Engler objected to several provisions of the welfare bill offered by House Republicans. Specifically, he said, Congress should not require states to deny welfare benefits to legal immigrants or to unmarried mothers younger than 18. Likewise, he said, Congress should not prevent a state from increasing welfare payments when additional children are born to women already on welfare.
Congress should simply let states make their own decisions about such questions, Mr. Engler said. In fact, he said, Michigan's welfare payments are more generous than those of many states, and Michigan is not trying to cut off benefits for legal immigrants or young, unmarried mothers.
Several students of welfare policy urged Congress to repeal the laws that automatically provide whatever amounts of Federal money are needed to pay welfare benefits each year. "Welfare entitlements should be ended," said Robert Rector, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Michael J. Horowitz, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said Congress should appropriate money for welfare just as it allocates money for other programs each year. "There is something appalling about the idea of democracy on autopilot," he told lawmakers. "You should explore the welfare system every single year."
Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that if welfare and food stamps were stripped of their status as entitlement programs and replaced with lump sums of money known as block grants, they could not meet the increased need in time of recession.
"Governors who support block grants today will come back begging for help in the next recession," Mr. Greenstein said.
Mr. Shaw, the subcommittee chairman, said he was seeking a compromise that would give welfare programs some fiscal protection while subjecting them to greater scrutiny by Congress.
"It's not all or nothing," Mr. Shaw said. "You can come up with a hybrid. The democratic process does require us to look at these things every year."

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
The Drum Major And D. C.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Of all the speeches and essays given and written by Martin Luther King Jr., the one I find myself returning to is a sermon he gave in Atlanta in 1968, three months before his assassination.
 The sermon was called "The Drum Major Instinct." 
 King's more well-known "I Have a Dream" speech of 1963 spoke broadly to the vision of a nation free from racial intolerance. "The Drum Major Instinct" addresses the vain quest for supremacy and the need to rechannel that desire to be first in the pursuit of higher goals.
 What brings this sermon to mind, aside from the anniversary of King's birthday on Sunday, is Derrick Coleman, the New Jersey Nets star forward and someone who definitely marches to the beat of his own drummer.
 The question is whether Coleman is content merely to march to a different beat, or does he want to be the leader. The Drum Major.

Fiercely independent, Coleman leads by example but refuses to compromise his right to independence for the sake of appearances -- or peace. His five-year tenure has been marked by rancor. There was an early morning brawl with teen-agers looking for trouble outside a club. There was the accusation by a Detroit woman who claimed Coleman assaulted her, but the authorities did not bring charges.
 The latest episode was a missed shoot-around the morning of a game in Detroit last week. Coleman, who was staying at the home he owns in Detroit, said he couldn't get his 1970 Nova to start and didn't want to take his 1957 Buick on the icy roads.
 His answer, he says, is his numbers: 19.8 points, 11 rebounds per game. "When Derrick steps on the court he plays hard in practice," he said, "so don't worry about Derrick." Last night Coleman scored 29 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in New Jersey's 110-101 victory here over the 76ers.
 I respect Derrick Coleman's feistiness and refusal to allow the media to define his standards or tell him what his approach to being an athlete should be. He frequently talks about forming economic cooperatives with fellow athletes from Detroit to invest money in depressed neighborhoods. While he has a $37 million contract, Coleman lives in the same Detroit neighborhood where he was raised.
 Yet his public and professional image is that of a taciturn bully who was responsible for two coaches' departure. "I guess I'm what some people call a new-breed player," he said. "I'm outspoken. I say what I feel, and a lot of people can't handle that."
 You don't get the sense from watching him that he is consumed with a burning desire to inspire his team. Could be the stagnant New Jersey franchise has taken it out of him. Maybe it's time for a change.
 Scottie Pippen wants out of Chicago. Clyde Drexler wants out of Portland and wants to be with a contender. "You always think about it," Coleman said. "Look at Deion Sanders. He was in Atlanta for five years. When it didn't look like things were getting better, he made a change. He wanted to put himself in position to win a championship, or at least say you played for one."
 The Nets face the Knicks in New Jersey on Monday. The Knicks, buried by the news media a month ago, have surged back. The engine driving the Knicks is atonement: John Starks shoots the Knicks out of Game 7 in Houston during the National Basketball Association finals. Pat Riley lets him do it. Charles Smith wants to prove he's a top-caliber player. Patrick Ewing is hungry for a championship.

For Coleman, with a championship out of the picture at least for now, the question is: How will he be remembered? As a character tied to a bad team that he couldn't make better?
 "I want to win," Coleman said. "Every athlete at this level wants to win. People think it's about money -- it ain't money. We have money, more money than we'll ever be able to spend. It's about winning."
 Coleman and the Nets were born in the same year. Coleman in Detroit on June 21, 1967, the Nets the following October as the New Jersey Americans of the American Basketball Association.
 Now Coleman is the franchise's controversial superstar, marching to the beat of a different drummer. The challenge before him is becoming the inspirational drum major.

HEADLINE: Too Soon to Lift Iraq Sanctions

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council was right not to ease economic sanctions against Iraq this week. France and Russia pushed for relaxation and the United States and Britain resisted. While Iraq has inched closer to compliance with U.N. strictures on weapons of mass destruction and the means to make them, it has not yet crossed the goal line.
The case for maintaining sanctions is clear. U.N. resolutions require Iraq to do more than destroy its Scud missiles and chemical arms before it can resume exporting oil. It must allow U.N. monitoring of facilities capable of making nuclear, chemical and biological arms and missiles, and disclose the sources of materials used in their manufacture. A new report by the U.N. inspectors shows that Baghdad has yet to come clean. 
 The report credits Iraq with opening access to all suspect sites since June and helping to inventory and tag equipment to prevent its diversion to weapons work. Iraq has allowed monitoring gear such as cameras, sensors, air-sampling devices and flow meters to be installed at various plants, and has constructed a verification center in Baghdad linking the sensors at remote sites.
Yet important requirements remain unmet. Iraq has impeded monitoring of biological arms-making by failing to identify all sites, material and equipment used for that purpose. Information provided on how it obtained equipment and materials to manufacture weapons is inaccurate and incomplete. Identification of supplier networks is critical to plug proliferation leaks. Last September, moreover, Baghdad threatened to block the work of the inspectors, and continues to protest surveillance flights essential to monitoring, which casts doubt on its commitment to continued compliance.
Unfortunately, Madeleine Albright, America's U.N. representative, obscured the case against easing sanctions. She presented the U.S. case to the Security Council by brandishing photographs of captured Kuwaiti arms still in Iraqi hands. Iraqi failure to return the arms or compensate Kuwait defies U.N. demands, but it is not a necessary condition for some easing of sanctions. By insisting on overly expansive requirements for Iraq to obtain relief, the U.S. would reduce Iraq's incentive to comply on arms.
France, meanwhile, is eager to resume doing business with Baghdad and is rushing off to open a diplomatic office there. In its enthusiasm to ease sanctions, it too would weaken U.N. resolve to get Iraqi compliance on arms.
The U.S., by wanting full sanctions to do too much, and France, by trying to ease them too quickly, may undermine the overriding goal -- keeping Iraq disarmed and contained.

HEADLINE: Washington Debates the Price for Mexican Aid

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
As Treasury Department officials and Congressional aides scurried today to draft legislation needed for a Mexican bailout package, top Clinton Administration officials and members of Congress began discussing how hard a bargain to drive with the Mexican Government for giving it up to $40 billion in loan guarantees.
At a meeting this morning on Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, briefed 50 senators and 75 representatives on their plan for commercial banks to make large loans to Mexico and for the Federal Government to repay the loans if Mexico defaults. After the meeting, the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, predicted that Congress would approve legislation authorizing the guarantees, but said that members wanted more details. 
 Yet the legislation poses big political risks for the Administration. While the Democratic and Republican leadership in the House and Senate endorsed the plan on Thursday night, the rank-and-file members of both parties have become less enthusiastic about American assistance to foreign countries since the end of the cold war.
Liberal Democrats with close ties to organized labor and Republicans who rely on support from voters who admire Ross Perot have been nervous about providing any backing for Mexico, particularly given that Congress voted in 1993 to approve a North American Free Trade Agreement eliminating United States trade barriers with Mexico and Canada.
Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who voted against the trade agreement, said in a telephone interview tonight that she hoped the bailout legislation would provide an opportunity to review American participation in the agreement. And a group of 15 representatives who opposed the original pact said this week that they would try to force an American withdrawal from the agreement. The Administration calls the accord one of its biggest political and economic successes.
One of the most important details in the bailout legislation concerns how much money the United States charges Mexico for the loan guarantees. Senator Dole said that the fee could be as high as 10 percent. If the fee is set at that level, the Mexican Government would be required to make $4 billion in nonrefundable fee payments to the United States Government to obtain guarantees for $40 billion in borrowing.
Following the Washington rule of demanding big concessions from anyone in a weak position, some lawmakers in the meeting also wanted various deals from Mexico for their constituents. Senator Boxer said she wanted to require Mexico to crackdown on illegal border crossings into the United States and to take back jailed illegal immigrants.
"I feel very, very strongly that at the minimum, this should be done," she said.
Ideas circulating at this morning's meeting involved requiring Mexico to protect labor rights and set aside oil against a possible default. Administration officials at the meeting said they would consider the idea of using Mexican oil revenues as collateral for the loan guarantees, but urged the members to adopt a bill with fairly few restrictions. The Administration officials expressed hope today that a bill could be ready soon, probably this month.
Senior Mexican officials declined to respond to the lawmakers' ideas today, emphasizing that no legislation had yet been drafted. The Mexican Government has deeply resented past American criticisms of illegal immigration and American efforts to exert control over Mexican oil. Mexico City has been willing to pledge oil revenues as collateral for loans, although large sums of this revenue have already been pledged over the last several years toward the repayment of certain bonds.
A senior Mexican official, who insisted on anonymity, did emphasize that if international confidence in Mexico recovers and foreign investors begin buying Mexican Government bonds again, Mexico may never need any loan guarantees.
The United States used to subsidize foreign countries' borrowing through loan guarantees and low-interest-rate loans without worrying about the budget implications. But losses during the third-world debt crisis in the 1980's prompted Congress to pass an obscure law in 1991 requiring that money be set aside in direct proportion to the odds that the foreign borrower will default. The law allows Congress to collect the money from a foreign government or from general tax revenues in the United States.
The fees charged to foreign governments are similar to the premiums charged to homeowners for mortgage insurance. If there is a 1 in 20 chance of default then the fee would be 5 percent or so.
A senior Treasury official said tonight that the Administration might require Mexico to pay a supplemental fee to the Federal Government in addition to the basic premium to offset the budgetary cost of the loan guarantees.
The supplemental fee would make it so expensive for Mexico to buy loan guarantees from the Federal Government that it would stop using the guarantees as soon as commercial banks are again willing to lend money without them, said the Treasury official, who insisted on anonymity.
The practical effect of this is that the Administration has made available a huge sum of money to Mexico so as to reassure financial markets of the country's financial stability. But the Administration is making the Federal loan guarantees so expensive that Mexico may use them only briefly, if at all.
Federal Government risk premiums for foreign governments vary wildly, even for the same country. For instance, Congress does not charge Mexico for Agriculture Department loan guarantees for the purchase of American food, and because of the shortage of money in the Federal budget, uses taxpayers' money to set aside only one-third of a percentage point of the outstanding balance of these loans each year.
By contrast, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a Federal agency that provides loans and loan guarantees to foreign governments and companies to help them buy nonagricultural American goods, charges Mexico a one-time fee of 2.25 percent for loan guarantees.

HEADLINE: STRUGGLE IN RUSSIA: IN THE U.S.;
CLINTON EXHORTS RUSSIANS TO HALT WAR IN CHECHNYA

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Jan. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton called today for an end to the Russian military onslaught in the secessionist region of Chechnya but also said that it would be wrong for the United States to respond by cutting back on aid to Moscow.
Until today, Mr. Clinton had said almost nothing in public about the Russian assault, letting the State Department express official alarm and reserving his own criticism to a letter he sent last week to President Boris N. Yeltsin. But White House officials said the new determination being shown by Russian forces to impose a military solution to the crisis, together with growing criticism from Congress, had led Mr. Clinton to speak out. 
 "Every day the fighting in Chechnya continues is a day of wasted lives and wasted resources and wasted opportunity," the President declared. He said Russian and Chechen leaders should embrace a plan by the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to send peace monitors to the region, and he urged the warring parties "to stop spilling blood and start making peace."
Yet in his speech, to Eastern European officials and business executives at a trade conference here, Mr. Clinton reiterated the American view that Chechnya is properly a part of Russia. And although he scolded Moscow, he defended his Administration's decision to maintain its embrace of the Russian Government and its leaders.
"If the forces of reform are embattled, we must renew -- not retreat from -- our support for them," Mr. Clinton said. He vowed to lead "a bipartisan effort here at home and an international coalition abroad" to encourage Russia further along a path toward democracy and economic reform.
At a time when American television screens have been filled nightly with images of Russian brutality, senior officials who accompanied Mr. Clinton here said he had devoted considerable time to preparing his address, which they described as an effort to present his Administration's continued support of Moscow in a formal and considered way.
They said the Administration feared that a backlash from the unpopular war could derail Russia from its reformist path and lead Congress to force a scaling back of American support for the Russian Government and for Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Clinton did not mention Mr. Yeltsin by name in his address today. But the President's top deputies insisted the omission had not been intended as a slight, and said the United States remained foursquare behind the Russian leader, whose support has eroded substantially at home since he dispatched some 40,000 troops on the military venture.
"We continue to support Boris Yeltsin, full stop," a senior Administration official said. But the official went on to amplify Mr. Clinton's criticism by saying the brutal military tactics Russia had employed in its assault in Chechnya had been "misguided and led to too many casualties."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev are to meet next week in Geneva, where the war in Chechnya is expected to be a principal focus. But both Mr. Clinton's carefully crafted phrases about that conflict and the broader thrust of its foreign policy themes appeared aimed even more directly at the new Republican Congress, whose leaders have threatened to take aim at American assistance to Russia and other countries.
Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said last week that the American helping hand might be withdrawn quickly if Russian troops persisted in attacks upon Chechen civilians.
"If he can't control his people in terms of killing women and children and other people," Mr. Helms said of Mr. Yeltsin, "then he had better look out as far as foreign aid is concerned or any other aid, in my opinion."
In Washington today, Mr. Christopher predicted that the Administration would succeed in pushing aid for Russia through Congress despite the "indiscriminate killing" in Chechnya, but only after a tough struggle with Senator Helms, The Associated Press reported.
Now, more than ever, it is important to help Russia dismantle its nuclear arsenal, Mr. Christopher said.
In his speech today, Mr. Clinton said the war in Chechnya, "terrible though it is," had not changed the fact that the United States retained "a tremendous stake" in Russia's efforts to become a stable, democratic country.
Mr. Clinton's audience here included several hundred businessmen and officials from 14 Central and Eastern European countries who had joined hundreds more American business leaders for a White House conference on trade and investment. The White House said the long shadow still cast by Russia in the region made it important that Mr. Clinton use the core of his 38-minute address to make plain his policy toward Moscow.
But the President also went out of his way to defend the bargain his Administration has struck with North Korea, which calls for $4 billion in assistance from several nations, including help for North Korea to build two modern nuclear reactors in return for its agreement to abandon its nuclear weapons program. That accord has also generated sharp criticism from Republicans in Congress.
Mr. Clinton insisted today that the proposal "stops North Korea's nuclear program in its tracks" and declared, "No critic has come up with an alternative that isn't either unfeasible or foolhardy."

Retail sales slipped 0.1 percent in December, surprising economists and the markets. The report indicates that consumer spending may be fading faster than expected. [Page 39.]
Orange County may defer debt payments through 1996. [49.]
 
Markets
 
Stocks surged. Traders were encouraged by the retail sales report, which lowered expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon raise short-term interest rates sharply. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.33 points. [39.]
Treasury prices rallied. Lower interest rates gave corporate borrowers a good opportunity to offer new debt, and more than $1 billion in securities were priced yesterday. [49.]
The dollar recovered against the mark, helped by calm in European markets. But the dollar fell again against the yen. [50.]
Heating oil and natural gas prices continued to slide. A mild winter in the Midwest and Northeast is limiting demand. [50.]
 
International
 
Mexican officials sought to ease concerns in the United States over the costs of a rescue package. Officials said the loan guarantees announced by President Clinton would not cost American taxpayers anything because Mexico would pay all fees. [39.]
A rescue package will probably come at a price for Mexico. Clinton Administration officials and Congressional leaders are discussing what concessions should be demanded of the Mexican Government. High loan fees and restrictions on immigration in the United States are among the ideas being considered. [51.]
Iberia, Spain's national airline, faces bankruptcy. A proposed bailout comes at time when Europe is reassessing the need for propping up money-losing national airlines. But it is unclear whether the European Union has the will to force its members to make painful, market-oriented decisions or whether it will beat a costly retreat to the old use of national carriers as government employment agencies and vehicles for waving the flag.

HEADLINE: THE GREAT IVY LEAGUE NUDE POSTURE PHOTO SCANDAL

BYLINE: By RON ROSENBAUM; Ron Rosenbaum is a contributing writer for the Magazine.

 BODY:
ONE AFTERNOON IN THE LATE 1970's, deep in the labyrinthine interior of a massive Gothic tower in New Haven, an unsuspecting employee of Yale University opened a long-locked room in the Payne Whitney Gymnasium and stumbled upon something shocking and disturbing.
Shocking, because what he found was an enormous cache of nude photographs, thousands and thousands of photographs of young men in front, side and rear poses. Disturbing, because on closer inspection the photos looked like the record of a bizarre body-piercing ritual: sticking out from the spine of each and every body was a row of sharp metal pins.
The employee who found them was mystified. The athletic director at the time, Frank Ryan, a former Cleveland Browns quarterback new to Yale, was mystified. But after making some discreet inquiries, he found out what they were -- and took swift action to burn them. He called in a professional, a document-disposal expert, who initiated a two-step torching procedure. First, every single one of the many thousands of photographs was fed into a shredder, and then each of the shreds was fed to the flames, thereby insuring that not a single intact or recognizable image of the nude Yale students -- some of whom had gone on to assume positions of importance in government and society -- would survive. 
 It was the Bonfire of the Best and the Brightest, and the assumption was that the last embarrassing reminders of a peculiar practice, which masqueraded as science and now looked like a kind of kinky voodoo ritual, had gone up in smoke. The assumption was wrong. Thousands upon thousands of photos from Yale and other elite schools survive to this day.
When I first embarked on my quest for the lost nude "posture photos," I could not decide whether to think of the phenomenon as a scandal or as an extreme example of academic folly -- of what happens when well-intentioned institutions allow their reverence for the reigning conjectures of scientific orthodoxy to persuade them to do things that seem silly or scandalous in retrospect. And now that I've found them, I'm still not sure whether outrage or laughter is the more appropriate reaction. Your response, dear reader, may depend on whether your nude photograph is among them. And if you attended Yale, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith or Princeton -- to name a few of the schools involved -- from the 1940's through the 1960's, there's a chance that yours may be.
Your response may also depend on how you feel about the fact that some of these schools made nude or seminude photographs of you available to the disciples of what many now regard as a pseudo-science without asking permission. And on how you feel about an obscure archive in Washington making them available for researchers to study.
While investigating the strange odyssey of the missing nude "posture photos," I found that the issue is, in every respect, a very touchy matter -- indeed, a kind of touchstone for registering the uneven evolution of attitudes toward body, race and gender in the past half-century.
 
UP YOUR LEGS FOR YALE
I personally have posed nude only twice in my life. The second time -- for a John and Yoko film titled "Up Your Legs Forever," which has been screened at the Whitney -- I was one of many, it was Art, and let's leave it at that. But the first time was even more strange and bizarre because of its strait-laced Ivy setting, its preliberation context -- and yes, because of the metal pins stuck on my body.
One fall afternoon in the mid-60's, shortly after I arrived in New Haven to begin my freshman year at Yale, I was summoned to that sooty Gothic shrine to muscular virtue known as Payne Whitney Gym. I reported to a windowless room on an upper floor, where men dressed in crisp white garments instructed me to remove all of my clothes. And then -- and this is the part I still have trouble believing -- they attached metal pins to my spine. There was no actual piercing of skin, only of dignity, as four-inch metal pins were affixed with adhesive to my vertebrae at regular intervals from my neck down. I was positioned against a wall; a floodlight illuminated my pin-spiked profile and a camera captured it.
It didn't occur to me to object: I'd been told that this "posture photo" was a routine feature of freshman orientation week. Those whose pins described a too violent or erratic postural curve were required to attend remedial posture classes.
The procedure did seem strange. But I soon learned that it was a long-established custom at most Ivy League and Seven Sisters schools. George Bush, George Pataki, Brandon Tartikoff and Bob Woodward were required to do it at Yale. At Vassar, Meryl Streep; at Mount Holyoke, Wendy Wasserstein; at Wellesley, Hillary Rodham and Diane Sawyer. All of them -- whole generations of the cultural elite -- were asked to pose. But however much the colleges tried to make this bizarre procedure seem routine, its undeniable strangeness engendered a scurrilous strain of folklore.
 
THE MISMEASURE OF MAN
There were several salacious stories circulating at Yale back in the 60's. Most common was the report that someone had broken into a photo lab in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and stolen the negatives of that year's Vassar posture nudes, which were supposedly for sale on the Ivy League black market or available to the initiates of Skull and Bones. Little did I know how universal this myth was.
"Ah, yes, the famous rumored stolen Vassar posture pictures," Nora Ephron (Wellesley '62) recalled when I spoke with her. "But don't forget the famous rumored stolen Wellesley posture photos."
"Wellesley too?"
"Oh, yes," she said. "It's one of those urban legends."
She can laugh about it now, she said, but in retrospect the whole idea that she and all her smart classmates went along with being photographed in this way dismays her. "We were idiots," she said. "Idiots!"
Sally Quinn (Smith '63), the Washington writer, expressed alarm when I first reached her. "God, I'm relieved," she said. "I thought you were going to tell me you found mine. You always thought when you did it that one day they'd come back to haunt you. That 25 years later, when your husband was running for President, they'd show up in Penthouse."
Another Wellesley alumna, Judith Martin, author of the Miss Manners column, told me she's "appalled in retrospect" that the college forced this practice on their freshmen. "Why weren't we more appalled at the time?" she wondered. Nonetheless, she confessed to making a kind of good-natured extortionate use of the posture-photo specter herself.
"I do remember making a reunion speech in which I offered to sell them back to people for large donations. And there were a lot of people who turned pale before they realized it was a joke."
Distinguishing between joke and reality is often difficult in posture-photo lore. Consider the astonishing rumor Ephron clued me in to, a story she assured me she'd heard from someone very close to the source:
"There was a guy, an adjunct professor of sociology who was working on a grant for the tobacco industry. And what I heard when I was at Wellesley was that, using Harvard posture photos, he had proved conclusively that the more manly you are, the more you smoked. And I believe the criterion for manliness was the obvious one."
"The obvious one?"
"I assume -- what else could it have been?"
In fact, the study was real. I was able to track it down, although the conclusion it reached about Harvard men was somewhat different from what Ephron recalled. But, clearly, the nude-posture-photo practice engendered heated fantasies in both sexes. Perhaps in the otherwise circumspect Ivy League-Seven Sisters world, nude posture photos were the licensed exception to propriety that spawned licentious fantasies. Fantasies that were to lie unremembered, or at least unpublicized until. . . .
 
THE RETURN OF THE REPRESSED
It was Naomi Wolf, author of "The Beauty Myth," who opened the Pandora's box of posture-photo controversy. In that book and in a 1992 Op-Ed piece in The Times, Wolf (Yale '84) bitterly attacked Dick Cavett (Yale '55) for a joke he'd made at Wolf's graduation ceremonies. According to Wolf, who'd never had a posture photo taken (the practice was discontinued at Yale in 1968), Cavett took the microphone and told the following anecdote:
"When I was an undergraduate . . . there were no women [at Yale]. The women went to Vassar. At Vassar they had nude photographs taken of women in gym class to check their posture. One year the photos were stolen and turned up for sale in New Haven's red-light district." His punchline: "The photos found no buyers."
Wolf was horrified. Cavett, she wrote in her book, "transposed us for a moment out of the gentle quadrangle where we had been led to believe we were cherished, and into the tawdry district four blocks away, where stolen photographs of our naked bodies would find no buyers."
Cavett responded, in a letter to The Times, by dismissing the joke as an innocuous "example of how my Yale years showed up in my long-forgotten nightclub act."
Wolf's horrified account attests to the totemic power of the posture-photo legend. But little did she know, little did Cavett know, how potentially sinister the entire phenomenon really was. No one knew until. . . .
 
THE NAZI-POSTURE-PHOTO ALLEGATION
This is where things get really strange. Shortly after Cavett's reply, George Hersey, a respected art history professor at Yale, wrote a letter to The Times that ran under the headline "A Secret Lies Hidden in Vassar and Yale Nude 'Posture Photos.' " Sounding an ominous note, Hersey declared that the photos "had nothing to do with posture . . . that is only what we were told."
Hersey went on to say that the pictures were actually made for anthropological research: "The reigning school of the time, presided over by E. A. Hooton of Harvard and W. H. Sheldon" -- who directed an institute for physique studies at Columbia University -- "held that a person's body, measured and analyzed, could tell much about intelligence, temperament, moral worth and probable future achievement. The inspiration came from the founder of social Darwinism, Francis Galton, who proposed such a photo archive for the British population."
And then Hersey evoked the specter of the Third Reich:
"The Nazis compiled similar archives analyzing the photos for racial as well as characterological content (as did Hooton). . . . The Nazis often used American high school yearbook photographs for this purpose. . . . The American investigators planned an archive that could correlate each freshman's bodily configuration ('somatotype') and physiognomy with later life history. That the photos had no value as pornography is a tribute to their resolutely scientific nature."
A truly breathtaking missive. What Hersey seemed to be saying was that entire generations of America's ruling class had been unwitting guinea pigs in a vast eugenic experiment run by scientists with a master-race hidden agenda. My classmate Steve Weisman, the Times editor who first called my attention to the letter, pointed out a fascinating corollary: The letter managed in a stroke to confer on some of the most overprivileged people in the world the one status distinction it seemed they'd forever be denied -- victim.
My first stop in what would turn out to be a prolonged and eventful quest for the truth about the posture photos was Professor Hersey's office in New Haven. A thoughtful, civilized scholar, Hersey did not seem prone to sensationalism. But he showed me a draft chapter from his forthcoming book on the esthetics of racism that went even further than the allegations in his letter to The Times. I was struck by one passage in particular:
"From the outset, the purpose of these 'posture photographs' was eugenic. The data accumulated, says Hooton, will eventually lead on to proposals to 'control and limit the production of inferior and useless organisms.' Some of the latter would be penalized for reproducing . . . or would be sterilized. But the real solution is to be enforced better breeding -- getting those Exeter and Harvard men together with their corresponding Wellesley, Vassar and Radcliffe girls."
In other words, a kind of eugenic dating service, "Studs" for the cultural elite. But my talk with Hersey left key questions unanswered. What was the precise relationship between theorists like Hooton and Sheldon (the man who actually took tens of thousands of those nude posture photos) and the Ivy League and Seven Sisters schools whose student bodies were photographed? Were the schools complicit or were they simply dupes? And finally: What became of the photographs?
As for the last question, Hersey thought there'd be no trouble locating the photographs. He assumed that "they can probably be found with Sheldon's research papers" in one of the several academic institutions with which he had been associated. But most of those institutions said that they had burned whatever photos they'd had. Harley P. Holden, curator of Harvard's archives, said that from the 1880's to the 1940's the university had its own posture-photo program in which some 3,500 pictures of its students were taken. Most were destroyed 15 or 20 years ago "for privacy scruples," Holden said. Nonetheless, quite a few Harvard nudes can be found illustrating Sheldon's book on body types, the "Atlas of Men." Radcliffe took posture photos from 1931 to 1961; the curator there said that most of them had been destroyed (although some might be missing) and that none were taken by Sheldon.
Hersey insisted that there was a treasure trove of Sheldon photographs out there to be found. He gave me the phone number of a man in New Mexico named Ellery Lanier, a friend of Sheldon, the posture-photo mastermind. "He might know where they ended up," Hersey told me.
Going from Hersey to Lanier meant stepping over the threshold from contemporary academic orthodoxy into the more exotic precincts of Sheldon subculture, a loose-knit network of his surviving disciples. A number of them keep the Sheldon legacy alive, hoping for a revival.
Lanier, an articulate, seventyish doctoral student at New Mexico State, told me he'd gotten to know Sheldon at Columbia in the late 1940's, when the two of them were hanging out with Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood and their crew. (Sheldon had a prophetic mystical side, which revealed itself in Huxleian philosophic treatises on the "Promethean will." Sheldon was also, Lanier told me, "the world's leading expert on the history of the American penny.") At that time, Sheldon was at the apex of his now-forgotten renown. Life magazine ran a cover story in 1951 on Sheldon's theory of somatotypes.
While the popular conception of Sheldonism has it that he divided human beings into three types -- skinny, nervous "ectomorphs"; fat and jolly "endomorphs"; confident, buffed "mesomorphs" -- what he actually did was somewhat more complex. He believed that every individual harbored within him different degrees of each of the three character components. By using body measurements and ratios derived from nude photographs, Sheldon believed he could assign every individual a three-digit number representing the three components, components that Sheldon believed were inborn -- genetic -- and remained unwavering determinants of character regardless of transitory weight change. In other words, physique equals destiny.
It was the pop-psych flavor of the month for a while; Cosmopolitan magazine published quizzes about how to understand your husband on the basis of somatotype. Ecto-, meso- and endomorphic have entered the language, although few scientists these days give credence to Sheldon's claims. "Half the textbooks in [his] area fail to take [him] seriously," remarked one academician in a 1992 paper on Sheldon's legacy. Others, like Hans Eysenck, the British psychologist, have suggested that Sheldon wasn't really doing science at all, that he was just winging it, that there was "little theoretical foundation for the observed findings."
Nonetheless, in the late 40's and early 50's, Sheldonism seemed mainstream, and Sheldon took advantage of that to approach Ivy League schools. Many, like Harvard, already had a posture-photo tradition. But it was at Wellesley College in the late 1920's that concern about postural correctness metamorphosed into a cottage industry with pretensions to science. The department of hygiene circulated training films about posture measurement to other women's colleges, which took up the practice, as did some "progressive" high schools and elementary schools. (By the time Hillary Rodham arrived on the Wellesley campus, women were allowed to have their pictures taken only partly nude. Although Lanier assumes that Sheldon took the Rodham photo, Wellesley archivists believe that Sheldon didn't take posture photos at their school.)
What Sheldon did was appropriate the ritual. Lanier confirmed that the Ivy League "posture photos" Sheldon used were "part of a facade or cover-up for what we were really doing" -- which would make the schools less complicit. But Lanier stoutly defended "what we were really doing" as valid science. As part of his Ph.D. project, he has been examining Sheldonian ecto-, meso- and endomorphic categories and the "time horizon" of the individual.
"Conflicting temporal horizon can account for all the divorce we have today," Lanier said. "The Woody Allen-Mia Farrow-type thing."
Huh? Woody and Mia?
"I'm trying to find some clue to the breakup because of the discrepancies between their time focus," Lanier said.
"Well, Woody's certainly ectomorphic, but. . . . "
"No, let me correct you," Lanier said tartly. "Woody Allen creates an illusion. He puts on a big show of being ectomorphic, but this is all a cover-up because he's quite mesomorphic."
"I think he would be surprised to hear that."
"I know," Lanier said. "He wouldn't want to admit it, but the only way you can know this is by looking at photographs very carefully."
Lanier also filled me in on the cause of Sheldon's downfall: his never completed, partly burned "Atlas of Women." In attempting to compile what would have been the companion volume to his "Atlas of Men," which included hundreds of nude Harvard men to illustrate each of the three-digit body types, Sheldon made the strategic mistake of taking his photo show on the road.
What happened was this: In September 1950, Sheldon and his team descended on Seattle, where the University of Washington had agreed to play host to his project. He'd begun taking nude pictures of female freshmen, but something went wrong. One of them told her parents about the practice. The next morning, a battalion of lawyers and university officials stormed Sheldon's lab, seized every photo of a nude woman, convicted the images of shamefulness and sentenced them to burning. The angry crew then shoveled the incendiary film into an incinerator. A short-lived controversy broke out: Was this a book burning? A witch hunt? Was Professor Sheldon's nude photography a legitimate scientific investigation into the relationship between physique and temperament, the raw material of serious scholarship? Or just raw material -- pornography masquerading as science?
They burned a few thousand photos in Seattle. Thousands more were burned at Harvard, Vassar and Yale in the 60's and 70's, when the colleges phased out the posture-photo practice. But thousands more escaped the flames, tens of thousands that Sheldon took at Harvard, Vassar, Yale and elsewhere but sequestered in his own archives. And what became of the archives? Lanier didn't know, but he said they were out there somewhere. He dug up the phone number of a man who was once the lawyer for Sheldon's estate, a Mr. Joachim Weissfeld in Providence, R.I. "Maybe he'll know," Lanier said.
At this point, the posture-photo quest turned into a kind of high-speed parody of "The Aspern Papers." The lawyer in Rhode Island professed ignorance as to the whereabouts or even continued existence of the lost Sheldonian archives, but he did put me in touch with the last living leaf on the Sheldon family tree, a niece by marriage who lived in Warwick, R.I. She, too, said she didn't know what had become of the Sheldon photos, but she did give me the name of an 84-year-old man living in Columbus, Ohio, who had worked very closely with Sheldon, one Roland D. Elderkin -- a man who, in fact, had shot many of the lost photos himself and who promised to reveal their location to me.

THE MYSTERY SOLVED
With Roland D. Elderkin, we're now this close to the late, great Sheldon himself. "There was nobody closer," Elderkin declared shortly after I reached him at his rooming house in Columbus. "I was his soul mate."
Elderkin described himself a bit mournfully as "just an 84-year-old man living alone in a furnished room." But he once had a brush with greatness, and you can hear it in his recollection of Sheldon and his grand project.
To Elderkin, Sheldon was no mere body-typer: he was a true philosophe, "the first to introduce holistic perspective" to American science, a proto-New Ager. Elderkin became Sheldon's research associate, his trusty cameraman and a kind of private eye, compiling case histories of Sheldon's posture nudes to confirm Sheldon's theories about physique and destiny. He also witnessed Sheldon's downfall.
The Bonfire of the Nude Coed Photos in Seattle wasn't Sheldon's only public burning, Elderkin told me: "He went through a number of furors over women. A similar thing later happened at Pembroke, the women's college at Brown." In each case, the fact that female nudes were involved kindled the flame against Sheldon. Toward the end, Sheldon became a kind of pathetic Willy Loman-esque figure as he wandered America far from the elite Ivy halls that had once housed him, seeking a place he could complete the photography for his "Atlas of Women."
Rejected and scorned, out of fashion with academic officialdom, Sheldon is still a hero to Roland D. Elderkin. And so when Sheldon died in 1977, "a lonely old man who did nothing his last years but sit in his room and read detective stories," Elderkin said, "there was nobody else to carry on." It fell to Elderkin to find a final resting place for the huge archives of Sheldon's posture nudes.
It wasn't easy, he said. Elderkin went "up and down the East Coast trying to peddle them" to places like Harvard and Columbia, which once welcomed Sheldon but now wanted nothing to do with nude photos and the controversy trailing them. "That's how I found out about the burning at Pembroke," Elderkin recalled. "I was trying to get someone at Brown to accept them, and he said, 'That filth? We already burned the ones we had.' "
"And you know where they are now?" I asked incredulously. "Hersey and Lanier said they didn't know."
"Sure I do," he said. "I was the one that finally found a home for them."
And then he told me where.
BEFORE WE PROCEED TO the location of the treasure itself, it might be wise to pause and ponder the wisdom of opening such a Pandora's box. With scholars like Hersey alleging eugenic motives behind Sheldon's project, with the self-images of so many of the cultural elite at stake, would exposure of the hidden hoard be defensible? Is there anyone, aside from lifelong Sheldon disciples, who will step forward to defend Sheldon's posture photos?
Of course there is: Camille Paglia.
"I'm very interested in somatotypes," she said. "I constantly use the term in my work. The word 'ectomorph' is used repeatedly in 'Sexual Personae' about Spenser's Apollonian angels. That's one of the things I'm trying to do: to reconsider these classification schemes, to rescue them from their tainting by Nazi ideology. It's always been a part of classicism. It's sort of like we've lost the old curiosity about physical characteristics, physical differences. And I maintain it's bourgeois prudery.
"See, I'm interested in looking at women's breasts! I'm interested in looking at men's penises! I maintain that at the present date, Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, serve the same cultural functions as the posture photos."
With these words ringing in my ears, I set out to see if I could open up the Sheldon archives.
 
THE SECRET IS BARED
Down a dimly lit back corridor of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, far from the dinosaur displays, is a branch of the Smithsonian not well known to the public: the National Anthropological Archives.
Although it contains a rich and strange assortment of archival treasures, it's particularly notable for the number of Native Americans who travel here to investigate centuries-old anthropological records, poring over them in a cramped, windowless research room whose walls are hung with stylized illustrations of tribal rituals painted by one Chief Blue Eagle. It was here that my quest for another kind of tribal illustration -- the taboo images of the blue-blood tribe, the long-lost nude posture photos -- culminated at last.
In 1987, the curators of the National Anthropological Archives acquired the remains of Sheldon's life work, which were gathering dust in "dead storage" in a Goodwill warehouse in Boston. While there were solid archival reasons for making the acquisition, the curators are clearly aware that they harbor some potentially explosive material in their storage rooms. And they did not make it easy for me to gain access.
On my first visit, I was informed by a good-natured but wary supervisor that the restrictive grant of Sheldon's materials by his estate would permit me to review only the written materials in the Sheldon archives. The actual photographs, he said, were off-limits. To see them, I would have to petition the chief of archivists. Determined to pursue the matter to the bitter end, I began the process of applying for permission.
Meanwhile, I plunged into the written material hoping to find answers to several unresolved mysteries. Although I did not find substantiation in those files for Hersey's belief that Sheldon was actively engaged in a master-race eugenic project, I did find stunning confirmation of Hersey's charge that Sheldon held racist views.
In Box 43 I came across a document never referred to in any of the literature on Sheldon I'd seen. It was a faded offprint of a 1924 Sheldon study, "The Intelligence of Mexican Children." In it are damning assertions presented as scientific truisms that "Negro intelligence" comes to a "standstill at about the 10th year," Mexican at about age 12. To the author of such sentiments, America's elite institutions entrusted their student bodies.
Another box held clues to the truth behind Nora Ephron's tale about smoking and organ size. It turned out to be true that a research arm of the tobacco industry had sponsored studies on the relationship between masculinity and smoking, and that the studies had involved Sheldonian posture photos of Harvard men -- although there is no evidence that the criterion of masculinity was the "obvious one" referred to by Ephron. I located a fascinating report on this research in a December 1959 issue of the respected journal Science, a report titled "Masculinity and Smoking." According to the article, and contrary to the rumor, it is "not strength but weakness of the masculine component" that is "more frequent in the heavier smokers." Here, perhaps, is the most profound cultural legacy of the Sheldonian posture-photo phenomenon: the blueprint for the sexual iconography of tobacco advertising. If, in fact, heavy smokers looked more like Harvard nerds than Marlboro men, why not use advertising imagery to make Harvard nerds feel like virile cowboys when they smoked?
Finally and most telling, I found a letter nearly four decades old that did something nothing else in the files did. It gave a glimpse, a clue to the feelings of the subjects of Sheldon's research, particularly the women. I found the letter in a file of correspondence between Sheldon and various phys ed directors at women's colleges who were providing Sheldon with bodies for the ill-fated "Atlas of Women." In this letter, an official at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, was responding to Sheldon's request to rephotograph the female freshmen he had photographed the year before. Something had apparently gone wrong with the technical side of the earlier shoot. But the official refused to allow Sheldon to reshoot the women, declaring that "to require them to pose for another [nude posture photo] would create insurmountable psychological problems."
Insurmountable psychological problems. Suddenly the subjects of Sheldon's photography leaped into the foreground: the shy girl, the fat girl, the religiously conservative, the victim of inappropriate parental attention. Here, perhaps, Naomi Wolf has a point. In a culture that already encourages women to scrutinize their bodies critically, the first thing that happens to these women when they arrive at college is an intrusive, uncomfortable, public examination of their nude bodies.
THREE MONTHS LATER, I FINALLY SUCCEEDED IN gaining permission to study the elusive posture photos. As I sat at my desk in the reading room, under a portrait of Chief Blue Eagle, the long-sought cache materialized. A curator trundled in a library cart from the storage facility. Teetering on top of the cart were stacks of big, gray cardboard boxes. The curator handed me a pair of the white cotton gloves that researchers must use to handle archival material.
The contents of the boxes were described in an accompanying "Finder's Aid" in this fashion:
 
BOX 90 YALE UNIVERSITY CLASS OF 1971
Negatives. Full length views of nude freshmen men, front, back and rear. Includes weight, height, previous or maximum weight, with age, name, or initials.
 
BOX 95 MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE PHOTOGRAPHS
Negatives. Made in 1950. Full length views of nude women, front, back and rear. Includes height, weight, date and age. Includes some photographs marked S.P.C.
Among the other classes listed in the Finder's Aid were: the Yale classes of '50, '63, '64, '66 and '71; the Princeton class of '52; Smith '50 and '52; Vassar '42 and '52; Mount Holyoke '53; Swarthmore '51; University of California '61 and '67; Hotchkiss '71; Syracuse '50; University of Wisconsin '53; Purdue '53; University of Pennsylvania '51, and Brooklyn College '51 and '52. There were also undated photos from the Oregon Hospital for the Criminally Insane (which I could not distinguish in any way from the Ivy League photos). All told, there were some 20,000 photographs of men -- 9,000 from Yale -- and 7,000 of women.
In flipping through those thousands of images (which were recently transferred to Smithsonian archives in Suitland, Md.), I found surprising testimony to the "insurmountable psychological problems" that the Denison University official had referred to. It took awhile for the "problems" to become apparent, because, as it turned out, I was not permitted to see positive photographs -- only negatives (with no names attached).
A fascinating distinction was being exhibited here, a kind of light-polarity theory of prurience and privacy that absolves the negative image of the naked body of whatever transgressive power it might have in a positive print. There's an intuitive logic to the theory, although here the Sheldon posture-photo phenomenon exposes how fragile are the distinctions we make between the sanctioned and the forbidden images of the body.
As I thumbed rapidly through box after box to confirm that the entries described in the Finder's Aid were actually there, I tried to glance at only the faces. It was a decision that paid off, because it was in them that a crucial difference between the men and the women revealed itself. For the most part, the men looked diffident, oblivious. That's not surprising considering that men of that era were accustomed to undressing for draft physicals and athletic-squad weigh-ins.
But the faces of the women were another story. I was surprised at how many looked deeply unhappy, as if pained at being subjected to this procedure. On the faces of quite a few I saw what looked like grimaces, reflecting pronounced discomfort, perhaps even anger.
I was not much more comfortable myself sitting there in the midst of stacks of boxes of such images. There I was at the end of my quest. I'd tracked down the fabled photographs, but the lessons of the posture-photo ritual were elusive.
"THERE'S A TREMENDOUS LESSON HERE," MISS manners declares. "Which is that one should have sympathy and tolerance for respectable women from whose past naked pictures suddenly show up. One should think of the many times where some woman becomes prominent like Marilyn Monroe and suddenly there are nude pictures in her past. Shouldn't we be a little less condemning of someone in that position?"
A little less condemning of the victims, yes, certainly. (I speak as one myself, although it turned out that my photo was burned in the Yale bonfire of the late 70's.) But what about the perpetrators? What could have possessed so many elite institutions of higher education to turn their student bodies over to the practitioners of what now seems so dubious a science project?
It's a question that baffles the current powers that be at Ivy League schools. The response of Gary Fryer, Yale's spokesman, is representative: "We searched, but there's nobody around now who was involved with the decision." Even so, he assures me, nothing like it could happen again; concerns about privacy have heightened, and, as he puts it, "there's now a Federal law against disclosing anything in a college student's record to any outsider without written permission."
In other words, "We won't get fooled again." Though he is undoubtedly correct that nothing precisely like the posture-photo folly could happen again, it is hard to deny the possibility, the likelihood, that well-meaning people and institutions will get taken in -- are being taken in -- by those who peddle scientific conjecture as certainty. Sheldon's dream of reducing the complexity of human personality and the contingency of human fate to a single number is a recurrent one, as the continuing I.Q. controversy demonstrates. And a reminder that skepticism is still valuable in the face of scientific claims of certainty, particularly in the slippery realms of human behavior.
The rise and fall of "sciences" like Marxist history, Freudian psychology and Keynesian economics suggests that at least some of the beliefs and axioms treated as science today (Rorschach analysis, "rational choice" economics, perhaps) will turn out to have little more validity than nude stick-pin somatotyping.
In the Sheldon rituals, the student test subjects were naked -- but it was the emperors of scientific certainty who had no clothes.

HEADLINE: ON WASHINGTON;
America's Front Lawn

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
AS IT BEGAN TO SLEET ON New Year's Eve, I was sitting on a bench across from the White House dreaming of Carole Lombard.
Watching the homeless who live in Lafayette Park drift around, I was reminded of "My Man Godfrey," the 1936 romp in which Lombard, as a madcap New York society girl, looks for a "forgotten man" in a scavenger hunt. Finding one (a down-at-the-heels William Powell) in a city dump on the East River, she offers him a job, asking blithely, "Can you butle?" 
 There are no screwball angels in Lafayette Park. Only a few well-dressed Washingtonians hurrying along the red brick paths. But the forgotten men and women camped near the statue of Andrew Jackson are a little less forgotten this winter. In the past few months, this quiet, pretty square has turned ominous and jittery. Like the scene in Disney's "Fantasia" scored to Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain," the park seems suddenly alive with macabre spirits, rising up and swirling around an unlucky White House.
"It has been a weird series of things, one after the other," says Bill Pugh, a 64-year-old Marine veteran from California who has made a bench in the southwest corner his home for a year and a half. "I'm beginning to get a little queasy about being here. We have a little rhyme that we put together: 'Now I lay me down in my bed, With the sounds of gunshots going off in my head.' "
Pugh presents himself as the Samuel Pepys of the park, witness to the eerie, violent goings-on. He recalls that he was sleeping on the ground one night in September when he was awakened by a "crunching, slamming" noise as a small plane crashed onto the South Lawn.
"About three minutes after that, this place was covered with every policeman you could think of: D.C. Government, Park Police, the Executive Protection Service, the Secret Service," he said, adding, with the savvy that comes from his milieu: "Actually, it was an F.A.A. slip-up."
Pugh says he was on his bench on Oct. 29 when he saw Francisco Duran stroll down Pennsylvania Avenue, pull a semiautomatic rifle from under his coat and fire through the north gate.
"Real tragic," he says, lighting a cigarette. "It's bad enough on the streets of New York or Los Angeles, but here in front of the White House, that's absolutely obscene."
In December, an unidentified gunman sprayed shots through the window of the State Dining Room. One man was arrested after making up a story about having a bomb in his car; another for trying to climb the north fence of the White House. And, in the most disturbing incident for those who live in the park, the Park Police shot and killed Marcelino Corniel, a homeless man who rushed across Pennsylvania Avenue waving a knife.
"It was a real shock, because he was the last guy we expected would do something like that," Mr. Pugh said. "He used to sit all day and sketch real-life scenes -- trees, birds, pigeons. He seldom spoke to anyone. But something snapped. The officers kept telling him to 'Drop the knife! Drop it!' But he wouldn't. It was just 'Bam! Bam!' "
Mr. Pugh, a compact man with ruddy skin and a yellowy white mustache, is wearing a maroon knit cap, and jeans and gloves with holes. Jazz squeaks from the Sony Walkman hanging around his neck. "My favorite was Stan Getz before he died," he says, waving off some young men offering peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and Christian pamphlets. "Well, everybody loves Stan Getz."
Pugh says he is a retired master gunnery sergeant who served in World War II and the Korean War. He came here from his home in Marina del Rey, Calif., to have a knee operation at the Veterans Administration hospital, then lingered, watching the passing scene. He says he gets a Government stipend, but prefers to stay in the park so he can save money and go to restaurants.
The park has an anthropology every bit as complex as that of the executive mansion across the way. Bill Pugh gets along pretty well with the various cliques, except for one trio of paranoid brothers who accuse him of being a C.I.A. operative sent by William Colby. He tries to steer clear of "the front line" of less stable park residents who gather along Pennsylvania Avenue to receive messages from Mars coming through pots on their heads and to protest various causes, vendettas and conspiracies. (One conspiracy involves the C.I.A. building robotic sleds under the sea.)
Dwight Baird, 44, lying amid his sleeping bag, economic books and cardboard marked with swastikas, announces grandly: "They hate me because I'm white. And I hate them." And, at another point: "My family are fascists. In fact, I've sued them."
The park, which was the front lawn of the White House until Thomas Jefferson turned it over to the public, has long been a symbolic slice of reality in the unreal Federal city. Administration officials and media big shots who never venture into the murderous parts of the city walk through Lafayette Park on their way to lunch at the posh Bombay Club; they glance at the tame sprinkling of homeless people and feel that they've experienced the gritty side of Washington.
An extreme manifestation of this attitude came in 1989, when Government agents lured a drug dealer to the park so they could buy crack for President Bush to use as a prop in a televised speech on drugs. Speech writers wanted the President to be able to claim that drugs were being sold right outside the Oval Office.
Sometimes, as Presidents have grown isolated in crises, they have looked out the window and seen, in the park, the specter of their demise. During the Vietnam era, protesters shouted "Hey, hey, L. B. J., how many kids did you kill today?" as the anguished President stared back, asking advisers, "Why are they doing this to me?"
Not everyone appreciates the park's reputation for free speech. When protesters beat a drum round the clock to protest the Persian Gulf war, President Bush grumped to Republicans, "Those damned drums are keeping me up all night."
But now the mood has grown spooky. Frank J. Fahrenkopf, a former G.O.P. chairman, has demanded that the park be cleaned out so that Americans can "bring their kids to see the people's house without having bums abuse them or yell or scream or see people lying in their own filth."
Bill Pugh says he won't be around to see what happens. He was going to celebrate New Year's Eve at Mr. Egan's restaurant, a few blocks away. "I'll have the hot roast beef sandwich and a couple of drinks -- V.O.," he mused. "By midnight, everybody in the park will be pretty well drunk and will go to sleep.
"In a couple of days, I'm going back to California," he said. "It's been an educational experience. But now I'm getting the heck out of this place."

HEADLINE: WORD & IMAGE;
Dysphemisms

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
THE START OF A NEW CONGRESS IS A good time to check on the current fashion in political euphemisms -- words that create a soothing image for what in more candid language would be harsh or offensive thought. The substitution of blunter expressions -- a few dysphemisms -- could be salutary.
For example, in the Capitol's changed climate (a liberal euphemism for now that the Republicans control both houses of Congress), you can expect to read and hear less about affirmative action, meaning reparation or compensation for past discrimination, and a lot more about tax breaks for capital gains, meaning the income that mostly rich people earn on certain kinds of investment. You can also expect a lively struggle over words that describe new issues; when referring to certain aliens, some politicians and members of the media will insist on calling them illegal while others cling to undocumented. 
 Not all euphemisms serve a political purpose (propaganda), but many help to conceal a political credibility problem (lie). And some of the most noteworthy evasions have been employed so successfully over a long period of time that they have become embedded in political culture, with hardly a challenge from even the most aggressive (politicians prefer hostile) media. It's those ingrown euphemisms that really hurt.
It would require dangerous idiomatic surgery, for example, to rid the body politic of the term "campaign contribution." Yet when the heads of a business or professional society explain to their stockholders or members why their Washington lobbyist has written such large checks to candidates for Congress, they portray the payment not as a contribution but as an investment. They rarely use the word investment, however, because it so plainly implies the uncomfortable truth that the money has been advanced with the expectation of a profitable return -- a legislative maneuver or vote that serves the economic interest of the donor. Even the possibility of such a return might then tempt the media to be more consistently enterprising in ferreting out the patterns of exchange. And before long, the "contribution" that had become an "investment" would be widely perceived and properly described as a bribe.
Anyone who still doubts that campaign financing has become an organized, institutionalized form of bribery should consider what happened after the election of the new Congress, when major contributors found they had guessed wrong by mistakenly putting most of their money on Democrats. Plainly frightened by the unmistakable Republican threats of retribution -- donors "not on board" were said to have been warned of "the two coldest years in Washington" (extortion?) -- these investors lined up to offer post-election tribute to the winners, whose overdrawn campaign accounts (deficit financing?) were generously kept open for late-comers. Dan Morgan, a consultant looking to help new House members retire campaign debts, told The Washington Post that "a lot of PAC's are saying, 'Whoops, we made a mistake,' and they're trying to redeem themselves" (buy their way back into favor).
In canvassing some of these tardy investors, Michael Weisskopf of The Post found several patterns. "We don't really look at it as an eraser on the pencil [expiation]," said John McKechnie, the political director of the Credit Union National Association, "but as a way of letting the winner know we'd like to be the same friend to [beneficiary of] him as we were to the guy he defeated."
Alfred Gilchrist of the Texas Medical Association offered a further illumination: "You want to let them know your support for the other person wasn't hostile to them. When you get on the late train, it's usually the most expensive ticket." (They really sock it to you when you've missed the boat.)
A further wrinkle was (almost) revealed by Teena Cregan, the chief lobbyist for the National Association of Postmasters. "We'll certainly be looking around to see who is in a leadership position we can work with," she said, meaning, We like to hold back some money till we know which legislators land on the committees that can help us the most.
A FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED POLITICIAN LIKE President Clinton, who is not currently collecting campaign "contributions," can find similar euphemistic refuge in the word "gifts." The ethics laws permit the First Family to accept unsolicited gifts; they were written to accommodate foreign potentates who tender expensive tribute to our Chief of State and ordinary Americans who enjoy sharing trinkets with their President. Surely unintended, but therefore apparently legal, is the President's receipt of substantial gifts of cash.
Thus, when the investigations of Whitewater and Paula Jones's charges of sexual harassment (propositioning?) threatened the Clintons with huge legal expenses, they established a "legal defense fund" to gather gifts of up to $1,000 from concerned Friends of Bill -- mostly lobbyists. Yet even that strategy failed to achieve the goal of millions, so the faithful are searching for a new name for the fund, one that would sanction more active and direct White House solicitation. Little Rock FOB Fund?
Of course, if the President's plight were dysphemistically described as that of a potentially indigent defendant, his needs could be met much more ethically. He could seek the help of a few pro bono lawyers who would, out of conviction or sympathy, see him through these trials without fee. Only a handful of individuals would then incur the President's debt, and watching these few for any sign of a future payoff would be a lot simpler for the media than watching thousands of vaguely identified donors.
 I SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE IMPRESSION that only politicians enjoy a good euphemism. The rest of the citizenry will as easily rise to linguistic bait.
For more than a decade now the voters have rewarded any office-seeker who promises a tax reduction, and the 1996 contenders, led by the President, are in full cry. Judging by the media enthusiasm for these "middle-class tax cuts" (bribes of voters?), you'd think that thousands of dollars instead of a few hundred per family, at most, were in the offing. And hardly anyone has been so rude as to call the proposals a tax expenditure, that is, a proposal to have the Federal Government borrow still more money at rising interest rates to pay the cost of the tax "cut."
A few news reports, it is true, will occasionally observe that any tax reduction would increase the deficit, whose decrease was so recently the object of universal political concern. And fewer still will estimate or, as is customary, underestimate the amount of the added deficit. Most of the media will simply relay the daily babble about the coming "tax cut," grateful perhaps to leave the era of tax increases that were fobbed off by the FOB's last year as spending cuts and in some quarters even as revenue enhancements.

Finding the Bargains Amid the Peso's Decline

BYLINE: By ANTHONY De PALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
AT last count, the battered Mexican peso had lost somewhere near 40 percent of its value against the dollar in less than a month.. Although it may seem predatory to think of bargains while Mexicans are trying to recover from the economic shock of the devaluation, the misfortune of America's neighbor opens a world of possibilities for travelers -- at least for the short term -- especially those willing to explore.
As of Jan. 9, one peso was worth less than 20 cents. If the Government's emergency plan to rescue the economy can be enforced, prices on most items that have not been imported will stay about where they were before the peso dropped. 
 That means that a 200-peso meal for two at Lorenzillo's in Cancun that would have cost a visitor $59 before the devaluation in December now goes for $36. A 75-peso leather hat in Ciudadela market in Mexico City used to cost $22. Now it costs the equivalent of about $13.50.
Of course, no economic stabilization plan can guarantee that prices will not increase, and it's easy for a government to lose control of inflation. Import prices will rise as quickly as the value of the peso falls, and any business that takes in and pays out dollars has started to jack up prices.
Airline tickets to and from the United States are paid in dollars, but Mexican airlines that fly from, say, Mexico City to Guadalajara charge in pesos. Mexicana, one of the country's largest airlines, has said it will not raise fares inside Mexico. The Mexico City-Guadalajara round trip now costs 614 pesos, around $110, down from $180 before devaluation in mid-December.
But in some instances -- for hotel rooms, for example -- prices will not change. In Cancun, room rates at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel have always been in dollars, $245 a night for double occupancy in the January off-season. Patricia Lopez Mancera, a hotel spokeswoman, says room prices will stay exactly where they are. But in the hotel's restaurants, where the prices are in pesos, prices went up about 15 percent on Jan. 1.
The Four Seasons hotel in Mexico City, which bases its rates on pesos, tagged an extra 15 percent on room prices Jan. 1. And some auto rental companies have already increased prices 10 percent.
Still, the cost of a Mexican vacation has dropped substantially. The Mexican Department of Tourism estimates that the devaluation will enable Mexico to increase the number of visitors from the United States by 9 percent, to 7.6 million this year.
Places like Cancun, where 85 percent of tourists are Americans, should see the biggest influx of visitors. But shopkeepers there know that those Americans have dollars that are worth more now, and will be tempted to increase prices or raise their bargaining threshold.
Kirk Whisler, publisher of Mexico Events magazine, suggests that the greatest values will be found away from the crowds. "The colonial cities outside Mexico City are going to be much more economical," he said.
With the value of the peso fluctuating daily, it is worth noting that American Express calculates the exchange rate not on the day a purchase is made, but on the day American Express receives the charge slip.
Finding the right place to change dollars into pesos also can make a substantial difference. Hotels generally have the worst rates. Surprisingly, the exchange booths at the airport in Mexico City are more competetive than most banks. Automated teller machines, if you can find them, generally have the best rates. Mexico doesn't really have a street-corner black market in dollars like other Latin American capitals.
Taxis in the capital are among the bargains -- they have not yet recalibrated their meters. And the innumerable vendors who sell chewing gum at every other corner still charge 1 peso for a box of Chiclets. Because most museums are run by the Government, admission fees can be expected to hold. And the Mexico City subway, clean and quiet, still charges 40 centavos for a limitless ride. That now comes to 8 cents.

Newt Age Music

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
Legislature sets the stage,
Social slaves caught in my rage
 -- Slayer, "Dittohead" 
 AS THE 104TH CONGRESS considers the state of the Union this week, its new Republican majority won't be thinking much about popular music. Oh, maybe another cop-hating rapper will set off an outburst of law-and-order posturing, or the fallout from last year's hearings on Ticketmaster's business practices will allow legislators to act like consumer advocates. But the Congress that has set out to champion what Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House, calls "normal people" probably won't want to go anywhere near the pierced, dreadlocked, angry and angst-laden legions involved in popular music. The odd thing is that the theme of both the new Congress and mid-1990's rock is the same: Revenge of the 'Burbs.
The 1990 census figures showed that a majority of Americans now live in suburbs. The 1994 elections were dominated by white male suburbanites among the 35 percent of the electorate that voted. The Republicans who control the new Congress have interpreted the election results as a mandate for suburban secession: redirecting perceived advantages from cities to suburbs, adding tax breaks and slashing social programs and controlling crime through tougher sanctions. Pop doesn't march or dance in lockstep with electoral politics; nobody's writing hits about welfare cuts or capital-gains tax breaks. But pop reacts to the same cultural currents that sway elections. And in recent years, the pop charts -- themselves a kind of poll on esthetics and attitudes -- have also turned suburban. Punk and hip-hop, the two lasting revolutions of the 1970's, were urban movements, but commercial and musical momentum is now generated outside the cities.
The pop juggernauts of the 1990's for the adult market have been persevering baby-boomer icons and a suburbanized version of country music. Younger consumers have endorsed the mall-rat alienation of grunge and neo-punk, the flailing bitterness of thrash metal and the nonchalant machismo of West Coast rap. The only potential crossovers come from decorous black crooners like Toni Braxton and Boyz II Men, who deliver come-ons and promises of romantic fulfillment, a perennial pop function.
For grown-ups, 1990's pop delivers familiarity and down-home comfort, the sonic equivalent of shag carpet and the recliner. For younger people, pop refracts suburban apathy through brattiness, despair and vicarious brutality; it's a food fight at the food court.
The suburbs mean comfort and isolation, a chance to sample the resources of the city without having to put up with urban noise, squalor and diversity. Geographically and economically as well as culturally, suburbs are defined by their separation from the dangerous and depressing city. They are as much refuges as communities.
Prototypical urban music is pitched to motley crowds and public gatherings, and to build its audience it tries to provide something for everybody. The suburban life carries music out of the public sphere and into the private one. In suburbia, music is enjoyed in cars, in basements, in bedrooms and on cable television. (Music on television, especially, has eliminated the need to visit cities for the latest updates.) The audience is large, but it's atomized; listening mostly takes place alone or with a handful of neighbors, not with strangers. The music calls for cult solidarity instead of one-world dreams.
In current pop, most older listeners want nothing to do with the modern city's frenzy of stimulation or its constant change. They're "normal" and proud of it; other people can be hip. While their radio stations promise as much exclusivity as the best neighborhoods -- "no rap, no hard rock" -- they stick with old favorites, snapping up brand names like Pink Floyd, the Eagles and Eric Clapton.
Or they turn to modern country music, which has abandoned the stark fatalism and troubled faith of country tradition. Good-timey songs about lovin' and cheatin' and dancin' survive, sung by telegenic young men who look as if they wear their cowboy hats to ride the lawnmower. Garth Brooks, the commercial success story of the 1990's, is an avowed fan of Billy Joel, the bard of suburban Long Island; Brooks's songs are domestic dramas that blend down-home country, 1970's pop-folk delicacy and arena-rock pomp. Mary Chapin Carpenter, a million-selling, nominally country performer who sings without a Southern twang, praises the harried suburban housewife in songs like "He Thinks He'll Keep Her."
Country songs have generally avoided grand statements and rather focused on individual stories. When modern country does venture to suggest a community, it envisions honest working men (and, much more rarely, working women) who long for the good old days when harmonious families lived in idealized small towns. It's the same all-American mythos conjured up by Republican rhetoric.
Country performers aren't necessarily party-line conservatives. In 1992, Brooks interrupted his long string of No. 1 country singles to release "We Shall Be Free," a song that insisted on the freedom to "love anyone we choose." Yet despite projects like "Rhythm, Country and Blues" (a hit 1994 album of duets for country and soul singers), country remains almost entirely segregated in both audiences and performers; there are more successful white rappers than there are black country singers. And only in current country music could Tim McGraw make his album a multimillion-selling hit with a single like "Indian Outlaw": "You can find me in my wigwam, I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom."
A diverse city audience might well hoot down such old-fashioned stereotypes. But country songs don't think about cities; their gathering place, for the proverbial Saturday night honky-tonking, is down on the farm or, for sophistication, in the town. Geography aside, the city is a long way away.
Younger suburbanites aren't as sure that they want to avoid the city. For them, suburban calm breeds boredom; isolation leaves them wondering what they're missing. At the very least, surburban album buyers want just enough grit to connote urban authenticity: some abrasive feedback, perhaps, or the latest in gangster slang, or a chance to gather by the thousands and feel rebellious for the annual Lollapalooza tour. They want something that will break through suburban complacency because they don't feel satisfied.
Can suburbs produce new musical ideas as well as consume them? That question hasn't been answered yet. Music has already been factionalizing, with each genre spawning subgenres. Suburban seclusion may accelerate the process, offering fewer opportunities for disparate styles to meet.
If recent history is any guide, a return to conservative economics and Republican moralizing may re-energize the most hostile strains in popular music. Through the 1980's and early 1990's, the Reagan and Bush administrations nurtured rock's angriest genres. Against the official veneer of optimism and 1950's niceness, rock (and increasingly violent horror and action-adventure movies) insisted that rampant self-interest would make for losers as well as winners. Intuitively, people in their teens and 20's may have guessed they'd be stuck with the bill for the high-living 1980's.
THROUGH THE LAST DECADE, thrash bands like Metallica and Slayer created doom-laden narratives about the forces of death -- psychotic killers, war, apocalypse -- as the music virtuosically bludgeoned listeners, insisting that malevolent forces were arrayed against them. Multimillion-selling hard rockers like Guns 'n' Roses lashed out in all directions, offering Reaganite individualism at its Darwinian extreme: "Welcome to the jungle," Axl Rose shrieked. In the song "One in a Million," Rose flaunted prejudices against blacks and immigrants, those longtime urban scapegoats; facing criticism, he later claimed that he was merely speaking in the voice of an invented character, someone straight off the bus in the big city.
Hard rock was music for suburban youth who would be servicing the new service economy, future keypunch operators and fry cooks. If frustration led nowhere, at least they could sing along with the the worst news. Other young rock fans supported a nationwide, grass-roots hard-core movement, in both cities and suburbs, forming punky local bands to bash out complaints. They helped punk-rock survive, below the radar of radio stations and major labels, until its momentum could not be denied. With upgraded melodic skills and musical proficiency, the eventual result was bands like Green Day, which sold three million copies of its third album, "Dookie," in 1994. In one of Green Day's most popular songs, "Welcome to Paradise," Billie Joe, its guitarist, sings a series of letters to Mom. She's back in the suburbs; he has moved to the scary but thrilling city.
Drawing on both hard rock and punk-rock, collegiate types turned suburban malaise and uncertainty inward to create alternative rock, with its complaints, defensive noise, arty tangents and self-mocking irony. As the music trickled out of college towns in the 1980's, suburbanites embraced the ambiguities of R.E.M. and the hypersensitive confessions of Morrissey. And as the Bush Administration wound down, the suburban millions transformed college-town diversions into its own anthems of aimlessness and despair, hurtling bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam into the top 10. Although grungewear's flannel shirts are already passe in big cities, and rock bands wouldn't think of wearing one, suburban teen-agers flaunt them like uniforms.
Hip-hop, meanwhile, saw its commercial initiative transferred from rap's birthplace, New York City, to the suburban sprawl of southern California. The virtuosic wordplay and noise collages of New York rap, echoing the urban information barrage, gave way on the charts to styles more easily decipherable to outsiders. The rappers slowed down, the music grew smoother and more cinematic, and the words increasingly focused on gangster exploits, from entrepreneurship in the crack trade to sexual boasts to gunplay. Although hip-hop as a whole still offers myriad messages, most of its commercial pace setters are now gangster rappers.
Early gangster rap may have provided a dose of artful reportage, a vision from within the urban purgatory and a reminder of the results of decreased Federal support to cities. But in recent years, the style has become nearly formulaic, and it increasingly functions to provide thrills from a distance to listeners who wouldn't dream of visiting South-Central Los Angeles. More and more raps warn people who aren't from the ghetto to stay out. But through gangster rap, suburbanites can purchase a vision of the inner city that suits their most alarmist fantasies, where belligerent young men carry guns, the women are irresponsible tramps or welfare mothers, and the police are despised and ineffectual. It's as scary as any 1994 campaign advertisement.
Fear of the city is inseparable from fascination; the city may be perceived as deadly, but it's not dull. And denial of the city, as heard in current country, leads to resentment when urban problems won't just go away. The suburbs remain dependent on the cities, but that dependence creates friction.
One of 1994's left-field hits -- released on a small independent label by a new band from Chicago -- was Veruca Salt's "Seether." In it, Nina Gordon and Louise Post sing about an anger that won't be held back, no matter how hard they try. "Seether is the center of it all," they sing. "Can't fight the seether." Tell it to the Democrats.

A Saxophonist Who Doesn't Wear Armani

BYLINE: By JOSEPH HOOPER 

 BODY:
BEGINNING IN THE EARLY 80's, the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis rejuvenated and refashioned jazz in his own dapper, neo-conservative image. Thanks to Mr. Marsalis's talent, ambition and marketability, jazz became very hospitable to dexterous young black men who looked great in Armani suits. So who could have predicted that a leading voice on tenor saxophone among the under-50 set would belong to Joe Lovano, a heavyset 43-year-old Italian-American with a receding hairline and a goatee?
It may be considered an act of bad faith to divide the jazz world along racial lines, jazz being America's great monument to racial synthesis. But the simple fact is, Mr. Lovano sticks out. He will play the Village Vanguard for six nights beginning on Tuesday, and if past gigs are any indication, he will sell out the club for virtually every show. 
 Not since Stan Getz has a white tenor sax player been taken seriously as a prime exponent of the instrument. But Getz enjoyed his peak popularity in the 50's and early 60's, when the top white players profited financially from the racial chauvinism of white audiences willing and able to ignore the black giants of jazz. Today the jazz audience as a whole is even whiter, but the racial preference has been turned upside down. In marketing terms, young black or mixed-race horn players like Roy Hargrove and Joshua Redman, as well a rediscovered elder like Joe Henderson, have a near lock on the middle-of-the-road jazz market, while white players find more visibility at the extremes of the esthetic spectrum, in the pop-fusion of Kenny G. or the arty downtown jazz typified by John Zorn.
Mr. Lovano may have the distinction of being a white man who has made it in a black man's world, but race itself does not make much of a case for musical importance. His recordings attest to that. Whether as a sideman in the drummer Paul Motion's trio or the guitarist John Scofield's quartet or as a leader of his own groups, Mr. Lovano has made his way onto a startling number of exceptional albums over the past two decades. On the tenor, his voice is readily identifiable, affecting without being especially pretty. Often he'll move back and forth between an earthy, barrelhouse tone in the lower register and a drier, querulous one in the upper, the sound of raw cotton rubbing against metal. "He plays modern ideas," the pianist John Hicks says of his sometime collaborator, "but his sound encompasses the history of the tenor sax."
It is the very richness of that history that has conditioned jazz fans to seek out that saxophonist who will usher in the next glorious age. But no younger sax player dominates the current scene in the manner of a Charlie Parker or a John Coltrane. Instead of giants, there are question marks. Mr. Redman, whom Mr. Lovano featured on his most recent album, "Tenor Legacy," is selling CD's by the gross, but is he too young and too glib? Will Branford Marsalis ever end his agonized dance with popular culture?
Clearly the cognoscenti who flock to Mr. Lovano's engagements at the Vanguard want to believe that his free-jazz inflections suggest an alternative to the prevailing orthodox hard-bop. But the Vanguard is a small church and Mr. Lovano's four well-reviewed, modest-selling albums on Blue Note haven't reached much beyond it. His next two releases, "Rush Hour," an orchestral collaboration with the celebrated composer and scholar Gunther Schuller, due out on Feb. 7, and "Live at the Vanguard," which will come out this summer, may well determine whether Mr. Lovano will ever gain a purchase on the popular imagination.
IN PERSON, THERE IS AN ursine solidity about Joe Lovano that would be intimidating if he were not famous in the jazz community for being the gentlest of men. Others may be obsessed with matters like race or commerce; he would rather talk about the joys of communal art that he discovered in 1978 when he moved into his funky-elegant Chelsea loft. "I had my friends, I had musical concepts I wanted to work on," he says. "My loft became one of those scenes."
Two years later, his musical circle expanded to include Judi Silverman, who was trained in classical voice and modern dance. Before long, they and their friends were putting on regular performances at the Washington Square Church in Greenwich Village. "I would sing a piece in leotards and then the dancers and I would do a piece I had choreographed," recalls Judi Silvano, who changed her name after she and Mr. Lovano married in 1984. Mr. Lovano adds, "We played some beautiful things." Where cynics might see a Jules Feiffer cartoon, Mr. Lovano finds a sustaining bohemian idealism. His 1993 album, "Universal Language," features Ms. Silvano's soprano voice pitched at weird angles against his horn -- interesting but, unapologetically, not for everybody.
These days, Mr. Lovano is the General Motors of jazz. He has his two avant-gardish groups, the Universal Language Ensemble and Symbiosis, as well as a quartet and a quintet that hew more closely to the ideal of hard-blowing modern jazz. But the 75-year-old gongs from Wuhan, China, that dominate the entrance to the Lovano loft suggest that nothing that produces tones is truly foreign to him.
This past April, Mr. Lovano was closeted in the recording studio with an assemblage of 23 string, brass and woodwind players and Mr. Schuller, the 1994 Pulitzer Prize winner in music composition. Two years ago, Mr. Lovano had heard one of Mr. Schuller's classical chamber pieces and had conceived the idea of returning with the maestro to his early-60's experiments in Third Stream music, folding improvisation into longer, composed pieces.
Owing to the straitened economies of jazz record labels, the entire process of rehearsing and recording had to be telescoped into two days. Mr. Schuller occupied center stage grandly, if wildly, furiously copying out parts during lunch breaks. Mr. Lovano was partitioned in a glass booth, given the barely conceivable job of sight reading the parts, following Mr. Schuller's baton and improvising with and against the sound of the ensemble being fed to him via headphones. Somehow, he served all masters. He blew through the manic-depressive mood swings and the jostling polyphony of Mr. Schuller's compositions and his arrangements of pieces by classic jazz composers like Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk. "Joe just picks up everything," Mr. Schuller says.
BLUE NOTE IS NOT unaware that Mr. Lovano's brainstorm is its marketing opportunity to take him out of the commercial ghetto of hard-core jazz and show him off in a tonier crossover neighborhood. "Does this mean that Lovano is going to be the big success in white jazz?" asks Bob Belden, a tenor saxophonist and arranger for Blue Note. "Probably not. His roots are in his family tradition and in the working-class communities of the Rust Belt, white and black."
While "Rush Hour" might be seen as an elaboration of the white jazz tradition that emphasized harmony and the melodic line, Mr. Belden is right that no one is going to mistake Mr. Lovano for the tenor saxophone's answer to the trumpeter Chet Baker. Mr. Lovano's roots are in complex, aggressive rhythm. Before his stint as a 23-year-old soloist with the Woody Herman big band, he had played rhythm-and-blues-inflected jazz with the organists Lonnie Smith and Jack MacDuff. He was in the distinct minority of white players on the so-called chitlin circuit of black jazz joints. "That was a trip," he recalls, "but I was accepted because I was in the band."
His most important teacher, however, was his father, Tony (Big T) Lovano, a Cleveland barber and an accomplished club tenor player. "My father had a beautiful, big sound that was coming from the Illinois Jacquet school," he says, "but it also had Lester Young elements when he played a ballad. I had stuff to reach for right there in the room with me. Not just from a record." In his early teens, he sat in for his father on wedding gigs and spent evenings drinking Cokes in the Smiling Dog Saloon, his father's favorite jazz club, absorbing some of the more adventurous jazz that still informs his playing.
In contrast to peers like Branford Marsalis who, for better or worse, have to wrestle with earlier allegiances to rock and funk, nothing but jazz ever registered with Mr. Lovano. The purity, and the severity, of that conception is perhaps most striking on the forthcoming "Live at the Vanguard." Listening to passages where he is playing a keening tenor with one hand and accompanying himself on the gongs with the other, one gets the feeling that Mr. Lovano is moving forward by reaching back to the early 60's, the free jazz of Ornette Coleman. "For a long time, my practicing was more a technical thing," Mr. Lovano says, "and then at a certain point it turned into a meditation." At that level of artistic engagement, issues of race and class, however instructive, dissolve, and what is left is the hard-won, deeply felt music.

Gleaming Baubles That Could Make A King Envious

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
NOT SINCE THE BLOCKBUSTER auction of King Farouk's paperweights in Cairo in 1954 has a collection as celebrated come on the market. Now, the New-York Historical Society is selling 500 glass paperweights from a collection that while slightly smaller in size, is more comprehensive than that of the Egyptian monarch.
The sale will be held on Wednesday at Sotheby's in Manhattan and is expected to bring about $1 million. Proceeds from the auction will go to the society's endowment for maintaining its vast collection of books, paintings and furnishings. While approved by the State Attorney General, the society's decision to sell art and objects from its collection has been widely criticized. 
 Praised for decades as one of the finest in public hands, the paperweight collection consists of items made between 1845 and 1960 in France, the United States, England and China. Virtually every known 19th- and 20th-century maker and type is represented. The insect and floral fantasies, prancing horses and glorious pinwheels of color include some outsize ones, up to four inches in diameter and a variety of shapes: ovals, hexagonals, doorknobs, pitchers and bottles.
Most of the paperweights in the collection, like glazed plums, rock candy and petits fours under glass, look good enough to eat. Even those depicting miniature gardens and starry skies seem squeezed from tubes of cake frosting. And those topped by relief portraits in white clay of Napoleon, Queen Victoria, Benjamin Franklin and Washington appear to be carved of sugar.
The oldest paperweight is an egg-shaped hand cooler, which was made at St. Louis, a factory in the French province of Lorraine, and is signed and dated "S.L. 1845," the year glass paperweights were first produced. It is expected to command a hefty $9,000. "The date, its oval shape and the use of glass canes that do not appear in later weights explain the high price," said Lauren K. Tarshis, Sotheby's paperweight specialist.
Miss Tarshis said she chose in this catalogue to describe the condition of any altered or damaged piece as an aid to bidders who cannot view the paperweights in person or to speak with Sotheby's representatives. Paperweights that are refaceted, reground or repolished with chips or bruises are expected to bring one-tenth to one-half the prices of unflawed pieces. But the rarest ones may still fetch four- and five-figure prices.
An unusual American piece, for example, a peach-colored dahlia paperweight by the Mt. Washington Glass Works of Boston, while cracked inside, may sell for $20,000, half what it might bring if perfect. And two rare but flawed French paperweights -- a blue trumpet-shaped flower on a lattice ground and a multiwindowed glass ball with a nosegay in the center -- are expected to bring less than $10,000 each.
The paperweights up for bidding are expected to range in price from a low of $100 for a group of five paperweights, including one from China depicting yellow birds on a red tree, to a high of $25,000 for a large clear glass paperweight centered by a bouquet of velvety violets and tinier wild flowers.
And just in case other New York museums wish to buy at this sale, the Attorney General has approved what is called preemptive bidding, which allows museums to override the winning bids and purchase the works at discounts below the hammer price.
Paperweights, which were sold in the mid-19th century for pennies, or at most $12, have been auctioned for much higher prices than Sotheby's estimates for anything offered in this sale. The record for a paperweight is $258,500, a figure paid in 1990 at Sotheby's in New York for a rare basket-shaped work from Clichy, a Paris producer.
Not all of the museum's paperweights are being sold, said Philip Zimmerman, the society's acting curator of decorative arts. About 35 are being retained by the society as a record of the type of objects New Yorkers collected. Many of these -- and the majority of those in the sale -- were acquired in the 1920's and 1930's by Jennie H. Sinclair of Manhattan, the widow of Francis McDonald Sinclair, a producer of printing inks. She bought them on trips abroad and in New England and left more than 400 to the society at her death in 1965.
Whatever she paid, the sums would seem small today. The Farouk sale of predominantly French paperweights was organized by Sotheby's in Cairo two years after the king was overthrown and brought what were then considered record prices of up to $850 each. All 600 were sold, glutting the market and creating a 10-year recession in paperweight sales as prices plummeted. By 1970, a new generation of buyers was happily paying 30 times the figures realized at the Farouk sale.
Will this sale spark another downturn in the paperweight market?
"Probably not," said Homer Perkins, president of the Paperweights Collectors Association, an international organization based in East Hampton, Mass. There are many more collectors actively buying today, he said. Since 1980, the association's membership has doubled, to 1,600. And there are buyers out there who are so competitive they never join any organization.

On-Line Property Listings

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
LUCILLE BOCCHICCHIO, a management consultant who has developed a reputation as a computer whiz, was recently asked by a friend if there was a way to list his East 59th Street co-op apartment on an electronic bulletin board.
The result was the "for sale" announcement (co-op, East 59th Street, 2 beds, 2 baths, asking $215,000) that appeared on CompuServe's residential listings all last week. Costing just $1 per line per week, it certainly started the phones ringing. 
 Similarly, Iris Engelson, a general manager at a computer software company in Millburn, N.J., bypassed the usual sources such as brokers and newspaper ads when she recently became interested in comparing mortgage rates for the 2-bedroom apartment she is seeking on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
"I didn't want to rely only on brokers," she said. "And I certainly didn't have the time to start calling around to all the banks." So she sat down at her computer and during a routine cruise of the Internet for mortgage-related information she stumbled upon the mortgage advisory services of HSH Associates in nearby Butler, N.J.
Using the HSH toll-free number, along with her own credit card number, Ms. Engelson was then able to order an instant E-mail copy of HSH's latest weekly comparative listing of mortgages in the area where she was making her purchase. Time spent was only 30 minutes. The cost of the print-out was $10. And there were no access charges since she has log-on privileges through her business (otherwise expect to pay about $4 or so per hour).
Anyone interested in buying, renting, financing or selling a property might also do well to think seriously about cruising cyberspace for the sort of information that once required endless legwork, phone calls and the purchase of many magazines or newspapers.
Although on-line services connected with residential real estate are still in their infancy -- and may therefore occasionally produce irritating solicitations from anxious vendors rather than actual facts or customers -- there is now enough good stuff on the electronic byways to make an on-line trek well worthwhile.
For example, some on-line services offer access to discussions with specialists who are not subject to the sorts of potential conflicts of interest faced by someone who will directly benefit from a specific deal. "People like to exchange information with someone who's not part of the selling process," said Peter Miller of Silver Spring, Md., a former real estate broker and author of numerous books on mortgages and home buying. He answers questions on America OnLine.
Other experts include such people as Julian Block, a highly respected tax attorney in Larchmont, N.Y., who regularly writes consumer-oriented books on taxes and real estate. He can be reached on Prodigy.
But limitations should be anticipated. For example, America OnLine (AOL), CompuServe and Prodigy all promote the fact that they offer "classified" listings of homes for sale. But as yet there are just a scant few to choose from -- which could be good for the seller but awful for a buyer.
Last week on AOL, for example, only 153 entries were posted for the entire state of New York, with just 29 for all of Connecticut. CompuServe similarly offered only 72 in its combined New York/New Jersey category and just 4 in Connecticut (which it lumps with most other states on the Eastern seaboard). Prodigy, with 1,618 properties listed in New York State and a total of 32,000 listed nationally, may currently have the most.
It may also not be clear whether the contact person is an agent or the seller (for-sale-by-owner), although the distinction is supposed to be noted. For example, a contemporary home ostensibly listed by a Charles Bull of East Hampton, L.I., on CompuServe last week turned out to have been the contact phone number of the local Coldwell Banker real estate office.
The office, which confirmed that it carried the listing, later apologized for the mix-up. It was not intended to deceive, it insisted, but rather due to its inexperience with the medium.
Ms. Bocchicchio, the management consultant, also felt she had been drawn into an electronic blind alley when many of her return calls started coming from services, such as movers and brokers, rather than from potential buyers. She said she had thus learned the importance of adding "interested parties only -- no vendors or brokers."
But reaching brokers or vendors may not be all that bad. Pollock & Williams, a real estate agency in Darien, Conn., ran into similar problems even though it was itself an agency. But it is planning to regularly list properties anyway.
David Epprecht, a broker with the firm, maintains there are indeed customers out there in electronic land. But, he said, "I haven't yet had calls from anyone except other brokers." Still, he argued, it draws attention to the properties. And the potential customer base is enlarging daily as these services expand at a rapid clip. America OnLine already says it has 1.2 million members.
Probably the most useful part of the current on-line real estate services are the data banks offering relocation information such as the demographics of a particular community or neighborhood.
CompuServe is especially strong in this area. It can provide Bureau of the Census data based on ZIP codes that can identify average household income and age of the local population, among other facts. Prodigy allows a subscriber to post a notice asking for another subscriber living in a community to discuss its pros and cons.
Browsers can also order "school match" information that can provide statistical information and standardized scores for the community's public and private schools. Most of the on-line services also offer access to local newspapers, which may further provide a window into a particular community.
And they also provide a mortgage calculator option that allows someone to figure out monthly costs instantly based on a number of variables, such as the size of the loan, the interest rate and term.
Further, virtually all of them have become more user-friendly, providing easy access to the various categories of information through the simple use of point-and-click graphic icons, the entering of key words or making selections from main menus.
Useful key words at CompuServe include: "homefinders," "demographics," "classified," "newspapers" and "mortgages." At America OnLine its easiest to start with the key words "real estate" and then choose more specific topics from its general menu of real estate topics. At Prodigy click on "jump" and type "real estate center."
Other on-line services with real estate components include Delphi (800-544-4005; GEnie (800-638-9636); Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL) (415-332-4335). America OnLine can be reached at (800) 827-6364; CompuServe at (800) 848-8199 and Prodigy at (800) 822-6922.

HEADLINE: Converting Brownstone Homes Into Office Space

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
A SOFT real estate market and a spate of vacancies have created opportunities for small companies and bargain-seeking investors to convert private brownstone homes to other uses, real-estate agents say.
Such conversions, from homes to offices or stores, and even back again, have altered the landscape of Center City's narrow streets for more than 300 years, since William Penn began his Colonial real estate development. But the steady pace of conversions in recent years, real-estate professionals say, has created a buyer's market. 
 One reason for the vacancies, said Larry Isard, president of the Isard-Greenberg Company, which specializes in downtown properties, is that many businesses have moved to the suburbs to escape the city's nearly 5 percent wage tax and the inconveniences of traffic or parking.
Another reason, Mr. Isard said, is the changing fortunes of the small companies that occupy the brownstones. They can grow or shrink unexpectedly, require bigger quarters or even go out of business.
And the demand for these properties may be cooling, brokers say, as some companies compare the cost of taxes and maintenance with the flexibility of renting. But there are still other concerns that prefer the long-term advantages of owning their own building and of controlling their own space.
For companies wanting to locate in town, Mr. Isard said, prices for private buildings can range between $60 and $100 a square foot, depending on size and amenities.
Most of the conversions are separated from the central business district by a three-block buffer zone designated by the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. The buffer zone, between the high-rise office towers on Market Street, the city's main east-west thoroughfare, and the residential areas as close as four blocks away, includes Chestnut, Walnut and Locust Streets. Most brownstone buildings are at the edges of the roughly three-square-mile downtown area; many are on Locust, Spruce and Pine Streets, including some in the buffer zone. Commercial activity is permitted in the zone, but there are limits on building size and the shape of offices.
BUILDINGS usually are not demolished to make way for commercial use, but renovated to open up office spaces and hallways that were not part of the original design. At the edges of the city's center, some buildings have apartments above storefronts or street-level offices, while others are used entirely as corporate addresses for architects, lawyers, consultants and other business professionals.
Such shifts keep the city vital and help it to maintain its small-town scale, said Otto Sperr, a restoration architect who lives and works near Rittenhouse Square.
"It's an interesting mix of people and users," Mr. Sperr said. "The commercial uses go quiet at night. But its an ongoing renewal and redevelopment in a neighborhood that's had its ups and downs."
One law firm that recently opted for a brownstone address is Bowser, Weaver & Cousounis. It moved from rental space in a high-rise office tower to a brownstone five blocks away, the former headquarters of the Republican Women of Pennsylvania, in a four-story building at 16th and Latimer Streets, just south of the buffer zone. The building's neighbors on the block, within walking distance of City Hall and the major downtown office towers, include a jewelry boutique, a doctor's office and a restaurant.
Charles W. Bowser, a partner in the firm, bought the building and paid for the needed renovations. Mr. Bowser said he paid $350,000 for the building -- down from an initial listing price of more than $1 million -- and that he has put more than the purchase price into the renovations.
The firm now occupies about two-thirds of the 10,000 square feet available and will save the balance for expansion or possible rental. For comparable space at his previous address, the annual rent was $92,000, including maintenance and other charges, he said.
"We can amortize the purchase price in 10 years or less -- and we plan to be in business that long -- but we'll also get the depreciation, the direct tax benefits and any appreciation of the property's value," he said.
What made the move possible, he said, was the age of the computer -- an age that has provided the technological ability to work from home offices or in smaller quarters. "I can do as much work with seven lawyers and a computer as I did with 15 lawyers at a large firm," he said.
In years past, law books and client files filled much of a law office's space, Mr. Bowser said, but storage of files on computer disk and access by modem to law libraries or databases reduces the need for large libraries and conference rooms.
Mr. Bowser said that a building's layout could be an obstacle to creating offices. Many homes are designed to move people from one room into another without hallways, but most offices require doors that close onto connecting halls.
HE knew it would be difficult to work with the distractions of people passing by constantly, he said, so he sought a property large enough to construct private spaces. His building, though, has retained some of the original architectural features, such as large leaded-glass windows. An airy, bright front parlor has been converted to a conference room.
There can, however, be unexpected problems in corporate homesteading, Mr. Isard said. A building's owners may after time outgrow the space, or dissolve the business, and find no buyers for the property. The companies, he said, may end up stuck with a onetime corporate asset that has become a liability, that is declining in value rather than gaining.
"There are several small law firms that bought buildings in the 1980's and are now trying to get out of them," he said. "At this point, they've removed kitchens and showers or put in drop ceilings, and to make them into a home again will cost somebody a lot of money. So they're trying to market them as offices and there's not a lot of buyers."
In addition, said Barbara L. Greenfield, who represents several commercial properties for Albert M. Greenfield and Company, office buyers -- like home buyers -- tend to "overcustomize" with flourishes and renovations that can boost the price for the next potential buyer. A higher price, of course, can make a sale more difficult.
Ms. Greenberg represents a 6,000-square-foot brownstone office building at 21st and Pine Streets where only half the space is being used because of turnover at a small law firm. The law firm is trying to sell, has found no takers, and the price has dropped by half, to $440,000.
Also, conversions from one business to another may be difficult because zoning variances granted for one owner do not transfer with the building's title. An office use approved by local officials and nearby residents may not be permitted for a new owner, said J. Ward Larkin of the Larkin Group, a real-estate advisory service. That can scare off prospective buyers or torpedo deals that take too long to get necessary approvals, Mr. Larkin said.
For example, one building on Locust Street was zoned for a single floor of office use and three apartments. The 90 days required to get community support for an additional floor of office use caused one bidder to withdraw, he said.
"You really need an entrepreneurial spirit to undertake the purchase of a property," Mr. Larkin said, "because there are lots of trapdoors and alligators in buying a brownstone building."

HEADLINE: Solar Power Unit At Work in Valhalla

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

 BODY:
THE sun is now powering the lights and equipment of the Westchester County Public Health Building in Valhalla as part of a demonstration project run by the New York Power Authority.
The 36-kilowatt power system on the roof of the building consists of 180 solar panels. Each panel measures 26 square feet and faces south at a 19-degree angle. The system produces 36,000 watts of power. 
 The Power Authority installed the $360,000 system at no expense to the county for "demonstration and advertising," said S. David Freeman, the authority's president. The county will save about $6,000 a year in electrical costs at the Public Health Building, which is part of the county's Lab and Research Department.
"This system is so simple, it's brilliant," said William Pisani, deputy commissioner of the Westchester Department of Public Works. "The sun's rays are converted directly to electricity with no chemical process, no nuclear reaction and no smoke. It's good for N.Y.P.A., the county government, taxpayers, science and the environment."
The authority has joined with 64 other utilities across the United States in a consortium, with each utility agreeing to buy and test solar systems. The cost of the Westchester project is being divided equally among the power authority, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, which consists of the New York Power Authority and six private utilities. The utilities hope that their combined purchasing power will drive down the cost of solar systems and encourage others to use the technology. "If we take 1 percent of the solar energy that hits the earth and harness it at an efficiency rate of 1 percent, we will get more energy than we use now from coal, gas, nuclear and all the rest," Mr. Freeman said.
The Public Health Building project is the second solar system that the Power Authority has installed in Westchester. In June 1993, the authority put a small 4-kilowatt, 12-panel system on the roof of White Plains High School. The authority plans to install eight solar projects in the state next year, with a total capacity of 300 kilowatts.
"We are picking some prominent spots to do these projects," Mr. Freeman said. "Each project is a small demonstration that we can take the sun's energy free of charge and, with modern technology, convert it to electricity. If it works on one roof, it can work on a lot of roofs."
The unit on the Public Health Building, called Solarex, has no moving parts. Photovoltaic cells convert the sun's rays into 480 volts of direct current, which are then turned into the more efficient alternate current. The system will power the lights, motors and air-conditioning fans of the building. But the building will not rely solely on solar power.
"We have two electrical feeds into the building: the normal and the Solarex," Mr. Pisani said. "When the sun is shining, we use the Solarex. When it becomes dark and cloudy, we automatically switch back to the regular electrical system. The system can sense a drop in voltage and switch over without even causing the lights to flicker." The Power Authority will maintain the system for two years, after which it will become the property of the county.
The solar power system at White Plains High School has "made no difference" in electrical costs so far, said Michael J. Lynch, director of facilities and operations for the White Plains city school district. That is because of the small size of the unit, which Mr. Lynch described as "making even less electricity than is produced in your kitchen, perhaps enough to run a coffee maker." Mr. Lynch said that "somewhere down the road, solar power will work" and added, "We are happy to help the Power Authority in this project."
While solar energy has been available for years, county and Power Authority officials say they believe that recent advances in technology -- like advanced metals that make the panels absorb sunlight better -- have made these systems more efficient and affordable.
"The cost has gone down by a factor of five," Mr. Freeman said. "Ten years ago, a solar system comparable in size to the Valhalla unit would have cost $2 million or $3 million. We think that by the turn of the century, the price of solar power will be highly competitive. This will be a major source of power for the planet over the next century."

HEADLINE: The Need to Preserve Indian Sites

 BODY:
Concerning the West New Brighton, S.I., Journal of Dec. 18:
Native Americans came, some from out of state, to speak about two Native American sites, Lot 33 and the Last Green Hill, which are in imminent danger. This land is next to and part of a Lenape burial ground and dwelling site. 
 We were surprised to see that Native Americans were not even mentioned in this article. A great many Native American people were here 15,000 years before there were European settlers. Native Americans were treated as if they were invisible.
The message of the American Indian is most needed now at a time when pollution has almost made this a place where people cannot live, and values seem to be lost. The Native Americans knew how to treat and love the land, water and air and respect the balance of nature.
These sites must be saved -- all that remains of the last green spaces and Native American sites along Richmond Terrace facing the Kill van Kull. Interestingly, this also means economic restoration of this historic area near the New York ferry and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center. This historic place should be a Richmondtown on the waterfront.
Native American sites must not be desecrated. The New York City Parks Department wants these sites. A choice must be made now. We trust that New York City will see that Lot 33 and the Last Green Hill go to the Parks Department. We hope that the New York City government makes the choice for the people, our heritage, and our environment and true economic growth.

HEADLINE: We've Come Far Since the Victorians . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gertrude Himmelfarb suggests in "The Victorians Get a Bad Rap" (Op-Ed, Jan. 9) that a return to the values of Victorian Britain might help solve America's social problems. Her article only illustrates, however, how bad history makes for bad politics. 
 For example, to support her case for the replacement of public provision by private charity, she asserts that in Victorian Britain such charity was taken seriously not only by the upper classes: in 1890, a survey showed half of the "respectable" working classes making regular charitable contributions. This is tendentious.
It is, anyway, implausible to suggest that half the members of this class, themselves only saved from degrading poverty or destitution by constant effort and good luck, were in the habit of giving a part of their overstretched income to help those even less well off.
What the historical evidence shows is that a substantial number of members of this class were contributing to organizations such as friendly and provident societies. This was not charity, but insurance for themselves and their families.
It is less defensible still for Ms. Himmelfarb to urge a return to the principles of the New Poor Law of 1834, one of the most thoroughly reviled and detested pieces of legislation passed in the 19th century. Is she seriously urging that the most powerful and affluent society in the world should now reinvent the early-19th-century workhouse and set the unemployed to do 10 hours' labor a day breaking stones?
Should the United States try to model itself on an early-19th-century society that was still overwhelmingly agricultural, aristocratic and Anglican? If reflecting on the history of the Victorian period were to yield any useful guidance for the present, it would surely be by considering the kinds of measures that enabled our predecessors to address some of the problems of an increasingly urbanized and industrialized society.
Regulation of working hours and conditions, legal protection of trade union activity, collective provision of essential services, publicly financed schools, libraries and museums, taxes on higher incomes, and death duties on inherited wealth -- these too were Victorian achievements.
Modern versions of these measures may or may not be appropriate to today's America. But recognizing their place in the historical picture may at least help prevent "Victorian" from becoming a code word for a particularly unlovely blend of myopic individualism and coercive moralism.

HEADLINE: PASSING THE BUCK;
War. Peace. Aid. All Issues Are Trade Issues

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST hours after the Senate confirmed Robert E. Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury last week, he received an immediate full-immersion lesson in what life is like these days sitting under the giant portrait of Alexander Hamilton. Rather than arm-wrestle with Newt Gingrich over the Administration's forthcoming budget, or shoot his signature over to the Bureau of Engraving for inclusion on every new dollar bill, he spent endless hours on the telephone to capitals around the world, trying to keep the United States' biggest neighbor, Mexico, from going down the tubes.
Mr. Rubin's task was to out-psych currency speculators and nervous investors the way American policy-makers once tried to out-psych the Soviet military: Make elaborate and very public plans for coming to an ally's defense in hopes of deterring all attacks. In this case, the plans were for loan guarantees for Mexico, stitched together Thursday night at the White House by Mr. Rubin, President Clinton, Mr. Gingrich and other Republican leaders, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan. 
 It is still unclear whether they accomplished enough to keep Mexico's currency crisis from turning into a nightmare: wild inflation and political instability on America's southern border, an influx of more illegal immigrants, and rattled markets in other booming but developing economies from Brazil to Indonesia. But whether the plan works or not, Mr. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, was already engaged in a new age of American foreign policy, in which Treasury, Commerce and the United States Trade Representative take the lead in managing many of America's most strategic relationships and the State Department focuses on the Middle East and the current hot spot (maybe Port-au-Prince, maybe Grozny).
"Everyone's been saying for a long time that foreign policy is becoming economic, but like everything it's taken a while for the message to sink in around here," the former Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said just before he left town last month. "It just shows you how important the economic issues are internationally, and that's a situation Secretaries of State don't work at very much."
The job of Treasury Secretary has permanently changed, Mr. Bentsen argues, and the result is that it has virtually merged with the job of Secretary of State. In a number of recent interviews, he told about turning Boris Yeltsin around on issues of Russian aid, pressing top Japanese officials to change their tax policies in an effort to spur more imports, cajoling Latin American leaders to speed the pace of reform.
Mr. Rubin may not be quite as tightly focused on his mission abroad; during his largely pro forma Senate confirmation hearing, he talked a good deal about job retraining, capital gains taxes and budgetary prudence. But the fact is that domestic fiscal policy is virtually dead; there is not enough discretionary money left in the budget to spur growth internally through government spending or big industrial policy programs. There is widespread acceptance of the notion that if the American economy is going to expand, it will do so through exports of goods, services and information. Even Warren Christopher says so. But his response has been to hand away countries to his colleagues, one by one.
He started with Japan, concluding that America's problems with its greatest ally in the Pacific were largely economic, and thus out of his bailiwick. China came next: Ever since last spring, when Mr. Bentsen won the day in one of the Administration's biggest policy arguments and persuaded Mr. Clinton that the linkage of human rights to trade relations with China was a recipe for America's commercial ruin, China policy has been dominated by the likes of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and the United State Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor.
Their talk of "commercial engagement" hasn't eased tension with China -- by many measures things are worse -- but now officials in Washington and Beijing do not argue over China's continued imprisonment of dissidents. Instead, they issue threats of a trade war, prompted by the Administration's insistence that China shut the factories that churn out 70 million pirated compact and video disks a year.
And as the Latin American summit in Miami last month proved, the Western Hemisphere is going the way of the economic gurus as well; the secret airstrips where the C.I.A. once flew arms to the contras now look like promising distribution channels for the new "Free Trade Area of the Americas." That is, unless the Mexican crisis sinks Mr. Clinton's plan for creating millions of jobs in the United States by building export markets throughout the the hemisphere.
"The question isn't whether Warren Christopher will stay in his job," one State Department official active in economic issues said the other day. "The question is why he has given so much of it away."
The answer is that he had little choice. Mr. Christopher has few levers to pull when it comes to helping direct international capital flows around the world -- and access to capital is the leading subject of discussion these days. The State Department has a large economics section, of course, but it plays little role in coordinating economic foreign policy.
 
Money's the High Card
 The rise of the Age of the Finance Minister, of course, is not entirely new: James A. Baker 3d carved out a lot of the territory when he served as Ronald Reagan's Treasury Secretary. But in the Reagan and Bush years, as throughout the cold war, keeping the anti-Soviet alliance together always trumped commercial concerns. Two years into the Clinton Administration, things have changed. To tell the difference, just peek inside the situation room -- not the one at the State Department, but the new one, over at Commerce.
Technically, it is the "Advocacy Center," a sleek computer room staffed by specialists who track, minute by minute, the status of thousands of giant projects around the world that American firms are vying to win. "The idea is to bring the whole force of the Government together to press the case for American business -- ambassadors, commercial officers, investment bankers, the Ex-Im Bank or OPIC," he said, naming the two government agencies that have taken a major role in financing big deals abroad. Competitors are also tracked.
On Thursday, 24 hours before Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's departure with an entourage of officials and industry executives to India, the screens were flickering with data about big electric power and telecommunications projects still up for grabs. "I for one was tired of seeing President Mitterrand and President Kohl travel the world representing their country's industry while we stood back and did nothing," Mr. Brown said last week. "Our attitude was, 'Good luck, let us know how it turned out.' "
But a series of deals does not constitute a foreign policy. The risk, of course, is that relentless pressure to buy, buy, buy American undercuts alliances and breeds resentments. Just ask the Australians, who are among America's most critical strategic allies and are outraged by the Agriculture Department's plan to help American dairy farmers export to Australia's markets. At the height of the cold war, when exports meant little to Americans and defending against Soviet attack meant a lot, the decision would have been easy. Now it may take up most of Mr. Rubin's day.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
A City Asks For a Return On Its Dollar

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI'S new urban agenda is a political alchemist's ingenious formula for coping with diminishing returns from Albany and Washington: He argues that New York, like many other American cities, is a well-capitalized national economic resource that would be largely self-sufficient if only the state and Federal governments got out of its way.
The logical, if unlikely, extension of that agenda is another political retread that dreamers recycle periodically: statehood. 
 "From an intellectual analysis, if New York were a 51st state, New York would not have a budget deficit," Mr. Giuliani suggested last week after outlining the agenda in his State of the City speech. "Its budget deficit, to a very large extent, is a factor of the mandates placed upon it by the state and the treatment that it gets from the Federal Government because it isn't a state."
For well over a century, secessionists as disparate as Mayor Fernando Wood, William Randolph Hearst, Norman Mailer and Bella Abzug have been galvanized by the same frustration Mr. Giuliani now faces in arguing that Albany and Washington are dragging the city down, not the other way around. Washington and Puerto Rico have at different times agitated for statehood, but this month both got a taste of bitter medicine when the new Republican majority revoked even their symbolic votes. Congress as a whole always seems unwilling to grant anyone statehood.
But Mr. Giuliani is not advocating statehood. Who needs statehood when one has the vows of Congress and the Governor to cut budgets and taxes, and promises to free local officials from costly regulation?
Over the decades, cities were transformed from self-sustaining creatures of increasingly anachronistic states to supplicants pleading for Federal grants.
"We have developed a habit in New York of thinking of these grants as free goods, and they're not," said Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York. "You pay for every one of them and you get back 80 cents on the dollar."
Mr. Giuliani said the metropolitan area sends $3.3 billion more to Albany than it gets back. And New York State sends $14 billion more to Washington than it receives in return.
Those figures are gross calculations, of course. The costs of secession, or merely of fairness, would be tougher to compute. Still, Leon E. Panetta, a former executive assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay and now Chief of Staff to President Clinton, wrote two decades ago that analyzing the issue would be worthwhile because "then, in the very least, the issues that will have been debated and studied will help the citizens of this city better understand the discouraging prospect of having to bargain annually with Albany for its life."
Or, as Norman Mailer, the author whose 1965 mayoral campaign platform championed a 51st state, mused recently: "Governor Giuliani, at this moment, sounds better than Governor Pataki."

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA STORM BRINGS RETHINKING OF DEVELOPMENT

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO LINDA, Calif., Jan. 14

 BODY:
With more than half of California declared a disaster area after the punch of a 10-day storm, water experts are questioning why this state remains stuck in a predictable cycle: devastation in a known flood area, followed by Federal relief, then rebuilding in the same places.
Today, the storms for the most part started to abate after causing 11 deaths and more than $300 million in damage. Thirty-four of California's 58 counties have been declared Federal disaster areas. 
 It is no surprise to anyone who has lived here in Northern California for any length of time that the flat land near the Sacramento River and its tributaries has once again flooded. The bigger surprise, some water experts say, is that new housing developments continue to rise in the flood zone and that the Federal Government continues to indirectly encourage building there.
Some of the worst flooding was here in Rio Linda, a community just north of Sacramento, where a tiny channel called Dry Creek swelled into a lake, covering hundreds of houses.
"Every time they build another home up north of here, the water comes down here on top of us," said Tom Ray, manager of the water district in Rio Linda.
Parts of Rio Linda and other areas around the Sacramento River here have flooded so often in the last century -- each time leading to more costly flood-control measures financed by taxpayers -- that Mr. Ray has now reached a somewhat radical conclusion for a water district manager.
"The only way you can get these people out of the flood zone is to buy them out," he said. "For the taxpayers, that would be the best deal."
That is the same conclusion reached last year by a panel put together after the Mississippi River floods of 1993, the worst in a century.
The Sacramento River system is the most heavily engineered in America, except for the Mississippi. For more than a century, Federal policy has been to build up a series of dams and levees intended to keep the water from spilling over onto its natural flood plain.
But on the Mississippi, much of that policy was declared a failure after the 1993 flood. The river has since been given room to reclaim some of its natural channel, about 35,000 acres, and more than 7,000 people have been moved, permanently, to higher ground.
California, by contrast, has continued in the opposite direction, water experts say.
The Sacramento is one of the biggest beneficiaries of 70 years of Federal dam- and levee-building, at a cost of $25 billion nationwide. Despite the vast Federal investment, per-capita flood losses, adjusted for inflation, have more than doubled since 1951, studies have shown, and much of that loss has been in California. Though California usually suffers more from too little moisture than from too much, when it rains here in the winter, it pours in near-biblical proportions.
The lessons from the Mississippi flood left a relief and cleanup bill of $6 billion, hydrologists and flood-control specialists say.
A new national flood policy, less reliant on dams and levees that channel water into fast-moving drainage systems was proposed last year as part of a study on the Mississippi by a special committee led by Brig. Gen. Gerald E. Galloway, an Army engineer.
Federal flood-control efforts would cost less and be more effective if they tried to move people out of risky low-lying areas and allowed more water to drain off into natural reservoirs of flat, spongy land, the committee reported.
The suggested changes were sent to the White House more than seven months ago, but have yet to be acted on. A bill that would have incorporated many of the changes was blocked by Republican-led resistance in the Senate last summer. Though many Republicans say they favor putting more stringent requirements on Federal largess to states prone to flooding, last year's bill was caught up in a Republican strategy that blocked almost all Democratic-supported legislation late in the session. In addition, property-rights advocates opposed the bill, saying that any measures to protect wetlands in general will lead to more regulations and take more farm land out of cultivation.
Since the Mississippi disaster, there have been major floods in Texas, Georgia and California.
"Some of the most dramatic examples of what was wrong with American flood policy can now be seen here in California this week," said Dr. Philip B. Williams, a California hydrologist who advises cities on flood-control matters.
In Southern California, where torrents of brown water and mud have smothered some neighborhoods, the Army Corps of Engineers is planning to spend up to $500 million to raise the cement walls of the Los Angeles River, a 58-mile-long concrete drainage ditch.
Some water experts say such a move will make the river even more likely to act as it did this week, when it raised up with three days of heavy rain, smashed into homes and took at least two lives. They say that building the walls higher will not only give a flood more velocity, but will offer people a false sense of security, making them more likely to live in homes that have gone under water in the past.
The corps says that it is impractical in urbanized Los Angeles to expect people to move out of a flood plain. They say raising the walls of the Los Angeles River, even at a half-billion-dollar cost to taxpayers, is cheaper than buying back land that has been developed along the river.
And here in the Sacramento area, a housing development for up to 60,000 people in a flood plain north of the city is moving ahead, with the blessing of local officials. The area now is mostly rice paddies, holding water that stormed out of the Sierra Nevada foothills in the last week and a half.
"The decay rate of the memory of a flood is very rapid," General Galloway said in an interview. "Every time we have a flood we are reminded how we have ignored the lessons of the past."
He said the Corps of Engineers, the nation's premier river-channeling agency, is making incremental changes. But there is stiff political opposition to even modest proposals to get people out of flood zones. In Sacramento County, developers say the levee system continues to be improved and usually works, creating land for a vast number of homes that would otherwise not be built.
Sacramento County officials have been trying to buy some private land in the flood plain. They also say they are working to get away from some of the old solutions to flood control, like new levees and culverts.
But at the same time, local officials here have approved housing developments for thousands of new homes in areas that now soak up water during heavy rains.
"It's stupid, and it makes me angry," said Martha Friedrich, who was tending the flooded Rio Linda house of her parents, who are away on vacation. "We know all this area is a flood zone. They shouldn't allow houses. But they want to buy out all the poor people and let all the rich people's homes go ahead."
She said her father, who raised eight children in the same house along Dry Creek, will not move, even though he has been through at least three major floods. "After the last flood in 1986, my dad said, 'That's the flood of the century, and when it happens again, I'll be gone.' Well, it happened. And he's gone, except for that is not what he thought."
In the first days of February 1986, more than 50 inches of rain fell in the upper reaches of the Sacramento Basin, causing a surge that came close to bursting Folsom Dam. The dam holds back water that could flood much of the capital city of California.
This time around, state and Federal officials say, the levees and flood-control dams in the Sacramento drainage system worked as they were supposed to. They have long talked of building a new dam on the American River, a major Sacramento River tributary, at a cost of up to $3 billion. Congress voted down the proposal two years ago. Supporters say the dam would allow more housing development in the flood plains around Sacramento.
Still, it would be less expensive, from a flood-control standpoint, not to allow future development in areas that traditionally go under water, critics say.
"The bottom line is that the long-term costs are always borne by the taxpayers, but the short-term gainers always seem to win out," Dr. Williams said.
Two large dams on the Russian River, north of San Francisco, could not keep the river from carrying a wall of water over the town of Guerneville, perhaps the community hit hardest in this year's flood. The town used to be a summer resort, with few year-round homes. After the dams were built, more people started living in permanent residences close to the river.
Now, in the wake of last week's floods, state and county water officials are talking about relocating people away from the river.
Critics of Federal policy on disaster relief say it has long encouraged people to stay in areas where homes probably should not be built. By some estimates, only one in five people who live in flood plains nationwide have insurance.
There is no incentive for a homeowner to buy insurance or to move out of harm's way, critics say, when flood victims know they can rely on Federal grants and loans after a flood.
"The market is saying you're nuts to live in a flood plain, but the Federal Government is saying it's not only O.K., but we'll make it affordable," said Scott Faber, director of the flood plains program for American Rivers, a conservation group based in Washington.
After the epic 1993 floods in the Midwest, Congress allocated 15 percent of the disaster aid for relocating people out of the flood plain. More than 7,000 have moved, the largest post-flood relocation in the nation's history.
With the report of General Galloway last spring, the Government was urged to relocate people to higher ground as a long-term policy, instead of just building more dams and levees, or waiting until disasters happen to move people.
Farmers along the Mississippi have taken buyouts, which put their land in a "conservation easement," meaning they would still own it, but it was given over to flood control, as a natural wetland.
Congress tried to make these kinds of buyouts part of the nation's flood policy last year. The bill championed by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, would have put restraints on new flood-control dams and levees.
It was opposed by Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, on behalf of some farmers who are against adding new wetlands as a flood-control measure.
Marc Reisner, a California author and expert on Federal water policy, said a handful of property owners have always been able to dictate flood-control decisions. "The vast majority of Californians do not live in flood plains," Mr. Reisner said. "But this minority that does live there controls the policy."

Chart/Diagram: "COMPARE AND CONTRAST: Two Ways of Managing a River"
 
Natural Flood Plain
 Floods are more frequent, but less devastating because flood waters have space to spread out. Buildings must be situated away from riverbanks to avoid water damage.
 
Man-Made Levee of Culvert
 Floods are less frequent, because high walls hold back rising waters. However, the walls constrict the river, increasing the current's force. If the river breaches the walls, the resulting flood waters can cause much more damage than a non-constricted river.
 The Los Angeles River is one such channel. In urban areas, the river flows through a concrete culvert. Most years, it is only a trickle, but becomes a torrent dureing floods. (pg. 20)

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Hunger for Poor And Middle-Class Hardship

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The three weeks since the peso was abruptly devalued have not been kind to the people of Mexico. The worst economic crisis in a decade has splashed icy water on many who thought they had worked themselves up the ladder, and on many who remain at the bottom.
Prices have risen far more than the 10 percent wage increase the Government allowed in a recent pact with labor and business. For Mexicans who are poor -- more than 45 percent of the 90 million people -- that means staples like cooking oil, eggs and milk have become distressingly like luxuries. 
 Jose Socorro Palomares, a 64-year-old street sweeper who earns Mexico's official minimum wage of what now translates to about $3 a day, says he has no idea how he will make ends meet now. His wife, Aurora, is also a street sweeper, and together they barely made enough before the crisis to pay the rent and feed their seven children.
But many of the most disillusioned are among the more than 40 million in the rapidly expanding middle class -- defined here as everyone who earns enough to keep from being hungry, but not enough to be considered among the richest 10 percent. The steep rise in interest rates that has accompanied the devaluation has hurt them. Monthly payments on adjustable-rate mortgages suddenly eat up an entire salary; credit cards are charging interest rates as high as 80 percent; payments on car loans have ballooned.
Carlos Garcia Frutes, a 38-year-old sales manager and father of two, thinks back to the dozen years in which he cinched his belt because the Government asked Mexicans to sacrifice now for benefits later. Just last October he was finally confident enough to take out a 21 percent adjustable-rate mortgage for 250,000 pesos, the equivalent at the time of about $75,000. The coffee-colored dream house in a Mexico City suburb was finally his.
Now he finds that since the devaluation his monthly mortgage payment could double and the value of what he has saved in the 14 years he has worked at Ingersoll-Rand of Mexico has dropped sharply. His only hope is a grace period from the bank.
Intoxicated by an overvalued peso before the current crisis, many Mexicans binged on imported stereos, videocassette recorders and other goodies. New cars, new coats, California vacations -- all could be paid for on credit, because things would only get better. But now those goods seem unaffordable to many people.
The wealthiest Mexicans worry also about their profit margins and the survival of their businesses. But many have dollars saved and will tap them during the crisis to get along.
Many Mexicans are disgusted about their situation.
"I really thought we were growing and that our economy had reached new stability," said Jose Romero, a 40-year-old carpenter. Framing the roof of a concrete hut at the edge of this huge city, and wearing a Zedillo for President cap, he called the Government's promises of a better future "pure lies."
"They've just been trying to trick us," he said.
Many in the middle class now worry about keeping their jobs. And they are skeptical of the Government's emergency stabilization plan, which asks them to accept cuts in purchasing power to help keep inflation under control.
Lydia Barbosa, an executive assistant in Mexico City for Detroit Diesel-Allison de Mexico, is one of many Mexicans interviewed who think their sacrifice has become perpetual. "They're asking us to sacrifice and we'll do it, not because we're in a mood to do so but because there's no other choice," she said. "But we want to know if the sacrifices are going to result in anything positive for us this time."
The linchpin of the Government's rescue plan is the ability to control inflation. Analysts say that while big stores like Kmart, Wal-Mart and the Mexican chain Aurrera will probably get special scrutiny to make sure they abide by the plan, there is no guarantee that owners of small stores will not panic and raise prices.
The Federal Office of the Attorney General for Consumer Affairs is charged with the nearly impossible task of enforcing Mexico's pricing guidelines. To cover the entire country, the agency has 550 investigators, about half of them here in Mexico City, where there is also a consumer complaint hot line.
"This morning I received a call from someone wanting to buy a Mercedes-Benz," said Lucia Cabrera, one of 15 operators taking call after call from angry consumers. "Before the devaluation, the car was priced at 196,000 pesos and now the price is 370,000."
In a nearby cubicle, Guillermina Velazquez used a stern, grandmotherly voice to lecture some shopkeepers who had been caught trying to evade the price guidelines.
"We've been getting a lot of calls from people telling us that the prices of the basics -- beans, sugar, eggs -- are going up," she said. "Imagine, these products have nothing to do with the dollar -- they are pure Mexican goods. There's absolutely no reason to raise their prices."
Since prices were frozen in the week before Christmas, the consumer agency has temporarily closed hundreds of stores for exceeding the price guidelines. And most Mexicans say they have seen widespread price gouging and even some hoarding by shopkeepers who remove items from the shelves until there is a shortage and demand allows them to charge whatever they want.
"I'm angry -- everybody is angry -- but what am I going to do with that anger?" said Mr. Socorro Palomares, the street sweeper.
Mr. Socorro Palomares said it was the small stores that had blatantly violated the price guidelines for everything from cooking oil to cigarettes, but he does not go to the big stores because they charge too much to begin with.
So he shops in the markets of the Tepito District of Mexico City, a chaotic haven for illegally imported products to which Mexicans have been going for generations. Vendors there say they have their own troubles.
"My father and my grandfather were also street vendors here, so we have all experienced devaluations before," said Claudia Ramirez, an enterprising 25-year-old who six days a week tries to sell handheld imported video games, X-Men dolls and a few Mexican toys. Business, she said, has dropped 70 percent since the peso collapsed. In mid-December the exchange rate was 3.4 pesos to the dollar. Now it is generally exceeding 5.5 to the dollar.
"Somehow this one seems harder," she said, referring to the devaluation. "There is more competition and it's taking longer for the exchange rate to stabilize."
The Trade and Commerce Ministry has been holding meetings with the nation's largest manufacturing companies to fix the allowable price increases for a group of basic products. The increases range from 10 percent to 30 percent; only tortillas and sugar remain unchanged.
Ricarda Martinez de Suarez has already determined what she must do to survive on the pension she and her 83-year-old husband, Martin, receive. "Chicken," she said, referring to the heads and feet that were all she used to buy. "We've cut it out completely."
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon has told the Mexican people that if the country really unifies and works together, the period of sacrifice will last only until the economy begins to recover. But many Mexicans find it hard to trust such promises.
"We don't have much confidence that the program will have any positive impact in the short term," said Rocio Olivera, 24, the director of human resources at Detroit Diesel.
Ms. Olivera lives with her mother and helps with house expenses. Her mother's monthly car payment has jumped 22 percent, and the family, like many Mexicans, is dreading the determination of January's mortgage payment.
"Look," she said, "we fortunately don't have to live day to day worrying about what to eat." But she has had to scrap her plan to buy a new car this year and perhaps move into her own apartment. She doubts she will be able to take a vacation in the United States.
Mr. Garcia Frutes said he had put off buying the new car he wanted, and he is hoping his children's school does not increase tuition before next September.
Mrs. Martinez is now raising half a dozen chickens to replace what she can't afford to buy at the market.
Ms. Barbosa and her husband, Igor, have decided to wait before starting the family they had planned. "We have had to put it off a little bit more to see how the future is," she said. "All we know now is that the future will be more difficult."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Republicans Want to Renew Vision Of Reagan (Then Redo His Math)

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
All over the Capitol these days the talk is of a Reagan revolution redux, a triumphant return by Republicans to an era of small government and more reliance than ever on the magic of the private sector. This time, of course, they say they will avoid running up $2 trillion in accumulated deficits.
Supply-side theories for raising Federal revenue by cutting taxes and stimulating the economy have risen anew. Republicans say the only problem with Ronald Reagan's vision is that no one took it far enough. 
 "I think Reaganomics was an incredible success," Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican who is now the House majority leader, told reporters over breakfast on Jan. 6. "We ought to stand up and be proud of the 80's."
Mr. Armey and his colleagues walk around the Capitol brandishing Mr. Reagan's old hit lists for elimination from the Federal budget: The Interstate Commerce Commission, now 107 years old and the survivor of several previous assassination attempts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Departments of Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban Development.
But in their less hyperbolic moments, the new Republican leaders acknowledge that while Mr. Reagan sounded the call of smaller government, as President he did little shrinking. And his record casts doubt about how much of a dent the new majority will be able to make.
"This may make people feel good about their government," Warren B. Rudman, the former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, said recently, "and that has some political significance. Unfortunately, it doesn't have any fiscal significance."
The number of Federal programs cut from the budget in the eight years of the Reagan Administration can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Moreover, despite the oratory, the Government's huge share of the national economy barely budged. It amounted to 22.9 percent of the gross domestic product the day Mr. Reagan arrived in Washington. It was 22.1 percent when he left and exactly 22 percent in 1994.
Meanwhile, the budget deficit soared, fueled by tax cuts and increased spending for the military. In the last few weeks, the Clinton Administration and the new Congressional majority have been arguing over whether the blame for that increase belongs to Mr. Reagan's wildly optimistic estimates of how his tax cuts would stimulate the economy or to a Congress controlled by Democrats who were unwilling to cut and slash.
It is an argument with no easy answer because it is impossible to know what the nation's tax revenue would have looked like without the Reagan plan or how much Mr. Reagan would have cut had Democrats given him a free hand.
Whatever the answer, Republicans are rediscovering a harsh truth: Even if they cut the 100 programs at the top of Speaker Newt Gingrich's list, the effect on a $200 billion annual Federal deficit will be minimal.
Take the Interstate Commerce Commission, a favorite target of budget cutters because its examiners daily wade through 16,000 pages of rates set by the nation's trucking and rail companies, even though deregulation has left the I.C.C. largely without power to change those rates. Eliminating the agency would save roughly $40 million, less than one-fiftieth of 1 percent of the Federal deficit last year.
But the numbers are less important these days than the Congressional mood, as Representative Bud Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, recently discovered.
Mr. Shuster has consistently opposed eliminating the I.C.C., but no sooner had he taken his post as the new chairman of the committee that oversees the transportation industry than he declared he had seen the Newtonian light.
"Now I may not be too smart," Mr. Shuster said at the panel's first meeting, "but I'm not Louie off a pickle boat. And I know the I.C.C. is going to be eliminated. So I think that as the band master I should run and get in front of the band."
Lawrence Chimerine of the Economic Strategy Institute, an economic research group, said: "Even if they cut welfare, the subsidy for Amtrak, the National Endowment for the Arts, you are talking about chicken feed. The reduction in spending is a lot less than you would think, and a lot less than all these enthusiastic freshmen in Congress think."
Republican leaders acknowledge that cutting away at bureaucracy might not contribute much to budget balancing, but they argue that a higher purpose is at work.
"When you talk about eliminating Commerce or the Small Business Administration, which are responsible for more mischief than most parts of the Government, you are talking about freeing up the private sector," Mr. Armey said. "The Government may not spend a lot of money on these things, but they can do a lot of mischief with a little."
Asked the other day what functions should be left to the Government, Mr. Armey said, "Defend our shores, build a system of justice and construct some infrastructure." After a pause, he added, "Gee, I'm running out of other suggestions."
Playing defense, the Administration is pursuing a two-track response: One day it portrays itself as the leader among budget-cutters, and the next day it maintains that it is the greatest paradox to turn to Reaganomics to fix what Reaganomics brought about.
The first response was evident on Jan. 6 when Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, announced that he planned to cut the department's staff by 4,400 employees, more than a third of the current total, over the next five years. He estimated the resulting savings would amount to $800 million.
Mr. Cisneros said his department had been kicking the figure around for months in internal debates over how to streamline the department's bloated bureaucracy, but the announcement appeared to be part of an effort to ward off HUD's total elimination, which the White House had once considered.
The second approach reappears every few days. Mr. Clinton and his Cabinet officers are bandying about a remarkable statistic intended to lay the blame for the current problems squarely on the last two Republican administrations. If the Government was not saddled with interest payments on debt accumulated from 1981, when Mr. Reagan took office, to 1993, when Mr. Clinton took office, the budget would be balanced today, they say.
It is an unprovable thesis, because no one knows how much debt the Democrats might have run up in the same time. But it drives home the fact that the Government's biggest single obligation today -- repaying its past debts -- is immune to the budget ax. And unless something radically changes, so are most of the programs such as Social Security and Medicare to which all qualified Americans are entitled by law.
Nor does the Congressional Budget Office think this will soon change. The other day it projected that in the year 2002 -- the first year that a Republican-sponsored constitutional amendment to balance the budget would go into effect -- the Federal deficit will be $322 billion, up from a projected $176 billion this year. To balance the budget would require $1.2 trillion in cuts or new taxes between 1996 and 2002, the budget office said.
"If those savings were achieved entirely out of entitlement and other mandatory programs, excluding Social Security," it concluded, "they would represent about a 20 percent reduction from current-policy levels for those programs."
Until a couple of weeks or so ago, the Republicans had a ready response to such estimates. They were advocating a budget-projection system, called "dynamic scoring," that has been rejected by the Congressional Budget Office. It includes estimates of how much new revenue will flow to the Government after tax cuts and deregulation further stimulate the economy.
But in recent days the Republicans have started to backtrack. Some warn that the financial markets would react badly to any move toward dynamic scoring, fearing that it would be used only to make the numbers come out right rather than keeping the deficit in check. The result could be a run up in interest rates, for which the Republicans would be blamed.
"We're going to go slowly on dynamic scoring," one Republican staff member said. "We've been down this road before, and no one wants to make the same mistake twice."

HEADLINE: Brazil Comes Down Hard on Cigarette Ads

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 10

 BODY:
No longer will a Brazilian soap opera villain drag on a cigarette while plotting perfidy. No longer will a Brazilian economist puff on camera while explaining Government perfidy.
In one of the widest attacks on smoking in the third world, Brazil's Health Ministry is banning cigarette advertising from sporting and cultural events and on television until 11 P.M. Prime-time shows and television news programs will also be forbidden from showing people smoking. 
 Advertisements will not be able to suggest that smokers are socially, professionally or sexually successful.
"Pretty soon, the Government will ban television interviews with people who are poorly dressed," grumbled Gilberto Leifert, acting president of Conar, the advertising industry's self-regulating council, which says it will challenge the restrictions as unconstitutional.
The rules for newspapers are scheduled to go into effect late this month, those for magazines in February and those for television in mid-May. With sponsorships of jazz concerts, dance festivals and automobile races at stake, tobacco industry leaders are trying to kill the new rules, while the Health Ministry says it is certain that it will prevail.
To reach those who cannot read, a graphic warning will cover one quarter of the front of each pack. One of the eight designs shows a black cloud hanging over a fetus carried by a smoking woman.
Tobacco companies are increasingly heading to third world countries with large, young populations, like Brazil.
In 1993, Brazil overtook the United States to become the world's largest exporter of raw tobacco. In 1994, Brazil exported $1 billion worth of tobacco, double the level of five years earlier.
Next year, Souza Cruz S.A., a subsidiary of British-American Tobacco, is to inaugurate in southern Brazil the world's largest tobacco-processing plant, a $54 million, 250-acre factory capable of processing 100,000 tons a year.
Despite the export drive, the average Brazilian increasingly declines a proffered cigarette. After 20 years of steady growth, Brazilian consumption has plummeted, from 164 billion cigarettes in 1990 to 103 billion in 1994. Taking into account population growth, per capita consumption has dropped 40 percent in five years.
"We believe that a great part of the reduction was because of our campaigns," said Marcos Moraes, a cancer surgeon and director of the National Cancer Institute.
Tobacco industry representatives counter that Brazil's consumption drop merely reflects the recession here in the early 1990's.
"The fall is attributed more to the fall that the country is going through, the erosion of salaries," said Ronaldo Costa, director of the Brazilian Tobacco Industry Association.
But Brazil has registered 5 percent economic growth for the last two years -- a time when tobacco consumption continued to tumble.
Some Brazilians have resisted smoking restrictions, calling them one more copycat import from the United States.
"We can't fall into the American paranoia," Clodoaldo Celentano, legal affairs director for the local Philip Morris subsidiary, told a Brazilian reporter. Gilberto Dimenstein, a newspaper columnist for Folha in Sao Paulo, wrote recently: "I'm moved. I'm even ready to start smoking again, to help Brazil."

HEADLINE: U.S. Ready to Declare Haiti 'Secure'

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The United States and United Nations plan to declare, perhaps as early as Tuesday, that Haiti is now a "stable and secure environment" and begin the process of transferring military control from American to United Nations authority, Administration officials say.
The decision to move forward comes despite the killing of an American soldier on Thursday and the doubts of a number of military officers and diplomats who say Washington is rushing the transfer because of Congressional pressure. 
 "The U.S. is anxious to move to put a U.N. face on this operation, but unless the situation in Haiti is more stable, it will be more difficult for the U.N. to carry out its mandate," said one United Nations official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Other senior American and United Nations officials dismiss these qualms and say the time is ripe for handing off responsibility to a 6,000-member international force, probably in mid-March. About half the troops in the new force will be American.
Maj. Gen. David C. Meade, the departing commander of American forces in Haiti, said in a telephone interview on Friday night that the killing of an American soldier by a former Haitian Army officer at a checkpoint in Gonaives on Thursday was "a random incident that I don't think changes the overall assessment that things here are going very well."
General Meade, who today turned over command of United States troops to Maj. Gen. George A. Fisher Jr., said, for instance, that random searches by Army troops of 2,500 cars in the Port-au-Prince area since November had turned up only nine unauthorized weapons, all but one of which had been pistols.
Even before the killing, Republicans lawmakers voiced opposition to placing American troops under United Nations command in peacekeeping operations. But they have clamored just as loudly for a rapid withdrawal of United States forces from a mission that has cost an estimated $765 million since October 1993.
"We will press the Administration to move forward in handing this mission over to international peacekeepers, where the U.S. should play a more limited role, as soon as possible," said Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican, who heads the House International Relations Committee.
To defuse Congressional objections to the international command structure, a United States Army officer, Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Kinzer, will head the United Nations operation.
United States officials and Army officers, recalling the problems that followed a similar transfer of military authority in Somalia, have expressed concern that the Administration's eagerness to placate Congress may lead the United States to withdraw too quickly.
"The U.S. wants to get out as fast as possible, and we want to make sure we don't go in with simmering problems, have them explode and then have us blamed," said a United Nations official. "There's no question on the agreement. It's just a question of timing."
A senior American official acknowledged that "some countries are anxious for the handoff and more responsibility, while others are nervous we'll leave them the hard part."
The declaration that safety has been established would pave the way for the United Nations Security Council to replace the expiring mandate that created the American-led operation with a new resolution.
The new mandate would authorize the United Nations-led force to sustain the "secure environment" in Haiti, train a police force and military to take over when the United Nations leaves in February 1996 and oversee Haitian parliamentary elections, which are expected to be held no sooner than April.
United Nations officials said it would take about 60 days after passage of a new Security Council resolution to build up its 6,000-member force, which will draw on many of the troops already in Haiti.
Four months after American troops landed in the impoverished Caribbean country to restore the exiled President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Administration officials say the operation has gone far better than anticipated. Mr. Aristide is sitting in the presidential palace, a fledgling Haitian Government is functioning and security has been restored to the point that commerce is picking up.
But Administration officials acknowledged the challenges ahead. "The Haitian Government right now can walk or chew gum, but it's not good at doing both yet," said a senior American official. "What it assigns priority to can get done quickly, but there is no experienced democracy. The economic situation is not improving as fast as one would like."
And while political terror has been largely supressed, street crime has surged, in large measure because of the collapse of Haiti's 7,000-member armed forces after President Aristide was returned to power on Oct. 15. A new interim police force, under the supervision of international monitors, has struggled to earn public respect and maintain order.
And anxiety lingers, particularly in the countryside, about the presence of many of the supporters of the military junta, including some rural policemen who have been cooperating with the American military.
"Look, we're not turning this place into Peoria," said an American official. "It'll be the crime-ridden urban environment that it is."
The interim police force has about 4,000 members, about 3,000 culled from the old police force and 1,000 from Haitian refugees recruited from detention camps in the United States naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. They received only a weeklong training course that focused on respect for human rights and on very basic police techniques.
The training of a new, permanent police force has been delayed until the end of this month, and it will be four months from then before the first class of 375 officers graduates from the new police academy.
At the height of the American intervention last fall, there were 21,000 United States soldiers in Haiti, and about 6,000 remain in the 8,000-member multinational force.
As the American military presence shrinks, so has its role. Army engineers have largely stopped patching roads, fixing electrical generators and repairing small bridges, as they did in the early days of the operation. And on Sunday the Haitian Government will begin paying for its own fuel. The Pentagon has paid for $2 million in fuel since last September.

HEADLINE: Poland's Foreign Minister, His Overtures to West Impeded, Resigns

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Poland's Foreign Minister, who has been among the strongest advocates of Warsaw's joining Western military and economic institutions, has resigned, raising questions about the direction of the country's international outlook.
Known at home and abroad for his tireless courting of the West and his efforts to chip away at Western ambivalence toward embracing Eastern Europe, Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski had been undermined by the Government of former Communists. On Friday, he said that he had had enough of what many in Poland perceived as a campaign by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak to force him out. 
 Citing irreconcilable policy differences, Mr. Olechowski said, "My feeling is that the Government does not want to do, and will not actively and convincingly do, what I regard as being in the state's interest: the fastest possible membership of NATO and the European Union."
President Lech Walesa, who appointed Mr. Olechowski as Foreign Minister in mid-1993, said he would accept the resignation.
Mr. Walesa, also a staunch supporter of NATO membership, said he had agreed that the Pawlak Government was unenthusiastic about taking an actively pro-Western stance. Mr. Walesa and Mr. Pawlak have been battling each other with an eye toward a presidential election that is expected sometime this year. While Western officials did not agree with the rush by Poland to become a member of NATO, many said they understood Mr. Olechowski's view that without the security of the alliance, Poland would be a stuck in a vacuum between an unpredictable Russia and the West.
With the resignation, Poland is without a Foreign Minister and a Defense Minister. In a sign of Mr. Pawlak's thinking on foreign policy, he nominated Longin Pastusiak as Defense Minister earlier this month. Under the Communists, Mr. Pastusiak wrote a number of books that lambasted the United States and NATO.
Mr. Olechowski's resignation was interpreted by Poles who favor a turn to the West as a major setback. They noted he had begun Poland's application to join the European Union and supervised Poland's membership in the so-called Partnership for Peace, a kind of apprenticeship program for NATO.
Mr. Olechowski often expressed his disappointment that the partnership plan did not offer more for Poland. At the same time he sought, with questionable success, to reassure the Russians that Poland's desire to join NATO was not intended as a hostile move.
Tall and distinguished-looking, Mr. Olechowski, 47, had previously worked at the World Bank in Washington and at the United Nations in Geneva as an economist. He speaks fluent and colloquial English -- an unusual trait among officials of the current Government -- and is familiar with Western pop culture from his days as a disk jockey in the 1970's.
"He anchored Poland closer to the West, the European Union and NATO," said Andrzej Wroblewski, the editor in chief of Gazeta Bankowa, a financial weekly. "His resignation means for Poland not so much that we are pulled toward the East but farther from the West."

HEADLINE: An Elusive Picture of Violent Men Who Kill Mates

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN 

 BODY:
Is O. J. Simpson's history of wife battering an indication that he murdered his wife, as the prosecution suggests? While prosecution and defense lawyers battle over the question, social scientists have an answer: Yes and no.
Virtually all men who kill their wives have assaulted them at least once in the year before the murder, data show. Yet of the men who severely batter their partners -- close to two million a year -- only a tiny fraction kill them. 
 In 1993, according to F.B.I. figures, 1,530 women were killed by their husbands or companions.
The problem of foreseeing which violent husbands will kill their wives is classic in social science: While data can yield estimates that apply to large groups of people, any specific case eludes the power of statistics to predict with accuracy.
"We simply don't know with any precision what particular wife batterers go on to commit homicide," said Dr. Angela Brown, a psychologist in Boston who reviewed the existing data in a article in The American Psychologist in October 1993.
Of the approximately 60 million couples in the United States, about 12 percent will have an incident of at least mild violence by the man, like pushing, shoving or slapping, in any year. But in only 3.4 percent of couples is the violence "severely abusive," as defined by surveys, like punching, kicking, choking or threatening with a knife or gun.
The figures for marital violence are from what is still considered the most definitive study, a 1985 random national survey of 6,002 households selected to be representative of the United States. These rates for violence are likely to underestimate the actual level of wife battery, if only because some couples are reluctant to admit violence, researchers say. "The vast majority of men -- 90 percent or more -- who kill their wives are among those men who have been most abusive to their wives," said Dr. Richard Gelles, a sociologist at the University of Rhode Island, who conducted the study. "Hindsight is always easy. If I know a man murdered his wife, I can look back and see what factors, like drug use and intense abuse, might have culminated in the murder."
The problem with prediction is that while a history of wife battering typifies men who kill their wives, the clues are elusive when it comes to identifying those who will do so.
By combing through data, including a yearly survey by the National Institute of Justice on domestic crime, Dr. Gelles has distilled 10 factors most common in the profile of men whom the surveys define as "severely abusive."
Many of the factors are economic. Severely abusive men are more likely than their nonabusive peers to be unemployed or to hold blue-collar jobs, or to have total family incomes of less than $15,000 a year. They are likely to be from 18 to 30 years old, to use illicit drugs like cocaine or engage in binge drinking and to have dropped out of high school.
As children, these men often saw their father hit their mother or came from neighborhoods with high levels of violence. They are abusively violent toward their children, and, in half the cases, their violence against their wives was serious enough that the police had been called at least once in the preceding year.
And, Dr. Gelles said, such men are often not married to their partner or have separated from her, and the partners come from different religious or cultural backgrounds,
"For men with 7 or more of these 10 factors, the rate of extreme violence is 17 times higher than average," Dr. Gelles said. "Even so, among such men, 4 in 10 will not be abusive."
Apart from these factors, emotional dynamics are at play when it comes to just what pushes a violent man over the line to kill. A 1982 study of men who killed their wives or companions found that the single most common reason the men gave was feeling rejected or unable to control what their mate did.
More than half of the killers, the study found, were living separately from the victim at the time of the killing. For the others, a walkout or threat of separation was the provocation, one they took as an intolerable rejection.
Such men, who have a history of extreme violence with their wives, fit one of two psychological patterns, according to work by Dr. Amy Holtzworth-Munroe, a psychologist at Indiana University. One type is men who become extremely jealous and obsessed by fears that their partner will leave them; the trigger for violence is some sign of abandonment.
The other type is men who use fear to control their wives. These men are the most brutal, using extreme violence in a calculated campaign of terror.
Beyond these patterns, studies of men who killed their wives have found that they are likely to have violated a police restraining order, to own a handgun and to have gone on drinking binges. Their psychological profile includes being impulsive, having a low sense of self-worth, being sexually jealous and harassing their mates and having a history of aggression.
But even if these additional elements are included, Dr. Gelles said, "you get only about a 70 percent prediction rate for which abusive men will go on to murder." He gave these chances for errors:
"That means your prediction will be wrong 30 percent of the time. If I were able to screen all the two million or so men in this country who are severely abusive, and with a 30 percent error rate, and with such a rare event as murder, I could falsely identify as prospective murderers 600,000 men who are innocent."
When it comes to predicting which wife batterers will kill their wives, Dr. Julie Blackmun, a psychologist in Montclair, N.J., and trial consultant in cases of domestic violence, said: "We only have broad statistical correlations. You can't do experiments on this where you systematically vary the elements."
Is it possible to predict what man will kill his wife based on the known characteristics of a wife killer? asked Dr. Neil S. Jacobson, a University of Washington psychologist who has studied violent husbands. "The answer is no," Dr. Jacobson said, "because it's very hard, if not impossible, to predict with complete accuracy any rare behavior. It's just as impossible to say who, of all the severely depressed people, will commit suicide."
Dr. Gelles said: "There's just too much about human behavior we still don't know. The complexity is way beyond our 20 years of research on this."

HEADLINE: Bank Plans For Mideast Scaled Back

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Plans for a Middle East development bank, widely seen as an important vehicle to promote peace efforts in the region, are being scaled back in an attempt to overcome opposition from Saudi Arabia and some European countries, American and Middle Eastern diplomats say.
The fate of the bank, which was proposed with great fanfare shortly after Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization made peace in 1993, was cast in doubt two months ago when Saudi Arabia opposed Washington's proposal at an international conference in Casablanca. As the region's economic giant -- but with financial problems of their own -- the Saudis feared that they were going to be pressed to provide billions of dollars for the bank. 
 But when representatives from 39 nations and financial institutions met this week at the State Department, a series of concessions were put forward that appear to have greatly diminished opposition to the bank from the Saudis and other Arab nations. And Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization came together at the meeting to make a joint proposal for such a bank, a combination that diplomats said helped give the idea new life.
The United States and other supporters of a bank say it is needed to buttress peace efforts in the Middle East, to help lift much of the region out of poverty, and to increase cooperation throughout the region. Such a bank is expected to lend money for water projects, highways and promotion of tourism.
To win Saudi backing, the diplomats from the United States, Europe and the Middle East who gathered at the State Department proposed a smaller bank than had originally been envisioned.
Under the new plan, the capital of the bank is expected to be at least $5 billion, far less than what some supporters say they had proposed. And its initial capitalization will be even less, possibly as little as $1.5 billion, less than one-third of what many supporters had wanted, Middle Eastern diplomats said.
Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the P.L.O. recommended that Middle Eastern countries put up 40 percent of the bank's capital, while other countries would contribute the rest.
In its clearest signal that its opposition was easing, Saudi Arabia supported the principal result of the State Department meeting: formation of a task force that would make recommendations on the size, membership and administration of a bank as well as the level of contribution from each country.
In another concession, the diplomats this week proposed that the new bank lend money only at market rates, rather than provide subsidized loans.
At the closed-door meeting, France and Saudi Arabia voiced the strongest reservations about the bank, but American and Mideast officials expressed confidence that even those two countries would ultimately support the bank. With Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain all voicing support, many diplomats said it was only a matter of time before the Saudis came around. The Saudi Embassy did not return calls for comment.
According to diplomats at the meeting, the joint proposal made by Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the P.L.O. went far to melt opposition to the bank.
"It was not only politically significant, but economically significant that the four parties in the region came to a consensus on a joint vision." Jordan's Ambassador to the United States, Fayez A. Tarawneh, said in an interview.
Israeli officials applauded in particular one proposal agreed to by all the countries at the meeting. The diplomats recommended that for countries to join the bank -- and the overwhelming majority of Middle East countries are expected to -- they would have to end direct and indirect boycotts against Israel.
Some French officials spoke out against the bank, saying it would be unnecessary when there were already numerous economic efforts to help the region. But Egyptian, Jordanian and Israeli diplomats chided France, saying that now that they were cooperating on something, as the French hadlong urged, France appeared to be turning its back on them.
In pushing for a economic cooperation institution rather than a bank, France proposed a Middle East version of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a 25-nation Paris-based group of wealthy nations that promotes economic growth. Joan E. Spero, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and co-chairwoman of last week's meeting, insisted that such an economic cooperation group would supplement a regional bank, rather than replace it.

HEADLINE: M.T.A., in Compromise, Seeking Short-Term Tenants for Coliseum

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Ending an impasse with City Hall about what to do next with the vacant New York Coliseum, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is seeking proposals from prospective tenants who would use the complex's vast exhibition hall for up to three years and finally generate some income for the authority.
 The request for proposals comes six months after long negotiations broke off between the authority and the building's prospective developer, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the owner of The Daily News, who had planned to build a huge complex of offices and apartments at the site. 
 It also comes after rocky discussions between the M.T.A. board and John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, who had argued last fall against a plan by the authority to seek Coliseum tenants with leases running 10 to 15 years.
 Mr. Dyson, who also sits on the M.T.A. board, had contended that such leases would hamper efforts to find a buyer who would redevelop the Coliseum site.
 A spokesman, Forrest R. Taylor, said Mr. Dyson was delighted by the plan for three-year leases.
 Officials of the authority said that in seeking to lease out the space, it was trying to put the complex to productive use.
 "The building is sitting unused and is costing us money," said John Cunningham, a spokesman for the M.T.A. The authority has estimated that security and upkeep at the Coliseum are costing it $1 million a year.
 Mr. Cunningham said the authority expected proposals from companies that would use the building for exhibitions or retail sales but would not make major renovations because of the short leases.
 "The idea is to test the market and see what proposals we get," he said, adding that the M.T.A. hoped to select one or more tenants within six months.
 Since last week, the authority has received a dozen calls seeking information but so far, no firm proposals. The deadline for bids is Feb. 8.
 Although the authority owns the Coliseum, any decision on its use must be approved by the city. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said he wants the Coliseum site, at Columbus Circle, redeveloped as soon as possible, in part because it would create jobs for a moribund construction industry.
 But the M.T.A. said its attempt to find short-term tenants had been authorized by the city in a contract signed in December 1992, seven months before Mr. Zuckerman dropped his development plan.
 At the time, Mr. Cunningham said, representatives of Mayor David N. Dinkins had agreed to leases of no more than three years because they realized that Mr. Zuckerman's plans were in jeopardy.
 It was not known how much the M.T.A. might receive in rental payments on the Coliseum, but an outside real estate consultant's report, commissioned by the authority last year, estimated that it could get $8 million to $10 million a year from tenants with short-term leases.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
But Haven't They Ever Read Genesis?

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
WHAT was billed as a year of steady growth and low inflation has opened ominously with a seasonal fire sale of stocks and currencies from emerging markets and the weaker industrial nations as capital flees the unstable peripheries of the global financial system to the safety of the center.
Will 1995 really be the second of those biblical "seven fat years," with a sustainable 3.6 percent expansion rate, which the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, cheerfully proclaimed at the annual meeting in Madrid last October? 
 Led by Mexico and the rest of Latin America, emerging markets are now souring on a scale unforeseen a few weeks ago when the financial community was vociferously promoting their charms.
Losers among 24 such markets have risen from 15 in 1994 to 17 in the opening weeks of 1995, with two of last year's winners giving up their gains. And the big threat of higher American interest rates leading to shrinking capital inflows and slower growth, is still to come. "We'll likely see a reassessment by investors of the riskiness, especially if money earns more at home," predicted John Litsky, Salomon Brothers' chief economist.
Meanwhile, jittery currency investors are dumping the industrial world's more vulnerable currencies -- Canadian dollars, Swedish kroner, pesetas and lire -- and piling into the havens of Germany and Switzerland. The dollar, caught by the backwash of a rising mark and yen, looks weak.
Wider floating bands have allowed Europe's pegged exchange rate system to weather the storm. But last week's turbulence foretells an impending collision between weak, deficit-prone governments and a Bundesbank preparing to follow the Fed into the world of tighter money.
The immediate problem in the emerging market drama is that the $18 billion international rescue package for Mexico may not be enough to save the peso. "They need a lot more," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International.
While the package covers Mexico's outstanding short-term foreign liabilities (the famous tesobonos), it doesn't give the central bankers enough to defend the peso against currency flight or foreigners' cashing in their $30 billion of Mexican stocks.
But where is the money to come from when the Clinton Administration cannot bail out Orange County, Calif.? And why should Western taxpayers stabilize Mexico's exchange rate by guaranteeing new loans so Fidelity's emerging market funds can get their money out safely?
Predictably in the wake of the Mexican crisis, Congressional protectionists are seeking to dissolve the union of the United States and its unstable southern neighbor that was created by the North American Free Trade Agreement, despite the threat to growth on both side of the Rio Grande.
They conveniently forget that Mexico has been enriching Americans for years by living beyond its means, while the trade pact has helped keep it tethered in the free-trade corral in the present crisis instead of galloping off into nationalistic isolation.
But the greatest threat to 1995's prospects stems from the Fed's difficulty over whether to tighten monetary policy on an overheating domestic economy even if this means higher rates in Latin America and less available capital to finance growth in emerging market economies.
In 1982, the then-Fed chairman, Paul Volcker, drastically relaxed American monetary policy when threatened with a Latin American debt blowoff. This time, however, the Fed and the Bundesbank have bet their reputations on containing inflation. "Mexico may temporarily delay the next tightening or shave it. But developing world problems are unlikely to get as center stage as in 1982," said Neal M. Soss of the investment advisers Soss & Cotton.
Yet overnight money in Mexico is now 34 percent. And in 1992 Britain and Italy pulled out of Europe's pegged exchange rate system rather than raise rates on weak economies at German dictate. Must the poor live by different rules?
The whiff of tighter money pushed currency markets into turmoil last week. They are betting that when the Bundesbank tightens, the weak, scandal-torn governments of Italy, Spain and Sweden will lack the will to defend their currencies at the price of sacrificing the growth they need to reduce unemployment, lift revenues and cut deficits.
With a prescience unremarked upon by financial commentators so far, the I.M.F., in fact, foresaw these looming storm clouds just as Mr. Camdessus was welcoming his days and wine and roses.
While its official forecasts see the developing world growing at 5 to 6 percent a year into the late 1990's, a little noticed chapter in last September's World Economic Outlook warns that "a sharp reversal of capital inflows" caused by "policy slippages" and "higher interest rates in industrial countries" could cut that rate in half.
Clearly, someone in the I.M.F. had doubts about those "seven fat years."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Is Everyone Destined To Get Rich?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE poor, Jesus said, shall always be with us. The financial markets of the world are beginning to suspect he might have had a point.
For the past several years, the big story in international finance was the willingness of those with money to believe that poor countries would soon become rich. It had worked with the export-led booms of such countries as Singapore and South Korea, and with rich countries feeling beset by cheap imports, it became fashionable to think that those success stories would be repeated time after time. 
 The collapse of Communism helped fuel the investment boom. It was bad Government policies, not fate, that had made many countries poor. Now, as free enterprise policies spread, wealth would grow around the world, and investing in emerging markets -- the new name for what used to be called less developed countries -- was a quick way to get rich.
There were always some flaws to the argument. Not everyone can get rich with an export-oriented strategy, for unless and until the Martians show up and start buying the world must have a net trade balance of zero. And it was never clear that many countries could maintain the same discipline shown by the early winners, who reinvested the early profits rather than allowing them to be consumed. But those who bought the argument and invested in emerging markets were amply rewarded, and the rush was on. By last year it seemed as if every mutual fund company had a fund to invest in such markets, and every brokerage firm had an expert on them. Bullishness ruled the day.
There were setbacks in a number of countries last year, but they were brushed off. And this one may be as well. Early last week, the flight to quality was on, and even the poorer European countries were finding investors reluctant to hold their securities. But then there was a remarkable rebound in Mexico and other Latin American markets, as United States investors fished for bargains while their Government tied to bail out the Mexican economy.
Still, the Mexican crisis should serve as a reminder that it isn't that easy for a country to get rich, and even harder to stay rich. Setting up the kind of economic system that both generates and keeps wealth is not as simple as taking a free enterprise pledge and vowing to export your way to wealth.
Investment is obviously needed. The best is often direct investment, setting up a plant that employs people and produces something that can be exported. Buying stock or bonds in a company may do the same thing, but it may also just enrich those who are selling the securities. Games involving artificial exchange rates are often tempting for the elite in a country that is attracting foreign capital. Don't be surprised if a scandal emerges involving accusations that some well-connected Mexicans took advantage of the artificially high peso to get their money out of the country before the devaluation. Certainly a lot of Mexicans managed to sell shares to foreigners at prices that now seem very high.
Eventually, some of the emerging economies will prosper. And so will long-term investors in those countries. But it is far from clear that those profits will be enough to offset losses in the countries that don't make it. Especially for those, like most mutual fund buyers, who got in on the emerging markets fad only when it was nearing a peak.

THE ECONOMY
 
There Was Nothing to Inflate but Fear of Inflation Itself
Inflation, inflation, inflation -- that's all we heard about last year. Dire warnings, hand-wringings -- and, of course, repeated Federal Reserve interest-rate increases to head it off. But when the final '94 numbers came in last week, one couldn't help wondering what all the fuss was about. Dread inflation, as measured by consumer prices, was a puny 2.7 percent for the year -- the fourth straight year under 3 percent. With one exception, in fact, that was the lowest rate in three decades. And there were signs that the mighty economy was slowing, too. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales had slumped unexpectedly in December -- and, a bigger surprise, that November was weaker than first reported. This was taken as a sign that the Fed might hold off on future rate increases, and stocks and bonds roared ahead.
 
Oh, Yes: The Minimum Wage
It's often hard to tell Democrats from Republicans these days -- from the silvery wads of hair atop Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich to those near-unison tax and welfare cantatas. But one issue survives: the minimum wage. Mr. Clinton, campaigner, vowed to raise it; Mr. Clinton, President, shelved it as he took that messy health care detour. Now it's back. Al Gore and Richard Gephardt (who calls it "a metaphor for the differences" between the parties) want to raise the wage, whose buying power is slipping mercilessly, while Dick Armey, House majority leader, wants to scrap the wage floor entirely. The case for keeping it at $4.25: raising it would mean wide job losses, and most low-wage workers are teen-agers, not breadwinners. Economists beg to differ: their studies predict negligible job losses, and show that just a third of four million minimum-wage earners are teen-agers; nearly half provide vital family support.
 
California Takes a Bath
Merrill Lynch and Orange County lobbed grenades back and forth last week in their billion-dollar blame game. First Merrill released letters showing that it had warned the county in 1992 that it was playing with fire with its explosive investment fund. Then the county sued Merrill for $2 billion, saying the firm had misrepresented the securities -- that it was illegal to buy them anyway. Merrill's response: the county was glad to get hefty returns for years, but now, "in effect, they're saying, 'Heads we win, tails you lose.' " . . . As this was unfolding, the gods got impatient with all the finger-pointing and unleashed 40 days' and 40 nights' worth of rain on the entire state (all in just a few days).
 
Hit the Ice, Already!
With football nearing its orgasmic finale and baseball a fuzzy memory, sports addicts who suffer post-Super Bowl withdrawal faced the horrifying prospect of having only basketball to distract them. (Sports pages would probably soon be reporting basement Ping-Pong games.) But last week it appeared that there'd be a hockey season after all. The settlement was grumpy, though -- both union and management were so dissatisfied, there wasn't even a public handshake.
 
Greenspan Has a Better Way
As the battle raged last week over that bit of mandated morality known as a balanced-budget amendment, Alan Greenspan unexpectedly offered to toss $150 billion into the kitty. The Government, he insists, could save that much over five years if it would just calculate inflation more carefully. The price index, he says, exaggerates inflation by 0.5 to 1.5 points, and since so many payments are tied to inflation -- Social Security, pensions, some union wages -- billions go out needlessly. Republicans liked the idea, though it does involve treading on that sacred ground called Social Security, while Democrats didn't waver from their demand that would-be budget-balancers "show us the fine print," as Richard Gephardt put it.
 
Jobs, in Black and White
"Economic recovery" -- those are empty words to most blacks. While the rosy numbers pile up -- on unemployment, say, or consumer prices -- blacks, as usual, are left far behind. There's been a breakthrough of sorts, for recent data show that the unemployment rate for blacks just dipped below 10 percent for the first time since 1974. It's probably just a statistical breakthrough, though, for if you scratch job numbers even slightly you see that they count only those looking for work, not those discouraged long ago. After all, just 24 percent of black youths are working, and 49 percent of whites.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Resolved: To Help Mexico
Democrats and Republicans were in clear agreement last week: they wanted a quick end to the Mexican crisis. That $18 billion credit line announced over a week ago clearly didn't do the trick, as both the peso and Mexican stocks kept falling. So the White House, with quick support from Congressional Republicans, came up with a big package of loan guarantees (it didn't give numbers, though estimates put it as high as $40 billion). And -- this was vital -- the move, involving loans, didn't open up any hornets' nests by adding to the budget back home. One thing in peril, of course, is the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- if the peso stays weak, there'll be precious few exports to Mexico.
 
Hail the Conquering Apple!
Life without apples, some say, is not worth living -- though the Japanese have somehow muddled through. With a good apple costing up to $6 in Japan, they've been treasured gifts, not daily fare. But salvation has arrived -- greeted by thankful hordes. Japan, never known to open its markets lightly, lifted import restrictions a quarter century ago -- in theory. In fact, it has kept foreign apples out all these years for fear that they'd carry disease (or so it said). But last week was D-Day for American apples, and Japanese consumers snatched them up in no time. At last report, no Japanese had been banished from their island Eden for partaking of this once-forbidden joy.
 
COMPANIES
 
Soon It'll Be the 'Gatesnet'
Clearly, it's not enough for Bill Gates to be the nation's richest human, to dominate the software universe, to build himself a digital San Simeon. No, he wants the world -- and since his world is computers, that means the Internet. Last week he said Microsoft had plans to be one of the world's largest commercial providers of Internet access, through its Microsoft Network, to start later this year. This, of course, puts strong competitive pressure on Compuserve, Prodigy and the like -- and could also provide a great lure for businesses, now computer-wary, to make the digital plunge.
 
Defy Microsoft at Your Peril
In case there were any lingering doubts about Microsoft's software dominance, just look at Borland International. Philippe Kahn, who founded Borland in 1983, kept lashing out defiantly at Microsoft -- and kept getting swatted down. It was undercut by a Microsoft desktop-application package it couldn't match, and it was late delivering key programs -- all adding up to repeated losses. So last week, after months of demands by big investors, Mr. Kahn resigned as chief executive -- though he'll stay on as chairman. The next step: possibly a sale of the company, either as a whole or in parts.
 
Golf? Not for Dr. Vagelos
What do you do when you retire, at 65, from a mighty career? You could play golf, but that didn't appeal to P. Roy Vagelos. Dr. Vagelos, who built Merck into a drug giant before leaving in November, joined a tiny biotech company called Regeneron Pharmaceuticals last week -- saying, in partial explanation, "I don't play golf." Is this a rerun of John Sculley's disastrous sojourn at Spectrum? After all, Regeneron has lost millions, recent tests of one drug were unsuccessful, and its shares have plunged (though they jumped on this news). Dr. Vagelos sees more, calling the company's scientists "some of the best I have seen."
 
What, No Dashboard Nintendo?
"Oh, reason not the need!" King Lear thundered. "Our basest beggars have too many cup holders!" But did Detroit listen? Of course not. Back when Detroit held its head up high, any car worth its chrome had fins you could ski down, or some awesome number of "horses." But drivers barely drive these days -- they're so busy talking on the car phone, playing a CD, drinking coffee. So at the Auto Show in Detroit last week, the big news was things like cup holders -- G.M.'s mini-vans have 14 (14!) of them -- and his-and-hers climate controls. All, in the words of Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman, to give drivers "things they don't even know they want." It's Chrysler's fault, of course -- it started the Great Cup Holder War when, a decade ago, it popularized those family-rooms-on-wheels called mini-vans.
 
A Statement That Refreshes
Is Coca-Cola trying to buy Quaker Oats? Opinions vary. Dan Dorfman, of CNBC, says it is. Investors went along, sending Quaker's stock up $4.50 on Friday. But Coke, relaxing its policy "not to comment on rumors," said, "Dan Dorfman does not have a clue."

HEADLINE: The Life of a Small Landlord

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
OSCAR PEREZ, landlord to the poor, compares his precarious calling to that of a family farmer. So much is out of his control. The other day, a seemingly respectable tenant was arrested on child abuse charges, and another apartment was empty. The week before, he thought he finally had a fifth-floor walk-up rented until the prospective tenant climbed the endless stairs one last time.
So the owner of four small South Bronx buildings with 38 units now has six empty apartments, and feels like a farmer gazing at a hail-ravaged field. 
 He is not cheered by the fact that he had eight empty apartments in 1993, a year when he evicted two tenants for years of not paying rent.
Part of his problem is that the city and nonprofit housing organizations have in recent years renovated much housing in the South Bronx. This is sometimes cheaper than what Mr. Perez offers, and some of his tenants, usually ones who are scrupulous about paying rent on time, snap it up.
But the tale of Oscar Perez is no sob story. For all the hard work and unpredictability, the value of his investment may have tripled in 15 years, and he could walk away with a profit of more than $200,000, providing the right buyer materialized. But taking care of old buildings is all Mr. Perez has ever known, and buyers eager to dish out large money for real estate are still rare in the South Bronx.
His experience illustrates a way of life and livelihood with a long tradition here, as generations of cabdrivers and schoolteachers, many of them immigrants, have scraped and scrimped to buy a piece of America, often a single tenement. For those interested in rolling these particular dice today -- or for those who are only curious about people who choose to be landlords -- Mr. Perez's situation is instructive.
There are easier ways to make a living. Last year his rental income after expenses was $31,000. Though he does most of the maintenance himself, he pays himself no salary for his 60-hour weeks.
Life as a landlord has never been easy for this 34-year-old Puerto Rican son of a floor polisher and zipper factory worker. He was effectively given his first and biggest building in 1977 at age 18 when the ailing owner gave up on it after a bloody shootout in a corridor. For the young man who had dropped out of high school to learn building maintenance skills, the initial challenge was filling 11 suddenly empty apartments in the 20-unit building, which is at 1162 Hoe Avenue in the West Farms section.
The pressures never diminished, though they are not particularly uncommon. Indeed, Mr. Perez's current problems -- which, he says, vary from sharply higher costs to tenants who don't pay rent to bureaucratic obstacles to redlining by insurance companies -- are emblematic of those facing tens of thousands of small property owners. Some say more buildings are in trouble than at any time since the great wave of abandonments in the 1970's, and government and industry experts are warning that the stakes are the homes of the city's poorest residents.
"These landlords are holding neighborhoods together," said Deborah C. Wright, Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "So many can't make ends meet. We fundamentally have to find a way for them to be successful."
The Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a group that raises much of its money from property owners, estimates that there are more than 350,000 privately owned apartments in the 20 poorest community board districts. It says 50,000 of these are in immediate danger of being seized by the city for tax arrears or simply abandoned.
The problem is severe enough that even tenant advocates acknowledge it. "I'm not unsympathetic to the problems small, hard-working, decent landlords have," said Michael McKee, director of development for the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition.
Mr. McKee specified that his compassion does not extend to the bigger landlords who his studies indicate dominate New York rental housing, even as landlords like Mr. Perez provide most of the housing in the poorest neighborhoods. His worry is that all forms of low-income housing are facing harder times. "Without some kind of subsidy -- which is unlikely in today's climate -- it is going to be very, very difficult," he said.
The numbers are chilling. A study by the Rent Guidelines Board in 1992 showed that 10 to 14 percent of the city's housing was in serious trouble -- about 100,000 units, virtually all in low-income areas.
"In this group, the cost of running the apartments almost equals what the landlords are receiving in rent," said Aston Glaves, the board's former chairman, who presided over the study. "In many cases, costs exceed rent."
Another indication of mounting difficulties is an increase in buildings behind in taxes, 18,003 in 1993 compared with 13,737 in 1989. What has historically happened is that owners in arrears negotiate a payment plan with the city Finance Department. But according to the rent board's study, the percentage who have done that plunged from 90.8 percent in 1989 to 29.4 percent in 1992, meaning that more tend to just walk away.
Worse, these late payment agreements are not being kept. A Finance Department official recently said that of 12,000 pacts in effect, 10,000 are in default, a sharp increase.
 
NO POPULARITY CONTEST
 And if the money is sparser, it hardly seems plausible that landlords remain in business for the popularity. From the Russian proverb suggesting the only good landlord is a dead one to Jackie Gleason's ranting about his on "The Honeymooners," building owners have seemed the easiest of targets, not least because a small but steady proportion have richly deserved it.
Indeed, a handbook published by the city Human Rights Commission in 1992 warned that a landlord is "likely to try to get his money through lying, promises, intimidation, harassment."
At least one property owner who failed in an effort to provide low-income housing in East Harlem is bitter about these prevalent attitudes. "There's kind of a knee-jerk prejudice against property owners; we're all supposed to be rich," said Harley Brooke-Hitching, who was forced by banks to sell her own co-op apartment as well as give up her 11 tenement buildings when she could no longer keep up with payments.
"It gets you angrier and angrier and sicker and sicker," she said.
The one glimmer of perpetual hope, the same hope that sustains cash-squeezed farmers, is that a property's value is going up. Mr. Perez, who acquired his buildings when the Bronx seemed to be sinking like a stone, said his $128,000 in real-estate purchases may have tripled in value, though assessments have only about doubled. But profiting from the price increase hinges on finding someone willing to pay that much. He has received only one offer for a building, his smallest, for $95,000, compared with a purchase price of $28,000. He turned it down, and has neither sought nor received offers for other buildings.
'I don't think anybody outside the neighborhood would buy them," he said. "And not many people here have the money."
But there is no question that he has done better with investments than most high school dropouts; he left Alfred E. Smith Vocational High School as a junior. And he is scrambling to make sure all his empty units have window guards, smoke detectors and new appliances so he can fill them as soon as somebody signs the dotted line. His ambition this year is a reprise of 1990, when he made more than $40,000.
But he also fears his fragile economics may force him to hang up his landlord hat, and perhaps go to work managing other people's buildings. "If I have to walk away, I'll walk away," Mr. Perez said.
The landlord grew up in the building at 1162 Hoe Avenue in West Farms, the Bronx, near the Morrisania section. His father, who polished floors in Manhattan office buildings, moonlighted as building superintendent there. The boy, who had four brothers and sisters, was kept inside to shield him from the gangs.
Samuel Barmherzig, a concentration camp survivor who invented gadgets and owned several buildings, took an interest in the youth's development and encouraged him to learn how to repair things. Mr. Perez remembers repairing a marble step with him at age 10. Then, he moved on to faucets and toilets, the first of which he broke.
Mr. Barmherzig would schedule plumber's visits so the boy could watch the work. "He would tell me to be there to make sure he doesn't mess up the pipes," Mr. Perez said. "But why would a plumber hurt the pipes? He wanted me to learn what this man was doing."
Then Mr. Perez's mentor was stricken with stomach cancer. In October 1977, he said: "I can't no more. You're going to have to take this building and make it work."
So on Jan. 16, 1978, Mr. Perez, at age 18, found himself the landlord of a building that had just experienced a shootout in a hallway, a nightmare that scared more than half the tenants away. "It was tough," he said. "It took awhile to realize the amounts of responsibility laid on me."
 
A LONG TRADITION
 Mr. Perez was representative of a breed. "This was the classic way buildings were saved from abandonment in those years," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership. "As the previous owners aged, many simply handed the keys over to a new generation, often immigrants. Through their hard work, some of these buildings have survived."
It is part of a long tradition of mom-and-pop building ownership here, the sort of thing to which a cabdriver might aspire. "These guys feed their families off their buildings," said Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a bank consortium that has lent $1.25 billion to finance 38,000 housing units. "It's different than just an investment."
Not that Mr. Perez got the building for nothing. He paid $25,000 in $300 monthly installments over 10 years. The building is now assessed at $95,000, an increase in value that is partly the result of today's spiffier South Bronx. A decade ago, all the buildings on this block were abandoned. Now, just the house across the street is.
Slowly, Mr. Perez began to build his small empire. In 1983, a friend of the old man who had first befriended the boy gave Mr. Perez a chance to buy an eight-unit building at 1245 Woodycrest Avenue near Yankee Stadium for $1,000 down and $263 a month over eight years.
The total monthly rent from that building was then $1,100, barely enough to pay for heat and other monthly expenses. That meant Mr. Perez had to begin a campaign of capital improvements to legally justify raising rents to profit-making levels. He accomplished that, but is proud that four of the original eight tenants have stayed on, even with the higher rents. Because the building is a better moneymaker as well as because of a general increase in values in the neighborhood, Mr. Perez says he thinks the property may now be worth as much as $150,000.
He next bought a three-unit building at 804 Freeman Street for $28,000 in 1986. That was the building for which he was offered $95,000.
His last building, at 936 East 169th Street, was bought with a partner, the owner of a local hardware store, in 1991. Each man put up $50,000 for the seven-unit building. Mr. Perez says it may now be worth $150,000.
These numbers suggest his net worth has tripled. He also has very little debt, just five more payments of $217 on the last building. (He also makes monthly payments of $1,040 on a two-and-a-half-bedroom house in the Bronx's Soundview section with his wife, Jannette, and their two children.)
What Mr. Perez represents is a property owner whose income is eroding, in the face of some stiff new challenges. Moreover, his cash flow is inherently unpredictable, dependent as it is on poor people paying him regularly and keeping apartments occupied.
And he is quick to say that he differs from farmers in that his product is not supported by government subsidies, as are corn and peanuts, but instead is kept cheap by the rent stabilization system.
As an example, he points to two identical six-room apartments at 1245 Woodycrest. For one, he gets $660 and for the other he gets $397. The lower price is not enough for proper maintenance, he says. "It destroys the desire you have to try to make everything nice," he said.
But rent regulation is not as big a problem as landlord complaints would suggest, he acknowledges. At the same address, he gets $502 from a tenant who pays rent regularly and is tidy. "Let's face it; we're not on Park Avenue," Mr. Perez said. "I prefer to take a little less and keep a good tenant."
Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, said that in poor areas, property owners' returns are limited more by people's low incomes than by rent ceilings. "In many cases the landlord can't get the regulated rent," he said.
But then there is the problem of tenants who do not like to pay rent at all. Mr. Perez says he has one tenant who pays $388.48 for a six-room apartment on Hoe Avenue. Each year, he says he takes her to Housing Court for back rent. She then agrees to pay a lump sum of $2,000 or so, and to pay the rest of the debt at $50 a month. She does this for a while; then the whole cycle starts again.
"This could drive you to kill a person," Mr. Perez said.
His lawyer says that despite Mr. Perez's frustration, it is exceedingly hard to persuade him. "I have to play the role of bad guy and push him to evict," he said.
Indeed, Mr. Perez goes fishing and on picnics with some of his tenants. Many send him Christmas cards, and he is often invited to parties in tenants' apartments.
"Sometimes I don't pay exactly on time, but he never gets angry," said Maria Rodriguez, who has lived in his Freeman Street building for five years. "He says O.K."
Cassandra Vernon, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said there are a relatively small number of violations in Mr. Perez's buildings, all minor. One, at Hoe Avenue, for example, is for failure to mark floors with painted numbers.
 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
 Such small landlords' biggest problem over time is that they cannot afford the major renovations needed to keep buildings running. "These buildings are on the edge at best," said Mark Willis, president of the Chase Community Development Corporation, a unit of Chase Manhattan Bank. "This guy can't hold that building together forever by continually patching it."
In particular, Mr. Perez has postponed getting a new boiler for the Hoe Avenue building, both of which were built in 1905. He says even the boiler salesman will not guarantee that the $22,000 expense will save energy. So he keeps patching cracks in the old steel, doing the welding himself. "It's a big decision to make," he said.
Other spending is a result of rough treatment by tenants themselves. For example, Mr. Perez said, one tenant has broken his apartment lock three times. "If the tenant breaks it 20 times, I still have to take care of it," Mr. Perez said. He said if he took this tenant to court, it would cost him $800 and he might lose. A new lock costs $50.
The bigger expenses have all shot up too, Mr. Perez said. Real-estate taxes exceed $10,000 at Hoe Avenue, compared with $1,600 in 1978. Repairs for all the buildings are no less than $10,000. Heat runs about $17,000. Sanitation tickets, almost always caused by neighborhood youths' overturning garbage cans, reach $3,000 a year. Fire and other insurance would be unavailable had not small property owners banded together and bought as an association: it runs $6,000 for all four buildings.
Another huge expense comes from the city's requirement that apartment owners pay higher water and sewer bills. At Hoe Avenue, these bills now approach $12,000, compared with $700 in 1978. The increase will be even greater after meters must be installed everywhere; so far, Mr. Perez has avoided meters by paying higher estimated costs.
Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, an organization of medium-sized landlords, said water and sewer costs are expected to increase by 5 percent a year over the next decade. "That is a real killer for small buildings in poor neighborhoods," he said.
And an even larger financial threat is looming: the cost of lead paint abatement. If the city, which is now planning tougher rules, requires all lead paint to be removed to protect children from brain damage, it could cost about $12,000 an apartment in old buildings like Mr. Perez's.
The landlord does not dispute the need. "I'm not a piece of meat with eyes," he said. "I have two kids of my own."
But he does hope the eventual requirement is either less costly than full removal, or in some way compensates property owners for their abatement expense. In terms of the economic threat to low-income housing, "this is like a ticking time bomb," said Mr. McKee, the tenant advocate.
In part, Mr. Perez survives because he has learned a trick or two over the years. One is to cultivate such necessary people as emergency plumbers by paying their bills first. Another is to go through the trash of a tenant who absconds without paying rent; he found one such woman's work address and succeeded in having her paycheck garnisheed. Still another is to ask about the "off the books" income of a prospective tenant who at first appears unable to pay the monthly rent.
But a startling amount of Mr. Perez's success has come from being a nice guy, tenants say, the last thing most people would expect from a landlord. Nersa Quinones tells of living in the Hoe Avenue building, then in 1977 moving to a larger apartment on the third-floor of a detached house. The rent went up faster than her husband Ralph's income as a body-and-fender repairman. They called Mr. Perez. "No problem," he said, and moved them into a $357.97 two-bedroom apartment.
"It's good to be back," Mrs. Quinones said. "My kids grew up here, you know."
 
From the Other Side: The Rights of New York Tenants
Here is a listing of some of the major rights of tenants living in New York City, according to Michael McKee, director of development and public relations for the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, a state-wide organization that lobbies for tenant's rights:

BUILDING CONDITION Landlords must provide heat and hot water for tenants. Heat should be turned on on October 1 and remain active until the end of May. The landlord also has an obligation to make repairs and guarantee that the apartment does not pose any threat to life or safety. This guarantee includes two types of locks on the door, a latch lock and a bolt lock, as well as protective bars on the windows if children under 11 are living there and a self locking front building entrance. Apartments are also generally required to get a new coat of paint every three years and have two-way intercoms.

ACCESS Tenants must grant access to the landlord only under a few specific conditions: for repairs, to check for violations, or to show to prospective purchaser. In all cases, the landlord must give the tenant reasonable advance notice and show up at a decent hour. Except, of course, in case of emergencies like ruptured pipes or flaming stoves. Tenants are also required to give the landlord a key, especially if they decide to change the locks.

OCCUPANCY In any regulated housing, including rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments as well as Mitchell-Lama housing and public housing, tenants have a right to tenure, i.e. they can stay in the apartment indefinitely until they choose to vacate or in the worse case, are evicted. Regulated status remains when a new tenant moves in. New tenants should check with previous renters or neighbors to make sure the rent hasn't been inflated beyond allowable limits. In unregulated housing, generally including small buildings with fewer than six units, your lease can be terminated without reason.

GENERAL RIGHTS Tenants can organize tenant groups and meet in public areas of the building, like lobbies and hallways and are free to distribute literature throughout the building. Tenants can keep pets if the landlord doesn't object within the first three months of you and your pet's occupancy.

HEADLINE: Building Up From Ground Zero

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: MOTT, N.D.

 BODY:
HERE in southwest North Dakota, the population peaked decades ago and signs of economic decline are as commonplace as winter blizzards. Farmers abandoned vast reaches of marginal cropland during the 1980's in return for Federal conservation payments, the latest in a long line of blows to farm equipment dealers, hardware stores, fuel supply companies and other local businesses. Most high school graduates move away to find work.
In towns like Mott, which has 950 or so residents, commercial districts are pocked with empty storefronts and the surviving merchants cobble together diverse enterprises to make ends meet. The laundromat here is also the television repair shop. The florist rents tuxedos to bridegrooms and high school graduates. 
 "This is Ground Zero for Buffalo Commons," says David Crane, a local lawyer, referring to a theory popularized in the 1980's by Frank Popper, a Rutgers University land specialist who suggested that large portions of the Western Plains be returned to the buffalo. "Mott is where NBC brought him to film a newscast on it."
But Mr. Crane and Thomas Secrest, a lawyer 40 miles away in the town of Hettinger, have a brighter future in mind. It is based on what legal scholars say is an ingenious plan that could save Mott and many similar rural communities from the slow death that looms before them. The two lawyers have been hunting in bankruptcy courts around the nation for small manufacturing companies that could benefit from moving some or all of their operations to an area like this, where land, labor and tax costs are low. The men's strategy: arrange for investors from several of the area's towns to settle the debts, buy control of the companies and then move them.
"We are not interested in starting up companies," says Mr. Secrest. "These little communities don't have time for that and starting up takes more money."
The Dakota Management Corporation, the two lawyers' year-old enterprise, originally set out seeking a 20 percent equity stake in each imported company, plus a management fee, with at least 31 percent of the remaining equity in the hands of the townspeople. Ideally, the transplanted companies would be in related industries, and the corporation would, for a fee, enable them to share accounting, marketing, distribution and other operating costs.
"It sounds fabulous," says Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy and commercial law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. "Small business bankruptcy is an overlooked segment of the U.S. economy."
"It's a very creative idea," agrees Mark E. MacDonald, a Dallas lawyer who is chairman of the Chapter 11 subcommittee of an American Bar Association group of lawyers specializing in bankruptcy. (Chapter 11 is the section of the Federal Bankruptcy Code that allows companies to stay in business with court protection from creditors while they try to settle their debts.)
But, Mr. MacDonald warns, Chapter 11 is a world rife with shady entrepreneurs. In addition, there is so little information available on small companies in Chapter 11 that finding attractive candidates could be an insurmountable challenge.
So far, Mr. MacDonald's concerns seem right on the mark. Efforts to bring three companies here have flopped. For their labors, Messrs. Crane and Secrest have more than $45,000 in legal bills and administrative debt, a pending lawsuit filed against them seeking damages of up to $1 million and scores of disappointed neighbors. And they have an albatross of a business partner: William J. Vaughan 3d, a 33-year-old high-school dropout from California whose attempts to build a career reorganizing underperforming businesses have been accompanied by an unnerving number of legal irregularities and financial problems.
Companies looking for a respite from the difficulties and costs of urban America have been moving to North Dakota's biggest towns, like Bismarck and Fargo. But despite economic incentives offered by the state, luring businesses to the 175 or so communities five miles or more from the handful of communities with more than 10,000 residents has proved much harder.
With the help of advanced telecommunications systems, small companies and individual entrepreneurs in some of the nation's rural communities can now compete on a more even footing with urban and suburban rivals based closer to customers and suppliers. But the new technologies also allow traditional employers like utility companies and the Agriculture Department to close local offices and serve customers from regional centers, driving many small towns further toward oblivion.
"Geography matters, despite the fanfare that the information-age economy is no respecter of places," says Tim R. Smith, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Smith has studied the 25 percent of rural counties that have grown faster than the nation's metropolitan areas and how they differ from the majority that are losing ground.
A high proportion of the winners are near urban centers. Those prospering in remote areas tend to be especially scenic, like counties in the Rocky Mountains or the Ozarks, or crisscrossed by interstate highways and rail lines. That reality explains why relocating established but bankrupt businesses might look promising to less fortunate regions, especially if several towns can coordinate efforts.
Since 1990, about 20,000 companies a year have filed Chapter 11 petitions, more than 99 percent of them small, privately held concerns. The most widely accepted estimate, based on a 1989 study by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in Washington, is that less than 20 percent manage to come up with a court-approved plan to satisfy creditors and stay in business. Of that group, about half have so little financial muscle they fail to live up to their plans and soon fold. That probably leaves a pool of scores of basically healthy manufacturing ventures with up to 50 employees and as much as a few million dollars in sales. If successfully transplanted, they could spell the difference between life and slow death for remote towns like Mott.
But while vulture capitalists actively serve investors interested in gaining control and reorganizing companies with $30 million or more in sales, most investors do not bother with shaky companies smaller than that. Those attracted to small companies, says Mr. McDonald, the Dallas lawyer, include "a lot of sharks" looking for quick fees in return for promises to find investors. And many smaller companies show up in Chapter 11 with what Mr. MacDonald calls "shoe-box accounting" -- records so disorganized it is hard to tell if the company has insoluble operating problems or if it can be saved with debt restructuring.
 
Hatching the Plan
 Mr. Secrest came up with the plan for Dakota Management after helping a safe-manufacturing company in Chapter 11 move from Boulder, Colo., to Edmund, S.D. A native of Texas who moved to the region in 1949 after marrying a North Dakotan, Mr. Secrest, 67, has been an assistant attorney general for the state, a county prosecutor, a county judge and head of the state Republican Party. He attacked each job with an aggressive, albeit folksy, style that left him well known but not universally loved.
Nor has Mr. Secrest been averse to taking business risks. He has bred race horses and sunk money into a packing plant that expanded so rapidly it went bankrupt during the 1970's. And he is unfazed by controversy. He has advocated that the region make a bid to become a nuclear waste storage site. Until last year, he regularly debated issues of the day with Tony Bender, then editor of the local newspaper, on a radio show called "B.S. in the A.M."
Mr. Secrest's Dakota Management partner could hardly be more different. A soft-spoken, intensely religious man with little taste for confrontation, Mr. Crane, 41, is head of Mott's Chamber of Commerce and has a law practice built by his grandfather and father, a longtime professional acquaintance of Mr. Secrest.
The two partners were unable to locate suitable buyout candidates through informal contacts with bankruptcy lawyers around the nation or through an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal. Then in the fall of 1993, Mr. Crane saw a classified ad placed by Mr. Vaughan in National Review magazine, identifying himself as a "chief financial officer" with Chapter 11 reorganization experience.
When Mr. Vaughan was reached by phone, Mr. Crane recalls, "he deluged me with ideas." A package of material about Mott and environs was sent off to California and Mr. Vaughan quickly responded with more development ideas.
"I was impressed with how thorough he had been," says Mr. Crane. "He had researched our transportation and telecommunications capabilities."
The first face-to-face encounter was last January, when Mr. Vaughan visited the region. "Vaughan wowed everyone," Mr. Crane says, recounting a meeting with potential investors. One target Mr. Vaughan suggested, Vitamin Research Products, looked perfect. The premium-priced vitamin supplements it manufactured and sold through mail and telephone orders had a good reputation. Its nationwide customer base could be easily served from North Dakota. It had 23 employees, a reasonable number for Mott to absorb; assuming a few moved with the company, the rest of the jobs could be filled locally. It had begun to make healthy profits while in Chapter 11.
And although the company had cut costs by moving from San Jose, Calif., to Carson City, Nev., it had expenses in its new home that could be slashed further by moving to Mott. For example, instead of paying $72,000 a year in rent, says Mr. Vaughan, it could buy an entire building for $8,500.
Mr. Vaughan also introduced Dakota Management to Jeffrey Chauncey, a Los Angeles-based entrepreneur whose futon assembly and retail company, Chauncey Enterprises, had recently emerged from Chapter 11 and was looking for capital to expand. Through Mr. Chauncey, Dakota also met Bill Warne, whose Warne Fiber Company, in Littlefield, Tex., was Mr. Chauncey's main supplier of mattresses. Mr. Vaughan proposed bringing Vitamin Research to Mott, a branch of Chauncey's company to Hettinger, and part of Mr. Warne's business to Elgin (a town 30 miles east of Mott), painting an alluring picture of how management and administrative costs could be shared among them.
The strategy might have had a better chance if Mr. Vaughan's knowledge of Vitamin Research had not come from his own troubled past with the company. Hired in 1991 to help reorganize it, he had been promoted to chief financial officer and president before being fired by Robert Watson Jr., the owner and chief executive, in February 1993.
The company sued Mr. Vaughan, charging in the complaint that, among other things, he had lied about his credentials and background in order to get hired in 1991, had wired company funds into personal accounts and had put on company expenses trips with other employees to Nevada brothels.
Mr. Vaughan has filed a countersuit, denying the charges and claiming he had been fired because Mr. Watson was trying to back out of an agreement to give Mr. Vaughan half-ownership of the company.
 
Signs of Trouble
 Mr. Vaughan had warned the North Dakotan lawyers about the dispute early on, but he had not been pressed for details. He had more disturbing news for them last January, shortly before his trip to North Dakota, when he was arrested and charged with fraudulently using another William J. Vaughan's Social Security number to get a $28,000 loan to buy a used Cadillac Seville. After the charges were reduced to a misdemeanor in February, Mr. Vaughan accepted a guilty finding, paid $600 in fines and administrative expenses, and began serving a year's probation.
Mr. Vaughan's would-be partners accepted his explanation that the Social Security Administration had issued him the second number by mistake after he reported his card lost. And he was able to point out that no payments were missed and the car was returned in good condition to the dealership once it told him the financing had been blocked.
There was more bad news in March, when Vitamin Research won a partial summary judgment in its case against Mr. Vaughan for $17,604.38. Mr. Vaughan filed a personal bankruptcy petition, later withdrawn. Among his creditors is the Internal Revenue Service, which wants nearly $43,000 in taxes it said he failed to pay from 1989 to 1992.
These and other red flags raised by Mr. Watson and his lawyer were not enough to send Mr. Crane and Mr. Secrest running the other way. Mr. Crane did check criminal records and talk to Nevada law enforcement officials. But he did not contact the people on Mr. Vaughan's resume or any Vitamin Research employee. "I wasn't anxious to look for reasons to discredit the guy," Mr. Crane acknowledges.
"The thing that mattered to me was who controlled the money," says Mr. Secrest. "And we never let ourselves get into a position where he did."
Most importantly, perhaps, everything Mr. Vaughan said about the soundness of Vitamin Research checked out when a Hettinger accountant was sent out on two separate auditing trips.
"We were tickled to find someone who appeared to be knowledgeable and Vitamin Research looked so promising that it overrode the negative stuff," says Mr. Crane.
 
Plunging Ahead
 Burying any misgivings, the two lawyers took the Californian on as a partner, giving him a 50 percent stake in Dakota Management rather than paying him upfront for his work. They also made him president of the West River Nutrition Corporation, a company set up to buy Vitamin Research, thus ending whatever chance there might have been for working out a friendly deal with the company. Two other companies were also formed: one to bring Mr. Chauncey's futon group to Hettinger; the other, Mr. Warne's to Elgin. By last summer, Dakota Management was ready to begin selling stock in the three ventures. Both Mr. Vaughan and Mr. Chauncey made trips to the region in advance of the offerings and, in October, Mr. Vaughan moved his wife and two young children to Hettinger.
That same month, The Adams County Record, Hettinger's weekly newspaper, discovered court records of the dispute between Mr. Vaughan and Vitamin Research. That led The Record to contact Mr. Watson, who arranged for it to receive a flood of negative information. The accusations it could confirm were published this past fall, raising public doubts about Mr. Vaughan's character and business record. Those doubts grew when Mr. Vaughan, needing money, abruptly moved back to California to seek consulting work.
In late November, with the stock offerings dead in the water, Dakota Management decided to return the more than $50,000 it had collected. The partners also decided they would focus on winning an auction the bankruptcy court overseeing Vitamin Research had set up to determine who could offer the most to the company's creditors. Dakota Management quickly won approval from the state to issue promisory notes, allowing it to borrow up to $450,000 from local investors.
Mott residents, some annoyed by the negative coverage in the Hettinger paper that many viewed as motivated by rivalry between the two towns, put their faith in Mr. Crane's continued support and Mr. Vaughan's explanations of his problems. Many were also impressed that Mr. Vaughan had worked on the project without being paid.
"Vaughan's never asked us for one cent," said Claude Heidt, a shoe store owner. Mr. Heidt and others also felt that Mott needed to move faster than Hettinger, which sits on a Burlington Northern rail line, is home to a regional medical clinic with 12 doctors, and has a healthier range of businesses as well as 700 more residents than Mott.
"If I don't invest this money now," Mr. Heidt maintained, "I'd have to invest it in five years to move." He lent $100,000, the compensation his young daughter received for a car accident that has left her an invalid. With support from several other residents and the Commercial Bank of Mott, Dakota raised $450,000.
On Dec. 19, Mr. Watson and his backers, who could have anticipated how much Dakota raised by reading the public prospectus, won the auction by bidding just over $455,000.
 
The Aftermath
 Two weeks before the auction, Mr. Crane described himself as "mentally, spiritually, psychologically and physically at the end of my reserves." Today, he still believes in Dakota's original strategy but is not ready to go after another company.
"I need to straighten my business out and spend some time with my wife and kids," says Mr. Crane. Dakota Management's first goal, he says, should be returning the money raised for Vitamin Research and paying debts. He is hoping Mr. Watson will drop the lawsuit filed against Dakota and its partners for allegedly interfering in its efforts to raise money for the December auction.
The less flappable Mr. Secrest has written off the past year's experience as a "shakedown cruise." He says he is now leery of working with Mr. Vaughan, who blames him for not bringing more money to the auction.
"I don't think Vaughan is a con man," Mr. Secrest says. "If he was out to con us, he never would have pursued Vitamin Research so hard. He knew that he had enemies there who would do everything conceivable to blow him out of the saddle. My problem with him is that he is a control freak."
Mr. Vaughan is looking forward to Sept. 11, the date set for the trial of his claims against Vitamin Research. Meanwhile, he acknowledges he wants more control over Dakota's acquisition tactics. He continues to talk about investment opportunities, including some arrangement with Mr. Chauncey.
Mr. Chauncey, though, describes negotiations as "pretty well stalled." The flaw in the North Dakotans' efforts to date, he says, is that they were unable to raise equity investment funds for inventories, provide tax and rent relief, or offer moving subsidies that would make a setting up in North Dakota worthwhile. "You can't relocate on borrowed money," he says. "That just adds to debt."
Everyone agrees the stakes are too high to give up easily on Dakota Management's original vision. "Everything that happened was something I didn't expect," says Mr. Crane. "If nothing ever comes of it, it will be truly devastating."

HEADLINE: Tax Deductions for College

 BODY:
President Clinton decided shortly after election to cast aside his campaign pledge to cut taxes on middle-class families for the more pressing purpose of controlling the deficit. He has paid dearly for that act of fiscal prudence. The Republicans seized the political low ground by promising all but the richest 1 percent of families a $500-per-child tax cut. The promise energized their campaign -- even though the spending cuts required to offset the tax cuts would punish the poor and most middle-class families as well.
The President had little choice but to respond in kind. To his credit, he struggled to make the best of a bad idea. His tax cut encourages something the economy desperately needs: a better-educated work force. Mr. Clinton proposes a tax deduction for most families of up to $10,000 per year to cover the cost of post-secondary education. The idea is to stimulate the type of investment that lies at the core of his economic platform. It is easy to poke holes in the plan. But at least the President put a constructive goal before the public. 
 Mr. Clinton's tax-cut plan was driven by the need to rebuild his political popularity. His advisers would not otherwise propose tax deductions to encourage college enrollment. Deductions are poorly targeted -- providing twice as much savings to a family earning $100,000 a year (tax bracket above 30 percent) as to one earning $30,000 a year (tax bracket of 15 percent). The lion's share of the tax cut will go to relatively well-off families that would gladly pay tuition for their children whether Washington stepped in or not. There is also the threat that colleges will find ways to exploit Congress's generosity and raise tuition by offsetting amounts.
A better way to boost college enrollment would be to direct aid to needy families. Congress already pays for grants and subsidized loans that go primarily to families earning less than $25,000 a year. But a fiscally strapped Congress has let the value of the Pell grants slide by about 15 percent since 1980 while college tuitions were rising by about 50 percent. Sadly, if Congress passes the President's tax-cut plan, let alone the larger tax cut proposed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, it will almost surely cut back spending on Pell grants and other targeted financial aid.
For all its flaws, Mr. Clinton's plan would still do some good. Prof. Thomas Kane of Harvard estimates that the tax deduction could raise post-secondary enrollment by between 120,000 and 360,000 students. That would not be a huge boost to the 12 million already enrolled, but it would mean that many fewer Americans were facing bleak futures. Studies show that each additional year of post-secondary education adds between 6 and 12 percent to average annual income. But many families cannot afford, nor even borrow, the money needed to pay for higher education or vocational training. The nation faces far larger costs if these individuals fall into lives of poverty or criminality.
The President's plan is not the most effective way to boost enrollment of needy students. Mr. Kane estimates that the money the Treasury would lose from the tax deduction could be used to double the money spent on Pell grants. Such a policy would concentrate Federal aid on families that truly need help.
That is economically sensible, but, alas, politically difficult. The game between the White House and Capitol Hill requires each to wave benefits before the maximum number of voters -- no matter how much the waste, no matter how complete the illusion.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Throw a Bit? Hit a Little? Majors Want You

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
On the one hand, the fellow showed ingenuity; on the other, he showed how desperate major league clubs are to find replacement players for their replacement season.
The fellow was the Philadelphia Phillies' employee that Andy McGaffigan had called to invite to play in his golf tournament in Lakeland, Fla., a tournament that would benefit the baseball team at his alma mater, Florida Southern College. 
 "He said, 'Can you throw?' I said, 'Yeah, I can throw,' " McGaffigan said, recounting the telephone conversation. "I didn't know what he meant at first. He said again, 'Can you throw?' Then I understood. I said, 'Yes, but I'm not going to.' He said, 'We're looking for guys, guys who have had time in the big leagues, guys on the bubble the last few years. We're looking to fill rosters.' "
And did McGaffigan, a former major league pitcher, enroll for the cause?
"I said I just couldn't do it," he related. "I said my coming in as a player would only prolong the process, hurt the Players Association and in the long run hurt my reputation among my peers. Any short-term gain I would receive monetarily, I'd have a tough time looking my teammates and opponents in the eye. I'm just not that kind of guy."
Dan Gladden and Von Hayes told clubs they aren't that kind of guy either. The two outfielders and McGaffigan are typical of the players that clubs are seeking in their determination to show striking players they can play without them and make the strikers nervous enough that they'll be lured back to work, at least when the season starts or shortly thereafter.
Gladden, Hayes and McGaffigan all rejected the propositioning. Others have, too. Some probably have accepted or will accept, but they will most likely remain quiet about their plans. Gladden, Hayes and McGaffigan didn't exactly advertise their experiences, but word spread from people they did tell.
McGaffigan, 38 years old, last pitched in 1991, appearing in four games for the Kansas City Royals. Hayes, 36, last played in 1992, his career effectively ending when the California Angels released him that August. He was in the Milwaukee Brewers' minor league camp last spring but went home voluntarily. Gladden, 37, has not retired. He played in Japan last year after spending two seasons in Detroit.
"Those guys haven't played," Gladden said, speaking of Hayes and McGaffigan but not belittling them, just the clubs' recruitment efforts. "They've been out of the game. At least I played last year. If a guy's not good enough to play in the big leagues but he's going to be playing in the big leagues, that's fraud. You can't pull that on the fans."
With a need for 32 players for each of the 28 clubs, or a total of 896, clubs are scouring the lists of retired and released players and six-year minor league free agents. Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said the clubs "are committed to playing the 1995 season and will do so with the best players willing to play."
That's not exactly the way George Steinbrenner did it in the 1970's and early 1980's when he put together "the best team money can buy." Instead of having Steinbrenner woo Reggie Jackson with dinner at "21," the owners are sending their general managers after players they think can be bought with a cup of coffee at a diner.
The general managers hate the idea of finding and using replacement players just as they hate the implemented salary cap, but they also hate the strike.
The ones who called Gladden are the ones he contacted upon his return from Japan, seeking a way back to the major leagues. That is, he wanted to return to the majors but not this way.
"I didn't feel I was a replacement-type-caliber player," Gladden said. "I thought I was better than that. I thought I was a major league player. If you're not going to put major league players back on the field, don't call me. I feel I'm good enough to play on your major league team. If you don't think so, don't call me."
Gladden recalled the National Football League's use of replacement players during a players' strike in 1987 and the schism that strategy caused within the union. He related it to the baseball owners' current efforts.
"They think it'll be like the football players: get a couple of big- name guys crossing the line and everybody else will scamper," he said. "If anybody knows about the history of baseball, we're a different athlete. We're more of a tight-knit fraternity than the football players. We're completely different than that."
Hayes said the Royals called him and asked if he wanted to be a replacement player. He reminded them that he had retired because he had tendinitis in his right wrist, but he added that he wouldn't become a strikebreaker even if he had a healthy wrist.
"I was a strong backer of the union when I was playing and I have no intention of going against their cause now that I'm retired," he said. "They said, 'Well, we appreciate your honesty, thank you very much and good luck.' "
But when Hayes was playing in McGaffigan's golf tournament last Friday, he encountered the manager of another club.
"As soon as I saw Jim Fregosi," Hayes related, "he said, 'Here comes my center fielder.' "
Hayes no more will be in center field for the Philadelphia Phillies April 3 than McGaffigan will be on the pitching mound for them.
"It seems like an incredibly bad idea, especially from a former player's standpoint," McGaffigan said of the notion of being a replacement player. "Look at the position he would be in. This strike will be settled. When it is, the chances of that individual who walked across the line sticking with the club will be incredibly small. The ill will that will be developed because of that action for a short-term monetary gain is just not worth it."
Last week, McGaffigan took his story to the players' meeting the union held in Tampa as one of a series of eight regional meetings.
"All the striking players know they're not striking for themselves," he said. "They're striking for everyone who played this game and will play it. I shared exactly that thought at the meeting. I said I have to let you know that if I were to take that $115,000, that would fit real nicely into my budget, but it's not worth it to me. I know what happened in 1976, '72, '81. Guys went to the mat for me so I could earn what I earned. Maybe this is my turn."
The Phillies' employee who extended a replacement invitation when McGaffigan called with a golf invitation did not disagree with his old friend.
"I probably wouldn't do it either," the former pitcher quoted him as saying.
 
 
Orioles May Sit It Out
 In reacting to the executive council's approval of guidelines for the recruitment and use of replacement players, Peter Angelos has adopted a mild stance. "I've just glanced at them," the Baltimore Orioles' owner said yesterday. "I've got a couple guys reviewing it. We're in the process of formulating a position."
But people familiar with Angelos's thinking said he has no intention of changing his stated position against the use of replacement players. In other words, short of a legal move by Major League Baseball to force the faux Orioles onto the field at Camden Yards, there will be no Baltimore team in the standings come April.
Angelos, those people said, believes that use of a replacement team would present Orioles fans with an inferior product, cause long-term damage to their confidence in the team and jeopardize their economic support of the Orioles.
It's not very likely that baseball officials, beginning with Selig, would quietly let Angelos stick to his position. That introduces the possibility of a lawsuit among b owners that would rival the labor, legal and Congressional skirmishes between the owners and the players.
Angelos was one of three owners who voted against implementation at the owners' meeting in Chicago Dec. 15. What hasn't surfaced, though, is his position on a vote to extend for five years the agreement that permits Selig to serve in the role of acting commissioner.
According to a person who attended the meeting, the renewal was the first order of business at the meeting. The renewal was necessary because the agreement was due to expire Jan. 5. The vote figured to be a mere formality, but Angelos tossed a few nails onto the road when he called for a roll call.
Selig, the person said, asked Angelos what he wanted to say. Angelos replied that he didn't want to say anything. "My vote will say it all," he was quoted as saying. The vote was 27-1 for the renewal. Angelos was apparently opposed to it because he believes that Selig's presence in the role creates a conflict of interest. Selig owns a team, the Milwaukee Brewers, and as a result, Angelos thinks that Selig's interests, especially in the labor dispute, are contrary to the interest of the Orioles and other high-revenue clubs.
 
 
New Decade for Minoso?
 The replacement-player idea is perfect for the Chicago White Sox. Under two different commissioners, Fay Vincent and Bud Selig, the White Sox failed to gain permission for Minnie Minoso to play a game in the 1990's so he could extend his streak to having played in the major leagues in six successive decades. He began his career with nine games in 1949, and after he retired in 1964 the White Sox brought him back for three games in 1976 and two in 1980.
Considering some of the other players that clubs have pursued, Selig couldn't very well object to the use of the 72-year-old Minoso.
 
Another Loss for the Owners
 In his newly announced decision on damages for jobs lost as the result of the owners' collusion against free agents in the 1980's, Thomas Roberts, the arbitrator, thought the clubs treated Rod Carew so badly he granted the seven-time American League batting champion even more money than the Players Association recommended.
Roberts awarded Carew $575,000 for 1986 instead of the recommended $525,000. He also gave Carew credit for a year of major league service.
Citing a total disinterest shown in Carew by clubs after the 1985 season, Roberts noted that Carew never played baseball again and wrote, "The Players Association has identified Carew as a target victim of the collusion scheme so enthusiastically embraced by the California Angels. The greater shame attached to that contractually prohibited conduct as it impacted Carew and his career was the denial of an opportunity to properly exit baseball."
 
Some Miscast Votes
 Maybe Mike Krukow, Chris Speier and Jim Sundberg each had a particularly close friend among the baseball writers who vote for the Hall of Fame, but that is no rationale for anyone writing their names on the ballot. Each received one vote in the election that sent Mike Schmidt into the hall.
But if their careers warranted even one vote, the careers of Thurman Munson, Ron Guidry and Graig Nettles, responsible for much of the Yankees' success in the early Steinbrenner years, should have gained greater Hall-of-Fame sanction than 30, 25 and 28 votes, respectively.
In a strict, conscientious vote, Munson and Guidry would be found to have glittered too briefly and Nettles would be guilty of having undermined his 390 home runs and 1,314 runs batted in with a .248 batting average. But they had legitimately outstanding careers worthy of note.
Perhaps the most grievous vote, though, was that given Jim Rice -- 137 out of 460 for a man who never understood what Reggie Jackson tried to teach him about off-the-field courtesy to reporters trying to do their jobs but who was an on-the-field Hall-of-Famer.
