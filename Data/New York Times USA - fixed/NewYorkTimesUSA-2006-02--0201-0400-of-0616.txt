HEADLINE: Iraq Utilities Are Falling Short of Prewar Performance 

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Virtually every measure of the performance of Iraq's oil, electricity, water and sewerage sectors has fallen below preinvasion values even though $16 billion of American taxpayer money has already been disbursed in the Iraq reconstruction program, several government witnesses said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Wednesday. 
 Of seven measures of public services performance presented at the committee hearing by the inspector general's office, only one was above preinvasion values. 
Those that had slumped below those values were electrical generation capacity, hours of power available in a day in Baghdad, oil and heating oil production and the numbers of Iraqis with drinkable water and sewage service. 
 Only the hours of power available to Iraqis outside Baghdad had increased over prewar values. 
 In addition, two of the witnesses said they believed that an earlier estimate by the World Bank that $56 billion would be needed for rebuilding over the next several years was too low. 
 At the same time, as Iraq's oil exports plummet and the country remains saddled with tens of billions of dollars of debt, it is unclear where that money will come from, said one of the witnesses, Joseph A. Christoff, director of international affairs and trade at the Government Accountability Office.
 And those may not be the most serious problems facing Iraq's pipelines, storage tanks, power lines, electrical switching stations and other structures, said Stuart W. Bowen Jr., the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, an independent office.
 In one sense, focusing on the plummeting performance numbers ''misses the point,'' Mr. Bowen said. The real question, he said, is whether the Iraqi security forces will ever be able to protect the infrastructure from insurgent attack. 
 ''What's happened is that an incessant, an insidious insurgency has repeatedly attacked the key infrastructure targets, reducing outputs,'' Mr. Bowen said. He added that some of the performance numbers had fluctuated above prewar values in the past, only to fall again under the pressure of insurgent attacks and other factors. 
 The chairman of the committee, Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, began by billing the session as a way of deciphering how much of America's original ambitions in the rebuilding program are likely to be fulfilled with the amount of money that Iraq, the United States Congress and international donors are still prepared to spend on the task.
 This downsizing of expectations was striking given that $30 billion American taxpayer money has already been dedicated to the task, according to an analysis by Mr. Christoff of the accountability office. Of that money, $23 billion has already been obligated to specific rebuilding contracts, and $16 billion of that amount has been disbursed, Mr. Christoff said.
 Mr. Bowen's office has pointed out that another $40 billion in Iraqi oil money and seized assets of Saddam Hussein's regime was also made available for reconstruction and other tasks at one time or another. Last week, Robert J. Stein Jr., one of four former United States government officials in Iraq who have been arrested in a bribery and kickback scheme involving that money, pleaded guilty to federal charges.
 Mr. Bowen pointed out in his testimony that the news on reconstruction in Iraq is not all bad. Despite the recent financing and performance shortfalls, the rebuilding program now seems to be much less ridden by fraud, corruption and chaos than it was in the early days when people like Mr. Stein were in charge.
 James R. Kunder, assistant administrator for Asia and the Near East at the United States Agency for International Development, in the State Department, emphasized things like what he called a 30 percent ''potential increase'' in electricity output because of new and reconditioned power generators in Iraq.
 ''We have done a lot of reconstruction work in Iraq over the last couple of years,'' Mr. Kunder said. ''We did not meet all of the goals, the ambitious goals, we originally intended,'' he conceded.
 Mr. Christoff of the accounting office said the latest numbers may actually overstate how well Iraqis have been served by the reconstruction program.
 Water numbers, for example, often focus on how much drinkable water is generated at central plants, he said. But he said 65 percent of that water was subject to leaking from porous distribution pipes, which often run next to sewage facilities.
 ''So we really don't know how many households get potable, drinkable water,'' Mr. Christoff said.
 Mr. Christoff also brought another new figure to the hearing: he said that on a recent trip to Baghdad, the American forces there had told him that they would need another $3.9 billion to continue training and equipping Iraqi forces, in part so that they can better protect the infrastructure.
 The money would presumably be included in a 2006 supplemental funding request in which the Bush administration has said it would ask for more money to support the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, an official at the Office of Management and Budget said. The administration ''told us it would include this type of expenses,'' the official said, adding that no total for Iraqi security forces has yet come directly from the White House.
 If the $3.9 billion that the American forces believe they need is actually appropriated, it would bring the total amount spent simply on training and equipping the Iraqi Army and the police to about $15 billion.

HEADLINE: Storm Victims Face Big Delay To Get Trailers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ERIC LIPTON; Jennifer Steinhauer reported from Slidell, La., and Eric Lipton from Washington.

DATELINE: SLIDELL, La., Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Nearly six months after two hurricanes ripped apart communities across the Gulf Coast, tens of thousands of residents remain without trailers promised by the federal government for use as temporary shelter while they rebuild. 
 Of the 135,000 requests for trailers that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has received from families, slightly more than half have been filled. The delays have left families holed up with relatives or stranded out of state, stalled local economies and infuriated state and local officials, who criticize how the program has been managed. Further, officials and residents complain about problems with quality, like poor plumbing and electrical shorts, with the trailers they have received.
 ''The trailer problem is an individual human tragedy,'' said Reinhard J. Dearing, the chief administrative officer of Slidell, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. Several city officials, including police officers, are still without trailers or just received them this week, and have been sleeping with friends or neighbors, and in one case, under a desk in a government office.
 On Monday, frustrated by the delays, four members of the St. Bernard Parish Council performed what they called a symbolic act, taking three trailers from a local stockpile of about 275 and delivering them to residents. 
 ''If this happened with any other business, you would find another purveyor,'' said Councilman Mark Madary, who represents a parish where 6,000 families are waiting for trailers and about 2,000 have received them. 
 The problems in administering the $4 billion trailer program mirror those of other major recovery efforts undertaken since the hurricanes crippled the region, and appear to be a result of failures at all levels of government. Local officials, contractors and residents say that some of the delays seem to stem from the federal government's poor planning and its frustrating layers of subcontractors and bureaucracy.
 For example, trailers are often sent to two different holding areas before they are distributed, and sit collecting dust while families wait. 
 ''It is so disheartening to see people living in houses with water pouring through the roof,'' said James M. McGehee, the mayor of Bogalusa, a small Louisiana city near the Mississippi border. Across the state line, Mr. McGehee said, are ''acres and acres'' of trailers in holding areas. 
 For its part, FEMA criticized local governments for rejecting trailer sites in neighborhoods and engaging in protracted negotiations about where the trailers should go. Agency officials also said that private companies, including electric utilities, had contributed to the problem by being slow to provide services. 
 ''Everything from parishes not willing to accept trailers at all, to local rules and ordinances that we don't have authority to override, or the delay in getting power hook-ups, all impact the pace of getting trailers on the ground and occupied,'' said Nicol Andrews, a FEMA spokeswoman in Washington. ''The supply of trailers is not the issue; we have plenty of trailers.''
 FEMA, Ms. Andrews said, has about 19,000 trailers and mobile homes in staging areas, ready to go, but is waiting for Louisiana officials to decide where to put them.
 Federal and local officials say the vast scope of this disaster has rendered all tasks Herculean.
 ''I'm not going to make excuses, but this has been an unprecedented event, and we have never, never in the history of FEMA ever had to house this many people,'' R. David Paulison, the acting FEMA director, said in Washington last week. ''So there are glitches along the way.''
 The trailer problem is most acute in Louisiana, where 60 percent of the 90,000 requests for manufactured housing have not been met. Of the 21,000 requests in Orleans Parish alone, only about 3,000 have been filled. By comparison, in Mississippi, federal officials say that of about 40,000 such requests, 34,560 have been met. FEMA officials in Louisiana say that at the rate they are going -- installing about 500 units a day -- it will most likely be an additional 100 days before they are close to reaching their goal.
 Residents who long to rebuild are impatient. Here in Slidell, where more than half the 10,000 homes are uninhabitable, Daryl Cleworth stood in his gutted house Monday afternoon, fiddling with some tools that seemed almost toylike compared with their task, and wondered when his several dozen calls to FEMA would result in a trailer. 
 ''We'll take anything,'' said Mr. Cleworth, who is living with his wife and baby in New Orleans while his three older children stay with his mother in Colorado. ''Just something to sleep in.''
 In the weeks after Hurricane Katrina blew through the Gulf Coast, FEMA signed contracts to buy about $2.5 billion in travel trailers and mobile homes from manufacturers and dealers across the country, in what was the single largest order in the history of the industry.
 With all of these pieces in place, FEMA officials predicted in September that they would soon be able to install perhaps as many as 30,000 housing units every two weeks, a goal the agency has never even approached.
 Already, the work completed so far is greater than any previous similar effort by FEMA. But the reality of the task along the Gulf Coast has proved far more complicated than FEMA officials expected.
 The goal from the start, particularly in Louisiana, was to find wide-open swaths of land where group sites, which have become known as FEMAvilles, could be set up. That was crucial because a large share of the homeless in Louisiana were renters who did not have their own property where FEMA could place a trailer. Even if they did, whole sections of New Orleans were still considered uninhabitable.
 The contractors sent teams of surveyors to identify possible sites for these new trailer communities. But as they began to negotiate the permits required, local authorities and landowners, one after another, started to turn them down.
 ''There is a very strong message: not in my backyard,'' said Mark Misczak, who oversees the temporary housing effort for FEMA in Louisiana.
 Ronnie Hughes, the president of Ascension Parish south of Baton Rouge, where officials had considered a group site, said the parish instead decided to ban them.
 ''We are the fastest-growing parish in Louisiana prior to the hurricanes,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''We don't have the infrastructure in place to support these cities.''
 To date, fewer than 5,000 of the 36,675 units of manufactured housing occupied in Louisiana are in group sites.
 Carl Goss, a subcontractor hired to install FEMA trailers, said he could install six a day but often installed only two, because the paperwork was wrong 65 percent of the time. The documents sometimes call for a unit that does not fit on the lot, Mr. Goss said. ''I'm real upset because I can't help people,'' he said.
 Elected officials said they understood the complications. But FEMA, they added, has too many excuses. 
 ''If you needed a classic example of how to make every mistake humanly possible and then throw more mistakes on top of that, that is what you have with this trailer program,'' said Representative Gene Taylor, Democrat of Mississippi, a vocal critic of the program who lost his home in Bay St. Louis to Hurricane Katrina.
 With the cumulative costs of buying, installing and maintaining these units reaching $70,000 or more, and the months it is taking to finish the effort, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, among others, says she wonders why FEMA put so much emphasis on manufactured housing in the first place.
 ''It's faster to fix apartment units that have gone down,'' Ms. Blanco told a Senate committee last week. In fact, FEMA is now renovating an apartment complex in New Orleans, which Ms. Andrews, the agency spokeswoman, said was an acknowledgment of the inability to get enough trailers into the city.
 Shirley Harris, a 73-year-old Slidell resident, continues to live in a ramshackle house that was severely damaged by the storm. Ms. Harris said that FEMA had told her it could not install a trailer because she had electrical wires still hanging in front of her house. But looking across the street at a house with identical hanging wires and two FEMA trailers in the yard, she feels at a loss. 
 ''I'd like to give up,'' she said, beginning to cry. ''I just want to get away. But there is nowhere to go.''

HEADLINE: Jurassic Pork 

BYLINE: By Kori Schake. 
Kori Schake, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor at West Point, was director of defense strategy and requirements at the National Security Council from 2002 to 2005.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
THE military budget for the 2007 fiscal year clocks in at $439.3 billion. And that doesn't include the $120 billion that reflects the real cost of the war. We have a behemoth defense budget that inadequately addresses the top national security threats. 
 In the wake of 9/11, it made sense to let defense spending mushroom to deal with new threats without cutting existing programs. But having worked on defense strategy and resources in the Pentagon and the National Security Council over the last decade, I'm now convinced that was a mistake. 
Increasing the Department of Defense's budget 35 percent since 2001 prevented it from making hard trade-offs between what it prefers to do (continue existing weapons systems) and what the nation most needs (an agile force that can quickly defend us against terrorists). 
 The Pentagon's budget is larger than the next 18 defense budgets in the world. Of course, it's not surprising that the United States has the highest defense spending by a substantial margin, but the magnitude relative to potential enemies suggests we are not achieving our objectives in a cost-effective way.
 The exchange ratio between what it costs, say, Al Qaeda to mount a terrorist attack and what we are spending to prevent or respond to them is not a hopeful prospect for our country in a long war. The central challenge for hegemonic powers is to avoid being stretched too thin by either taking on too many obligations or supporting them in an unsustainable way. In the 1950's, President Dwight D. Eisenhower justified his arbitrary cap on defense spending by saying that military force could freeze the confrontation while our real strengths of ideology and economy won the cold war. 
 The Defense Department's recently completed Quadrennial Defense Review, which had been billed as an outline for transforming post-9/11 military budgets, supports spending programs that look almost exactly like Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's blueprint from August 2001, minus cuts to the size of the Army. 
 When President Bush came into office, he had a bold agenda for reform that would use technology and innovation to keep our forces compact and out of harm's way by using precision weapons that allowed them to move faster than an enemy's ability to react. The president promised to accept risk where we are strongest and to make investments in other areas like better pay and benefits to service members, spending $20 billion more on research and development and committing 20 percent of procurement to ''leap-ahead'' technology. 
 Sadly, the administration has fallen short on some of these promises. The Pentagon has not replaced existing programs or skipped a generation of technology. Mr. Rumsfeld has cancelled only two major programs: the Crusader self-propelled artillery and the Comanche helicopter. He has kept the F-22 fighter aircraft, which is designed to combat threats that no longer exist, and is proceeding with a self-propelled cannon system, a direct replacement to the Crusader. 
 And the Pentagon has not allocated anywhere near 20 percent of the procurement budget for new programs. The three newest programs, two of which were under way before 2001, are unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed sealift and the Future Combat System, a network of 18 weapons and vehicles for about 45,000 soldiers. The 2007 fiscal year budget provides less than $5 billion for these programs. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld disparages his opponents as industrial age dinosaurs. Yet this is precisely the approach of this latest defense budget: it continues programs and practices that have been made obsolete by technology, innovation and field experience. 
 It is difficult to cut military spending when the country is at war. But it's important to remember that cuts to the defense budget will allow us to adapt to the challenges of American security in the age of terrorism.

HEADLINE: In Weld's Bid, G.O.P. Risks Losing Conservative Allies

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
It is the greatest threat to New York Republicans in the race for governor this year: The state Conservative Party is increasingly opposed to the Republicans' favored candidate, William F. Weld, and is willing to run a candidate of its own. That move could split the right and hand the race to the Democrats, leaders in both parties say.
 With the Conservatives preparing to meet in Albany for an annual conclave on Monday, their chairman, Michael Long, said that more party committeemen were moving away from Mr. Weld every day because of his support for abortion rights and gay rights and his past praise for gay marriage. 
''It's a severe uphill battle for Weld to get our support, to be fair about it,'' Mr. Long said in an interview yesterday. ''The Republicans may nominate Weld, but he has very little support in our party. We want a candidate with our values, not just someone who can win. 
 ''If Republicans nominate Weld, we could see a very divided Republican-Conservative vote in November.''
 Since its founding in 1962 to fight liberal Rockefeller Republicans, the Conservative Party has been a stubborn thorn and sometime partner for the Republicans, who are far more dominant, with 3.1 million registered voters to the Conservatives' 155,000. No Republican has won a statewide election without a Conservative endorsement since 1974, and those votes could be crucial this fall if the face-off is against the formidable leading Democratic candidate, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
 Mr. Weld said he believed his fiscal record -- particularly, cutting taxes 19 times as governor of Massachusetts -- would ultimately win over Conservatives.
 '' 'High wall' is how Mike put it to me,'' Mr. Weld said of Mr. Long's assessment of his chances. ''I hear Conservatives saying the economic issues are predominant to social issues. If that were true I'd be running away with this. But I'm going to see the Conservatives Monday and play straight baseball and hope for the best.''
 Some Republicans believe the Conservatives will ultimately cut a deal to support Mr. Weld. But Conservative leaders say they are ready to lose with their own horse and settle for a consolation prize: winning enough votes to regain their cherished third position on the ballot, which they had lost to the Independence Party. Vote totals for each party decide the order on the ballot.
 ''There are a lot of Conservatives who would rather show some guts and go with a guy who really shares our values, and at least win the third position, rather than go with Weld,'' said Ralph Lorigo, the influential Conservative leader in Erie County. ''The Republicans need to realize, our ideals matter to us.''
 Mr. Weld's three Republican rivals, meanwhile, have begun battling for the Conservative endorsement. Each is trying to become the anti-Weld, following the news that Tom Golisano, a popular upstate Republican, will not run.
 One of those rivals, John Faso, came under a surprise attack this week by a Conservative ally of another candidate, Assemblyman Patrick Manning, over his work as a registered lobbyist in 2005. Also this week, Mr. Manning and the third rival to Mr. Weld, Randy A. Daniels, won new endorsements from Conservative and Republican leaders and stepped up their overtures to others by professing their loyalty to the Second Amendment, lower taxes and Ronald Reagan.
 Mr. Weld, who was also a former United States Justice Department official in the 1980's, tried to outflank his rivals on Tuesday in a speech upstate, where he praised his ''old boss,'' Mr. Reagan, and described himself as ''a supply-sider.''
 Conservatives often note how their party provided the margin of victory for George E. Pataki when he unseated Mario M. Cuomo in 1994, with their ballot line giving Mr. Pataki more than 300,000 votes. In the election before that, in 1990, the Conservatives ran their own candidate, Herbert London (who endorsed Mr. Weld on Monday); the Republican candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, suffered a crushing defeat. Mr. Weld's opponents are mindful of that history. 
 ''If the Conservatives run their own candidate, the Republican is doomed on Election Day, pure and simple,'' said Mr. Daniels, who was until recently secretary of state under Governor Pataki, who is leaving office this year after winning three terms as a Republican-Conservative candidate.
 ''What you're seeing now are other candidates who are desperate for the Conservative nod, who are trying to explain away the past or reinvent themselves,'' Mr. Daniels argued. He was referring to Mr. Weld, who now says he opposes gay marriage, and Mr. Faso, who is trying to shrug off the lobbyist label.
 In essence, the Conservative Party is playing a game of chicken with the Republicans, in hopes of foisting its preferred candidate, probably Mr. Faso, on them instead of Mr. Weld.
 This is the strategy: The Conservatives are threatening to select their own nominee before the Republicans designate one at their convention in May. Mr. Faso, a former assemblyman who was the Republican-Conservative nominee for comptroller in 2002, has a strong edge right now among the 350 committeemen, Mr. Long said. If Conservatives pick Mr. Faso, the Republicans could face a choice of going with Mr. Faso or eventually losing the general election in a Weld-Faso split.
 All four Republican candidates have told Mr. Long that, if endorsed, they will run on the Conservative ballot line even if they do not get the Republican line as well. Mr. Faso, in an interview, said he knew he could not win on the Conservative line only but did not expect it to come to that.
 ''I think most Republican Party officials know they can't win without Conservative support,'' said Mr. Faso, whose opposition to abortion rights and pledges to cut taxes and state spending has won him Conservative allies.
 The state Republican Party chairman, Stephen J. Minarik III, who is supporting Mr. Weld, acknowledged there were ''risks'' for both parties if they nominated different candidates. The Conservatives might have a hard time winning at least 50,000 votes, the number required to stay on the ballot in the next election. And the Republicans, of course, might lose.
 ''I hope it doesn't come to a split, believe me,'' Mr. Minarik said.

HEADLINE: 6 Lower Manhattan Public Spaces to Bloom With Post-9/11 Funds 

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Governors are often given to enthusiasm and grand thoughts, but yesterday afternoon heaps of enthusiasm and really grand thoughts were required to envision the glorious future of the no-name, rubble-strewn lot that is bounded by Canal, Varick and Laight Streets in Lower Manhattan.
 ''I see a park with a lot of green,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said as he gazed at the wire-fenced wasteland before him. ''There will be trees.'' He envisioned a fountain. And flower beds. ''No more chicken-wire fences.'' 
Mr. Pataki stopped at the park on the eve of an announcement expected today by the 16-member board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to authorize the spending of $19.5 million to enhance six parks and public spaces in Lower Manhattan, including the triangular Canal Street plot with its frozen weeds. 
 The renovations will be managed and monitored by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The money will be dispensed from the nearly depleted $2.8 billion in Lower Manhattan redevelopment grants from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 So far, the development corporation has spent $30 million on other parks and open spaces in Lower Manhattan, with an additional $70 million earmarked for the Hudson River Park, and $150 million for improvements at the East River waterfront.
 Officials have faced criticism in recent months for either being slow to use post-9/11 reconstruction money, or not using it to rebuild the area immediately around ground zero. But the aid came with a wide mandate -- to reinvigorate Lower Manhattan -- and the use of the some of the money for downtown parks has been relatively uncontroversial. 
 The park visit, during one of the governor's inspection tours of Lower Manhattan, was led by Mr. Pataki's habitual guide, John P. Cahill, who oversees downtown redevelopment as the governor's chief of staff. 
 During the trip, Governor Pataki examined the pace of progress at many sites, including the nascent Goldman Sachs building and the Fulton Street Transit Center. And Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, briefed the governor during a walk past complex construction at ground zero that Mr. Ringler termed ''a giant 3-D chess game.'' 
 The five other parks that will benefit from the funds are the Collect Pond Park, at Leonard Street between Centre and Lafayette Streets; Sara D. Roosevelt Park at Hester Street between Chrystie and Forsyth Streets; James Madison Plaza, bordered by St. James Place, Madison and Pearl Streets; the Allen and Pike Street malls; and Washington Market Park, bordered by Chambers, Greenwich and West Streets. 
 Planned improvements are as varied as the parks' locations. The triangular lot that is James Madison Plaza is to become a garden-like sitting area for office workers and local residents. Sara D. Roosevelt Park, a derelict spot, is to house a modern playground. 
 The Collect Pond Park will be expanded to receive benches, drinking fountains and other amenities. Washington Market Park is to have a new year-round, vandal-resistant public restroom. And the Pike and Allen Street malls -- 15 center plots along Allen and Pike Streets -- will be reconstructed with plantings, benches and trees. 
 Since the terrorist attack, the development corporation has contributed to the refurbishment of 16 parks and other public spaces. At the Canal Street park site, Mr. Cahill told the governor that one planned name was Renaissance Park. 
 ''Well,'' Mr. Pataki said, surveying the devastated expanse under a steely sky, ''it looks as though it should not have that name right now.''

HEADLINE: Undercover Agent in Real Fur Snares a Fake Veterinarian

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
The place was New York City. Crime was the dish of the day, and the main course was injury to an animal with a side of petty larceny. The victim was Burt. Burt was a Boston terrier. He was about to find a friend who looked more like a foe. 
 The case unraveled over six months, with an indictment this week. The details spilled from court documents and interviews with investigators and Burt's owner, Raymond Reid.
For four years, Burt had been under the care of Steven Vassall, 28, an unemployed lab technician who styled himself a licensed veterinarian. Mr. Vassall gave Burt vaccinations and heartworm treatments and sometimes boarded him. Mr. Reid liked Mr. Vassall. Mr. Vassall made house calls.
 Mr. Reid left for vacation in August, but he got an urgent call from Mr. Vassall. Burt was in a bad way. Burt had swallowed a foreign object. Burt was going to die.
 Mr. Reid came home and said he wanted to see Burt. Mr. Vassall let Burt out of the car and drove away. Burt had an open wound along his abdomen, and he was licking the blood.
 Mr. Vassall sent Mr. Reid a bill for $985. Mr. Reid called the Brooklyn district attorney.
 The district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, put his top investigators on the case. Rackets Division. Senior people. A sting was arranged. An apartment was wired. But this mousetrap was all spring and no cheese.
 Carol Moran was working a steady 9 to 5 in the district attorney's office. She had 22 years on the job. For this case, she was going to need a sidekick. That's where Fred came in.
 Fred was the strong, silent type with no place to come in out of the rain. He was an alley cat from the streets of Brooklyn, long and lean with thick black stripes. Ms. Moran took a shine to him right away. She adopted him from Animal Care and Control.
 Fred never asked to be a hero, but he needed work. And neutering. Mr. Vassall agreed to end Fred's sex life for $135. Last Friday, he picked up Fred and the payment. Fred was in a carrying case. The payment was in cash.
 Mr. Vassall was charged with unauthorized veterinary practice, criminal mischief, injuring animals and petty larceny. He was free on bail but could not be reached; his phone was disconnected. His lawyer, Royce Russell, declined to comment.
 The victim was stitched up. The hero wore a badge to meet the news media. His big green eyes looked past a dozen TV cameras. A dozen camera operators made kissy noises. 
 A tabloid reporter asked the district attorney a tabloid question.
 ''This is the first, Nance,'' Mr. Hynes said. ''First undercover cat.''
 Then Fred took a nap in the corner. Tomorrow was another day. His owner said neutering was still in the works.

HEADLINE: Rosier Technology Outlook Fuels Broad Market Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks gained yesterday after a sales forecast from Cisco Systems suggested that the profit outlook for technology companies might be improving.
 Falling oil prices, as well as advances in PepsiCo and Pfizer, helped support the market's rise. PepsiCo said fourth-quarter sales beat analysts' estimates and Pfizer announced that it might sell or spin off its consumer health unit.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 108.86 points, or 1 percent, to 10,858.62, its biggest gain since Jan. 3. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 10.87 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,265.65, the best advance since Jan. 6. Technology shares accounted for a third of the S.& P. 500's rally. The Nasdaq composite index, which gets 44 percent of its value from computer-related shares, climbed 22.02 points, or 1 percent, to 2,266.98. 
 Cisco, the world's largest maker of networking equipment, was up $1.31, or 7.2 percent, at $19.40, for its biggest gain since January 2004. Cisco said third-quarter sales would increase 10 percent to 12 percent. The company reported second-quarter earnings, excluding stock option expenses, of 26 cents a share, beating the 25-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson.
 PMC-Sierra, which makes chips for communications switches and routers, added 73 cents, to $10.78.Dell, the world's largest maker of personal computers, added $1.83, to $31.52. The company was raised to outperform from market perform at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. An analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, said the company could increase revenue at 10 percent to 12 percent and earnings per share at 13 percent to 15 percent for the next several years.
 Hewlett-Packard, one of the largest makers of computer data storage products, rallied $1.64, or 5.4 percent, to $32.01, for the biggest gain on the Dow average. The company is scheduled to report earnings next week.
 PepsiCo, the soft-drink maker, advanced 42 cents, to $57.28. The company reported the biggest sales gain in four years on demand for Frito-Lay snacks in the United States and for soft drinks overseas. Fourth-quarter sales jumped 15 percent, to $10.1 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $9.57 billion, according to Thomson.
 Two potential sales, including one of Pfizer's consumer health unit, supported the rally. Pfizer added $1.43, to close at $26.37. The drug maker said it might sell or spin off its consumer health unit, the second-biggest in the world with $3.88 billion in sales last year. Pfizer said it would provide more details at an investor meeting Friday.
 Univision Communications., the No. 1 Spanish-language network in the United States, rose $3.66, or 12 percent, to $34.20 for the best performance on the S.& P. 500. The company confirmed yesterday that it was putting itself up for sale.
 Through yesterday, 66 percent of the 374 S.& P. 500 companies that have reported results beat analysts' estimates, according to a Bloomberg analysis of Thomson Financial data. That compares with 59 percent on average since 1994.
 As traders prepared for tomorrow's 30-year bond auction, prices of United States Treasury securities fell after the former Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, suggested that the economy was strong enough to withstand additional rate increases.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 99 10/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.59 percent, from 4.57 percent on Tuesday. Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Hamas Tells Abbas Not to Act on His Own

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
A senior Hamas leader warned the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Wednesday not to revamp the Palestinian Authority or make cabinet appointments without Hamas's approval. The Hamas leader, Khaled Meshal, spoke at a news conference in Cairo, where he and other exiled Hamas officials have been conferring with Hamas leaders from Gaza and the West Bank. After sweeping the Palestinian parliamentary elections two weeks ago, Hamas is preparing to put together the new government, though Mr. Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, will remain president of the Palestinian Authority.
 It is not clear how this relationship will work -- or if it will work -- given the sharp political differences between Mr. Abbas, a moderate who leads the Fatah faction, and Hamas, the radical Islamic militant group. But Mr. Meshal said Mr. Abbas should not try to reshape Palestinian institutions without first consulting with Hamas. 
''This is a message to Abu Mazen and other brothers in the authority to stop issuing decrees and decisions,'' Mr. Meshal said, according to The Associated Press.
 ''We will not deal with them as legitimate,'' he added, though he did not cite specific examples.
 Mr. Abbas met with Hamas leaders in Gaza City on Saturday, and relations appeared to be cordial. But things are likely to become much more complicated starting next week, when the Palestinian parliament convenes on Feb. 16 to start work on the new government.
 Among the many differences to be settled is the control of the security forces and the use of violence. Mr. Meshal promised Wednesday that his group would not lay down its weapons when it took over the government. ''Hamas will rule and continue resistance, and the people will see how we can reconcile resistance and the exercise of power,'' he said. 
 According to Palestinian media sources cited by The Associated Press, Mr. Meshal spoke after reports that Mr. Abbas was prepared to appoint a close aide as deputy commissioner of the security forces.
 Mr. Abbas opposes attacks against Israel and says he wants to pursue peace talks. He has called on Hamas to honor all existing agreements between the authority and Israel.
 Hamas has staged the deadliest attacks against Israel, though it has largely abided by a truce for the last year. Mr. Abbas and the new government will both have responsibility for the security forces, but how those powers will be divided is unknown. 
 In Washington, King Abdullah II of Jordan told President Bush to be cautious about cutting off aid to the Palestinian Authority, even if a Hamas-led government takes power, Jordanian officials said.
 Together, the United States, Europe and wealthy Arab countries supply more than $1 billion to the authority. They have agreed to keep supplying money at least until a Hamas-led government takes power, but the United States and the major European nations say such aid will not be possible if Hamas does not change its ways. 
 By that, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice emphasized again Wednesday, they mean that a Hamas-led government would have to recognize Israel's legitimacy, dismantle extremist groups and renounce violence if it wanted to count on international economic aid. 
 After a meeting with Ms. Rice, Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, said Israel would release to the Palestinian Authority the $50 million in Palestinian taxes and customs duties it collects monthly, but only for the current month, adding that the transfer will be illegal once Hamas takes over the government. 
 ''We will judge the situation on a monthly basis in the future,'' she said.
 In the Gaza Strip, where violence has been on the increase in recent days, Israeli troops shot and killed two armed Palestinians and wounded a third before dawn on Wednesday as they neared the Karni crossing with Israel, Palestinian medical workers said. Reuters reported that the Israeli military said the men were suspected of trying to plant a bomb. 
 Karni is the spot where goods go in and out of Gaza. Israel had closed the crossing for three weeks, but reopened it on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Earmarked Men

BYLINE: By Jeff Flake. 
Jeff Flake is a Republican representative from Arizona.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
BACK on the F-Bar Ranch, when I was too young to load the chute, de-horn, vaccinate, hold a hot iron or otherwise make myself useful as my father and older brothers branded calves, I would spend my time collecting ''earmarks'' -- V-shaped pieces of a calf's left ear detached with two swift strokes of a pocketknife. I would stack these earmarks on the fence surrounding the corral as an unofficial tally of our progress.
 Well, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Here I am in Congress, again being asked to collect earmarks. Sorry. I've had enough of that. 
Earmarking -- in which members of Congress secure federal dollars for pork-barrel projects by covertly attaching them to huge spending bills -- has become the currency of corruption in Congress. It is not just the rising number of earmarks (more than 15,000 last year -- up from around 1,200 a decade ago), or the dollar amount ($27 billion) that is troubling. More disturbing is that earmarks are used as inducements to get members to sign on to large spending measures. (The disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff was astute when he referred to the House Appropriations Committee as an ''earmark favor factory.'') 
 It is no coincidence that the growth of earmarks has paralleled the monstrous increase in overall federal spending. And President Bush's new $2.77 trillion budget will only set off another frenzy. 
 When I was first elected, I had visions of participating in the great debates of our time: How can we give the federal government the tools it needs to identify and root out our enemies while maintaining a free society? What tax and trade policies lend themselves to survival and prosperity in a global economy? How do we assert our influence abroad in a manner that enhances our security?
 It is not that these policy debates haven't occurred during my time in Congress. They have. But they are diminishing.
 In Congress these days, you establish your priorities by getting money for them. When the carefully designed process of authorization, appropriation and oversight is adhered to, these policies and priorities are given a thorough vetting. But earmarking circumvents that cycle: the Appropriations Committee ensures that earmarks escape scrutiny by inserting them into conference reports, largely written behind closed doors. 
 By the time appropriation bills reach the House or Senate floor, passage by a lopsided margin is virtually assured because every member who got earmarks is obligated to vote for the entire bill. Further, the scope of debate is substantially narrowed, with even partisan arguments that would otherwise occur hushed as Republicans and Democrats find common cause: protecting their pork. 
 Earmarks are also making it increasingly difficult for Congress to oversee federal agencies. It's hypocritical for us to criticize the Defense Department for not providing body armor when we earmark growing portions of its budget for items like a genomics research project at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan.
 Solving the earmark problem will require transparency -- a requirement that earmarks be included in the actual text of legislation (where they can be seen and challenged) rather than hidden in committee and conference reports. I've introduced such legislation in the House and my Arizona Republican colleague John McCain has introduced companion legislation in the Senate. Debate on these measures should begin as soon as possible.
 During my last few years on the F-Bar we stopped earmarking our calves altogether. We concluded that a brand on the left side was sufficient, and that the earmark simply marred an otherwise healthy critter. Here's hoping we reach the same conclusion in Congress.

HEADLINE: Rell Calls for End to Car Tax, but Also for Repeal of a Tax Credit 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Flush with a $500 million surplus and facing a November election, Gov. M. Jodi Rell on Wednesday proposed almost $300 million in tax cuts on automobiles, utility bills, estates and corporations. She also promised to create jobs by reorganizing economic development efforts and creating a commuter rail service that would run north-south through the center of the state.
 Addressing the General Assembly for the annual State of the State speech to open the legislative session, Mrs. Rell, a Republican, said she would set aside most of the surplus, about $335 million, to be used in the event of an economic downturn. Revenue lost to the tax cuts would be offset through savings in other areas. 
The measures are part of her proposed adjustments to the budget for the 2007 fiscal year that begins on July 1, the second year of the state's two-year budget plan, which was passed last spring. She would spend $16.05 billion, almost $114 million more than the original plan.
 By far the most surprising proposal, and one Mrs. Rell had asked her staff to keep secret until Wednesday, was the repeal of an annual tax on automobiles assessed by local governments and widely criticized as inconsistent from town to town. The measure caught many lawmakers off guard and was met with a standing ovation in the House chamber.
 To help pay for it, Mrs. Rell, whose job approval ratings have consistently been above 70 percent in opinion polls, would take what might seem like a political risk: repealing a property tax credit of up to $350 claimed by homeowners in a state where high property taxes are a common complaint. But the governor's aides said the vast majority of people, particularly renters and those in families with two or more cars, would fare better with the repeal of the car tax.
 Annual car taxes range widely depending on a town's local tax rate, from more than $607 on a 2005 Ford Explorer in Plymouth to $246 for the same vehicle in Kent, according to data the governor's office provided. 
 Mrs. Rell said the repeal of the tax would provide ''direct property tax relief with money actually put in the wallets of taxpayers.''
 The governor, who spoke for 29 minutes to an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature, repeatedly cast her proposals as ways to benefit working families and stimulate business. ''Let there be no doubt,'' Mrs. Rell said, ''our core mission this session is a straightforward one and a critical one. It is to stimulate growth, retain good jobs, create new and even better jobs.''
 Two Democrats seeking their party's nomination to challenge her on Nov. 7, Mayors John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven and Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford, were in the audience. Both criticized her speech as a calculated election-year address that offered few real solutions on issues like rising health care costs and job growth. 
 ''It's not going to win votes from parents and children who can't afford health insurance, I can tell you that,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''It's not going to win votes from anyone who's serious about restructuring this state'' to nurture the economy.
 Mr. DeStefano said: ''There's nothing in this speech that spoke of strong leadership to grow jobs. Instead what we got was a cynical shell game on property taxes, to take out of one pocket and put into another pocket.''
 Democratic legislative leaders also noted the absence of major health care proposals, but they expressed more measured skepticism on repealing the car tax.
 ''It seems to be a very popular election-year proposal, but we have to find out, is it real?'' said Donald E. Williams Jr., the Senate president pro tem. ''We want real property tax reform. We would welcome the governor to that debate.''
 Repealing the car tax would eliminate $497 million that the state's 169 cities and towns receive. To offset that loss to the communities, the governor would shift to them $436 million that the state receives each year from slot-machine revenues at the state's two Indian casinos and cover the rest with general tax revenue. 
 The state would offset its own loss of the casino revenues in part by repealing the $350 property tax credit, a move that would save the state about $325 million. Mrs. Rell said the rest would come through savings.
 Transportation was another major theme. Adopting a proposal that has been popular among transportation planners for years, Mrs. Rell called for spending $344 million in state money to start a new commuter rail service along an existing Amtrak route from New Haven to Springfield, Mass. She would link it by bus to Bradley International Airport near Hartford and build a ''busway'' from New Britain to Hartford. The program would also use about $300 million in federal money.
 The governor also proposed phasing out a tax on the transfer of estates of $2 million or more. The tax was imposed just last May as the state faced a deficit of $1.2 billion and was crucial to her budget compromise with Democrats.
 In a nod to the increasing costs of electricity, which have gone up by more than 22 percent for most residents this year, Mrs. Rell proposed a 25 percent cut in the public utilities tax that appears on utility bills. The current residential tax rate on gas is 4 percent, 6.8 on electricity. Commercial rates are 5 percent for gas and 8.5 for electricity.
 Mrs. Rell also proposed creating a 10-member Department of Energy, which she said would ''develop a statewide energy policy, promote energy efficiency and new technologies, and participate in the rate proceedings.''
 Calling the state's efforts to lure businesses ''a maze of economic development procedures, programs and policies,'' Mrs. Rell said she would hire a central development director to be based in her office. She would also streamline at least four agencies and create a new Department of Business and Employment that would operate ''with a new command focus.''
 Mrs. Rell would also provide tax incentives to employers that create new jobs, and she would end a 15 percent surcharge on corporate taxes in 2007 that she approved last year.

(Photo by Douglas Healey/Associated Press)Chart: ''Connecticut Car Tax Realignment''Gov. M. Jodi Rell introduced a series of proposed tax cuts yesterday, including a repeal of the annual property tax on cars. Here is what she had to say.''For those who wonder if this proposal is fair, let me give you a few eye-opening examples:If you are a Bridgeport resident who owns a 2003 four-door Taurus, you pay $309 in property taxes. In New Canaan, the same car carries a tax of $103 a year. Is that fair? No.If you are a Norwich resident with a 2002 four-door Toyota Camry, your annual tax bill is $292. In Lyme, the annual tax bill is less than half: $138.One last example: A taxpayer in Greenwich pays $273 in property taxes for a 2005 four-door Mercedes-Benz sedan. A Waterbury taxpayer pays $278 in property taxes for a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier.''(Source by Office of the Governor)

HEADLINE: Housekeeper to the Stars Admits Stealing From Her Least Favorites

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Robert De Niro's ex-housekeeper, tears rolling down her cheeks, admitted in a Manhattan courtroom yesterday that she had stolen a $95,500 pair of diamond-drop earrings belonging to his wife, Grace Hightower.
 The housekeeper, Lucyna Turyk-Wawrynowicz, 35, also admitted to forging the signature of a previous employer, Denise Menton, who owned a Greenwich Village clothing boutique, on more than $3,000 in credit card slips for lingerie and other fancy goods at Barneys New York.
The case cast an unusual light on the often emotionally fraught relationship between wealthy and even not-so-wealthy New Yorkers and their household help, usually housekeepers and nannies. For many professional women, such household help is a necessity. Yet it can also be, as in this case, a minefield of social pathology. 
 Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz appeared in court in handcuffs yesterday, her complexion splotchy and her platinum blond hair looking stringy, after six months in a Rikers Island jail cell.
 Later, prosecutors and a police detective, Richard Kenney, said she was a serial kleptomaniac who stole from her unwitting employers. 
 Beginning around 1999, prosecutors said, Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz worked for a string of wealthy, often famous women -- including Faith Popcorn, Renee Rockefeller, Isabella Rossellini and Candice Bergen -- and stole from some, though not all, of them. 
 Ms. Menton said in a telephone interview that she believed that the housekeeper had used the same sterling reference, whom Ms. Menton declined to name, over and over again. 
 The latest thefts came to light last June, after Ms. Hightower reported the diamond earrings missing from her Central Park West apartment.
 The housekeeper, prosecutors said, seemed motivated to steal by a poisonous stew of jealousy, anger and class consciousness, and saw herself as a kind of Robin Hood taking from the rich to feed the poor -- that is, herself.
 ''If she treated me better, with more respect, I probably wouldn't have done this,'' a police report quoted Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz as saying of Ms. Hightower on June 20, 2005, as she was riding in a car with detectives, heading toward her home in Maspeth, Queens. ''I didn't steal from Isabella Rossellini, because she treated me well. I only stole from people who didn't treat me with respect.''
 That statement angered Ms. Menton, who said she had treated Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz with kid gloves, even after catching her red-handed in 2001, when the housekeeper charged the items at Barneys.
 Ms. Menton said that $1,000 -- cash receipts from her boutique, Betwixt -- had disappeared from her purse on Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz's first day of work. But Ms. Menton brushed away her suspicions, she said, unable to believe that someone would be so brazen as to steal on her very first day.
 ''Then she took an emerald necklace, but when I asked her about it, it sort of miraculously reappeared on a chair I never sit in,'' Ms. Menton said.
 When Ms. Menton got the credit card bill from Barneys, she knew something was wrong, and called the store to complain. The store, she said, found security photographs of Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz at the cash register, and Ms. Menton, armed with that information, escorted the housekeeper to the station house, where they met with police officers. Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz cried, she said, and ''I didn't press charges because I felt sympathetic towards her.'' Instead, she fired her, after just a month of work, and said she thought that the shock of being caught would prevent her from stealing again. Ms. Menton, for one, said, she no longer felt sorry for Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz, who faces deportation to her native Poland after serving a promised jail sentence of one to three years.
 ''Too bad for her,'' Ms. Menton said. ''But if she wasn't a thief it wouldn't have happened.''
 Mr. DeNiro's publicist, Stan Rosenfield, said, ''I think the plea by the defendant speaks volumes.''
 As part of her deal with prosecutors, Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court to three counts -- grand larceny, forgery and identity theft, for using a false Social Security number. 
 Her lawyer, Mark T. Zawisny, said that with six months' credit for time served, she will probably serve four to six months of her jail sentence. She will then be turned over to the Department of Homeland Security, which her lawyer said has agreed to let her return to Poland voluntarily with her husband, as long as she pays her own way.
 A one-way ticket is just $305 on LOT Polish Airlines from Newark, economy class, of course.

HEADLINE: Applications to Law Schools Are Declining

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Has law school lost its appeal?
 Last year, for the first time since the 1997-98 admission cycle, the number of applicants to law school declined, by 4.6 percent, and so far this year, the number has declined by 9.5 percent.
With falling numbers even among the top schools, admissions officers and career counselors say they are not sure what is causing the drop. They suggested that in an improving economy, college students may prefer jobs to law school, or that rising undergraduate debt loads have discouraged some students from borrowing still more to pay for a law degree. 
 It may be that a surge in popularity a few years ago has, perversely, led to the current decline in interest in law schools, said David E. Kelley, creator and producer of the television show ''Boston Legal'' and himself a lawyer. ''The more lawyers there are, the more people are out there to encourage others not to go to law school,'' Mr. Kelley said. 
 He added: ''I personally still have a very glamorous view of the law. But maybe that's because I'm out of it, and I get to write about what I would like the practice of law to be.''
 At Columbia, 8,020 would-be lawyers applied to start law school last fall, compared with 8,355 a year earlier. At New York University School of Law, the number fell to 7,872 from 8,220. At Stanford, the numbers fell to 4,863 from 5,040. At Harvard Law School, the numbers fell to 7,127 from 7,386.
 At Yale Law School, however, there were just five fewer applicants last year, a drop to 3,778, from 3,783. 
 ''You've got to expect those cycles to happen, whether that's tied to the latest hit TV show'' or some other factor, said Marshall Tracht, vice dean at Hofstra University School of Law, which has seen a slight decline. 
 ''There are some people who go to law school because they don't know what else to do,'' Mr. Tracht said, ''and there are a lot of other people who are really committed to going to law school because of what they want to accomplish with their lives.''
 The drop may also be a correction to numbers that had soared a few years ago, Mr. Tracht and several law school admissions officers said. In the 2003-4 admission cycle, the number of applicants hit 100,600, according to the Law School Admission Council. The biggest increase occurred in the 2001-2 admission cycle, in the wake of the dot-com bust. 
 The number of applicants -- 95,800 in the 2004-5 admission cycle -- is still far greater than it was 10 years ago, when about 75,000 people applied. At this point in the current admission cycle, the numbers have fallen to 60,397 from more than 66,000 at this time last year.
 James Calvi, a professor at West Texas A&M University and chairman of the Prelaw Advisors National Council, said fewer people may be applying to law school because more are applying to medical school. 
 ''That is the running joke among prelaw advisers,'' he said. ''There might be a grain of truth, if applications to medical school are up.'' 
 Medical school applications rose in 2005, to 37,364 from 35,735 the previous year, according to data collected by the Association of American Medical Colleges. 
 The Graduate Management Admission Council, which administers the entrance examination for business schools, does not gather data on applications directly, but it reports that in the past three years, more than half of two-year M.B.A. programs had declines in applicants. 
 Ursula Olender, associate director of career services at Dartmouth College, said that students are ''borrowing more money for undergraduate school, and law school is certainly quite expensive.'' 
 She added: ''Before you take on that kind of debt, it's going to be really important that that's what you want to do.'' 
 James Langerud, an associate dean at Grinnell College, said some students might go to law school later. 
 ''When times are good, and there are other things to do for a few years, I think they do'' those other things, he said, ''and then they go.''

HEADLINE: Back at Campaign Site, Bush Sells Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush returned to this city where he campaigned for the Republican nomination six years ago on a platform of tax cutting and fiscal restraint, arguing that the budget that he sent to Congress on Monday fulfilled that promise. 
 In an appearance at a hotel that is usually the site of political events during the New Hampshire primaries, Mr. Bush said he had no intention of giving up his insistence on revamping the Social Security system, a proposal that sank in Congress last year, and he argued that he was fixing the Medicare system, not eroding it.
''This isn't a cut,'' he said of his plan to cut $36 billion over five years out of the Medicare program by changing the formulas that govern its growth. ''People call it a cut in Medicare. That's not a cut. It's slowing down the rate of growth. It's the difference between slowing your car down to go the speed limit, or putting your car in reverse.''
 The result, he argued, would be that saving from productivity or efficiency ought to be given ''to the taxpayers, not to the hospitals.'' 
 Mr. Bush was supposed to come here on Tuesday, to develop some political momentum for his budget, but he delayed the visit by a day so he could deliver a eulogy for Coretta Scott King at her funeral in Georgia.
 He found an enthusiastic audience in the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, a state that prides itself on its distaste for taxes and that contrasts itself on that issue with its neighbor Massachusetts.
 Mr. Bush began his speech by saying that he was determined that the American economy would not look like that of Europe, with its centralization of power and high rates of taxation. 
 He argued that the tax cuts put in place after he became president had spurred economic growth and increased government revenues this year, proof of the supply-side economic theory. ''The reason why is that cutting taxes caused the economy to grow,'' Mr. Bush said, using the folksy tone that he usually reserves for campaign-style events. 
 Carrying the argument further, he said that his cuts in taxes on capital gains and dividends were directly linked to a rise in the stock market. 
 ''There's a correlation between cutting taxes on dividends and capital gains and increase in the market, and increase in individual net worth,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Parts of the speech were reminiscent of Mr. Bush's campaigns, in which New Hampshire has been the site of only mixed political success. He lost the Republican primary here in 2000 before going on to win the party's presidential nomination, and he took the state in the 2000 general election. In 2004, he lost New Hampshire in the general election to Senator John Kerry. 
 He treated some sensitive issues here delicately, starting with this year's record budget deficit. Mr. Bush restated his pledge to cut the deficit in half by 2009, the year he leaves office. He did not mention the rise in the deficit this fiscal year, a phenomenon his aides have said is chiefly a product of Hurricane Katrina and unexpected costs in Iraq.

HEADLINE: What Should the Democrats Do?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I am mystified by the media's repeated depiction of the Democrats as an idea-less, inept political party. 
In fact, minimal research reveals a party that has long promoted a specific and progressive agenda, rich with creative policy thinking on every subject -- from the war, the economy and the environment to Social Security and health care reform. 
 Now, before the crucial midterm election campaign has even begun, your front page trumpets Democratic remorse over ''missed opportunities.'' Worse yet, the Republican-promoted myths that some party leaders are angry (Hillary Rodham Clinton) and others ''flawed messengers'' (Howard Dean, John Kerry, Al Gore) are presented as if they were fact.
 I am waiting to read a front-page headline and article that state that Republicans may have to struggle to overcome both their own weak record and a strong Democratic platform in the 2006 midterm elections.

Broadway

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)

'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Beginning Tuesday, Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodovar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street; (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman)

'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

* 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)

* 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)

* 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates)

'A BITTER TASTE' When an academic gets too close to one of his case studies, his mistake haunts him in this twisty, acid drama about repression, friendship and the intersection between sex and power (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman)

'ELLIOT, A SOLDIER'S FUGUE' True to its title, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue'' is composed like a fugue, with several narrative strands playing in point and counterpoint around one theme: a soldier's experience of war. The play, by Quiara Alegria Hudes, traces the legacy of war through three generations of a Puerto Rican family, and without invoking current politics, manages to indict the war in Iraq (1:10). 45 Below at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban)

'GIRL IN HEAT' Nelson Avidon's predictable dramedy about Joseph, a randy lawyer, and Marilyn, a flirtatious office temp, is salvaged to some extent by the play's two performers. As their characters reveal themselves uneasily, Mr. Avidon and Cheryl Leibert make the struggle believable (1:20). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens)

'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

* 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444. (Hoban)

* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

* 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'BURIED CHILD' Sam Shepard's dark and sometimes funny portrait of a dysfunctional Midwestern family doesn't translate successfully into the bright colors of Norman Rockwell Americana. The director, Cyndy A. Marion, and her White Horse Theater Company did much better a year ago with a production of another Shepard play about family, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' which was full of mystery and emotion (2:40). The American Theater of Actors, Sargent Theater, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Stevens)

'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden)

'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)

* 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'CACHE (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)

* 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)

'COWBOY DEL AMOR' (No rating, 86 minutes, in English and Spanish) For 16 years, Ivan Thompson, a self-styled 'Cowboy Cupid,' has been supporting himself by helping disenchanted American men meet hopeful Mexican women. Directed by Michele Ohayon with an attentive ear for the regressive attitudes beneath the humor, ''Cowboy Del Amor'' is a slyly insightful portrait of conflicting expectations in the search for the perfect partner. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden)

'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee)

'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott)

'A GOOD WOMAN' (R, 93 minutes) This loose adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1892 comedy, ''Lady Windermere's Fan,'' moves it out of the drawing room, and out of England to the Italian Riviera in 1930, casting as its leads two American actors (Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson) who have no feel for Wilde's high-toned repartee: fatal mistakes all. (Holden)

* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)

* 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)

'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee)

'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)

'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis)

* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)

'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis)

* 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden)

* 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)

'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)

'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)

* 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)

'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden)

* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)

'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee)

'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture cliches. (Scott)

* 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)

'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School in Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Catsoulis)

'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)

'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned uber-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis)

'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)

(Gates)

FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Sunday) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. The series ends this weekend with five films, including Stephen Frears's 1985 comic drama, ''My Beautiful Laundrette,'' selected by Gene Seymour, about two young men who go into business together and fall in love; and Roko Belic's ''Genghis Blues'' (1999), selected by Lisa Schwarzbaum, a documentary about a blind American blues musician who teaches himself throat-singing. 36-01 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

OLETA ADAMS (Tuesday) The comfort and uplift of gospel music infuse Oleta Adams's secular and kindly songs. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

BISHOP ALLEN (Tonight) The indie pop outfit Bishop Allen is in the spotlight lately for its frontman Justin Rice's leading-man turn in Andrew Bujalski's film ''Mutual Appreciation.'' In it he plays to a receptive but sparse Brooklyn crowd. His own band has a slightly larger following. 9:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Laura Sinagra)

LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country resume that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 7:30, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near East Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra)

CELEBRATION (Thursday) Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. This bill also includes Hong Kong and Baby Shakes. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra)

ELECTRIC SIX, SHE WANTS REVENGE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Monday) The Detroit garage rockers Electric Six broke out of the pack by virtue of the singer Dick Valentine's mania on songs like ''Danger! High Voltage.'' The band's new album, ''Senor Smoke,'' is less compelling, but features the timely apocalyptic rumination ''Jimmy Carter.'' She Wants Revenge plays post-punk in the dark Interpol style. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door (both days sold out); Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra)

FEIST, JASON COLLETT, MATES OF STATE (Tonight) The Canadian bohemian Leslie Feist is good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best cabaret-pop songs are quirky jazz numbers; she sounds like a hipper Norah Jones.

(Sinagra)

TOM JONES (Tuesday and Wednesday) The newly knighted Welsh pop singer Sir Tom Jones learned a lot from American blues and soul, and he seems as amused as anyone by his long-established image as a sex symbol.

He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences.

King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)

(Pareles)

BEN TAYLOR , TRISTAN PRETTYMAN (Wednesday) Ben Taylor joined his mother, Carly Simon, onstage this fall, performing, among other things, his father James Taylor's part on the duet ''Mockingbird.''

(Sinagra)

VERONICAS (Tuesday) The twin rockers Lisa and Jess Origiassio, from Brisbane, Australia, perform focus-group-tested radio pop in the Kelly Clarkson vein.

(Sinagra)

WU-TANG CLAN (Tuesday) Before there was G-Unit or the Diplomats, there was the Wu Tang Clan. This Staten Island crew created a secret code that mixed Kung-fu arcana and Five-Percenter cosmology. Its most deliciously unpredictable member, Old Dirty Bastard, is gone, but the group has reconvened for its first tour since 2004, boasting the talents of the thug-turned-comedian Method Man; the master atmospheric producer RZA; the eloquent GZA and Raekwon; and the excitable absurdist Ghostface Killah. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740; $44.

MUSIC FROM JAPAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) A two-day festival presents traditional and contemporary music for the shakuhachi tomorrow, with Akikazu Nakamura as the soloist and Michiyo Yagi playing the 20-string koto, and a showcase of young Japanese composers on Sunday.

NEW YORK COLLEGIUM (Tonight) French baroque is the theme of the day: a concert devoted to the music of Louis-Nicolas Clerambault (1676-1749) includes the cantatas ''Orphee'' and ''Pirame et Thisbe.'' Robert Mealy will lead the group and play violin; Marc Molomot is the vocal soloist. 8, Society for Ethical Culture, Central Park West at 64th Street, (212) 717-9246; $30 to $50. (Midgette)

(Midgette)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Tuesday) In the final week of its Mozart series, the Philharmonic offers the three last symphonies, Nos. 39, 40 and 41. True, it's about as uninventive as programming can be, but Lorin Maazel has proved a surprising Mozart conductor lately, and during the first two weeks of this minifestival, the Philharmonic players have been at their zestiest. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Kozinn)

PACIFICA QUARTET (Sunday) This young ensemble, based at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, gave a memorable performance at Alice Tully Hall in 2004, and last year released a solid, richly played traversal of the Mendelssohn string quartets on the Cedille label. It returns for one of Lincoln Center's early morning concerts, with Mendelssohn's Quartet in E flat and Tchaikovsky's Quartet in D. 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500; $20. (Kozinn)

STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Daniel Barenboim reminds New York that he has an orchestra other than the Chicago Symphony. Conducting Germany's oldest orchestra, which he has led for more than a decade, he celebrates this year's birthday boy, Mozart, with two programs, each with two symphonies and a piano concerto in E-flat. Tomorrow's concerto is for two pianos; joining Mr. Barenboim will be Radu Lupu. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38 to $130. (Midgette)

'VOICES OF LIGHT' (Thursday) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and her execution at the stake. His texts draw on the Bible, Joan's letters, the works of Hildegard of Bingen and other medieval churchwomen, and ''The Vices of Women,'' a 13th-century misogynistic ballad; his music pivots between the medieval world and ours. During a screening of the film, it is to be performed live by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8 p.m., World Financial Center, West Street, South of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn)

Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

* RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday through Feb. 19) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching.

* GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Thursday) Ms. Gibney explores the worlds of finite reality and the unknowable, and she has made a third new world of them in her mysterious, subtle ''unbounded.'' (Through Feb. 19.) 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Dunning)

(Through Feb. 19.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25.(Erika Kinetz)

HEATHER KRAVAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) What promises to be a lively, internationally flavored double bill, with a three-year, long-distance collaboration between Heather Kravas from New York and Antonija Livingstone from Montreal by way of Berlin, and a duet from PO.V.S., a dance collective from Moscow. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12 and $20.

(Dunning)

* THE NETA DANCE COMPANY A.W.A.R.D. SHOW (Sunday) This free monthly performance series organized and produced by the choreographer Neta Pulvermacher began in January and runs until May. It's a great idea -- each event presents work by four emerging or midcareer choreographers, then opens up discussion between the artists and the audience. Later everyone has a drink. Melinda Ring, Pele Bauch, Barbara Duffy and the wonderful Keigwin & Company are on the lineup, and Thomas DeFrantz will moderate the discussion. Call first -- the Joyce SoHo had to turn people away last time. 7 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479 or www.joyce.org. (Sulcas)

NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tomorrow) Choreography by Miro Magloire, the company's director, and Deborah Lohse and Constantine Baecher will be performed by dancers including Deborah Wingert. 8 p.m., City Center Studio 4, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smartix.com; $15; $10 for students with ID. and ages 65+ (Dunning)

NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL 2006 (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) The city's annual celebration of all things Flamenco continues into its second week tomorrow night with the guitarist Vicente Amigo and an ensemble that includes the dancer Rafael Campallo. A gala on Wednesday night lines up some of flamenco's big guns, including the legendary Manolo Marin and Soledad Barrio, often seen in New York with Noche Flamenca. On Thursday, the Nuevo Ballet Espanol shows flamenco in a more contemporary guise -- a slightly doubtful enterprise -- featuring the wonderful Lola Greco. Various locations; for information: (212) 545-7536 or www.worldmusicinstitute.org/wmical/Main.asp (Sulcas)

92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) This 12-year-old festival has a noteworthy lineup over its second week.

In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life'' (Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Feb. 18 at 8 p.m.; Feb. 19 at 2 and 7 p.m.) Ailey Citigroup Theater, Joan Weill Center for Dance, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas)

* STARS OF THE 21ST CENTURY (Monday) Cheesy but usually amusing and sometimes thrilling, these potpourris of dancers from hither and yon, performing to recorded music and offering sometimes challenging choreography but mostly flashy showpieces, are always worth a visit. This year the galaxy, many returning from previous galas, includes Irina Dvorovenko and her husband, Maxim Beloserkovsky, from American Ballet Theater; Sofiane Sylve from the New York City Ballet; Svetlana Lunkina and Sergei Filin from the Bolshoi Ballet; Andrian Fadeyev from the Kirov Ballet; Mathilde Froustey and Emmanuel Thibault from the Paris Opera Ballet; Lucia Lacarra and Cyril Pierre from the Munich Ballet; Pilar Alvarez and Claudio Hoffmann from Tango Metropolis Argentina; and Desmond Richardson from Complexions. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500; $20 to $150.

THE WALDEN COMPANY (Sunday) A new musical, ''All is Full of Love,'' by the choreographer Josh Walden, is based on the narrative of ''On the Town,'' but set to the music of Bjork. The one-time performance (presumably Mr. Walden is hoping for more) partly benefits Dancers Responding to AIDS. 8 p.m., Theater at St. Clements, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101 or TheaterMania.com; $39.90 to $81.50 (includes preshow reception). (Sulcas)

* REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction.

 Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)

* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)

International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

* MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

* MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)

* P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)

* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639(Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

* Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through Feb. 18. (Cotter)

The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter)

Galleries: 57th Street

* Maria Elena Gonzalez This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. Gonzalez encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter)

* 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson)

JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'NOW' As a pendant to the photographer's survey at the Museum of Modern art, this show focuses on images of the land and outbuildings on his upstate farm, with special attention to the seasonal changes and akimbo branches of numerous apple trees. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Feb. 18. (Smith)

Galleries: Chelsea

WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 367-7474, through Feb. 18. (Smith)

Molly Davies This expansive show features major works from three decades by a veteran avant-gardist film and video maker. Ranging from near-abstraction to dreamlike allegory, the video installations of Ms. Davies call to mind artists as various as Gary Hill and Bill Viola. Some involve collaboration with musicians and dancers, and the esteemed poet Anne Carson stars in a sensuous and stately three-screen production from 2002 called ''Desire.'' Zone, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2177, through Feb. 18. (Johnson)

ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson)

Wu Jian'an: 'Daydreams' Trained in the art of paper cutting, this young Chinese artist scissors swirling, wonderfully intricate and fantastic compositions of figures, body parts and animals from single large sheets of white paper. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 414-1169, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

'It's a Beautiful Day' Sweet but with an acid center, this group show includes Mie Yim's smudgy painting of stuffed animals in an overripe landscape; Charlene Liu's pale watercolor vision of wrecked cars in an overgrown valley; Satoru Eguchi's architectural photographs cut into lacy patterns; Margaret Lee's watercolor pictures of rock formations with graffiti carved into them; Saeko Takagi's pastel-colored paintings of wan, blond models; Misaki Kawai's funky, storytelling marine sculptures; and Koji Shimizu's sculpture in the form of climbing equipment for cats. ISE Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1649, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana,: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation ofrecent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

* 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter)

* 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck)

* Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts.

MARIA MAGDALENA CAMPOS-PONS: backyard dreams See this show for the large, gorgeously colored multiphoto works in which drawing, painting and photography merge with intimations of the female, otherness and a distinctly tropical locale. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* 'DAVID HAMMONS: THE UNAUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 81/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: a homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783; closes Sunday.(Cotter)

* Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

CHRISTOPHER MINER: HOW BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN MUST BE In this split-personality debut, the artist mimics a drunken black man in one video, and in another, takes a remorseful, memory-laden tour of his dead grandparents' house. The prevailing impression is of white, male, not necessarily Southern emptiness and disconnection. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676; closes Sunday.

HEADLINE: Inventory Data Hint at Good Sales Outlook

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wholesale inventories increased in December and the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose less than forecast last week, suggesting that companies were gearing up for improving sales. 
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that inventories at wholesalers rose 1 percent, the most since January 2005 and twice as much as a month earlier. Economists had expected a 0.5 percent increase.
Purchases at wholesalers also rose 1 percent in December, the most in three months, reflecting demand for automobiles, computer equipment and costly petroleum products. The inventory-to-sales ratio, or the time goods remained on wholesalers' shelves, held at 1.15 months.
 Wholesale inventories of nondurable goods, lower-price items expected to last less than three years, increased 1.6 percent in December after rising 0.1 percent the month before. Sales were up 0.7 percent, in contrast to a 1.3 percent decline in November. The value of wholesale petroleum sales increased 4.4 percent, the most since September.
 In another report, the Labor Department said that initial jobless claims rose by 4,000 last week, to 277,000. Economists had expected 285,000. The four-week moving average fell to 276,500, the lowest level since April 2000.

HEADLINE: Driving Toward Middle East Nukes in Our S.U.V.'s

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The world stands today at a very dangerous dividing line. It is the dividing line between the post-cold-war world, which we have known since 1989 -- one of expanding democracy and free markets -- and a post-post-cold-war world, which is unknown but almost certain to be a much less stable, prosperous and benign place.
 I believe the questions that will determine whether we enter the post-post-cold-war world will come down to two: how India, China and Russia deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions, and how the West, particularly America, deals with $60-a-barrel oil. 
Let me explain: if Iran develops a nuclear bomb, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and possibly other Sunni Arab states are bound to follow. The Sunni Arabs can overlook Israel's bomb, but they will never stand for the Persian Shiites having a bomb and them not. That's about brothers with a centuries-old rivalry. And if the Arab world starts to go nuclear, then you will see the crumbling of the whole global nuclear nonproliferation regime.
 A world with so many nuclear powers, particularly in its primary oil-producing region, could only be a more dangerous and unstable place, compared with the post-cold-war world. Imagine Iran with $60-a-barrel oil to make all the mischief it wants, and a nuclear weapon to shield it from any retaliation. Indeed, if you want to know what the post-post-cold-war world would sound like, listen to Iran's poisonous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He was quoted in The Guardian of London the other day as saying: ''Our enemies cannot do a damn thing. We do not need you at all. But you are in need of the Iranian nation.''
 I'm convinced that the only countries capable of getting Iran to back down -- through diplomacy -- are China, India and Russia. Europe is too weak, and America has already used every economic sanction it can on Iran. China, India and Russia have been great beneficiaries of the post-cold-war order, and the trade, economic development and exports it has made possible. That order was largely shaped and safeguarded by the United States, with China, India and Russia often getting a free ride. 
 But that order will continue only if China, India and Russia get over their reluctance to get too close to America and become real stakeholders in maintaining this post-cold-war world. 
 I want to share power and responsibility with them -- starting with the three of them, which represent half of humanity, looking Iran in the eye and telling its leadership that they will join in any and all U.N. sanctions if Iran tries to build an A-bomb. That would get Tehran's attention.
 As for America, its leadership task has shifted. If the Bush team continues to let Dick Cheney set its oil policy -- one that will keep America dependent on crude oil -- the post-cold-war democracy movement that was unleashed by the fall of the Berlin Wall will be either aborted, diluted or reversed. If regimes like those in Iran, Venezuela, Syria, Burma, Sudan and Nigeria have the benefit of 10 years of $60-a-barrel oil, whatever democratic tide President Bush thinks he is unleashing will be stymied. The worst regimes in the world will have the most power to support the most regressive political and religious trends. 
 I don't approve of the Danish newspaper cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad. Yes, you can see much worse in the Arab-Muslim press on any day. But why should the West get into that gutter? What I approve of even less are the blatant efforts to intimidate the world media that have printed these cartoons -- an intimidation effort cynically fueled by Iran, Syria and its theocratic allies. What do you think will happen after a few more years of $60-a-barrel oil? You will see a radical arc from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah to Hamas -- all financed by Iran -- intimidating every moderate in the Muslim world. 
 A British official recalled for me that in 1946, the British foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, remarked, ''Give me 100,000 tons of coal and I will give you a foreign policy.'' What he meant was, Give me the energy source to heat the homes and run the businesses of Europe, and I will give you a rebuilt Europe. 
 Well, I say, Give me even $30-a-barrel oil and I will give you an Iranian regime that is a lot less smug -- an Iran that will need to be tied into the world much more in order to create real jobs for its exploding population.
 That's why we need an urgent national effort, starting with a gasoline tax, to move the U.S. economy onto a path of more fuel-efficient cars and renewable energy. If we do it, everyone will follow.
 If we don't, then say hello to the post-post-cold-war world and say goodbye to the post-cold-war world. It was fun while it lasted.

HEADLINE: In Iranian Eyes, the 'Cross-Eyed British' Are to Blame 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
The Embassy of Denmark was attacked and pelted with gasoline bombs two days in a row because of the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper. The Austrian Embassy was stoned and all its windows were smashed for the same reason. The United States has been dubbed the World Oppressor, and Israel has always been at the top of the enemies list.
 But to understand whom Iranians distrust most of all, you need only visit Bobby Sands Street. Named after the Irish republican who died of a hunger strike in 1981, the street runs right past the British Embassy in a busy neighborhood of Tehran. 
A not-too-subtle finger in the eye.
 ''We have not seen anything other than bad things from the British since they stepped foot here 200 years ago,'' said Seyed Razi Abbassian, 72, a dealer in stamps and coins at a shop across from the street from the British Embassy. ''We have no good memories of the British.''
 In an often bitterly divided country, Mr. Abbassian's outlook is one that unites Iranians of many social, economic and political classes. 
 The idea that Britain is behind much of what goes wrong in Iran is not just a conspiracy theory but also a prism through which to view events. Indeed, America -- the Great Satan itself -- is often portrayed as merely a hapless, muscle-bound child manipulated by smarter, craftier, more deceitful forces in London. 
 One European diplomat said he once received a gift from an Iranian child: a drawing of America as a marionette with Britain pulling the strings. 
 ''For 200 years we have had a political relationship with the British,'' said Mansoureh Ettehadie, a history professor and writer. ''They have never been innocent. There is a feeling in Iran that is widespread, that the British have not been blameless.''
 As Ms. Ettehadie intimated, there are sound historical reasons for the Iranians to suspect the British. Early in the 20th century, she said, Britain tussled with France and Russia over control of the country, and Britain's success in the south, and in dominating the rich oil fields, left a bad taste. She said, for example, that for many years, Iran did not even have its own central bank, but had to rely on the Imperial Bank to issue currency.
 And as every Iranian schoolchild knows, it was the British who engineered the coup that brought to power the dictatorial Reza Shah Pahlavi, who founded the hated dynasty that lasted until the Shiite revolution in 1979. 
 Distrust of Britain is so ingrained in the public psyche -- especially among the older generation -- that it has been joked about, written about and even dismissed as paranoia, but never done away with. One of the most popular novels in Iran, ''My Uncle Napoleon,'' is a comic love story spoofing how Iranians see a British hand in all dark deeds.
 The book popularized the phrase, ''This is the job of the cross-eyed British,'' which is often used here with a smile, and a wink. It can be said when bombs go off, or when there is really bad traffic.
 While many Iranians are adept at poking fun at their Brit-fixation, the prevailing view also serves to complicate already tense relations between London and Tehran over such matters as the Iranian nuclear program. One Western diplomat, who asked not to be identified so as not to inflame his host country, said Iranians often raised the specter of ''historical inequities'' with Britain in diplomatic meetings.
 Recently, as the United States and Britain and other European partners pressed for Iran to be referred to the United Nations Security Council for its nuclear activities, Iranian officials accused the British of some recent bombings and deadly plane crashes in Iran.
 In each case, government officials said that Britain was not working alone, but in tandem with Israel and the United States. Nevertheless, Britain was the ringmaster.
 If there is an event that still angers many, it is the coup in 1953 that ousted the prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and reinstalled Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had fled the country. Although the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in ousting Mr. Mossadegh, sentiment here holds that British intelligence pulled the strings.
 ''The British were responsible for ending Mossadegh's rule,'' said Mustafa Jahangard, 26, who runs a fruit and vegetable store in central Tehran. Asked who is disliked more in Iran, the United States or Britain, Mr. Jahangard first drew a distinction between the American people, who ''are good,'' and the American government, which ''is bad.'' No such distinction was made for the British.
 ''The British win in this competition,'' he said. ''England is even worse. They are sneaky.''
 The anger and suspicions are widespread, and widely discussed. On Jan. 31, Resalat, an Iranian daily, ran an article about the bombings in Ahvaz beneath the headline: ''England's Hand in Measures Against Our National Security.''
 ''Britain, the old colonizer, has a hand in all of these criminal measures,'' the article said. ''Another trick of the government of the old colonizer, England, is that whenever its secret intentions -- in conspiring against others -- are somehow revealed, it takes totally friendly positions, that are against America's positions, regarding Iran; and when everything is back to normal, it follows up its previous hostile positions.'' 
 The British Embassy occupies a large compound in Tehran and is tucked back inside, behind a tall brick wall. Reza Razavi said he had run his pen store on a corner, on the other side of the wall, for 12 years, and had never, to his knowledge, had a British customer from the embassy. He said it was easy to believe that the British were up to no good because of recent charges made public by Russia about a British diplomat caught working as a spy -- and of course the Mossadegh affair.
 As for all the negative deeds Iranians attribute to the Americans, he said, ''If you think about it, America was under the British as well.''

HEADLINE: Debate on Abortion Pill in Australia Becomes Personal

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Feb. 9 

 BODY:
The continuing debate here over the so-called abortion pill RU-486 -- the Senate voted Thursday to make it more easily available -- has revealed many of the same fierce emotions as abortion debates do in the United States.
 But it has also produced some moments unfathomable in the United States. 
''I bring to this debate personal experience,'' said Senator Nick Minchin, who opposed the legislation. ''A former girlfriend of mine had an abortion,'' he said Wednesday on the floor of Parliament. Mr. Minchin, 52, is also the country's finance minister, from the conservative governing Liberal Party, but there is no suggestion that he will lose his post, or even his next election. 
 What was perhaps more stunningly personal was the statement on the Senate floor by Senator Lynette Allison, a sponsor of the legislation. 
 ''An estimated one in three women have had an abortion,'' she said. ''And I am one of them.''
 She was 18, and abortion was illegal then, in the 1960's, she said in an interview. She came from a conservative family, ''which would have been ashamed of their daughter having an illegitimate child,'' added Ms. Allison, 59, who was a secondary school teacher before she got into politics. It was not difficult to make the public statement, and she did so out of solidarity with other women, she said.
 ''There are a lot of efforts to shame women who have had a termination,'' Ms. Allison said. ''It was important to send a message to women that they were not alone, that there were people who understood.''
 Abortion here is regulated by the states, and it has generally been legal for 30 years.
 ''It is a decision for a woman and her doctor,'' said Wendy McCarthy, a businesswoman who recently stepped down as chancellor of the University of Canberra and advocates abortion rights. 
 Under various state laws, the woman's physical and mental condition, as well as her economic status, are factors doctors may consider in deciding whether to perform an abortion.
 Roughly 80,000 abortions a year occur in Australia, making abortion the most common operation in this country of 21 million. The government medical plan covers the cost. 
 In recent years, the number of abortions has been gradually declining, largely because of better sex education, not only in the schools, but also in magazines for women, and a greater availability of contraceptives, Ms. McCarthy said.
 The RU-486 debate was over who has the authority to regulate the importation and sale of the pill in Australia. That power resides with the Ministry of Health, which is led by Tony Abbott, a conservative Catholic who opposes abortion.
 Ms. Allison proposed legislation that would strip the ministry of this power, and treat drugs that induce abortion like all other pharmaceuticals, which require approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, a government body of doctors and scientists. The legislation had broad political support, at least from women. Ms. Allison leads the small, liberal Democrats Party. The co-sponsors were Judith Troeth, of the Liberal Party; Fiona Nash, of the Nationals, a small, rural-based conservative party; and Claire Moore, of the center-left Labor Party, the major opposition party.
 The Senate debate lasted two days -- longer than the Senate recently spent debating antiterrorism laws, which gave the police and intelligence agencies sweeping powers to monitor, arrest and detain terrorism suspects.
 ''It is galling to listen to the men -- and it is mostly men -- who have such contempt for women who terminate unwanted pregnancies who have neither the compassion nor the understanding of the huge, and for many, daunting task of taking an embryo the size of a grain of rice to adulthood,'' Ms. Allison said during the debate.
 Mr. Abbott, a Liberal, expressed strong opposition to the bill, arguing that ministers were accountable to the public, unlike the drug agency. He vehemently rejected suggestions that his personal and religious views had dictated his position.
 It is ''about preserving women's safety, not restricting existing rights to abortion,'' he argued Monday in an newspaper opinion piece in The Australian.
 He said he was not in favor of withdrawing public financing for abortions, and he invoked the words of former President Bill Clinton that abortion should be ''safe, legal and rare.''
 The vote on the legislation was what is known here as a ''conscience vote,'' meaning that there were no instructions from the parties' leaders, which is highly unusual here.
 Prime Minister John Howard said he supported Mr. Abbott's position, which was considered a signal to Liberal Party members to oppose the bill. But his effort failed.
 The 45-to-28 Senate vote reflected gender politics, with 24 of the 76-member Senate's 27 women -- from five parties, from the left to the right -- supporting the bill. Twenty-five men voted against the bill, 21 for it and 3 abstained. The bill is subject to approval by the House of representative, where a closer vote is expected.

HEADLINE: Demand Strong as 30-Year Bond Makes a Comeback 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The first auction of 30-year Treasury bonds since 2001 was met with surprisingly strong demand yesterday.
 The sale allowed the United States government to borrow $14 billion at a yield of up to 4.53 percent, nearly a percentage point lower than it paid at the previous auction in August 2001.
After the auction, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 4.50 percent. 
 One indication of the robust demand was that 65 percent of the bids came from bidders other than the brokerage firms that are required to bid at auctions, indicating that perhaps investors like pension funds were buyers.
 The new auction came after the Bush administration reversed its policy on sales of such long bonds, amid rising government deficits. It had halted the auctions because it believed that it was likely to pay less if it borrowed short-term and then continuously rolled over the debt by issuing new short-term securities.
 The world seems very different now from what it looked like in August 2001. Then, projections called for the government to continue to run surpluses even with the tax cuts that President Bush was pushing through Congress. There was talk of a bond shortage.
 Now the government's budget is deep in deficit. The tax cuts are one reason, but it also turned out that government tax receipts had been inflated by the stock market boom, as executives paid taxes on option profits and others took capital gains. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were followed by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and spending on other problems rose as well. The 2006 deficit is forecast by the Bush administration to be more than $400 billion.
 Since the Bush administration canceled the 30-year bond sales, the gap between long-term rates and short-term rates has disappeared, for reasons that are debated. The Federal Reserve has raised short-term rates, but long-term rates have not gone up as many expected.
 Some trace that to demand for bonds from overseas investors and governments that are presumed to be buying to keep their currencies from rising against the dollar. Others point to trends in pension funds to match assets with liabilities by buying long-dated bonds to offset distant liabilities to retirees who might be collecting pensions decades from now.
 Yesterday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury -- now the benchmark for many interest rates -- fell to 4.54 percent from 4.59 percent on Wednesday. The yield on the two-year note rose to 4.65 percent from 4.63 percent on Wednesday.
 In the run-up to the auction, speculation about what would happen ran rampant. Some expected overwhelming demand, and voiced fears that someone -- perhaps a hedge fund -- would buy so many bonds that the market would be cornered and others would have to pay higher prices to get bonds they had promised to obtain.
 By yesterday morning, on the other hand, some on Wall Street were warning that the bond was likely to sell at too high a price, meaning a yield that was too low. That would lead to the bond price falling in later trading. To some, talk like that appeared to be an effort to talk the bond's auction price down, which would assure better profits for buyers in the auction.
 At the previous auction of 30-year Treasuries, the government raised $5 billion by auctioning bonds identical to the ones that had been sold six months earlier, and that will mature in February 2031.
 It got $10.8 billion in bids, and accepted bids calling for interest rates as high as 5.52 percent. In trading just before the auction results were announced yesterday, that bond, with a coupon of 5.375 percent, was trading at just below 110 percent of par value, for a yield to maturity of 4.70 percent. In the aftermath of the auction, the price rose and the yield fell to 4.65 percent from 4.67 percent on Wednesday.
 By contrast, Thursday's auction was for $14 billion in 30-year bonds that will mature in February 2036, and it received $28.7 billion in bids. The bonds that will be issued will have a coupon of 4.5 percent. 
 Under the auction process, bidders can agree to pay the average rate and be sure of getting bonds. The Treasury said it received such bids for just $38.8 million of bonds, plus another $100 million to be issued to foreign and international monetary authorities.
 Other bids specify the rate they are willing to accept, and get that rate if their bids are accepted. The lowest yield was 4.475 percent, and the highest yield accepted was 4.53 percent. 
 The median yield on accepted bids was 4.49 percent.

HEADLINE: An Appetite for Fast Gains From Restaurant Chains 

BYLINE: By Jenny Anderson

 BODY:
AMERICANS' obsession with food is only slightly outdone by its passion for real estate. Hedge fund activists seem to share the sentiment, redirecting their recent interest in fast food to casual dining, and focusing beyond high margins in the kitchen to finding value in the land beneath it.
 This week, Pirate Capital, an aptly named $1.5 billion activist fund, indicated in a regulatory filing that it had paid $58.8 million for a 7 percent stake in CKE Restaurants, parent of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, among other holdings. 
Late last month, Michael Woodhouse, the chairman and chief executive of Cracker Barrel, said his company had hired Wachovia to explore ways to enhance shareholder value. This came after Cracker Barrel was approached by an unnamed shareholder who wanted changes. That shareholder is Nelson Peltz, who runs Trian Partners, a new private investment fund, say people briefed on Mr. Peltz's investment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Peltz declined to comment. 
 These restaurant franchises, slightly more sophisticated than fast-food chains, have something in common with their bigger brethren other than some menu items: the restaurants in both types of chains own a lot of real estate. 
 The hedge fund investors believe that real estate has value that, once unlocked, could go to the company's owners -- the activists -- in the form of share buybacks. 
 Cracker Barrel and CKE Restaurants will not be alone: other targets are expected to include Outback Steakhouse, Bob Evans and Brinker International, say managers who do not want to be identified because they are buying shares.
 If the strategy sounds like a rerun, it is. Pirate Capital's real estate play comes on the heels of a suspended campaign by Pershing Square Capital Management to persuade McDonald's to borrow against its real estate to pay for a share buyback. Pershing Square and Mr. Peltz are also major shareholders in Wendy's International, and both have waged a successful campaign to force the company to sell to the public part of its Tim Hortons doughnut chain, helping to drive up the stock.
 Here's how the activists want to unlock real estate value: sell the real estate under the stores and lease it back, using the proceeds to buy back stock. If such a move would incur a large tax bill -- which it would if the real estate was cheap -- the restaurant companies could create a real estate holding company and borrow, heavily, against it. 
 Pirate Capital, in its filing, suggested that CKE sell its real estate and use the cash to buy back stock. Mr. Peltz is said to be pursuing a similar strategy with Cracker Barrel, looking to tap real estate value and improve performance at the operating company. 
 According to Matt Goldfarb, an analyst with Pirate Capital, CKE owns 420 units: restaurants and the land beneath them. If it sold 80 percent of the real estate and leased back the stores, the company, whose enterprise value (equity and debt) is $1.2 billion, would generate at least $300 million in proceeds. It could direct $100 million to paying off debt and $200 million to a share buyback.
 Andrew F. Puzder, CKE's chief executive, said that Pirate had not shown him a detailed plan but that CKE, with Citigroup as an adviser, had looked at sale and lease-backs and decided against the idea. ''Taxes make it very difficult to economically justify that kind of action, unless you were desperate for cash,'' he said. 
 He added that he had talked to Pirate as he often talks to shareholders with ideas, and would be happy to look at the idea again. 
 Some activists, however, have become less religious about real estate plays. In November, William A. Ackman of Pershing Square called on McDonald's to sell off two-thirds of the restaurants it owns, borrow nearly $15 billion against its real estate, and buy back stock, rewarding him and other shareholders. Mr. Ackman later revised his plan, suggesting management sell 20 percent of McOpCo, which operates about 8,000 restaurants, to the public and over time sell about 1,000 of those units. 
 When McDonald's agreed to sell 1,500 of its 8,000 restaurants, and disclose more about McOpCo's financials, Mr. Ackman declared victory, suggesting either that the real estate strategy was not so good an idea, or that Mr. Ackman is a master of compromise. (In a letter to investors, Mr. Ackman said his flagship Pershing Square Fund was up 39.9 percent, net of fees, in 2005, with Wendy's contributing 18.6 percent of gross performance, and McDonald's 7.5 percent.) 
 Whether Mr. Peltz, Pirate and others holding undisclosed stakes will prevail is unclear. Mr. Peltz has said in the past that unlike many of his competitors, he takes aim at a company's income statement and not just its balance sheet. If the company has good cash flow and a valuable real estate portfolio, perhaps the endgame is not to bully, but to buy out. 
 Now that's a real estate play.

HEADLINE: Big British Supermarket Chain Will Open Small Stores in U.S.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 9 

 BODY:
The British supermarket chain Tesco announced plans on Thursday to open a chain of small convenience stores across the United States beginning next year. 
 Tesco surprised investors with its plan to spend up to $435 million annually to establish the American stores. The company has been building revenue from international expansion in recent years, but its move into the world's largest economy breaks with its strategy of entering emerging markets like China. 
 ''The United States is the largest economy in the world with strong forecast growth and a sophisticated retail market,'' the chief executive, Terry Leahy, said. ''It is a market we have researched extensively for many years and over the last year we have committed serious resources to developing a format that we believe will be really popular with American consumers.'' 
 Tesco estimated that the American grocery market is worth more than $600 billion and will grow 40 percent over the next five years. Mr. Leahy said the company had developed a new model for the American stores, based on the smaller Tesco Express store concept that has proved successful in Britain. 
 The first stores will open on the West Coast in 2007. The company declined to specify the number of stores it planned to open but said it expected to break even on the project by the end of the second full year of operation. 
 Analysts were cautiously positive about the move. Richard Ratner, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said in a note to clients, that while the move was unexpected, ''it is an interesting move as Tesco has not been involved in the bidding for any of the larger U.S. supermarkets over the last few years, Albertson's being the latest.'' 
 Tesco has generally focused on emerging markets as it tries to diversify beyond the mature and fiercely competitive British market. The company entered China last year when it bought 50 percent of the Hymall chain of hypermarkets and now trades in 12 countries outside Britain.
 In Britain, the company is the undisputed leader with 30.5 percent share of the grocery market.

HEADLINE: The Vanishing Future

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
At this point we've had six years to grow accustomed to Bush budget chicanery. (Yes, six years: George W. Bush's special mix of blatant dishonesty and gross irresponsibility was fully visible during the 2000 presidential campaign.) What still amazes me, however, is the sheer childishness of the administration's denials and deceptions.
 Consider the case of the vanishing future. 
The story begins in 2001, when President Bush was pushing his first tax cut through Congress. At the time, the administration insisted that its tax-cut plans wouldn't endanger the budget surplus bequeathed to Mr. Bush by Bill Clinton. But even some Republican senators were skeptical. So the Senate demanded a cap on the tax cut: it should not reduce revenue over the period from 2001 to 2011 by more than $1.35 trillion.
 The administration met this requirement, but not by scaling back its tax-cutting ambitions. Instead, it created fictitious savings by ''sunsetting'' the tax cut, making the whole thing expire at the end of 2010.
 This was obviously silly. For example, under the law as written there will be no federal tax on the estates of wealthy people who die in 2010. But the estate tax will return in 2011 with a maximum rate of 55 percent, creating some interesting incentives. 
 I suggested, back in 2001, that the legislation be renamed the Throw Momma From the Train Act.
 It was also obvious that the administration had no intention of abiding by its concession to fiscal prudence, that it would try to eliminate the sunset clause and make the tax cuts permanent. 
 But it quickly became clear that the budget forecasts the administration used to justify the 2001 tax cut were wildly overoptimistic. The federal government faced a future of deficits, not surpluses, as far as the eye could see. Making the tax cut permanent would greatly worsen those future deficits. What were budget officials to do?
 You almost have to admire their brazenness: they made the future disappear.
 Clinton-era budgets offered 10-year projections of spending and revenues. But the Bush administration slashed the budget horizon to five years. This artificial shortsightedness greatly aided the campaign to make the 2001 tax cut permanent because it hid the costs: since budget analyses no longer covered the years after 2010, the revenue losses from extending the tax cut became invisible.
 But now it's 2006, and even a five-year projection covers the period from 2007 to 2011, which means including a year in which making the Bush tax cuts permanent will cost a lot of revenue -- $119.7 billion, but who's counting? Has the administration finally run out of ways to avoid budget reality?
 Not quite. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, until this year budget documents contained a standard table titled ''Impact of Budget Policy,'' which summarized the effects of the administration's tax and spending proposals on future outlays and revenues. But this year, that table is missing. So you have to do some detective work to figure out what's really going on. 
 Now, the administration has proposed spending cuts that are both cruel and implausible. For example, administration computer printouts obtained by the center show that the budget calls for a 13 percent cut in spending on veterans' health care, adjusted for inflation, over the next five years. 
 Yet even these cuts would fall far short of making up for the revenue losses from making the tax cuts permanent. The administration's own estimate, which can be deduced from its budget tables, is that extending the tax cuts would cost an average of $235 billion in each year from 2012 through 2016.
 In other words, the administration has no idea how to make its tax cuts feasible in the long run. Yet it has never, as far as I can tell, allowed unfavorable facts to affect its determination to make the tax cuts permanent. Instead, it has devoted all its efforts to hiding those awkward facts from public view. (Any resemblance to, say, its Iraq strategy is no coincidence.)
 At this point the administration's budget strategy seems to be simply to ignore reality. The 2007 budget makes it clear, once and for all, that the tax cuts can't be offset with spending cuts. But Bush officials have decided to ignore that unpleasant fact, and let some future administration deal with the mess they have created.

HEADLINE: Shares Mixed as Investors Worry About What's to Come

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street's momentum sagged yesterday, leaving the major indexes mixed after investors' enthusiasm over a six-year low in unemployment claims and strong corporate earnings waned in the face of longer-term economic worries. 
 With lingering questions remaining about the health of the economy, interest rates, oil prices and geopolitics, investors took profits in late trading, focusing on the energy and technology sectors that led the most recent rallies.
 ''Most companies have already reported their earnings, and I think we're getting to a quiet period where it can be tough to keep anything positive going,'' said Hans F. Olsen, managing director and chief investment officer at Bingham Legg Advisers. ''There's still a lot out there to deal with.'' 
 While weekly first-time jobless claims rose slightly, Wall Street was initially encouraged after the Labor Department said the four-week moving average of claims, an indicator of the labor market's health, fell to its lowest level since April 2000. Positive earnings reports from Best Buy and Aetna also cheered would-be buyers for much of the session. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.73 points, or 0.23 percent, to 10,883.35 after gaining 108.86 points on Wednesday. 
 Broader stock indicators were lower, however. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.87 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,263.78, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 11.11 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,255.87. 
 In earnings news, the electronics retailer Best Buy surged $4.13, to $52.96, after it raised its forecast for fourth-quarter earnings beyond analysts' current expectations. 
 The insurer Aetna which climbed $3.15 to $99.27, and the hotel operator Marriott International, which jumped $1.53, to $67.64, posted strong earnings and increased their 2006 full-year forecasts. 
 The American International Group gained 74 cents, to $67.12, after regulators said the company would pay $1.64 billion to settle charges of bid-rigging and accounting fraud with the New York attorney general and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The investment bank Morgan Stanley installed its acting president Zoe Cruz and a longtime executive, Robert W. Scully, as co-presidents under the chief executive, John J. Mack. The two will divide oversight of the company's various businesses. Morgan Stanley slipped 9 cents, to $61.18, after having posted gains for much of the day. 
 A Dow industrial, General Motors, rose 15 cents, to $22.14, after it announced a sales incentive program for its sport utility vehicles.
 The dollar was mixed against most major currencies, while gold prices edged lower. 
 Crude prices edged higher after the Energy Department reported a drop in energy stockpiles Wednesday. A barrel of light crude settled at $62.62, up 7 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Bonds reversed direction from the previous session and rose as the first auction of 30-year Treasury bonds since 2001 was generally well received. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.54 percent from 4.59 percent late Wednesday and the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the rate, rose 11/32, to 99 21/32.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year Treasury bonds:



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	High Price		High Yield	4.530	Low Yield	4.475	Median Yield	4.490	Total applied for	$29,561,668	Accepted	$14,841,330	Noncompetitive	$38,776	Interest set at	4 1/2%	The 30-year notes mature February 15, 2036.

HEADLINE: Wachovia Moves In

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
It may not be surprising that nine senior Morgan Stanley sales and trading executives walked away from that venerable investment house amid last summer's management upheaval. 
 What is surprising is where they wound up: Wachovia Securities, the investment banking arm of the Wachovia Corporation, whose influence on Wall Street is growing but whose name often generates blank stares.
Courted by half a dozen elite firms, the Morgan Stanley team was drawn by the prospects of building a business. 
 ''Coming from Morgan Stanley, you think that is the be-all and end-all,'' said Richard P. Silva, who is now co-head of Wachovia's structured product desk. ''There is so much more here for anybody from the outside to say this is a sweet-pea little bank.''
 ''You know what? It's not,'' he added. ''It's the real deal.''
 Ten years ago, Wachovia had little in the way of an investment bank and lacked a trading floor. But brick by brick, the bank, now the fourth biggest in the United States, has expanded its capital markets businesses. 
 It has built an equities group from scratch. It has rapidly expanded its fixed-income division and retail brokerage ranks and added equity derivatives trading and private equity financing to the mix. 
 Most of all, Wachovia has used its big balance sheet to win investment banking business, largely in the real estate and midsize corporate markets where it already had strong lending ties. 
 The approach seems to be paying off. Today, Wachovia's investment bank contributes more than 15 percent of the company's total earnings, up from 10 percent in 2002, the first full year after First Union acquired Wachovia and adopted its name. And it has climbed up the fee rankings of investment banks, catapulting into the top 12 in total United States underwriting for the first time last year, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial. 
 Someday, Wachovia hopes to be within striking distance of big-bank mainstays like J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, whose large size -- despite their turbulent performance -- allows them to command an impressive lead.
 Wachovia Securities is already near its rivals in one sense. It just took over five floors of the Seagram Building on Park Avenue. Citigroup and J. P. Morgan are blocks away. 
 ''We are competing against people who have been doing this forever,'' said Stephen E. Cummings, who has helped lead the business-building effort since 1998 as Wachovia's head of corporate and investment banking. 
 ''They have got brand. They have got decades of experience that we don't have right now,'' he added. ''But this is a long race.''
 Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., has long excelled at retail banking but has shunned doing one of Wall Street's enormous deals to expand its institutional business. As First Union, the bank went on a buying spree in the late 1990's just as the economy slumped. When G. Kennedy Thompson took over as chief executive in 2000, he tried to put the company back on track with a more patient and financially disciplined approach. 
 He smoothly orchestrated the big acquisitions -- Wachovia in 2001 and SouthTrust three years later -- that vastly enlarged its retail presence. But in investment banking, Mr. Thompson, who made his name by running First Union's capital markets unit, has been determined to build. 
 So far, that strategy seems to be working. Big banks have long maintained that they have built-in advantages. After all, their close customer relationships, huge pools of money to lend, low financing costs from consumer deposits and, in some cases, thousands of financial advisers should give them an edge. Yet, they have seldom lived up to their promise. 
 ''If you go through all the names and looked at how they tried to do it, it has been through lots of big acquisitions, lots of wasted shareholder dollars and lots of challenges,'' Mr. Cummings said. 
 Wachovia, by contrast, has taken a ground-up approach. It assembled its investment banking advisory and convertible bond businesses by snapping up smaller firms. It built its equities group by hiring about 80 people from Bankers Trust, and over the past year it lured away some 138 top bankers and traders in their 30's and 40's in other areas.
 ''People who might not have considered this platform five years ago -- my phone now rings all the time,'' said Richard P. Sandulli, who left Morgan Stanley with Mr. Silva to run the structured products desk. ''They see this as part of the future.'' One result, executives say, is a culture that is externally competitive but internally collegial. 
 ''We don't have a 50-year history or siloed products or divisions we had to overcome,'' said Benjamin F. Williams Jr., Wachovia's head of global capital markets. ''We had a blank chalkboard.''
 Of course, there are challenges. Connections and cachet are the lifeblood of investment banking. 
 And Wachovia's investment banking business has been concentrated on midsize and fast-growing companies, like the initial public offering it helped orchestrate yesterday for the Morton's Restaurant Group. Despite its large balance sheet, Wachovia has yet to lead one of Wall Street's megadeals. 
 Moreover, a big part of Wachovia's investment banking revenue comes from commercial real estate clients. That could make it vulnerable if the market turns. Wachovia executives say their business mix is diverse and they have budgeted this year for real estate's slower growth.
 The biggest challenge may be for Wachovia's management to remain committed to its plans. Despite Mr. Thompson's background, Wall Street is still unfamiliar territory to most retail bankers. And the investment bank lacks the breadth and depth of other top-tier underwriters.
 Still, Gerard S. Cassidy, a banking analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said he did not question Wachovia's resolve. ''Will they ever become a bulge-bracket firm like a Goldman Sachs or a Merrill Lynch? No,'' he said. ''But we expect their investment banking operations to be a meaningful contributor to their earnings in future years.''
 Mr. Cummings said he was up for that task. ''We are not the biggest. We are not global. But we think that we execute very well,'' he said. ''We have an underdog mentality and a chip on our shoulder. We are out to prove that we are the best in the business.''

HEADLINE: A Vivid Back Story For a Stella Legend 

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
EVERY art form cultivates its creation myths. Rock 'n' roll has Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. The modern novel has ''Ulysses'' and its 18th-century precedent, ''Tristram Shandy.'' Late-night television has Jack Parr and Ernie Kovacs. Underground comics have R. Crumb.
 Postwar American painting has Jackson Pollock's drips, Jasper Johns's flags, Andy Warhol's Elvises and Frank Stella's Black Paintings, all of which emerged in New York in stunning succession from the late 1940's to the early 60's. At the moment, the brooding, darkly titled Black Paintings that Mr. Stella made mostly in 1959, when he was only 23, may ring the least bells. They have probably never been less a force in contemporary painting or public consciousness than now.
The status of the Black Paintings could improve with ''Frank Stella 1958,'' a small, fast-moving (if bumpy) and rather obsessive exhibition organized by Harry Cooper, curator of modern art at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, and Megan R. Luke, a doctoral candidate in art history at Harvard. 
 The exhibition at Harvard's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery focuses on 21 of the 34 surviving paintings, drawings and reliefs that Mr. Stella made in 1958. These works lead directly to the imposing Black Paintings, in which slightly carpetlike designs result from radiating patterns of nesting black bands on white canvas. When the year began, he was starting his last semester as an undergraduate at Princeton. After graduating, he embarked on what could be called his first semester in New York, living in cheap storefronts and lofts on the Lower East Side and in the neighborhood now called SoHo and supporting himself as a house painter. 
 Accompanied by an ostentatiously detailed catalog, these works have been glimpsed in previous Stella shows and books, but never examined as a group. Despite an insensitive hanging in an ugly gallery that is too small for them, they make a strong, even stirring impression. Their brushy fields of unruled stripes and blocks show a young artist cognizant of but hardly paralyzed by the innovations of the Abstract Expressionists and scrambling to assimilate the influence of Mr. Johns. Mr. Stella saw Mr. Johns's flag paintings for the first time in the older artist's debut, at the Leo Castelli Gallery in January 1958, and quickly made them the foundation of a stripe-based vocabulary. 
 The show itself is built on the premise that behind every creation myth lies a messier, more colorful story of trial, error and triumph. In this case the back story may actually be more emblematic of the artist than the presumed masterpieces that followed. In other words, the show could actually leave the relatively low profile of the Black Paintings intact, suggesting the superfluity of art history and its designated landmarks to both the public and practicing artists. (It should be said that Mr. Cooper's and especially Ms. Luke's highly specialized essays don't help matters.) 
 For a while, those masterpieces, the Black Paintings, put Mr. Stella squarely on the art-historical map. In December 1959, four of them were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, which promptly bought the largest, ''The Marriage of Reason and Squalor.'' By September, Mr. Stella was showing his next series -- the aluminum-striped shaped paintings -- at the Leo Castelli Gallery. For the next decade and a half he reigned supreme as America's leading Abstract painter.
 The Black Paintings may also lag in prominence because Mr. Stella failed to fulfill some of the basic requirements of icon status. Unlike Mr. Johns's and Warhol's best-known efforts, the Black Paintings did not help ignite Pop Art and a new form of representation that artists continue to expand upon. Their resolutely abstract demeanor, based on a narrowly defined notion of formalist painting, is more an end than a beginning. And unlike Pollock, who died in a car crash at the age of 44, Mr. Stella has stayed alive and productive. He'll be 70 in May, and for the last quarter century has been churning out bulky colorful reliefs and even bulkier aluminum sculptures that have been increasingly viewed by many as inherently corporate. 
 ''Frank Stella 1958'' suggests, completely inadvertently, that the obscurity of the Black Paintings may be partly their own fault. They and Mr. Stella's subsequent striped shaped paintings are the most implacable and withholding of his production and, in many ways, the least characteristic of his sensibility. They are handsome works of great historical weight, but they don't seem to have held the artist's interest for very long, so why should they hold ours? All the more reason to examine what came before the Black Paintings, to better fathom what followed them.
 The show is an engaging combination of student work, precocious failures and robustly promising efforts. There are even two small wood assemblages, reminiscent of Kurt Schwitters and Robert Rauschenberg, that hint at Mr. Stella's later reliefs. On hand are the first three of the Black Paintings, probably made toward the end of 1958. The most successful of these, ''Morro Castle,'' exemplifies most closely the series as a whole, with its dark field flattened and radiating patterns. The worst, ''Criss-Cross,'' is a murky swatch of perpendicular black stripes that some artists might have destroyed as a first, clumsy try.
 There are well-known works, like ''Astoria,'' whose uninterrupted field of heavily reworked horizontal bands in ochre, with hints of green showing through, presage the Black Paintings' regimented patterns, but with more feeling. And there are works that seem barely started, like the intimations of vertical stripes, a brushy grid and a thick horizontal band in black on blue, with lots of bare canvas showing through, in an unfamiliar untitled work. Also unfamiliar, if more together, is ''Tundra,'' whose broad bands of grays and blues have the softness of a stained painting by Helen Frankenthaler, and whose central windowlike motif of vertical lines evokes assorted American painters, including Georgia O'Keeffe, Adolph Gottlieb and Robert Motherwell. 
 But the most engaging works are several in which the bands are defined in sourly contrasting hues of house paint (left over from the day job) and interrupted or countered by squares or doorlike rectangles. A strong example is the narrow red rectangle, carefully off-center, of ''Red River Valley,'' which lords it over a pale green ground and a stack of green and black stripes like a giant beam of light or a bloody plinth. 
 These works are muscularly painted and reworked in a way that is searching and sometimes tentative, but also outgoing and apparent to the eye. (The process was partly inspired by the complex collage-encaustic surfaces of the Johns flags.) In ''West Broadway,'' for example, the edges of the alternating red and black bands are continually shifting creating a marked optical buzz. In ''Coney Island'' there is more of a standoff, with little hints of white showing between yellow and red stripes, while a central, blue-violet square jazzes up their contrast. And in ''Grape Island,'' the most economical work, a solid umber ground burns through all other additions, both the cryptic bands of bright yellow and a cursory central square of green. 
 It is worth noting that while making these paintings, Mr. Stella was very interested in the formalist thinking of the art critic Clement Greenberg, whose theory of modernism had it that art mediums were being reduced to their essences. According to this suicidal program, painting's future lay in flat, rectangular, monochromatic canvases devoid ofimages and spatial illusion.
 Mr. Stella came closest to that future in the Black Paintings, but Greenberg did not endorse them. By the mid-1960's, his stripe vocabulary exhausted, he moved on to more complex, colorful, robustly worked and increasingly three-dimensional works. You could say that he accepted flatness as a given and built out from there. But in many ways he was returning to the colors and textures of the best paintings from 1958, and perhaps to a larger, truer part of himself. 

''Frank Stella 1958,'' organized by the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, is on view at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, 485 Broadway, at Quincy Street, Cambridge, Mass., (617) 495-9400, through May 7.

HEADLINE: As Torch Nears, Worries and Woes Flicker

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER; Peter Kiefer contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy, Feb. 9 

 BODY:
The protesters here certainly know what they don't like: war, globalization, capitalism, drug laws, immigrant detention centers, a high-speed train line and, inexplicably, the Olympic torch.
 ''This is a discussion of war,'' said Claudio Robba, 25, one of maybe 150 protesters at a piazza, referring, in fact, to a well-designed stick with a little flame on top.
 But clarity is not the point, and on Thursday, the eve of the Winter Games, the protesters managed to generate enough worry that Olympic organizers, for the third time in recent days, diverted the path of the torch relay to avoid them.
 The protesters claimed victory, but the general feelings were anger and embarrassment that Italy, which had meticulously prepared for the event for a decade, was having trouble getting the torch cleanly to the Olympic Stadium, where on Friday night it is supposed to light the caldron and officially open the Games. 
 The problems with the torch relay are turning into a symbol for an event that is mosquito-bitten by logistical worries. These include concerns about log-jammed transportation on two-lane mountain roads and venues untested with large crowds, lagging ticket sales, already overtaxed phone lines, melting snow, increased fears about security and, as the protest showed, the potential for disruption.
 Fortunately for the Games' organizers, attention is beginning to shift to the events, the real test of all this planning, which begin Saturday with the Nordic combined.
 For Americans, the interest may be especially high on the opening weekend. Daron Rahlves turned in the fastest time in the first training run Thursday for the men's downhill. The race, the first marquee event, will take place Sunday in the Alpine resort town of Sestriere.
 After beating his nearest competitor by more than a second, Rahlves immediately declared himself the favorite. ''The race comes down to me,'' he said, while his usually outspoken teammate Bode Miller turned in the 16th-fastest time and then refused to talk.
 Down the mountain, athletes, dignitaries and journalists have landed here in huge numbers and the city is finally shaping up as an Olympic stage. 
 Workers have been rushing to put in place the finishing touches, hanging banners and installing figurines of the Olympic stick-figure mascots in the traffic circles, while construction continues on the ornate shell in the center of town where some medal ceremonies will be held.
 ''We have one more day to fine-tune everything to be ready for tomorrow night,'' Andrea Varnier, the image and event director for the Turin Organizing Committee, said Thursday. ''This is a unique opportunity to give the first image of the Games and our country.''
 The city and the nation had seemed curiously resistant to Olympic fever, but excitement seems to be growing. Crowds lined the streets inside this industrial yet graceful city, among them throngs of schoolchildren with pennants, waiting for the torch to pass. For some, given that the torch was unexpectedly rerouted by the protest at Piazza Sabotino, just outside the center, the view came as a pleasant surprise.
 ''How beautiful!'' said Claudia Franchino, 26, who had just stepped out of a shop when the torch suddenly arrived on its new route. ''What an event!''
 Despite predictions of a huge last-minute buying spree, an ongoing enthusiasm deficit seems reflected in poorer-than-expected ticket sales. As of Thursday, 740,000 tickets had been sold, just over 85 percent of those available. There were still 1,000 tickets unsold for the opening ceremony Friday.
 Also Thursday, the Italian Interior Ministry, while expressing confidence in the ''full efficiency'' of its security plans, said nonetheless it was paying particular attention to two possible threats. First, a statement said, is a possibly increased worry about violence in the wake of protests among Muslims around the world against the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published in European papers.
 Second, the ministry said, was the ''growing aggressiveness of antagonistic movements and subversive Italian groups.'' Earlier this week, the interior minister, Giuseppe Pisanu, said he was more concerned about these groups -- a mix of leftists opposed to a full menu of issues, local and global -- than about Islamic terrorism.
 In recent days, these groups forced the police to divert the torch twice: first on Sunday in the Susa Valley, west of Turin, the site of protests against a high-speed train line under construction there; then on Wednesday in the town of Avigliana, west of Turin, where 1,500 protesters had gathered to try to block the torch.
 On Thursday, a contingent of the protesters set itself up at Piazza Sabotino, armed with T-shirts against the ''Dirty Games'' (as well as five-foot fake marijuana cigarettes that they carried about like the Olympic torch, in protest of harsh new drug laws in Italy).
 The protesters had a long list of complaints against the Games. General Electric is a sponsor, and it makes engines that power American warplanes in Iraq. Turin has spent more than $1.4 billion on the Games, which the protesters say will do nothing to change unemployment and layoffs in a city hit hard by the misfortunes of Fiat, the automaker based here.
 ''People say this is a chance for Turin to become a rich city,'' said Laura, 25, who like most of the protesters would not give her last name. ''But this is a lot of talk about nothing.''
 In nearly equal numbers to the protesters were riot police, with plastic shields and sticks -- not needed, it turned out, because Olympic organizers decided to reroute the torch a few streets away. However, there was trouble between the protesters and crowds of ordinary Turinese who showed up with pennants to watch the torch pass.
 ''It wasn't democratic; you are blocking the flame,'' a woman who gave her name as Felicia, 45, screamed at the protesters. ''You are a disgrace.''
 Giuseppe Galigiuti, 50, a mechanic, spit out, ''They are the embarrassment of Italy; them, not Italy itself.''
 The truth is that television viewers around the world are seeing not just the protesters, but a telling slice of Italian political life. The short but still complicated version is that Italy is the midst of hotly contested national elections, and many of these protesters are aligned to the Refounded Communists, which is aligned to the center-left coalition challenging Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
 The protests represent a small political windfall for Berlusconi and his allies, who are asking why the left, led by his opponent in the race, Romano Prodi, cannot stop the protests and the embarrassment to Italy.
 Giuseppe Tamburrano, a professor at the University of Catania in Sicily, said the protesters themselves are sending a message to the Communist leaders not to cozy up too much to the more moderate Prodi while they get free international television time.
 ''These young people understand perfectly well that the Olympic Games don't have a relationship with globalism or capitalism,'' he said. ''They do it, above all, for the visibility.''
 All of which meant nothing to the pupils at Cesare Battisti Primary School, who stood curbside with little pennants for an hour. A girl named Diana, 8, whose teacher forbade her to give her last name to a stranger with a notebook, said she was sad not to see the torch. Like Turin itself, she only had one chance to be part of the Olympics.
 ''It will neverhappen again,'' she said.

PERSON: JOSEPH E. SPINNATO 

HEADLINE: The Hotel Man Who's Expanding the Javits Center

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
NATURALLY, the Hotel Association of New York City resides at a ritzy address, 320 Park Avenue, just opposite the turrets of St. Bartholomew's and cater-cornered from the gilt-embossed Waldorf-Astoria. Great curb appeal. Announce one's ultimate destination -- the wood-paneled sanctum of Joseph E. Spinnato -- to the security guard in the imposing lobby, and he gives a knowing nod: ''Hmm, you're going to see the big dog.''
 And he's getting bigger. 
 Mr. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association since Preston Robert Tisch recommended him for the job in 1989, was hand-picked last month by Gov. George E. Pataki to assume the chairmanship of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. His instant mandate is to hustle its much-stalled, much-maligned and increasingly pricey $1.7 billion expansion from conflict mode into construction mode. 
 He's hot on the case and, no surprise, unlike the Javits Center's previous chairman, the ousted Robert Boyle, he's right on the same page as the governor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic development official. They want shovels in the ground by September, period, so that Phase 1 of the glassy expansion designed by Richard Rogers will be in business by 2010, period. 
 They'll get no argument from Mr. Spinnato. He and his hotelier constituents have been howling about the economic windfall to be had from a bigger, better Javits Center for a dozen years, and suddenly he's in the driver's seat to make windfalls a reality. How happy is the Hotel Association that its president is wearing this particular second hat? Over the moon. No conflict of interest around here. 
 So the big dog of 320 Park, robust, ruddy-faced and just returned from a We Love New York Day luncheon sponsored by the New York Society of Association Executives, is in a convivial mood, and not only because lunch tasted good. He reports that when the mayor stood up and announced that the Javits expansion needed to happen and happen now, the 1,200 execs on hand gave him a standing ovation. A good omen. Later on, one of Mr. Spinnato's highest profile Hotel Association members, Donald Trump, actually gave the mayor a little farewell hug. Sweet. 
 After a Javits Center plug like that, Mr. Spinnato, whose appointment as the hotel industry's representative on the Javits board was made in 1991 during the Cuomo administration -- even though he's not a Democrat -- didn't mind skipping dessert to get back to the office and discuss his recent upgrade to chairman.
 IT'S one of those jobs where you get all of the headaches and none of the money,'' he jokes, flashing a vintage pair of scales-of-justice cufflinks, an engagement gift from his wife of 39 years, Madeline. Alas, the Javits chairmanship is unpaid. So he has kept his day job. 
 ''It's a no-brainer,'' Mr. Spinnato, 66, says of the merits of expansion. ''It's the right thing to do, and now's the time to do it. It's doable, achievable, and we can afford it. As soon as that center is expanded, the number of shows and conventions able to come to the city will increase substantially. There should be no more impediments to doing this project. Certainly the hotel industry is vehemently opposed to any further delays.'' 
 He is irked that some politicians, and Mr. Boyle, have questioned the project's integrity. Mr. Boyle was dismissed after disagreeing with officials about the project's direction. 
 As for Senator Charles E. Schumer's criticism that the expansion is ''too small,'' Mr. Boyle's disgust with the plan to move a parking area for trade-show trucks from the south side to the north, and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky's charge that a ''second-rate convention center'' is being rushed into construction -- well, Mr. Spinnato isn't buying any of it. 
 ''They have a right to their opinion,'' he says before deeming those opinions unrealistic. ''I don't want to sound like a broken record, but considering the woeful state of the current building, in an ideal world this expansion plan may not be perfect, but for our purposes, it is. And that doesn't mean we're taking on a second-rate, shoddy project.'' They better not. At $1.7 billion -- paid for by the state and city, plus a citywide $1.50 per night hotel room tax -- the public expects the antithesis of shoddy. 
 It also doesn't mean he intends to remove Mr. Boyle's management team, so long as they cooperate with Mr. Gargano's development team. ''The period of contentiousness is over; we've all got to get behind this plan,'' he says. ''I think they understand that. They may not like it, but I think they understand. To clean house would not be helpful.'' Besides, from the looks of his desk, Mr. Spinnato is no housekeeper. ''I'm disorganized.'' 
 Born in Queens, Mr. Spinnato, who lives on Long Island in Muttontown, grew up in Florida and New York, where he attended LaSalle Military Academy. His father was in the meat business, and both parents made their ambitions for him clear: doctor or lawyer. After graduating from St. John's, he earned a degree at the University of Miami Law School, then spent 10 years with the Nassau County district attorney's office. 
 In 1982, Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed him fire commissioner, which explains the profusion of fire helmets in his office. He's a collector. Adding a hard hat from the Javits construction site is his next objective. ''I don't think anybody wouldn't opt to expand as much as possible if it were possible,'' he says, wrapping up his side of the story. ''Well, it's not possible.''

HEADLINE: Affordable Apartments a New York Luxury

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
A survey released yesterday by city housing officials supplied factual backing for what many renters already know: even as the household income of average New Yorkers has fallen, it has become harder to find an affordable apartment in the city.
 The survey, conducted every three years by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, found that real income -- or income adjusted for inflation -- fell across the board for New Yorkers at the same time that rents, as tracked by several indicators, continued to rise. 
Shaun Donovan, the city's housing commissioner, said that the city's overall housing stock and the number of homeowners in New York are both at a record high, but acknowledged that city tenants are facing a painful spiral of rising rents and falling wages.
 ''You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a statistician to know that affordability is increasingly the fundamental problem that we face,'' he said.
 The study found that real income in New York fell by 6.3 percent from 2001 to 2004, whereas it increased by 9.8 percent from 1998 to 2001. This decrease in how much city residents were earning was accompanied by a 5.4 percent increase in the median monthly rent from 2002 to 2005, the study found.
 By almost every indicator used by the study, known as the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, it has become harder in recent years to find a steal of an apartment. 
 For example, the median monthly gross rent in New York, including utility payments, rose to $920 in 2005 from $788 in 2002. During the same period, the median monthly contract rent, which excludes fuel and utility costs, increased to $850 from $706.
 Then there was this: The study found that the number of units with a gross monthly rent of $500 to $799 fell by 16.2 percent from 2002 to 2005, while the number of units with monthly rents of $800 to $999 fell by 6.2 percent. But the number of units with gross monthly rents between $1,000 and $1,499 went up by 17 percent and those costing $1,500 or more rose by 20.6 percent, the study found.
 Perhaps the most telling aspect of the study was that more people are spending more of their paychecks on rent. In 2002, half of the renters in New York spent 28.6 percent of their household income on rent, the study found. In 2005, half spent 31.2 percent on rent. 
 In the same vein, 28.8 percent of city renters spent more than half their income on rent in 2005, the study found. In 2002, about 25.5 percent gave more than half their earnings to a landlord.
 Moreover, the rental crunch occurred during a housing boom in New York City. From 2002 to 2005, the study found, the city's housing stock increased by about 52,000 units, to 3,261,000 from 3,209,000, the largest increase since 1991.
 Brad Lander, the director of the Pratt Center for Community Development and an advocate for low-income housing, said a majority of the new units, 29,000 of them, were built for sale, not rent.
 ''You see it all around you,'' Mr. Lander said. ''It's all condos.''
 On the bright side, Mr. Donovan pointed out that a third of all New Yorkers own their homes. ''It's not just that people are coming to New York City,'' he said. ''They're coming to stay.'' 
 He also said that vacancy rates had increased -- meaning pressure is slowly being let off the market -- and that renters had rated their satisfaction with their neighborhoods at the highest levels in 27 years.
 Mr. Donovan suggested that, given Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's recently expanded plan to build affordable housing in New York, he expects rents and housing prices may soon come down.
 ''We prefer to believe, and the signs are there, that the housing market is returning to a healthier balance,'' he said. ''What we will see is neither significant increases in prices, but also not a substantial drop that would indicate a real crisis of confidence in New York City.''
 Mr. Lander said the study offered no truly surprising findings -- especially to the many people who must dig deep every first of the month for their home payments.
 ''This confirms what New Yorkers know,'' he said. ''Rents are up, low-rent units are almost impossible to find, and people are struggling to pay the housing bills.''

HEADLINE: Train Conductors Must Stay, Arbitrator Says

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
An arbitrator has ruled for a second time against the New York City Transit Authority's plan to remove the conductor on certain low-traffic routes, leaving the motorman at the head of the train to run the train alone. 
 Critics said the planned cutback, on the weekday G line from Brooklyn to Queens, endangered passengers in the event of crime. But the arbitrator, citing an earlier ruling, ruled that the cutback violated the union's contract.
 Both the union and the authority said the arbitrator's ruling was narrow and did not create a precedent to stop the authority's campaign to reduce staffing on the train.
 Separately, the authority said yesterday that subway ridership had risen 1.5 percent from the year earlier to 1.45 billion trips. It is the highest level since the Eisenhower administration, when ridership reached a record 1.5 billion trips in 1953.
 In a statement, Lawrence G. Reuter, the transit authority president, attributed the rise to more tourists, a resilient economy, fare discounts and what he called ''ongoing improvements and upgrades'' to the subway system.
 Bus ridership, however, fell 4.2 million trips to 736.4 million, a drop of nearly 0.6 percent from the year-ago level.
 In 1994, the union and the authority agreed on three criteria to determine when trains could resort to one-person train operation.
 First, the train had to be shorter than the typical 8- to-10-car train so that a motorman could see the full length of the train. The union and the authority agreed on a train of less than 300 feet, typically four cars.
 The other criteria were low-traffic stations so platforms were not crowded and, similarly, nonrush times to reduce distractions for the motorman.
 The Times Square shuttle runs one-person at off-peak hours, for example, and the M train runs that way on weekends, while the Lefferts shuttle on the No. 5 line does so after midnight.
 Last August, a state arbitrator, Richard Adelman, ruled that the authority could not remove the conductor from the L line from Manhattan to Brooklyn because the line was not specifically cited in the 1994 agreement.
 In the most recent ruling, dated Wednesday, Mr. Adelman ruled that the authority could not pull conductors off the G line because to do so would run the train one-person at a high-traffic time, namely weekdays, in violation of the contract. The ruling was reported yesterday in The Daily News.
 The authority had argued that the wording of the contract permitted one-person operation both weekdays and weekends. ''We obviously disagree with the arbitrator's decision,'' Charles F. Seaton, a transit spokesman, said in an interview.
 Roger Toussaint, the president of the transit workers' union, said in an interview that the ruling was ''a big victory for riders and for our members in terms of safety and security.''
 But he doubted that the authority would quit its plan to reduce staffing and observed that the rank and file's rejection of the December contract meant the issue was still a live one.
 ''Binding arbitration is a minefield,'' he said. The rejected contract effectively ended one-person trains, he said. ''But now the authority can introduce any argument on the grounds of safety and security'' in arbitration hearings.

HEADLINE: From Broadway To Runway 

BYLINE: By JOE BRESCIA

 BODY:
JOHN MALKOVICH, 52, the Obie winner and Oscar-nominated actor, director and producer, was in New York recently to show his Uncle Kimono clothing line to buyers at the Project New York show held at the Javits Center. The line, formulated with his partner, Francesco Rulli, features tailored suits, sweaters, striped ties and hats for men and just a few items for women, including berets and T-shirts with drawings done by Mr. Malkovich. Examples can be found at www.johnmalkovich.org. 
 Among the stores carrying Uncle Kimono is Blue Tree on Madison Avenue, owned by the actress Phoebe Cates. ''He's taken good old-fashioned well-made clothing and gives it more zip and detail,'' Ms. Cates said. ''I want him to produce a women's line.'' 
Mr. Malkovich said he wished he had more actor friends with clothing stores: ''It could be a good niche.'' Following are excerpts from the interview:

Q. How did you decide to enter the fashion business?

A. The only motivation I had was that I came to New York after Sept. 11 in 2001 to visit friends. Through a mutual friend I met Francesco Rulli. He asked me if I would I be interested in doing a men's clothing line. I thought: Well, it I might be interesting. And I think I was sort of born with the curse to be fashionable. I always wanted to be fashionable.

Q. Has it been more than interesting?

A. It's been an incredible amount of work. Not unlike my other job.

Q. How do you compare working on your clothes line with the acting business?

A. It's sort of like my regular job. Which means not altogether honest and not altogether unfrustrating or organized.

Q. In what way?

A. It's just that the world and the economy are changing so quickly that I think people say, 'Yeah, I'll make that, I'll do that.' But really in the end they can't do what they say they have agreed to do. It's different from my business in that if I do a play at 8 p.m. on Broadway, that's what I have to do. It's not a suggested time. And that's tough in fashion.

Q. What have you learned about finances and pricing?

A. It's tough to figure out how do we compete in Europe and North America, when obviously a living wage for us is very different than a living wage in Indonesia. And yet they have to work in Indonesia. They have to work in Morocco. They really need to. And kind of, so do we. There are a lot of complications to it that were really not wholly unforeseen, but they are difficult.
 I remember doing a show in Milan. I was told by a Belgian journalist, 'Your prices aren't exactly democratic.' I said, 'Well, yeah, we manufacture in Europe. So you have this amount of weeks of vacation. You get paid this amount and the fabrics manufactured in Europe and that costs this amount per meter.'
 They aren't dollar buttons or 30-cent buttons. They're 5-euro buttons. What do you want me to say? I don't make any money. That's the way it is. Yet to remain in business you have to be competitive. I don't know if we'll always be able to manufacture in Europe. I kind of doubt it.

Q. Who or what have been your designing influences?

A. It's an ongoing thing. For winter 2006 and 2007, I did a film about Klimt, the painter. So the main part, at least 20 something pieces are influenced by that. Last year, it was a film I had done about the guy who went around England impersonating Stanley Kubrick. It was a very flamboyant, rather tackily glamorous gay guy called Alan Conway. So I retain a little part of that.

Q. Has the line been another way of artistic fulfillment in addition to your acting, directing and producing?

A. Well, this is the most frustrating thing I've ever done artistically. It's extremely frustrating. But that's O.K. Things aren't ready. Things aren't done according to what had been agreed to. There's a tendency towards a panic unilateralism. I'm not a control maniac.
 But if something has my name on it, then I -- if it's all the same to you -- I would prefer to have it done the way I would like it to be done. I get very angry about it. Much more than when I direct or produce. Violent? Not so far. I don't throw things or yell. I just say I couldn't be more angry. That happens all the time.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Just the Right Moment to Take Out the Wallet

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Over the next few weeks, the latest generation of big-screen televisions, digital cameras, MP3 players and other consumer electronics are heading into the stores.
 In years past, that meant retailers would give last year's technology one final drastic price cut as they tried to make room for the new stuff. Consumers whose identities aren't wrapped up in having the latest and greatest gadgets could pick up some bargains.
That won't happen much this year. Because retailers share more sales and inventory information with manufacturers and vice versa via sophisticated software, inventories are kept lean.
 Still, a determined consumer can come away with the best price. A little more effort and knowledge of technology can provide an edge. 
 There is a rhythm to the introduction of many consumer products. The year-end holiday buying spree, when about 40 percent of all consumer products are purchased, sets that rhythm. New cars, electronics and most other items have to be in stores and ready to go by September.
 A few products don't follow the pattern. The big selling season for large kitchen appliances, to name an exception, is an abbreviated period before what the appliance makers call the cooking season. As you might guess, consumers want new appliances in place and ready to go before the Thanksgiving feast.
 Sales of air-conditioners are entirely weather related. A mild summer, and retailers are stuck with inventory that needs to be cleared out with a big price reduction. 
 Refrigerators tend to break in the heat, so that product has a summer selling season and isn't a hot product at Christmas. 
 So if September is so important, why are you reading this in February? Because in most consumer electronics, the majority of new products hit retailers in March and April. Again, it is part of the rhythm. 
 It used to be that you'd pick up bargains after Christmas. But that is no longer the case. Merchants, who start putting up Christmas decorations at Halloween, extend the season the other direction, well past New Year's Day. 
 As shoppers use gift cards, the season moves out a few weeks more. It then gets pushed to the Super Bowl, especially for big-screen televisions. 
 ''January is a pretty strong month because of the gift cards,'' said Randy Waynick, senior vice president of Sony's home product division. 
 The peak selling season is being stretched even more. Here's something that was in a Best Buy advertising circular in last week's Sunday newspaper: ''Make this Valentine's Day a truly memorable experience with Sharp Aquos.''
 Yes, you are being urged to substitute a 37-inch liquid-crystal-display flat-panel television for a dozen long-stem red roses and a box of Teuscher's champagne truffles. 
 Bob Scaglione, Sharp's senior vice president for marketing, says as the prices of televisions drop, people increasingly think of them as gifts. 
 ''Products that were a considered purchase are now take-away products,'' Mr. Scaglione said. 
 And how did he get that idea? The company was advertising TV's in kitchens for Mother's Day and sales surged. ''Why not Valentine's Day?'' he asked. 
 The selling season does finally screech to a halt near the end of February. About 75 percent of new electronic products are introduced in March and April, because, Panasonic's vice president for entertainment products, Reid Sullivan, said, it gave retailers and manufacturers time to ''launch, adjust and maximize.'' 
 The big retailers -- Wal-Mart, Costco, BestBuy and Circuit City, where Americans now buy the bulk of their gear -- rarely get stuck with much unwanted merchandise, so there's no need for a big sale. The inventory has been carefully tracked with something called supply-chain management software.
 ''It's a delicate balance,'' Mr. Scaglione said. ''We keep the inventory as tight as possible right up to the introduction of the new product. Otherwise the markdowns would be pretty substantial.'' 
 So this software is nothing but bad news for the consumer, right? Actually, it has been good news. ''There are fewer Oh-my-god bargains,'' said Ron Boire, executive vice president and general merchandise manager for Best Buy, ''but now all customers are getting a good price instead of a few customers getting a great price.'' 
 Wal-Mart, the first big retailer to get a handle on its inventory, hired economists at Global Insight to estimate how much it had saved consumers. The answer they came up with was $20 billion a year. Best Buy estimated that it was saving $10 million a year just on freight expenses because it ships to stores only what it needs to ship. It has also cut factory-to-store delivery to 4 weeks from 20 weeks, which removes risk of holding too much inventory and allows Best Buy to lower prices. 
 Mr. Sullivan of Panasonic said that retailing had changed markedly in the last five years because of the amount of data that is available and shared. ''The whole goal is to drive out costs and that is a win for consumers,'' he said. 
 The new 37-inch plasma screen from Panasonic, for example, costs $200 more than the current model, but it has a screen with better contrast. 
 ''As new products come out, consumers tend to get a better deal on the new products because they are getting more technology at a better price,'' Mr. Scaglione said. (Again, the exception is in the kitchen. Prices have been going up each year partly because of the rising price of stainless steel, the preferred finish for appliances.)
 While it might make more economic sense for merchants to maximize profits by holding prices firm during the buying season, Steven Baker, who analyzes the consumer electronics industry for NPD, said the opposite was true. 
 ''In an era of lean inventory and tight supply chains, the retailer is better off driving sales when consumers are willing to buy.'' A result, said Mr. Waynick of Sony: ''It's all on sale all the time. The sale has lost some of its impact with consumers because everything is on sale sometime someplace.'' 
 Indeed, a recent survey by Forrester Research showed that price was overwhelmingly the factor that influenced where, when and which consumer electronic product was bought. (The one exception is a new desktop computer, which was purchased when the old one needed to be replaced.) 
 So is there still a way to game the system? Yes, but it takes a little more diligence. You have to avoid impulse buying, but still be ready to pounce quickly.

KNOW YOUR PRODUCT. Web sites like Engadget.com and Gizmodo.com are places to gather information on product releases. News.com and Twice.com also track developments that come out of trade shows like the Consumer Electronics Show in January or the Photo Marketing Association conference in late February. Say you have an eye on a 5- or 6-megapixel digital camera. Hewlett-Packard's R727 will replace the R717, so keep an eye on that. Or watch for action on Fuji's Finepix F10, which is being replaced by the F60.
 NexTag.com, Shopping.com, Froogle.com and other price-comparison sites allow you to study which reputable dealer is also aggressive on price.

MONITOR THE PRICES. Watch the Sunday circulars or review them at SundaySaver.com. NexTag has a number of useful features to help you track price cuts. It e-mails you when a product finally drops to the price you are willing to pay. The site also lists products that recently had price cuts. The list is heavy on computer gear, but late last week it was showing a 60-inch liquid-crystal-display TV made by LG that was shaved 6 percent, to $6,700.

WAIT FOR YOUR PRICE. NexTag also displays price history charts. You can divine a little from those as well. A constantly downward sloping line suggests that the manufacturer has control of inventory and prices are dropping at a natural ''electronics just get cheaper'' pace. That means there's not much you can do. Anything you buy will be cheaper a month from now.
 But a flat line that also shows some abrupt drops, however small, suggests a struggling product. A need to outflank a competitor with price promotions or trim growing inventories can cause that pattern. If the line is flat for a while, hold off buying. It will drop soon enough. 
 It always does.

HEADLINE: Want to Rally The Troops? Try Candor

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
INC. magazine's cover article this month is an excerpt from a new book by its best-known writer, Bo Burlingham. The book is entitled ''Small Giants: Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big,'' and it aims to do for small private companies what ''In Search of Excellence'' did two decades ago for big public companies: shine a light on a handful of business practices the author admires, and which he believes are the reason some companies consistently do better than others. 
 Mr. Burlingham, 59, joined Inc. in 1983, just after its fourth birthday, and in many ways ''Small Giants'' is a distillation of the knowledge he and the magazine have acquired over the years. Mr. Burlingham believes that the entrepreneurs who run the companies he profiles -- CitiStorage in New York, Anchor Brewing in San Francisco and 12 others -- have a set of values that go well beyond making a profit. They are incredibly passionate about what they're doing. They have relationships with customers and suppliers that go far beyond the norm. They believe strongly in creating a working environment that addresses employees' ''creative, emotional, spiritual, and social needs as well as economic ones.'' And many of them use something called open book management-- a term Inc. coined in 1990.
Open book management refers to the practice of making a private company's financial information available to all employees. This is anathema to many small-business owners, but its proponents believe it can unlock a company's potential like nothing else. By sharing information with everyone, up and down the ranks -- and by educating employees about what the information means, and what their role is in helping the company improve -- open book management ''can change people's lives forever,'' said Jack Stack, the chief executive of SRC Holdings, a manufacturing company that has been using it for over two decades. ''They go from entitlement to entrepreneurial,'' he added. 
 Although Mr. Burlingham was not the Inc. writer who coined the phrase, he is the journalist most closely associated with open book management, writing two books with Mr. Stack, and helping him set up a conference division to spread the open book gospel. He has also written numerous articles in Inc. promoting its benefits. According to a survey Inc. conducted last year, 40 percent of the companies in the Inc. 500 -- the magazine's annual list of the fastest-growing private company in the United States -- use some form of open book management.
 And now, add one more: Mansueto Ventures, a new private company that owns two magazines, and which lost over $10 million last year on revenue of about $40 million. One of the company's magazines is Fast Company. The other is Inc. Which means that Bo Burlingham -- and everyone else at Inc. -- will finally be practicing what they've been preaching all these years. 
 INC. has been to hell and back since the end of the dot-com boom. Founded by a Boston entrepreneur named Bernard Goldhirsh, the magazine had a prosperous first two decades of life. At the exact moment entrepreneurship was finally getting its due in America, Inc. spoke directly to the entrepreneurial class. ''Think of the companies we covered back then,'' said George Gendron, who edited Inc. from 1980 to 2002. ''Timberland, Patagonia, Oracle. We were all growing up and discovering business together.''
 Mr. Goldhirsh was hardly the open book type. ''Bernie was always worried that open book would limit him in some way,'' Mr. Burlingham said. According to Mr. Gendron, the founder eventually lost much of his passion for the business, which was humming along nicely without his day-to-day involvement.
 Then, two things happened. In 2000, Mr. Goldhirsh learned he had brain cancer. The news caused him to sell Inc., for the astounding price of $200 million, to Gruner & Jahr, the magazine division of the German media giant Bertelsmann. A short time later, G. &J. paid an even more astounding $350 million to purchase Fast Company, a seven-year-old magazine that had had an instant and dizzying success. (Mr. Goldhirsh died in 2003.) 
 The second thing that happened, of course, was that business magazines fell off a cliff. Practically from the moment G. &J. bought Fast Company, the magazine began hemorrhaging money, as the dot-com ads that had made it fat and profitable disappeared. Inc. wasn't doing as poorly, but its ad pages were in steep decline as well. G. &J. made a bad situation worse by dictating strategic shifts for magazines it didn't understand. The lowest moment was probably when the company told all its United States magazines to reorganize themselves to replicate Child magazine, because it was the most frugally run of the company's properties.
 Finally, in May 2005, G. &J. gave up, and put Fast Company and Inc. on the block. The executives of the two magazines took matters into their own hands and found a buyer in Joe Mansueto, an entrepreneur who had started Morningstar, the hugely successful mutual fund monitoring and research company. He paid $32.5 million for the two properties.
 Inc.'s editor during most of the dark days was John Koten, 51, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who signed on in 2002, after a 10-year stint editing Worth, the personal finance magazine. Mr. Koten spent at least as much time trying to keep the ship afloat as editing a magazine: fending off the German owners as best he could, managing cutbacks to minimize the damage, and trying to maintain some semblance of morale in the midst of the turmoil. 
 He also led the effort to find a buyer when the magazines were put up for sale. The process of trying to save Inc. made Mr. Koten realize that he had become extraordinarily passionate about the magazine and the subject it covered. ''Entrepreneurs,'' he told me, ''are the ones adding jobs and changing the economy. But they are an untold story because most business journalists only cover big companies.'' When Mr. Mansueto was searching for a chief executive for Mansueto Ventures, he concluded that Mr. Koten's passion made him the logical candidate.
 One way Mr. Koten kept the place together during the G. &J. era was by lifting the veil of secrecy. ''He was straightforward with both good news and bad,'' said Loren Feldman, Inc.'s deputy editor. Employees appreciated it; Mr. Koten proudly points out that not a single Inc. editorial employee left during the bad days. But he also admits that he took the open approach mainly because ''it was what felt most comfortable to me.''
 Then, after the deal with Mr. Mansueto was struck, Mr. Koten assigned Mr. Burlingham to write a lengthy account of the sale. Although the article's publication was resisted by much of the staff, Mr. Koten views its publication as a turning point, the first step toward an open book approach. ''Telling our own story was a gesture of the kind of company I wanted us to become,'' he said.
 He began a series of discussions with Mr. Burlingham about formally instituting open book management at Mansueto Ventures. Mr. Burlingham was predictably enthusiastic. The two men traveled to Missouri and spent several days visiting Jack Stack's operation at SRC. For all the many articles Inc. has published about open book management, Mr. Koten still found the visit eye-opening. ''We sat in on a big open book meeting where all the employees were gathered,'' he recalled. ''People would get up and ask why the costs were so high in this area or that. You never see that at a big company. Employees never get to connect what they do all day with the overall success of the business.''
 After he returned to New York, Mr. Koten sent out a survey to the staff, using questions modeled on the surveys Mr. Stack uses at SRC. In early January, Mr. Koten took the next step toward open book, writing a long memo to the staff about the survey results. ''Your trust in the senior management here is higher than I expected,'' he wrote. ''The reason that surprised me is that I think that I and the rest of the senior management team still have a lot to prove to you about our ability to steer this company.'' He told the staff that the company was probably going to lose more than $10 million in 2005, and that its goal was to cut that deficit in half this year. 
 ''One of the things I've learned about open book is that it is hard,'' said John Case, a former Inc. writer (and the man who did coin the phrase). ''It takes a passionate leader. It takes sustained commitment. It involves a lot of training, and a lot of work. There is a lot more involved than just opening the books.'' Mr. Koten held his first big all-employee open book meeting yesterday. The process has begun.
 ''We have a big job ahead of us,'' Mr. Burlingham said. Then he smiled. ''And now, everybody here knows just how big a job it is.''
 Many readers chided me for writing last week that if you send an iPod to Apple to have the battery replaced you lose all your data. They noted, correctly, that so long as your music is stored in iTunes, you can easily download it onto the new iPod Apple sends you. When I wrote that line I was thinking of situations -- which happen more often than you'd imagine -- where your computer has crashed, and the iPod is the only place your music is stored. But when I pointed this out to a few of my correspondents, their rejoinder was swift: you should always back up the data on your computer. In the modern age, a computer crash is as inevitable as death and taxes.

HEADLINE: Volkswagen To Eliminate 20,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
Job losses continue to ripple through the German auto industry, as Volkswagen announced Friday that it planned to eliminate up to 20,000 jobs in the next three years.
 The reductions are part of a program to streamline Volkswagen, which has been struggling with a stagnant home market, a fading presence in the United States and fierce new competition in China.
Volkswagen delivered this downbeat news even as it said it had begun to reap dividends from its last cost-cutting campaign. It reported a preliminary net profit of 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in 2005, an increase of 61 percent over the previous year and well above the expectations of analysts. 
 Analysts expect Volkswagen to achieve the bulk of these cuts through voluntary measures, including buyouts and early retirements. In a 2004 agreement with its union, the company pledged not to lay off workers until 2011 in return for a freeze in wages and concessions in work rules.
 Volkswagen, which employs 103,000 people in Germany, has warned about job losses for months. But until now, it has avoided putting a precise number on them. The company said such deep reductions were the only way to preserve Germany's future in manufacturing.
 ''We continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from Germany to the U.S.A.,'' the chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder, said in a statement. ''In order to ensure a secure long-term future for the group, we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face.'' The depth of the cuts -- nearly 6 percent of its worldwide work force of about 336,000 -- impressed investors, as did the earnings. Shares of Volkswagen rose nearly 10 percent here to close at a three-year high.
 ''If they do everything they announced today, they are on a sound basis to be solidly profitable by 2009,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer , director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen.
 By Mr. Dudenhoffer's calculation, Volkswagen needs to reduce its payroll by at least 15,000 to be competitive with the industry's most efficient carmakers. Volkswagen, he said, should be able to reach its goal, thanks partly to a deal with the union that lets workers retire at age 58.
 He said Volkswagen might also sell subsidiaries that make auto parts, further slimming its payroll.
 The union, IG Metall, reacted cautiously, saying Volkswagen's announcement left a lot of open questions. Indeed, aside from pledging to adhere to its agreement not to lay off workers involuntarily, Volkswagen said little about which factories would suffer the heaviest losses.
 Volkswagen is only the latest German carmaker to announce a five-digit job cut. DaimlerChrysler plans to eliminate 14,500 jobs at its Mercedes-Benz division. Opel, a unit of General Motors, is cutting 12,000 jobs.
 The cutbacks in Germany are a stark contrast to the atmosphere in France, where Renault announced a four-year plan on Thursday that included no job losses. Renault's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said he would restore profits with a raft of new models and increased sales outside Europe.
 Mr. Ghosn made his reputation turning around Nissan Motor of Japan -- a process that also entailed sweeping job losses. Some analysts think Renault's growth strategy is riskier than Volkswagen's strict diet.
 ''I was surprised that Carlos Ghosn's plan did not include any job reductions,'' Mr. Dudenhoffer said. ''My feeling is that Renault will have a long way to go, without adjusting its cost structure.''
 At Volkswagen, Wolfgang Bernhard, the company's No. 2 executive, is leading the effort to turn around the flagship VW brand. He came from Chrysler, where he and his former boss, Dieter Zetsche, eliminated 26,000 jobs as part of an overhaul that salvaged that company. Mr. Zetsche is now the chief executive, and chief cost-cutter, at DaimlerChrysler.
 A crucial part of Mr. Bernhard's strategy is rebuilding Volkswagen's presence in the United States, where its market share has dwindled to 1.5 percent. It plans to introduce several new models there.
 Volkswagen has extracted concessions from its German workers by threatening to assemble new models outside the country. It recently agreed to build a new sport utility vehicle at its flagship plant in Wolfsburg rather than in Portugal -- but only after winning a 20 percent reduction in wages.
 Volkswagen's simultaneous announcement of better profits and job losses helps explain why the revival of Germany's corporate sector has not yet spilled over into the broader economy. Profits are rebounding, but few companies are hiring, and many, like Volkswagen, continue to cut.
 That has left the unemployment rate above 10 percent, not far from its highest level in the post-world-war period. Without evidence of jobs being created, economists say, German consumers are unlikely to begin spending, which would lift the country's anemic growth rate.

HEADLINE: And on the Eighth Day, God Went Green

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
And on the eighth day, God said, Let there be a thermostat for the heavens and the earth, and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let no man adjust it more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius, until the end of time. 
 Now that evangelical Christians have joined the battle against global warming, we may as well acknowledge that America has one truly national religion: environmentalism. 
Its tenets, already taken for granted in the blue states, were embraced this week by the Christian leaders who formed the Evangelical Climate Initiative. They haven't yet rewritten Genesis, but their advertising campaign warns of ''millions of deaths'' from biblical scourges -- floods, droughts, pestilence -- unless humans make a ''sacred commitment'' to stop global warming.
 It may look odd for evangelicals to be taking up Hollywood's most fashionable cause, but the alliance makes perfect sense. Environmentalism has always fundamentally been a religion -- ''Calvinism minus God,'' in the words of Robert Nelson, a professor of environmental policy at the University of Maryland. He calls the global warming debate the latest example of environmentalist creationism.
 The Puritans and other Calvinists believed that God was revealed not just in Scripture but also in the ''Book of Nature.'' To them, the wilderness was an unchanged record of God's handiwork at ''the Creation,'' offering a glimpse of the world before man's pride and sinfulness alienated him from nature and caused him to be expelled from Eden. 
 Environmentalists have had similar notions, starting with John Muir, who considered nature ''a mirror reflecting the Creator.'' Al Gore urged the ''moral courage'' to secure ''our place within creation.'' When Bruce Babbitt was secretary of the interior, he called plants and animals ''a direct reflector of divinity,'' and he warned Americans not to ''recklessly destroy the patterns of creation.'' 
 There is one large problem with this version of creationism. The world we see was not created in a week, and it has looked a lot different in the past.
 The forests that seemed divine to the Puritans and to Muir and Babbitt were not present at the Creation. They were merely the latest adaptation to changing climatic conditions and competition with other species, including humans -- Indians had been managing the forests by cutting trees and setting fires. There is no such thing as a ''natural'' forest in America, Nelson writes, unless you reject creationism and define nature as ''the Darwinian vision of unremitting struggle for survival.'' 
 Darwin's Book of Nature isn't as morally satisfying as Calvin's, at least not for those who enjoy berating Americans for their sinful desires to cut down trees and burn fossil fuels. But it does make for a clearer way to think about global warming. Instead of assuming that humans will be punished for tinkering with God's handiwork, you can consider the best strategy for our species' survival.
 That means rejecting the assumption that we must immediately start atoning for our excesses. Solutions like the Kyoto treaty amount to expensive hair shirts that appeal to penitents but not necessarily to economists. Even economists who support the Kyoto treaty acknowledge that it will make only a small difference far in the future while imposing serious costs today. 
 And those costs seem too high to other economists, like the four Nobel laureates and their colleagues who met in Copenhagen in 2004 to study proposals to help the world's poor. The Copenhagen Consensus, as they called it, was that programs to slow global warming are one of the worst investments -- far less worthwhile than programs to immediately combat disease and improve drinking water and sanitation. 
 Saving lives now makes more sense than spending large sums to avert biblical punishments that may never come. Scientists agree that the planet seems to be warming, but their models are so crude that they're unsure about how much it will heat up or how much damage will be done. There's a chance the warming could be mild enough to produce net benefits. 
 For now, the best strategy is to refine the forecasts and look for the cheapest and least painful ways to counteract global warming, including heretical ideas like geo-engineering schemes to cool the planet by blocking sunlight. It's hard today to imagine how that would be done -- or how environmentalists would ever allow something so ''unnatural.'' But maybe they could be convinced that we're just resetting God's thermostat back to the eighth day of Creation.

HEADLINE: Gretzky's Presence Will Be Distraction

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy 

 BODY:
JUST when the 2006 Winter Olympics seemed likely to be swallowed whole by this greater metropolitan area of almost two million, along came confirmation that Wayne Gretzky will ride a mighty tailwind of fresh gambling scandal here, setting the stage for the follow-up spectacle to the spirited pageantry of the opening ceremony last night.
 ''It's not an issue, no one connected to the Olympics has been charged,'' Michael Chambers, the president of the Canadian Olympic Committee, said yesterday. ''The gambling, that's in North America, not here.'' 
Not until Gretzky steps off a plane early next week with the Canadian men's hockey team, the gold-medal favorite that he helped put together as executive director. Then will come more obsession with celebrity and subterfuge, and central to it all will be the Canadians, just as they were in Salt Lake City four years ago. 
 Missing the big picture, the Olympic karma so colorfully on display last night, Gretzky will show up, he insisted Thursday night after coaching the Phoenix Coyotes. He will not hide, he said, because he is connected to the busting of a gambling ring only by marriage (to Janet Jones) and friendship (with Rick Tocchet, his coaching assistant).
 Confronted with the sticky attachment of Gretzky, their long unassailable national icon, to a sordid sports tale, Canadian Olympic officials said they had no reason to disbelieve him, or consider asking that he and his wife stay home.
 ''I look forward to his arrival,'' Chambers said, putting on his bravest bureaucratic face, lecturing combative Canadian journalists that the impact of the Gretzky issue was in their hands, ultimately on their conscience. 
 ''The story will go where the story will go -- that's the nature of the press,'' Chambers said, apparently forgetting how Canadian officials played the news media in 2002 when it suited them, going nuclear with protests of judging that temporarily deprived their pairs figure skaters, David Pelletier and Jamie Sale, of gold. 
 For better or worse, superstar mania is also the nature of the modern Olympics, which has struck its double-edged deal with the big-ticket athlete. As if the Olympics didn't have a firestorm brand of its own, ambitious caretakers invited famous multimillionaires to compete in the neighborhood of those with more eclectic passions to boost the almighty television take.
 Across the Olympic landscape, bigger has pathologically meant better, and here we are, spread out wide in a metropolis largely devoid of the winter festival quaintness that once characterized the Games. The staging costs have become daunting even for cities like Vancouver, the 2010 host, currently swathed in inflationary construction overruns that weren't on the agenda yesterday when Chambers and company promoted their agenda to change the country's competitive culture.
 At a morning news conference, he and Chris Rudge, the chief executive of the C.O.C., said Canadians were here to win more medals than anyone except for Germany and the United States. They will aim for a rousing hometown run at the top in 2010. Then they opened up the floor for questions, but no one wanted to know about the medals to come, only what the officials thought about Gretzky's coming.
 ''To infer that we may do something on conjecture would be unfair to Mr. Gretzky,'' Rudge said. ''We're proud to have him here, and Mr. Gretzky deserves it based on the life he's led, which has been exemplary.''
 But this is not about innocence or guilt, just cause and effect. Chambers and Rudge are in a no-win position, between the Canadian Elvis and the Olympians whose time is now. How do they get Canadian reporters to ask about the speedskaters and snowboarders when Gretzky hasn't answered reports about being caught on a wiretap discussing with Tocchet his wife's exposure in the case brought by the New Jersey state police?
 ''They haven't been ignored yet,'' Rudge said, referring to the Canadian Olympians. ''Clearly, the story has the potential to divert some of the attention they would normally get.'' 
 If the allegations are true, if Tocchet is tied to organized crime, if there is even the sniff of gambling on hockey, this could become much worse for the N.H.L. and possibly for Gretzky -- notwithstanding his wife's claim Thursday that ''at no time did I ever place a wager on my husband's behalf, period.''
 End of story? Not likely. It is going to last well beyond these Olympics, which began on a clear, cold night in an old soccer stadium ordered built by Mussolini in 1933, with the guest list ranging from Yoko Ono to Sophia Loren. 
 White rain slickers were handed out to fans to create the illusion of snow in this bone-dry city. Whatever the forecast, we can confidently predict a news media blizzard when Gretzky hits town, barring a change of heart that would be well advised. He should stay home, weather the storm.
 In Phoenix Thursday night, Gretzky understandably asked reporters to respect his privacy, saying, ''I hope you appreciate that these three days have been horrible.''
 Couldn't have been fun, and he doesn't need to make it worse by coming here to be chased by the world, or at least the part that needs no further introduction to him than the Great One. The Olympics doesn't need another Canadian cloud over it. The athletes don't need to get caught in the shadow of a New Jersey sting.

HEADLINE: Never Mind the Solitaire; Explain What the IX Is For

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
In the beginning there was Edouard-Etienne de Nevers, sieur de Brantigny, later known as Edouard Boisvert. He immigrated to Quebec from France and in 1654 settled along the St. Lawrence on a prime plot he bought for a cow and two barrels of pickled eel.
 In the middle was Edouard Antoine Boisvert V, who moved down to Massachusetts and Anglicized the family name to Greenwood. 
Today, history lives on near Albany, N.Y., where Edward Anthony Greenwood IX, late of the New York City Office of State Legislative Affairs, became nationally famous two days ago as the man who was fired after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spotted a game of solitaire on his computer screen.
 To some, Mr. Greenwood has become a symbol of arbitrary injustice, dismissed for doing what millions do every day. Others who are less charitable have called him the living embodiment of the public employee work ethic.
 But enough about the solitaire incident. What's with that IX? What man who does not rule a large country has a number like that after his name? 
 The executive director of the National Genealogical Society, Diane O'Connor, said she had never run across anyone higher than a V. ''Off the top of my head,'' she said, ''I would say that it is unusual.'' 
 She did not, however, rule it out, and researchers at the University of Montreal said that many French Canadians can trace their roots back a dozen generations, thanks to excellent record-keeping by the early settlers.
 Edward IX said he had never doubted his bloodline. His half sister, Denise Reneau, who researched the family's history, said she was sure the numerical claim is legitimate. Their father, Edward VIII, said carrying on the family name had been a passion of Edward VII, an uncle who had no children of his own.
 So assuming that the Edward Greenwood/Boisverts are indeed that rare family that has kept a name alive for centuries, and across an ocean, what have they been up to all these years? And what is it like being a IX? 
 Edward IX said that for most of his life, it has not been a big deal. ''A lot of times people see IX and just put IV because they think it's a V, not an X, or that I wrote it wrong,'' he said.
 As for the family history, the Greenwood/Boisverts turn out to be your average American family. In 1888, Ms. Reneau said, Edward V's estranged wife had him over for tea and forgot to rinse out the lye she had used to clean the kettle. ''Supposedly she killed him,'' she said. 
 A relative, Chester Greenwood of Maine, invented earmuffs. Edward VI had nine children. Edward VII was a chief petty officer in World War II who, Ms. Reneau said, survived the sinking of an aircraft carrier thanks in part to the fishing skills he inherited from his great-great-great-great grandfather the eeler. 
 Edward VII's brother Arthur was the first chiropractor in Pittsfield, Mass., to have an X-ray machine. ''He loved to stand in front of it to show his patients how you could see your ribs and all that,'' Edward VIII said. ''Needless to say he died from overexposure.''
 Edward VIII, 66, himself was a railroad conductor for 30 years and an accomplished bluegrass musician.
 Which brings us to Edward IX, 39, of Ravena, N.Y., who is also a gifted bluegrass guitarist and singer, but that's not all. He is a trained operating-room technician, a certified airplane mechanic and a former Greyhound bus driver. He is a member of a single-malt Scotch society. He knows quite a bit about cheese.
 ''I've been referred to as a renaissance man,'' he said.
 As of yesterday, though, he was the former sole breadwinner for a family of three, freshly unemployed and uninsured. His son, Edward X, age 3 1/2, sat in the next room, watching an old Superman episode on TV.
 Edward IX said he hoped that out of all this publicity he might get a job. He was asked if the illustrious numeral might help his resume. 
 ''Maybe that'll be a bolster to my cachet,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Congress's Duty on Energy

 BODY:
Senator Pete Domenici told a recent gathering of experts that if Congress is going to do anything useful this year about the two big energy-related questions of our time -- oil dependency and global warming -- it will have to focus on ''four or five big things'' instead of the usual laundry list of tax breaks, subsidies and modest research programs. 
 A New Mexico Republican who runs the Senate energy committee, Mr. Domenici has become something of a Senate visionary on energy policy. With Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, he co-sponsored a resolution that not only accepted the basic science of global warming but also endorsed mandatory controls on emissions of carbon dioxide. The realist in him knows that this Congress is unlikely to take either of the steps (much less both) that would be most likely to lower oil consumption as well as greenhouse gases: a big increase in fuel economy standards and a big gasoline tax.
But he is willing to entertain other incentives to produce fuel-efficient cars, to develop fuels other than gasoline -- most likely ethanol, not just from corn but from other crops -- and to build a new generation of power plants capable of capturing carbon dioxide before it goes into the atmosphere. Mr. Domenici's vision of the future also includes safer, less expensive nuclear plants, which have the virtue of generating no greenhouse gases.
 There are several legislative vehicles at hand for achieving some of these objectives. One is the Fuel Choices for American Security Act of 2005. There are identical versions in both houses, each with broadly bipartisan sponsorship, including conservatives who would normally resist federal mandates but who believe that reducing oil consumption is an urgent matter of national security.
 The bill would establish a goal for fuel savings of 2.5 million barrels a day (about what we now import from the Persian Gulf), increasing to 7.5 million barrels by 2025. It would also provide some of the means to get there, including serious production incentives for a new generation of cars and fuels.
 Although the bill does not address other imperatives, like cleaner power plants, it would have a positive spillover effect on global warming because fuel-efficient cars and trucks would produce lower greenhouse gases. The question is whether Congress can focus on the big issues without engaging in the diversionary food fights that every energy bill seems to inspire. 
 It will be hard for someone not to raise red flags like drilling in the Arctic, or for Congress in general not to indulge its appetite for pork. But with even President Bush signing on (at least in speeches) to the need for a new energy future, this is not the time for business as usual.

HEADLINE: Finance Ministers Meet Warily in Russia 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
Finance ministers from the Group of 8 industrialized nations arrived Friday on a frosty, sunny day for a weekend meeting that is sure to revive doubts on Russia's membership in the club.
 For the first time, Russia, which holds the chairmanship this year, will be the host of the meeting of the G-8, whose other members are Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Canada and Japan.
The ministers attended a concert of Russia's top opera singers on Friday evening at the Kremlin; formal meetings begin Saturday. 
 The chairmanship brings Russia status, and it is an acknowledgment of the surging growth it has achieved on energy exports, as well as its recovery from the post-Communist implosion of the 1990's. But the position also renews a debate on whether the country under President Vladimir V. Putin should even be in the G-8, much less lead a club of capitalist democracies, a description some say only loosely applies to Russia.
 ''Clearly, Russia doesn't measure up,'' Hugh Barnes, director of the Russia program at the Foreign Policy Center, a British research center, said Friday in a telephone interview.
 Mr. Barnes cited the values expressed by the founding members of the club, then the Group of 6, in 1975 in Rambouillet, France. Besides economic principles, like low inflation and free trade, the group stressed democratic governance, he said. 
 ''Should a country that clearly doesn't meet the criteria hold the presidency?'' he asked.
 The two subjects Russia is expected to focus on may not necessarily help its profile. Its choice of a theme for its term at the helm, energy security, turned into an embarrassment after a natural gas pricing and transit dispute with Ukraine, a fight that risked leaving Europe short of fuel last month. The Kremlin is likely to be questioned closely on its reliability as a supplier. Some nations are also seeking some loosening of Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom. 
 Russia also wants to focus on a debt-relief program for the developing world. Russia has said it will pre-pay $11 billion to $12 billion of Soviet-era debt in the first half of this year. It is proposing that G-8 governments transfer those payments to the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, which would use that cash to cancel third world debt.
 But Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, has more than the means to pay its debt; holding onto the cash runs a risk of overvaluing the ruble and hurting exports. In addition, the sacrifice proposed in the plan applies only to the creditor nations, not to Russia itself.
 The World Bank's director, Paul D. Wolfowitz, was scheduled to attend the talks in Moscow on Saturday, Russia's minister of economy, Aleksei L. Kudrin, said this week. 
 Russia is also sponsoring a discussion on creating a uniform system of accounting for oil reserves. Mr. Kudrin said that would improve the accuracy of oil price projections by reducing uncertainty on supply. ''Projections in the market now are very weak,'' he said. Russia will also discuss encouraging investment to increase oil production amid extremely tight world supplies.
 Mr. Kudrin also said Russia was fighting money laundering in Central Asia, where drug money from Afghanistan's heroin trade is cycled through the banking system. Russia spends $3 million a year on this program, he said. 
 Still, some critics were not convinced Russia was ready to take a leadership role in a club of wealthy democracies, a question that has dogged the country since it joined under President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 Russia's economy is not among the eight largest in the world; it is in 10th place. Mr. Putin countered that last week, saying Russia's presence would keep the G-8 from becoming an ''assembly of fat cats'' because his country still sees economic problems from the perspective of a developing nation. 
 Barry F. Lowenkron, an assistant United States secretary of state, cited a new law in Russia that strictly monitors nongovernment organizations, and the persecution of a Russian-Chechen Friendship Society. Speaking to Congress on Wednesday, he said the current trajectory on democracy was ''discouraging.'' 
 The United States ''will speak honestly about our concerns with Russian officials; we do this as a friend of Russia,'' he said. Some members of Congress have even suggested ousting Russia from G-8 for democratic backsliding.
 Yevgeny G. Yasin, who was economy minister when Russia joined the Group of 8 in 1998, said membership was seen then as an incentive for the country to make greater economic and political reforms. 
 That has changed with Mr. Putin's emphasis on oil and gas exports as a rationale for Russia's membership, he said. Russia is still excluded from some of the group's financial meetings. 
 ''I'm afraid the Western community will stop relating to Russia as a member of the club, but as a source of energy,'' he said in an interview Friday. ''That would be a shame. You relate differently to a member of your family than to a trading partner.''
 He added, ''This is a democratic club, and Russia should fit in. If it doesn't, there should be a timeline'' to meet the standards.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Sets Record, With China and Oil the Causes

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened to a record $726 billion in 2005, the government reported yesterday, adding more fuel to the increasingly partisan debate between advocates of further globalization and those who contend that free trade is causing the loss of too many American manufacturing jobs.
 Hitting its fourth consecutive annual record, the gap between exports and imports reached almost twice the level of 2001. It was driven by strong consumer demand for foreign goods and soaring energy prices that added tens of billions of dollars to the nation's bill for imported oil. The nation last had a trade surplus, of $12.4 billion, in 1975.
The continued growth in the trade deficit, particularly with China, is likely to renew a fight in Congress as early as this spring over President Bush's trade policies. Lawmakers have seized on the growing imbalance with China to call on the White House to take a harder line with Beijing over its currency practices.
 But as long as the American economy is growing faster than most of its trading partners and energy prices stay at elevated levels, economists expect little improvement, and perhaps even a slight widening, in the trade imbalance this year. 
 ''You would need a dramatic slowdown in domestic U.S. demand to bring down the U.S. trade deficit, and we think that is unlikely,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital in New York.
 That means the nation will go deeper into debt with the rest of the world as Americans continue to rely on the strong flow of foreign money, particularly from central banks in Asia, to finance the trade gap. China, Japan and other foreign governments are some of the biggest holders of government securities, lending money to cover the substantial federal budget deficit and helping to keep interest rates and home mortgage costs here relatively low.
 As a result, American consumers are able to spend more and save less.
 Many economists say this situation is unsustainable over the long run, arguing that the United States could eventually face a harsh correction that would depress spending, increase the cost of borrowing and sharply lower the value of the dollar.
 ''There are certainly going to be inflows, the question is at what price?'' said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS, an investment house. ''As time goes on, it will become a little more difficult to attract foreign funds. That's another way of saying the dollar will fall.''
 But other economists argue that the huge trade gap mostly reflects stronger American growth and that money is flowing into the country at relatively low rates because of the attractiveness of the United States as a place to invest. They see little reason to fear a dollar crisis.
 ''As long as foreigners are willing to put their capital in the United States, we can sustain a trade deficit of 6 percent or more'' of overall economic activity, said Phillip L. Swagel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington who served as a staff economist for President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
 ''It would be better that we saved more on our own,'' Mr. Swagel added, ''but given that we aren't, I would rather have investment go on by foreign capital.''
 For its part, the Bush administration urged caution on the deficit.
 Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez, touring an I.B.M. operation in North Carolina, told The Associated Press, ''We can't overreact and make tactical choices that will hurt our economy.''
 As a share of the gross domestic product, the trade gap increased to 5.8 percent, from 5.3 percent in 2004 and 4.5 percent in 2003.
 While most economists dismiss the importance of bilateral trade imbalances, it is the deficit with China that has set off the most political fireworks. That nation had the largest gap with the United States of any country, at $201.6 billion for the year, up 24.5 percent from 2004. In December, the deficit with China narrowed nearly 12 percent, to $16.3 billion.
 Following increased pressure from the White House, the Chinese government allowed the yuan to rise by about 2 percent in July and allowed its currency to float in a narrow band. Since then the yuan, also known as the renminbi, has risen by an additional 0.7 percent. One dollar buys about 8.0505 yuan.
 A stronger Chinese currency would make imports to the United States more expensive and American exports to that country cheaper. Most analysts agree the yuan would rise significantly if it were set free, but many experts also worry that many financial institutions in China are not strong enough to survive the shocks that might accompany a fully convertible currency.
 In the Senate, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have proposed imposing a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese imports if the country does not allow its currency to appreciate further against the dollar. Late last year, the senators agreed to hold off on the measure after the Senate voted against stopping a floor vote on it.
 Mr. Schumer said ''there is a very strong likelihood that we will move our bill in March should the Chinese not show further movements.''
 ''If you believe in free trade, you play by the rules,'' he said when asked if a protectionist tariff would hurt the American economy. ''The long-term damage of the Chinese pegging their currency far exceeds any immediate benefits and almost every economist would agree with that. They might not agree with our methodology.''
 Experts note that a large portion of the deficit with China reflects its growing role as a hub for the assembly of goods as Asian manufacturers have shifted production there to save money. The overall deficit with Asia has changed little in recent years. 
 Bush administration officials have said they, too, would like to see the yuan appreciate further, but have contended that sanctions like a tariff would be counterproductive and would hurt consumers. This month, the Treasury Department urged the International Monetary Fund to improve its policing of currency manipulations by governments, without directly referring to China.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is expected to bring up the issue of exchange rates at a meeting of the Group of 8 finance ministers in Moscow this weekend.
 But even some longstanding advocates of free trade are growing increasingly frustrated with China's intransigence on the currency front, warning that it may be inviting protectionist legislation by repeatedly deflecting Washington's requests.
 ''The administration,'' said C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, ''has to let the Chinese know that it may not be able to stop it even though it doesn't want it.''
 While China draws most of the attention, perhaps the most important factor behind the swelling deficit last year was the rising cost of importing oil and other energy supplies. Trade in petroleum products accounted for 29 percent of the total deficit, up from 25 percent in 2004. Imports of petroleum goods climbed 39 percent, to $251.6 billion, after rising by 39 percent in 2004.
 Over all, the deficit jumped nearly 18 percent in 2005 compared with the previous year. Excluding oil and other petroleum products, the trade gap grew by 10 percent.
 After China, the United States' second-biggest deficit was with Japan, at $82.7 billion, up 9.4 percent, followed by Canada, a big supplier of oil and natural gas, at $76.5 billion, up 15.1 percent. 
 The deficit with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased by 29 percent, to $92.7 billion. For December, the trade deficit grew by 1.5 percent over the previous month, to $65.7 billion, as imports of computers, cars and airplanes rose and exports of planes, which had risen sharply in November, dropped. It was the third-largest monthly trade gap on record.
 And with oil prices rising again, said Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst for the MG Financial Group in New York, ''we can expect to see worse numbers to come.''

HEADLINE: RESPONSE ON LITHUANIA 

 BODY:

To the Editor: I read Denny Lee's three paragraphs (''Finding a Future in a Soviet Past,'' Jan. 22)on Lithuania and was greatly disappointed. 
 I am a 20-something Lithuanian who is in graduate school at Columbia University, so I confess I am a little defensive when I feel that my country is being portrayed negatively. The way Lithuania was mischaracterized in this article is unfortunate.
I would like to correct the impression that Lithuanians are in any way clinging to their Soviet past. They (we) are not. Lithuanians are intent on moving their country forward. A visit to Vilnius today will show you new construction (with modern architectural works), museums, shopping centers, and international restaurants.
 Lithuania is, indeed, trying hard to increase tourism, but to say that it is seeking to do this by showcasing all things Soviet is mistaken. 
 For example, Valdovu Rumai, an ancient palace in the center of Vilnius, is being rebuilt. Based on this, one could argue that Lithuanians are striving to revive their ancient (not Soviet) history. Any such characterization, however, would be an oversimplification. Lithuania, like any country, is embracing its history in a variety of ways as it seeks to move forward and become a strong member of the European Union.
 Speaking of which, evidence of Lithuania's desire to move forward (and not cling to its Soviet past) is clear from its impressive vote in favor of joining the European Union a couple of years ago.
 Granted, Grutas is a nice park, but it does not summarize a people. Even more, many view the park with irony, almost poking fun of the old Soviet ''gods'' of yore. A failure to grasp that irony makes the article, in my opinion, inaccurate.
 We Lithuanians cling to nothing but a hope for a brighter future as a free country that is a member of the E.U. The Soviet times are a dark spot on our history that we acknowledge, but are happy to be past. We may assemble statues honoring our former dictators in a park, but that does not mean we miss them. The presence of Stalin and Lenin in Grutas Park highlights their removal from town squares and public buildings across our country.

We make a round trip between London and New York each summer and would like to take Tigger, our border terrier puppy with us. We have been unable to find out the rules for onboard versus in-the-hold transport. Can you help? -- Chris and Frances Nowakowski, London
 
 Traveling with pets can be a daunting experience, and you'll find that some airlines are more pet-friendly than others. But before dealing with airlines, travelers should check regulations for countries they are traveling to or through, and make sure they have all the documents they need. 
 The United States, for instance, requires that your pet be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned before traveling on an airline, and you will need a health certificate from your vet. Information: www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/faq--animal--importation.htm.
American travelers flying into Britain are eligible for the European Union's Passport for Pets program. It allows dogs and cats from certain countries to enter Britain and other E.U. countries without the normal six-month quarantine, as long as they are fitted with a microchip tracking device (or a tattoo) and have been vaccinated against rabies. (Animals cannot enter Britain until six months after a blood test to show that the vaccine has worked.) Information: the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in Britain, www.defra.gov.uk.
 Airline policies vary. Many airlines, like Virgin Atlantic, www.virgin-atlantic.com, require that pets travel in the hold. British Airways, www.britishairways.com, makes an exception for guide dogs -- even offering them a seat next to their owner (space permitting) free of charge. The handling cost for checked pets on British Airways is $150 plus the price of transport, which depends on the pet's weight, the size of the container and the distance traveled. United Airlines, www.united.com, allows small dogs or cats to travel under the seat in a container 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches (the cost is $80 within the United States and between the United States and Canada; other international rates vary); larger animals are consigned to the hold. American Airlines, www.aa.com, does not accept carry-on pets to or from Hawaii, on trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific flights, or to Central and South America. 
 There are signs that airlines may be wooing pets in their battle for the hearts and minds of their accompanying owners. Midwest Airlines, www.midwestairlines.com, recently began allowing up to two small dogs in the cabin per flight; $100, one way. They must be transported in airline-approved carriers (they can be bought on the Midwest Web site). ROGER COLLIS

HEADLINE: Taipei

BYLINE: By MATT GROSS

 BODY:

WHY GO NOW -- In the last few years, Taipei -- the sprawling metropolis of 2.6 million that is the capital of Taiwan -- has leapt into modernity with a panache that puts the casino moguls of Macao and the skyscraper-erectors of Shanghai to shame.
 It's not just the hardware -- the tallest building in the world (for now), Wi-Fi coverage over more than half the city and a speedy and expanding subway system -- that is sophisticated. The people, too, embody all the complexities of a country that is at once forward-looking and historically aware, internationally plugged in but diplomatically isolated, and as multiculturally hybrid (influences include China, Japan and the United States) as it is full of hometown pride.
That pride has generated what may be Taipei's most vibrant cultural movement. It's called ''tai-ke,'' a phrase that originally meant ''redneck'' but has now come to encompass a youth-focused lifestyle that celebrates both the declasse (flip-flops, Long Life cigarettes) and the haute (Gucci, Macallan). 
 But tai ke is just one subculture among many in Taipei -- there are jazz fans and gay-rights activists, bohemians and aborigines, calligraphers and computer geeks -- and whatever the group identity, the motto generally is: Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we'll do it all over again.

WHERE TO STAY -- The Grand Hotel (1 Zhongshan North Road, Section 4, (886-2) 2886-8888; www.grand-hotel.org; rooms can be booked online from 5,500 Taiwan dollars (about $187, at about 31 Taiwan dollars to the United States dollar). Once the height of Taipei style, it still stands as a symbol of old-school Taiwan. If you want to feel like you're sleeping in a Ming emperor's palace (but with decor that feels dated rather than deluxe), this is the place for you.
 Sheraton -- in America a somewhat generic brand, but increasingly upscale abroad -- has filled the hole left by the gradual decline of the Grand Hotel, once the height of Tapei style. The Sheraton in Taipei, 12 Zhongxiao East Road, Section 1, (886-2) 2321-5511; on the Web at www.sheraton-taipei.com; doubles from 9,300 Taiwan dollars; reopened last summer following a three-year, $60 million renovation that transformed it into the hotel of choice for Taipei's elite (e.g., President Chen Shui-bian's son got married there).
 Taipei has a small but growing collection of boutique hotels, too. The newest is the Ambience Hotel, 64 Chang-An East Road, Section 1, (886-2) 2541-0077; on the Web at www.ambiencehotel.com.tw; doubles from 4,600 Taiwan dollars, 10 all-white stories filled with Philippe Starck and Ferruccio Laviani furniture, flat-screen televisions with video-on-demand systems, and Botanicus aromatherapy products.

WHERE TO EAT -- People in Taipei are so obsessed with food that they won't leave the house without the promise of a dumpling or a plate of stinky tofu (yes, it's a real dish) at their destination.
 Restaurants range from those offering quick bites like Ay-Chung Flour-Rice Noodle, 8-1 Er-Mei Street, (886-2) 2388-8808, which sells a thick, slightly sour noodle soup to standing-room-only crowds, to high-style establishments like Fifi, 15 Renai Road, Section 4, (886-2) 2721-1970 and (886-2) 2779-0528, which looks like something out of a Wong Kar-wai movie and has a great lunch special for 350 Taiwan dollars.
 Dishes from Sichuan province on the mainland are perennial favorites. The cutesy Kiki, 47 Alley 280, Guangfu South Road, (886-2) 2781-4250; offers exceptional renditions of Sichuan standards like fly's head (no insects here -- it's ground pork cooked with tons of fresh chilies) and dry-fried string beans.
 Regional Taiwanese food is coming to the fore as well: At state dinners, President Chen serves the surprisingly delicate, Japanese-inflected cuisine from Ilan in eastern Taiwan. Don't wait for an invitation; go to Lu San Canteen, 12-5 Yongkang Street, (886-2) 2351-3323, and order tofu with spinach puree, steamed bean-fish, and noodle soup with intensely garlicky pork.

WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- For just 100 Taiwan dollars, you can see thousands of years of Chinese art and artifacts at the National Palace Museum, 221 Chih-shan Road, Section 2, (886-2) 2881-2021. Only a small fraction of the enormous collection is on display at one time, with the rest stored in underground vaults dug out of the mountainside, but you can be reasonably assured of viewing such favorites as the piece of jade shaped like cabbage.
 A more Taiwan-specific view of history can be found at Taiwan Storyland, 50 Zhongxiao Road, Section 1, (886-2) 2388-7158; a typical small Taiwanese town circa 1965 recreated in the basement of the technology-focused K Mall. This is the ''Made in Taiwan'' era of yesteryear, with a doctor's office, a classroom, a camera store, a general store, a cinema, a Black Cat bar, and of course, several restaurants. Entry for foreigners is 80 Taiwan dollars.
 The epitome of today's Taipei, however, is Taipei 101, 7 Xinyi Road, Section 5, (886-2) 8101-8898; currently the world's tallest building, a 1,671-foot behemoth that may have disturbed an ancient fault line on the earthquake-prone island. A trip to the 89th floor costs 350 Taiwan dollars, a waltz around the 91st-floor observation deck is another 100 Taiwan dollars; children under 3 feet 3 inches tall get in free. Agoraphobics may wish to wander the high-end mall on the lower floors.
 For the opposite of such advanced architecture, take a taxi to Treasure Hill, a grassy neighborhood of illegal dwellings that Taipei's Culture Department is starting to transform into an arts district. Its epicenter is the lovely Treasure Hive cafe, 3, Alley 16, Lane 230, Dingzhou Road, Section 3, which holds weekly outdoor concerts.

WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- If you're a hip teenager -- or just want to do a little amateur trend-spotting -- the West Gate neighborhood is the place to go (take the subway to Ximending station). Kids in elaborate haircuts and Converse All-Stars roam this dense network of streets, buying cheap, trendy clothes from stores with names like Milk, Donut and Whazzup?, and snacking on fresh-baked croissants and grilled stinky tofu. Nearby is a karaoke parlor, Partyworld, 55 Zhonghua Road, Section 1, (886-2) 2361-9898, which is reputedly haunted: It stands on the site of a movie theater that burned down more than a decade ago.
 The music scene is kicking, but the main venue, Underworld, 45 Shida Road, (886-2) 2369-0103, lost its live-music license last fall. The D.J.'s still play Taipei indie and alternative rock, but the live scene has shifted to the Wall, 200 Roosevelt Road, Section 4, (886-2) 2930-0162, a bigger space that gets acts like Art of Fighting and Miniskirt. White Wabbit Records, (886-2) 8935-1454; wwr.idv.tw, in the Wall's basement mini-mall, sells CD's of almost every local band.
 Taipei bars are raucous, with bottles of Macallan being tossed back like shots at places like Naomi, 65 Anhe Road, Section 1, (886-2) 2709-8259, a basement recreation room-cum-Art Deco lounge. For a more civilized tipple, stop by Mono Mono, 17 Alley 29, Lane 127, Anhe Road, Section 1, (886-2) 2754-0868, for its wide range of Scotch (to be sipped, not swigged) and occasional celebrities like Bobby Chen, known as Taiwan's Bob Dylan.

WHERE TO SHOP -- When Taipei people aren't eating, they're shopping.
 The Idee department store, 14 and 15 Nanjing West Road, (886-2) 2564-1111; www.idee.com.tw, is Taipei's answer to Bloomingdale's, only with a bit more youthful elan; check out A la Sha, a local label, in the basement.
 Around the corner, Wum, 1 Lane 16, Zhongshan North Road, Section 2, (886-2) 2581-9866; www.stephanedou.com, features the refined fashions -- Balenciaga-esque tweed coats and organza evening gowns -- of Stephane Dou and Changlee Yugin.
 Design hounds will be delighted by the Dragonfly boutiques, which sell a host of clever products -- wooden radios, enameled gothic tableware -- from across Europe and Asia. The latest branch, at 11 Songkao Road, (886-2) 2723-3261; www.dragonfly.com.tw, was designed by Wei-Min Lee, the Ambience Hotel architect, and is in the basement of a brand-new Eslite, part of a chain of gargantuan bookstores that carry a university library's worth of novels, magazines, and Chinese poetry journals. The Eslite flagship, 245 Dunhua South Road, Section 1; www.eslitebooks.com, is open 24 hours a day.
 New Yorkers in search of tea will notice a familiar name -- Ten Ren, (www.tenren.com), the Chinatown purveyor of oolongs, is all over Taipei. But for a more intimate purchase of fragrant leaves, visit Mei's, 16 Lane 37, Yongkang Street, (886-2) 2394-2425; its proprietor, also named Mei, is a government-approved tea sommelier. (The state exam involves sampling 30 brews and identifying their mountain of origin.) Deep-pocketed tea lovers should ask for Assam from Hua Lien Country, 3,200 Taiwan dollars for 2.2 pounds.

HOW TO GET AROUND -- The Taipei Metro covers virtually the whole city and runs from 6 a.m. to midnight. Fares depend on how far you're going, and an all-day pass is 150 Taiwan dollars.
 Taxis are ubiquitous and fairly cheap: 70 Taiwan dollars for the first mile or so, and 5 Taiwan dollars for every additional third of a mile, or two minutes spent waiting.

YES, IT IS FREE -- The Ming-style Martyrs' Shrine, 139 Bei-An Road, (886-2) 2885-4162, honors Taiwan's fallen heroes, but crowds come more for the hourly changing of the guard, when stony-faced soldiers juggle rifles in a ceremony that is equal parts Buckingham Palace and vaudeville.

YOUR FIRST TIME OR 10TH -- Taipei's night markets, festive streets lined with knickknack stalls and, more important, food vendors, never disappoint. The most popular was at Shihlin, but its stalls have been moved to the less atmospheric indoors. Hungry insomniacs now go to Raohe Street, lining up for northern Chinese buns filled with black-pepper pork and baked in stone ovens.

WHERE TO STAY WIRED -- At the end of 2005, half of Taipei had access to Wi-Fly, the city's public wireless Internet service; coverage is expected to be 90 percent by the end of 2006. Wi-Fly costs 100 Taiwan dollars a day. If you can't log on without a cup of coffee, go to the 60's-mod Zaka cafe, 37 Lane 177, Dunhua South Road, Section 1, (886-2) 2773-7009.

HOW TO GET THERE -- EVA Airlines, www.evaair.com, has the fastest routes to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport just outside Taipei, with daily one-stop flights leaving from Newark. Weekend departures start at about $800 for economy class, $1,200 for Evergreen Class.

HEADLINE: Old Neighborhood, New Sounds

BYLINE: By SUSAN HARB

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, the Glenwood South neighborhood of Raleigh, N.C., a warehouse-wholesale district a half-dozen blocks northwest of the State Capitol, was deserted after 5, its main artery, Glenwood Avenue, merely a quick way to get home or to the airport. The two-story Pine State Creamery stood empty. Dark brick storefronts echoed the mournful sound of passing CSX trains. 
 Today, the sounds you hear are jazz, Celtic, salsa and rock emanating from nearly a dozen venues, as this eight-block area has become a hive of restaurants, bars, boutiques and now luxury housing. An 82-unit condo is open, and five more projects are under construction or planned. You can find practically anything from high-end contemporary home furnishings at Cherry Modern Design, 400 Glenwood, 919-754-8595, www.cherrymodern.com, to clothing befitting a harem at Turkish Treasure, 402 Glenwood, 919-821-9310, www.turkishtreasure.com. 
There are sports bars like Hi-5, 510 Glenwood, 919-834-4335, www.hi5raleigh.com, with 40 TV screens, a flat screen at many tables and about 250 beers. Late-night spots like Stool Pigeons, 410 Glenwood, 919-831-0400, www.stoolpigeons.biz, are geared toward fans and students of the city's five colleges. 
 There are designer restaurants where exposed ducts overhead and local art on the walls are prevalent, as if mandated by the lease. Enoteca Vin, 410 Glenwood, 919-834-3070, www.enotecavin.com, has cinderblock walls and 50 wines by the glass ($1.50 to $37). Its signature appetizer -- deviled egg with smoked paprika ($5) -- is a nod to the South. Zely & Ritz, 301 Glenwood, 919-828-0018, www.zelyandritz.com, stresses organic and locally produced foods. Recent entrees have included emu in plum sauce ($13.95) and black cod wrapped in Chinese cabbage with carrot sauce ($13.95).
 Lest one forgets this is North Carolina, there is a steakhouse, Sullivan's, 414 Glenwood, 919-833-2888, www.sullivansteakhouse.com, which draws the legal and legislative crowd like a close vote on the floor. Jazz is played every night in the wood-paneled lounge that was once the processing section of the old creamery, whose renovation in the late 90's ignited the neighborhood revitalization. The featured drinks are the martinis, including the chocolate diva -- Godiva chocolate, Stoli Vanil and cream in a chocolate-lined glass ($8.75). The homemade potato chips buried under blue cheese ($7.99) is a real Bond meets Bubba experience.
 In what was once the city's train station, 518 West Italian Cafe, 518 West Jones Street, 919-829-2518, www.518west.com, is busy at lunch, dinner and late at night. The menu goes beyond fried calamari and marinara to include a wild mushroom polenta prepared with fresh rosemary and cashew butter ($7.75) for starters and an entree of fresh crabmeat over pasta with scallions, bacon and a dill cream sauce ($13.95). 
 Then there's Harry's. In a neighborhood dominated by a young, urban clientele, including computer geeks from the Research Triangle who are reportedly buying the $200,000 to $850,000 condos, and where the premier furniture store selects inventory from Milan rather than nearby High Point, there's Harry's Music Store, 616 Glenwood, 888-974-4190, www.harrysguitarshop.com.
 Harry's, which has been at the same address for nearly 20 years, was cool when the neighborhood wasn't. The owner, Harry Tueting, plays in two bands, and all his sales personnel are musicians. Customers can try out guitars on the store's sound system. 
 ''It's a field of dreams for a guitar player,'' said Chris Farlow, who moved to Raleigh from San Francisco, where he first heard of the store. ''Is this heaven? No, it's Harry's.''

HEADLINE: For Men, A Fear Of Commitment

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade single women in the United States have been outpacing single men when it comes to buying homes, a trend that has been attributed to their increasing financial independence and their desire to cast off the timeworn Prince Charming rescue fantasy. 
 But as single women have grown to be an indisputable force in the housing market, a compelling question about single men has arisen: why are single women twice as likely to be home buyers?
A study published last month by the National Association of Realtors shows a continuing disparity, with single women accounting for 21 percent of recent home buyers and single men accounting for 9 percent.
 The share of single male buyers has remained steady at around 10 percent since 1993 but has never eclipsed the percentage of single female buyers. (Respondents to the survey who defined themselves as single were divorced, widowed or separated or had never been married.) 
 Certainly the buying gap between the sexes cannot be attributed to men's inferior earning power. Women in the United States earn about 76 cents for every dollar that men make, according to the Census Bureau. Few senior executives at American companies are women. And not one woman is at the helm of a Fortune 100 company. 
 The answer to the home buying question requires more than an analysis of dollars and cents. Myriad factors may contribute to the disparity, including the fact that women tend to live longer than men and that they often get custody of their children after a divorce, though with any trend that highlights differences between men and women, conjecture can degenerate into stereotypes. 
 Still, there seems to be a consensus among brokers and buyers who have witnessed the trend that single men, even those whose college diplomas are yellowed with age, gravitate to a lifestyle not unlike that enjoyed by fraternity brothers: relatively free of commitments and rife with male companionship. 
 They consider buying a home detrimental to their independence, as it tethers them to one location, squelching any youthful fantasy of a nomadic existence. Indeed, for many single men without children, buying a home is a commitment akin to getting married -- and they are content to put it off.
 Single women on the other hand seem more interested in establishing a sense of security, or ''nesting,'' as several brokers and buyers put it. They consider buying a home an act of independence. It is an asset, a symbol of their financial strength and proof that they need not wait for a man of means to provide them with the security they crave. 
 This is not a battle of the sexes. It is a battle of semantics. Both men and women view their decision to buy or not buy as a declaration of independence, though they have cultivated very different definitions of ''independence.'' And as women have more financial advantages than in the past, they are able to realize their desires -- and perhaps make up for lost time.
 ''In the last six months I've been working almost exclusively with women,'' said Pat Vredevoogd, vice president of AJS Realty in Grand Rapids, Mich. Ms. Vredevoogd, who will be president of the National Association of Realtors in 2007, said she thinks many single men live together after college rather than buy their own homes. ''It kind of resembles a fraternity,'' she said. ''They kind of keep on with that life.''
 Tom Livatino, a 36-year old high school basketball coach in Chicago, has a history of enabling single men to rent instead of buy. When he was in his 20's he purchased a home and dubbed it ''the Frat House.'' ''My thought always was it was going to be a continuation of college,'' he said. ''All my buddies lived with me and they helped pay the mortgage.'' Mr. Livatino, who has a calmer lifestyle now, estimated that over the course of seven years some 15 rent-paying men lived there at one time or another. 
 Barbara D. O'Connor, a broker at Baird & Warner in Chicago, said that if enough men are enjoying living arrangements similar to those in Mr. Livatino's ''Frat House,'' it could account for some of the disparity between single male and female buyers. But she also speculated that many single men in their 20's and 30's are not interested in laying down roots. ''I think women, when they get to a certain age, they don't think they're going to get married,'' she said, ''so they purchase for life.'' 
 John McGovern, 35, who works in finance in Manhattan, said he can afford to buy but chooses not to because he would have to sacrifice location and amenities. ''I didn't want to compromise anything,'' said Mr. McGovern, who plans to move into a rental apartment in Union Square this month. ''I wanted to live well.''
 For him that means living downtown in a building with laundry and an elevator and having an apartment with a dishwasher. ''It might be different if I had a partner,'' Mr. McGovern said. ''I am single. I still want to be -- well, not compromising.''
 Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said there is indeed a phenomenon going on. But he added: ''We don't study the 'why.' It's hard enough to interpret what people do.'' He said he suspects there is a correlation, however, between the National Association of Realtors data and studies that have found that young adult single males are much more likely to stay at home after college than young adult single females. 
 Gabrielle Finley, 29, an event planner in Manhattan, said all of the women she knows are buying apartments. ''It's something really exciting for all of us, to feel that our lives are progressing,'' said Ms. Finley, who bought a one-bedroom in December. ''You do want a safety net and you don't know where your life is going to end up in the next five years, if you'll be married or have kids and have that security.''
 Ms. Finley's broker, Jodi Cowen of JC DeNiro & Associates in Manhattan, summed up the sentiment. ''If you don't have a mate,'' she said, ''it's sort of the next best thing.'' 
 Single men often prefer to be more certain about the future before they buy, said Nancy Lee, a vice president at the Corcoran Group in Manhattan. ''A lot of their decisions are based on where they are in their career, especially in the financial business,'' she said. ''There's a lot of hesitation for making that initial plunge. It's very challenging to convince them it's not a commitment, that you can trade up and move on.''
 Andres Cedron, 25, a lawyer who rents an apartment on the ocean in Miami Beach, agreed. ''I'm waiting to see where my life goes,'' he said. ''Right now what I want to buy is not what someone who gets married might want to buy.'' Mr. Cedron said he also has some school loans and would rather avoid the ''hassle'' of buying. ''I don't want to buy and sell again,'' he said, calling it an ''added bureaucratic step.'' 
 Steve Smith, also 25, a pharmaceutical salesman in Chicago, bought a home 18 months ago but explicitly told himself it was an investment. He has a friend, however, who can afford to buy but feels he cannot afford to commit. ''Buying a house to him means being tied down,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I did it purely as an investment. He's doing it as a symbol. He's renting as a symbol of still being young and being able to up and go.'' 
 Mr. Smith says his women friends approach things differently. ''If they have a job and the money, they're buying,'' he said. 
 Colin R. Johnson, an assistant professor of gender studies at Indiana University at Bloomington, said there is no wayto sociologically nail down an answer as to why single men are less interested in owning homes. But, he said, there is ''a very long history of women thinking about space'' and ''the privilege of what access to space means.'' 
 Men have always been free to move through public space without fear; women have not. For example the ''take back the night'' marches that began in the United States in the late 1970's were about women asserting their desire to gain access to the space that men have, Dr. Johnson said. ''Men feel the world is theirs to be had,'' he said, so they may not need to create their own safe haven. 
 Conversely, single women may feel that to lay claim to part of the world, they have to buy in. 
 The buying gap can in part be attributed to the higher percentage of divorced women who have custody of their children and may therefore be interested in owning a home. A breakdown of the Realtor group's survey numbers revealed that 25 percent of single women households include children under 18, compared with 17 percent of single male households. 
 The National Association of Realtors survey results were generated from responses to questionnaires completed by 7,813 Americans who bought homes from August 2004 to July 2005. The names and addresses of consumers were obtained randomly from Experian, a vendor that maintains a database of recent home buyers culled from county records. 
 Some brokers and sociologists wondered if the study adjusted for the fact that there are more single women in the United States than single men. Paul Bishop, a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors, responded to the question in an e-mail message: ''As a large nationally representative survey of recent home buyers and sellers, the information presented here will capture the characteristics of home buyers and sellers including the distribution of buyers and sellers by various characteristics. We review the data to make sure that it is consistent with sales patterns across the nation at the state level (and make any necessary adjustments).'' 
 Others wondered whether women were buying in a market cheaper than the market where men were buying. The Realtors survey found that 40 percent of the single men and single women who buy homes were buying homes in the same area of the country: the South. But Mr. Bishop said that while the survey is nationally representative, the group did not have sufficient data to show where singles are purchasing within the South. 
 Also of interest was whether there was a significant age difference between men and women buyers. There was not. The median age of a household was 41 for single men and 42 for single women. 
 That women tend to live longer than men may be yet another contributing factor to the buying gap as it is not uncommon for a widow to downsize to a new home. 
 The Realtors survey did not inquire about sexual orientation, which might have accounted for some of the buying gap. ''Are these really single men and women or do you have lesbian couples with children appearing more often than gay men couples with children?'' asked Abigail C. Saguy, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 Although a woman's declining financial reliance on a husband is a thoroughly modern trend, plenty of women who are buying homes say they felt a need for privacy and security, feelings that are anything but modern. 
 ''Women are still the biggest nesters,'' said Karen Kelley, a broker with the Corcoran Group. Her colleague, Sharon Held, added that women tend to be more conservative investors. Betty Brody, a lawyer over 40 who moved into a home in Coral Gables, Fla., in July, framed the mystery of the buying discrepancy in anthropological terms. ''Women are by nature nesters and men are hunters and gatherers,'' she said. 
 Of course, the most radical gender stereotyping occurs in fairy tales, where women are rescued by knights in shining armor and whisked off to roomy castles. Little boys know they have the role of the knight locked up. Rather than accepting the role as damsel in distress, girls are increasingly growing up to be concerned about establishing their financial security.
 As Heidi Oleson, an agent at Dickson Realty in Reno, Nev., put it: ''They're just not going to wait to live happily ever after anymore.''

HEADLINE: Here's $500,000. Now Go Away.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
IN an unusual move for a high-profile condo project, the developer Steven C. Witkoff dumped the marketing and sales firm that had helped him create the Cipriani Club Residences at 55 Wall Street. 
 Louise Sunshine, the chairwoman emeritus of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing, and her sales agents were escorted out of the building on the afternoon of Feb. 1, and the next morning a new sales staff, working for Prudential Douglas Elliman, took their place.
But the change did not come without a cost. Mr. Witkoff had to pay $500,000 to break his contract with Corcoran Sunshine, according to people on both sides of the breakup. That is in addition to what he already paid or may owe in commissions for the 37 furnished condos that Corcoran had sold in the 106-unit building, plus other consulting fees. 
 That is a lot of money, even in the Manhattan real estate business, and it is tempting to wonder where it came from. Did Mr. Witkoff decide that his relationship with the Corcoran Sunshine team had gone unbearably sour? Or did Douglas Elliman and its chairman, Howard Lorber, agree to a deal that would in some way make it worthwhile for Mr. Witkoff and his partner, Giuseppe Cipriani, to pay the hefty kill fee? 
 ''I made the move for strategic reasons,'' Mr. Witkoff said. He refused to talk about his financial arrangement with Douglas Elliman and he said he was unwilling to air details of the breakup. He even had words of praise for Ms. Sunshine, with whom he has been friends. ''Louise is one of the most brilliant real estate concept people I have ever met in my life,'' he said.
 Mr. Lorber said that he had nothing to do with the kill fee and that it was not a factor in his negotiations with Mr. Witkoff. ''I didn't pay a penny,'' he said. ''We're looking to enter into a long-term agreement with Witkoff for a lot of his projects, so at some point we'll agree on something and it'll be what it'll be. We'll agree on an overall commission structure on all of his projects.''
 He said that Mr. Witkoff was simply ready for a change. ''Sometimes people say, in a divorce, where it's very expensive, sometimes it's worth it,'' Mr. Lorber said.
 Ms. Sunshine had a different interpretation of the split. ''I feel raped,'' she said last Tuesday. ''I feel raped when I look at The New York Times and I see the ads I created and all of the marketing I created, with Douglas Elliman's name on it. They're not changing a thing.''
 She added, ''This was done out of spitefulness and I think it was totally unprofessional.'' 
 Ms. Sunshine has long been a trailblazer in the innovative marketing of condos. ''I have everybody trying to emulate what I do,'' she said. ''Maybe that's flattery but I find it spiteful and annoying. They ought to come up with their own ideas.'' 
 Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group and a senior regional vice president of its parent company, NRT, said that Douglas Elliman had wanted for some time to lure the Cipriani project away in an attempt to compete in the sale of new developments. ''They're jealous of the dominance Corcoran has in the arena,'' Ms. Liebman said. 
 Mr. Lorber disagreed. ''I would say that she's delusional,'' he said.
 Despite the split over the Cipriani project, Corcoran Sunshine and Mr. Witkoff's company, the Witkoff Group, are continuing to work together in planning for the conversion of part of the Woolworth Building, in lower Manhattan, into luxury condos. At least for now.
 Mr. Witkoff acknowledged the arrangement but would not discuss it. Ms. Sunshine said that her staff held a regular planning meeting with Mr. Witkoff's Woolworth development team on Monday. ''It's not awkward at all,'' she said. 
 Ms. Sunshine sold her company to NRT, the real estate conglomerate that also owns Corcoran, in 2002. Last June, Ms. Sunshine was eased out of her role at the head of the company and the firm was merged with a Corcoran division that also focused on marketing new developments. Ms. Sunshine took the title of chairwoman emeritus and is now working under a consulting contract, although she is still deeply involved in the company's projects. But the shift led some people in the real estate industry to question who was really in charge at the newly created Corcoran Sunshine Marketing, and whether Ms. Sunshine and Ms. Liebman could get along. 
 To put doubts about their compatibility to rest, Ms. Liebman and Ms. Sunshine invited a reporter to sit down with them a few days after the Cipriani split. 
 Meeting in one of Ms. Liebman's two Manhattan offices, on the 39th floor of a building at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street, with an expansive view of the Hudson River and New Jersey and Central Park as a backdrop, the two women laughed at each other's jokes and finished each other's sentences. They talked about how they like to have dinner together, just for fun. Their two families, including Ms. Sunshine's grandchildren and Ms. Liebman's children, once went to the Big Apple Circus together. 
 Ms. Liebman said she has a special ring tone for Ms. Sunshine on her cellphone. ''My husband doesn't even have a special ring,'' she said. 
 ''When people say we don't get along, we laugh about it,'' Ms. Liebman said. 

A Glutton for Renovation
 REED KRAKOFF, the president and executive creative director of Coach, the leather goods and fashion company, paid $17 million in September for a 30-foot-wide six-story town house on East 70th Street. At the time of the sale the building was divided into nine units; two months later, Mr. Krakoff filed plans to turn it into a single-family dwelling that would require renovation work estimated at $2.5 million. 
 Mr. Krakoff has hired Ferguson & Shamamian Architects, the same firm that his boss, Lew Frankfort, the chief executive of Coach, has engaged to renovate a large apartment he owns at the Beresford, a landmark co-op on Central Park West and 81st Street.
 Mr. Krakoff bought the East 70th Street building from the developer James Rinzler, who paid $11.4 million for it last February, according to city records. Cheryl A. Nesbit, a vice president of the Corcoran Group who sold the town house to Mr. Rinzler, said the building was vacant at the time of the sale. 
 Mr. Krakoff would seem to have a certain restlessness when it comes to renovation projects. City records show that in August 2001, he paid $3.75 million for a town house on East 61st Street. He hired the architect Joseph Vance to remake the structure inside and out. Department of Buildings records say the project was completed in late 2003 and, according to Mr. Vance's Web site (www.jvarchitects.com), the results were featured in Vogue and House and Garden and in a book, ''Creating the New American Townhouse,'' by the architect Alexander Gorlin (Rizzoli, 2005). 
 Mr. Krakoff joined Coach in the mid-1990's and has been credited with bringing a fresh design sense to Coach's products. He declined to comment.

What Manhattan Downturn?
 HOLD onto your hats. 
 In a tally of 563 Manhattan apartment closings in January, Halstead Property reports that the average sales price reached its second-highest level since the firm began tracking monthly sales figures. The January average of $1.277 million was 17 percent higher than the average for the same month a year ago, and second only to the record of $1.332 million set last June. 
 The average suggests that the market, which had dipped, at least on the high end, after the June peak, picked up again near the end of last year. The median price of $750,000 was 11 percent higher than the same month in 2005. 
 Gregory Heym, the chief economist for Halstead, said the increase in the averageis largely because of a jump in luxury sales. Among the apartments that closed last month were two condos that sold for more than $20 million, he said.

NORTON, JAMES A.

 BODY:
 NORTON--James A. At home on the morning of February 8, 2006. He will be greatly missed by his wife of 37 years, Femma. Also missed by his mother Kris, sisters Judy (Gene) & Lynn (Gayle). Cherished father of Lesley (Jill), Shauna (Colin), Tom (Norma), Jared and Joshua. Adored ''Pop'' to grandchildren Hilary, Matthew, Gwen, Keshia and Jonathan. 
Sadly missed by Millie. Jim was born in Montreal on March 17, 1935 but grew up in New Rochelle, New York where his father Alex was Administrator of New Rochelle Hospital. A 1957 graduate of Williams College, Jim returned to Canada where he was an economist with the Government of Canada, an International Representative for the United Steelworkers and Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics at Brock University. Following his election to North York Council and the Metropolitan Toronto Council, Jim embarked on a consulting career that bridged both sides of the border and spanned over thirty years. A specialist in the field of managed healthcare, Jim left his mark on the industry and those within it, as both a visionary and a friend. Upon retirement, Jim established his own consulting company, aptly titled, Kris Kringle. As candidate, active campaigner and vigilant supporter of The New Democratic Party Jim remained a life-long crusader for social Justice. A rare mix of success and generosity, Jim regularly volunteered at the ''Out of the Cold'' soup kitchen. Jim Norton was many things to many people: a husband, a father, a grandfather, a teacher, a colleague and a friend. To each of these roles Jim brought his trademark combination of courage, kindness, humour and wit. He will be forever missed. At his own request, Jim has been cremated and there is to be no memorial service. A ''Celebration of Jim's Life'' is being planned. Please send relevant contact information to jimnortoncelebration@rogers.com and details of the event will be forwarded when available. Donations, if desired, may be made to the Stephen Lewis Foundation.

HEADLINE: Chemical Wars

BYLINE: By GARY J. BASS. 
Gary J. Bass, an associate professor at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, is writing a book on humanitarian intervention.

 BODY:
WAR OF NERVES
 Chemical Warfare from
 World War I to Al-Qaeda.
 By Jonathan B. Tucker.
 Illustrated. 479 pp. Pantheon Books. $30.
A FOUR-MILLIGRAM droplet of VX can kill you in under an hour. Your first symptoms will probably include drooling, sweating, difficulty breathing and the constriction of your pupils to zombie pinpoints. Then come gastrointestinal spasms, vomiting, convulsions and finally death by asphyxiation.
 This is not obviously more barbaric than, for instance, being ripped apart by shrapnel in so-called legitimate warfare. Chemical weapons are less devastating than nuclear or biological weaponry, and are trickier to use in combat than high explosives. Yet poison weapons have been widely reviled for centuries. They are easier to make than nuclear or biological arms, and, since soldiers with advance notice can shield themselves, they are tempting for use against unwary civilians. 
 Jonathan B. Tucker's chilling ''War of Nerves'' is a history of the race between the advance of this taboo technology and the political efforts to abolish it. Tucker, who has a gift for making military science readable, wants a world secure from such repellent weapons. But human destructiveness always seems a step or two ahead of civilization.
 As early as 1675, France and Germany outlawed poison bullets. In the 1899 Hague Convention, the major European countries -- including Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- and the United States swore not to use ''poison or poisoned weapons,'' and signed an additional declaration renouncing projectiles meant only to carry asphyxiating gas. 
 But these humane efforts were dashed by the battlefield necessities of World War I. In April 1915, hoping for a military breakthrough, Germany launched the war's first major chemical attack, releasing chlorine gas to blow toward French and Algerian troops in their trenches at Ypres, in Belgium. As Tucker gruesomely recounts, along four miles of the front line, tons of yellow-green gas rose to a height of 30 feet as the wind slowly edged it forward. The lethal cloud scorched the eyes and lungs of the terrified French and Algerian soldiers, who vomited and collapsed in agony. Hundreds died, coughing up blood and green froth. The soldiers' silver insignia and buckles immediately turned greenish black. Five months later, Britain launched its own retaliatory chlorine attack, and by 1916 both the Allies and the Central Powers were using artillery packed with chemicals -- a total collapse of the Hague declaration. 
 The diplomats tried again in 1925, with the Geneva Protocol banning the use of chemical weapons in war, although not the manufacture and stockpiling of them. But the United States would not ratify the treaty until 1975, and Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union signed but secretly developed chemical weapons anyway. And even though Italy had ratified the Geneva Protocol, Mussolini used mustard agent during the 1935-36 conquest of Ethiopia.
 Nazi Germany pioneered a new generation of odorless and quick-killing nerve agents like sarin, designed to overcome Allied protective gear. In a report for Hermann Goring, the head of I. G. Farben's board of directors boasted that chemical weapons were ''the weapon of superior intelligence.'' But Hitler, while mass-murdering defenseless Jews with Zyklon B, was more cautious on the battlefield: fearing Allied retaliation against German cities, he planned to use chemical weapons in World War II only if the Allies did first.
 During the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union raced to improve their arsenals of nerve agents, and America used Agent Orange and tear gas in Vietnam. By the 1960's, the technology spread into the developing world. During its 1962-67 war in Yemen, Egypt (another cheating Geneva member) used chemical bombs on villages. Although Iraq was also a party to Geneva, Saddam Hussein authorized chemical warfare against Iranian troops in the 1980's (using weapons made with help from West German, Dutch, Swiss, American and French companies) and gassed his own Kurdish population in the 1988 Anfal extermination campaign. In 1983, in a 90-minute meeting with Hussein in Baghdad to discuss improving ties with Iraq, Donald Rumsfeld, as Reagan's special envoy, never mentioned Iraq's chemical strikes.
 The current stage of chemical proliferation, Tucker warns, involves terrorist groups, like the Aum Shinrikyo cultists who killed 19 people with sarin in two incidents in Japan in 1994 and 1995. Two years before the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden said that he had the right to seek nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
 Tucker wants to strengthen the effectiveness of international norms. He optimistically notes that the overwhelming majority of countries have joined the Chemical Weapons Convention, isolating and stigmatizing nonsignatories like North Korea and Syria, and helping to keep precursor chemicals beyond their grasp. But he warns that ''determined cheaters may not be deterred without a credible threat of economic or military sanctions.'' America and Russia are both taking too long to destroy their huge stockpiles, as well as insisting on the right to use incapacitating chemicals to foil terrorists -- as Russian security forces disastrously tried to do during the 2002 Chechen terrorist seizure of a Moscow theater, where Russian gas accidentally killed 127 hostages. Tucker's book makes a sobering case for a less poisonous world, but governments do not seem to be getting much wiser.


CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A review on Feb. 12 about ''War of Nerves: Chemical Warfare From World War I to Al-Qaeda,'' by Jonathan B. Tucker, referred imprecisely to the United States' use of tear gas and the defoliant Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. Unlike most of the other substances discussed in the review, neither was designed to cause direct casualties. However, the use of tear gas to flush enemy soldiers from hiding and Agent Orange to destroy overhead cover provoked debate about whether they should be counted as true chemical weapons under international law.

COUSINS AND STRANGERS
 America, Britain, and Europe
 in a New Century.
 By Chris Patten.
 309 pp. Times Books/
 Henry Holt & Company. $26.
IF Europe had an Establishment, Chris Patten would be it. Now chancellor of Oxford, Patten was most recently the European Union's commissioner for external relations, and he might have run European foreign policy if the European Union actually had one. A baron and a Balliol graduate, he was a member of Parliament, chairman of the Tories and the last British governor of Hong Kong. He is a perfect exemplar of what the British call ''the Great and the Good.'' 
 In this book -- part memoir, part cri de coeur -- we meet him in a new guise. Call it the ''Good European,'' in both senses of the term. In the British context, he is a Europhile who wants Albion to be what it has never quite been: in, of and with Europe. On the trans-Atlantic stage (hence the title ''Cousins and Strangers''), he is the Good European as New Man -- chastened and reformed -- who has seen the rest of the world and found it wanting. In a quiet, almost diffident voice that so distinguishes well-bred Britons from their French and German counterparts, Patten holds up Europe's moral-cultural authority against those unregenerates who would still insist on nationhood, sovereignty and force in international affairs. 
 At the top of the list are the usual suspects, Bushist America and Thatcherite Britain, but also add Tony Blair, a k a America's poodle, and the world's favorite bugaboo, Ariel Sharon (whose popularity soared miraculously after his coma). At the end, there aren't many lovables left. The president of France gets his comeuppance thus: ''Is there any consistency or meaning to . . . Jacques Chirac's practice of French exceptionalism?'' Patten demands to know. ''Even when they are right, the French can be infuriatingly perverse or incomprehensible.'' One of his most elegant slashes is reserved for Blair: ''A usually likable man,'' he ''has convictions to which he holds strongly -- while he holds them.'' And Gerhard Schroder, the former chancellor of Germany, ''always gives the impression that the very short term is for him very long indeed.'' 
 No fan of Israel, Patten wasn't very fond either of Yasir Arafat, whose ''baleful influence'' was ''far greater than his governing authority.'' By a rough count, there are only four people who make Patten's cut. One is John Major, Margaret Thatcher's successor -- an ''honest, generous, kindhearted . . . clever man.'' The other three are Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan and Colin Powell -- men who ''best combine natural grace and authority.'' Make that: who best conform to the ideal of an English gentleman.
 The prime target of Patten's rapier is American neoconservatives who ''considered George H. W. Bush's policies, particularly his failure to topple Saddam Hussein, anemic and deficient in chutzpah.'' They ''strongly supported'' Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud Party and clamored for a rematch against Hussein. Why the Yiddish ''chutzpah''? Why not ''guts'' or ''resolve''? So that we would know who ''they'' are, those clever manipulators who had subverted the American national interest? Patten could not have meant Bush and Cheney, Rice and Rumsfeld, who probably don't even know what chutzpah is. At any rate, their world was ''dangerous to us all because, in Edmund Burke's famous phrase, 'a great empire and little minds go ill together.' ''
 This is the backdrop against which Patten recites the gospel of the Good European: ''Under American tutelage, we in Europe turned our back on the bellicose, nationalist politics of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and through our new modes of cooperation . . . are bent on coping with the problems of the 21st.'' Naturally, Patten also upholds Europe's social contract, which favors egalitarianism over full employment. Yes, ''the U.S. economy has grown more rapidly than Europe's,'' he concedes, ''but that is largely the result of America's 1 percent annual population growth.'' So why won't Old Europe put its 20 million unemployed to work? Patten also opines that America's faster productivity growth can be explained by ''the Wal-Mart or Home Depot factor -- large shopping sheds on out-of-town green-field sites.'' That spin on Europe's 10-year slump doesn't wash, either. Those ''shopping sheds'' blanket Europe, too, where they are called Carrefour (food) or Media Markt (electronics) or even, yes, Wal-Mart and Costco.
 When it comes to Islam and terror, Patten for once loses his cool. So you Yanks want to remake the Middle East by force? ''Damn it,'' he sputters, ''this is our neighborhood,'' and therefore we know better, he all but shouts. Above all, you must ditch Samuel Huntington and his ''clash of civilizations.'' For the Arabs are just like us: they ''top the world in believing that democracy is the best form of government.'' And they care most about ''personal security, fulfillment and satisfaction.'' So whence Arab rage?
 You guessed it: from the war in Iraq and ''the betrayal and denial of Palestinian rights.'' This is a curiously foreshortened list. Does the Iraq war explain the unfathomable cruelty of Saddam Hussein before 2003 or even 1991? Does it explain the despotism and the deadly quarrels between sects, ideologies and regimes that preceded Israel's occupation in 1967? Does it explain the annihilation of the Syrian city of Hama by Hafez al-Assad's army in 1982? Or the economic backwardness that leaves so many young Arab men without a job and a future? Patten doesn't lay the blame for Islamist terrorism directly on the West. Ever so subtly, he indicts by posing questions: ''Why does the West's notion of spreading freedom, capitalism and democracy look to some others like licentiousness, greed and a new colonialism?''
 This is a flawed book, but cris de coeur always are. Patten's is also a brilliantly catty and nicely constructed text -- so felicitous in its language and subtle in its jabs that one wishes for a bit more Oxbridge in America's top schools. If back in college they had been obliged to deliver two essays per week, American mandarins might sound more like Patten and less like PowerPoint. In Oxford, they teach you not only to write well but also to think beyond the talking points of the day, and this is why the standard prejudices of the Good European do not overwhelm his intelligence, erudition and wit. 
 Though it ranges across the planet, the book is addressed to America. Though it takes an uncharitable view of the Bushies, as well as of all things American that European conservatives have always found distasteful, the book ends up with a kind of homage to the United States. ''We are too inclined,'' he writes, ''to criticize America while depending on its security shield; too prone to advocate multilateralism while knowing that if a multilateral solution requires force nothing much is likely to happen unless America is involved.'' The boys who went to a grande ecole would rather bite off their tongues than concede this incontrovertible point to the yahoos americains.
 So cousins after all? Well, yes, if you Yanks learned a bit from the wiser ways of Europe, Patten writes inhis last paragraph. Then, the century ahead will be ''dominated by the values that American history enshrines and that American leadership at its best embodies and defends without bragging or blustering: democracy, pluralism, enterprise and the rule of law.'' It doesn't quite jibe with the preceding 292 pages, but who's counting?

 BODY:
THE INHERITANCE OF LOSS
 By Kiran Desai.
 324 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $24.
ALTHOUGH it focuses on the fate of a few powerless individuals, Kiran Desai's extraordinary new novel manages to explore, with intimacy and insight, just about every contemporary international issue: globalization, multiculturalism, economic inequality, fundamentalism and terrorist violence. Despite being set in the mid-1980's, it seems the best kind of post-9/11 novel.
 ''The Inheritance of Loss'' opens with a teenage Indian girl, an orphan called Sai, living with her Cambridge-educated Anglophile grandfather, a retired judge, in the town of Kalimpong on the Indian side of the Himalayas. Sai is romantically involved with her math tutor, Gyan, the descendant of a Nepali Gurkha mercenary, but he eventually recoils from her obvious privilege and falls in with a group of ethnic Nepalese insurgents. In a parallel narrative, we are shown the life of Biju, the son of Sai's grandfather's cook, who belongs to the ''shadow class'' of illegal immigrants in New York and spends much of his time dodging the authorities, moving from one ill-paid job to another. 
 What binds these seemingly disparate characters is a shared historical legacy and a common experience of impotence and humiliation. ''Certain moves made long ago had produced all of them,'' Desai writes, referring to centuries of subjection by the economic and cultural power of the West. But the beginnings of an apparently leveled field in a late-20th-century global economy serve merely to scratch those wounds rather than heal them.
 Almost all of Desai's characters have been stunted by their encounters with the West. As a student, isolated in racist England, the future judge feels ''barely human at all'' and leaps ''when touched on the arm as if from an unbearable intimacy.'' Yet on his return to India, he finds himself despising his apparently backward Indian wife. 
 The judge is one of those ''ridiculous Indians,'' as the novel puts it, ''who couldn't rid themselves of what they had broken their souls to learn'' and whose Anglophilia can only turn into self-hatred. These Indians are also an unwanted anachronism in postcolonial India, where long-suppressed peoples have begun to awaken to their dereliction, to express their anger and despair. For some of Desai's characters, including one of the judge's neighbors in Kalimpong, this comes as a distinct shock: ''Just when Lola had thought it would continue, a hundred years like the one past -- Trollope, BBC, a burst of hilarity at Christmas -- all of a sudden, all that they had claimed innocent, fun, funny, not really to matter, was proven wrong.''
 There is no mistaking the literary influences on Desai's exploration of postcolonial chaos and despair. Early in the novel, she sets two Anglophilic Indian women to discussing ''A Bend in the River,'' V. S. Naipaul's powerfully bleak novel about traditional Africa's encounter with the modern world. Lola, whose clothesline sags ''under a load of Marks and Spencer's panties,'' thinks Naipaul is ''strange. Stuck in the past. . . . He has not progressed. Colonial neurosis, he's never freed himself from it.'' Lola goes on to accuse Naipaul of ignoring the fact that there is a ''new England,'' a ''completely cosmopolitan society'' where ''chicken tikka masala has replaced fish and chips as the No. 1 takeout dinner.'' As further evidence, she mentions her own daughter, a newsreader for BBC radio, who ''doesn't have a chip on her shoulder.''
 Desai takes a skeptical view of the West's consumer-driven multiculturalism, noting the ''sanitized elegance'' of Lola's daughter's British-accented voice, which is ''triumphant over any horrors the world might thrust upon others.'' At such moments, Desai seems far from writers like Zadie Smith and Hari Kunzru, whose fiction takes a generally optimistic view of what Salman Rushdie has called ''hybridity, impurity, intermingling, the transformation that comes of new and unexpected combinations of human beings, cultures, ideas, politics, movies, songs.''
 In fact, Desai's novel seems to argue that such multiculturalism, confined to the Western metropolis and academe, doesn't begin to address the causes of extremism and violence in the modern world. Nor, it suggests, can economic globalization become a route to prosperity for the downtrodden. ''Profit,'' Desai observes at one point, ''could only be harvested in the gap between nations, working one against the other.''
 This leaves most people in the postcolonial world with only the promise of a shabby modernity -- modernity, as Desai puts it, ''in its meanest form, brand-new one day, in ruin the next.'' Not surprisingly, half-educated, uprooted men like Gyan gravitate to the first available political cause in their search for a better way. He joins what sounds like an ethnic nationalist movement largely as an opportunity to vent his rage and frustration. ''Old hatreds are endlessly retrievable,'' Desai reminds us, and they are ''purer . . . because the grief of the past was gone. Just the fury remained, distilled, liberating.''
 Unlike Gyan, others try to escape. In scene after scene depicting this process -- a boarding house in England, derelict bungalows in Kalimpong, immigrant-packed basements in New York -- Desai's novel seems lit by a moral intelligence at once fierce and tender. But no scene is more harrowing than the one in which Biju joins a crowd of Indians scrambling to reach the visa counter at the United States Embassy: ''Biggest pusher, first place; how self-contented and smiling he was; he dusted himself off, presenting himself with the exquisite manners of a cat. I'm civilized, sir, ready for the U.S., I'm civilized, mam. Biju noticed that his eyes, so alive to the foreigners, looked back at his own countrymen and women, immediately glazed over, and went dead.''
 Desai's prose has uncanny flexibility and poise. She can describe the onset of the monsoon in the Himalayas and a rat in the slums of Manhattan with equal skill. She is also adept at using physical descriptions to evoke complex states of mind, as when Biju gazes at a park while celebrating the great luck of being granted his American visa: ''Raw sewage was being used to water a patch of grass that was lush and stinking, grinning brilliantly in the dusk.''
 Poor and lonely in New York, Biju eavesdrops on businessmen eating steak and exulting over the wealth to be gained in the new markets of Asia. Not surprisingly, he eventually becomes ''a man full to the brim with a wish to live within a narrow purity.'' For him, the city's endless possibilities for self-invention become a source of pain. Though ''another part of him had expanded: his self-consciousness, his self-pity,'' this awareness only makes him long to fade into insignificance, to return ''to where he might relinquish this overrated control over his own destiny.''
 A rriving back in India in the climactic scenes of the novel, Biju is immediately engulfed by the local eruptions of rage and frustration from which he had been physically remote in New York. For him and the others, Desai suggests, withdrawal or escape are no longer possible. ''Never again,'' Sai concludes, ''could she think there was but one narrative and that this narrative belonged only toherself, that she might create her own mean little happiness and live safely within it.''
 Apart from this abstraction, Desai offers her characters no possibility of growth or redemption. Though relieved by much humor, ''The Inheritance of Loss'' may strike many readers as offering an unrelentingly bitter view. But then, as Orhan Pamuk wrote soon after 9/11, people in the West are ''scarcely aware of this overwhelming feeling of humiliation that is experienced by most of the world's population,'' which ''neither magical realistic novels that endow poverty and foolishness with charm nor the exoticism of popular travel literature manages to fathom.'' This is the invisible emotional reality Desai uncovers as she describes the lives of people fated to experience modern life as a continuous affront to their notions of order, dignity and justice. We do not need to agree with this vision in order to marvel at Desai's artistic power in expressing it.

HEADLINE: Pelt Appeal

BYLINE: By Rob Walker

 BODY:
It is easy these days to find evidence that consumers are more concerned than ever about ethics: there are constituencies for environmentally friendly products, Fair Trade products, products that support anything from cancer research to Vermont dairy farming. Yet even as the profile of the concerned consumer has risen, so has something else: fur sales. This seems surprising, given that for some years the wearing of fur was arguably the consumer ethics issue. Anti-fur activism had a very high profile, and was presumably one reason that the production of mink skins, for instance, plummeted by more than 50 percent between 1988 and 1993, according to Oslo Fur Auctions Ltd. Last year, mink production was close to 1980's peak levels again. In 2004, a Gallup poll found that 63 percent of respondents pronounced the buying and wearing of clothing made with animal fur ''morally acceptable.'' And it has become routine to see newspaper and television stories asserting that fur is back. 
Sussing out exactly where ethics fit into this turn of events is trickier than it might appear; each side of the debate rejects the assertions made by the other. Keith Kaplan, executive director of the Fur Information Council of America (which represents the fur industry), speaks with great enthusiasm about fur's recent strength, citing fur sales of $1.81 billion in 2004. But he claims that animal rights activists had minimal impact on the business: the problem in the early 1990's was a recession-driven luxury backlash. Nowadays, ''sales of everything luxury are up,'' he says. Thus, he concludes, fur has found its way back to the main floor of department stores all over the country.
 Meanwhile, Dan Mathews, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, contends that the fur comeback is an illusion. He says that the real growth is in Russia and China, and that in the United States the trend is limited to two groups. One, he maintains, is made up of ''fashion folks who are always into the latest thing -- which is sort of mainstream in New York, but outside of a few major cities it's not something that most people follow.'' (Mathews's claim, of course, dismisses the dominant theory of how the fashion business works.) The other group includes those influenced by what he calls ''the 'pimp and ho' look by rappers,'' adding that this style has passed its peak. He also points to the continuing influence of animal rights groups, evident in the recent decision by J. Crew to withdraw fur-trimmed items from its clothing line. Brandweek magazine named PETA to its list of Guerrilla Marketers of the Year for 2005, and Mathews says that the group is now focusing on designers like Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren. 
 Kathy Deane, president of Tobe, a global fashion and retail consultancy, frames things a little differently. Deane says that people may wear more fur now in part because they no longer fear being splashed with red paint by activists, but that the more important factors have to do with changes in the way designers use fur. Often, for instance, fur is in the trim or detail on outerwear that's made mostly of something else -- so it doesn't look like an old-fashioned, over-the-top luxury item. The technology of fur processing has also changed, with new techniques like micro-shearing, tip-dying and laser cutting allowing for different kinds of looks and fits. This, Deane says, has attracted consumers who have been ''looking for novelty.''
 Interestingly, Deane also notes the popularity, particularly among young people, of fake fur (for example, a fake-fur-lined sweatshirt from Abercrombie & Fitch). From a consumer ethics perspective, the message of fake fur has always been slightly confusing: I don't want to wear an animal skin, but I want to look as if I am. Conversely, some of the fur products created by new techniques are not immediately recognizable as fur -- offering the possibility of wearing animal skin that looks like something else. ''People are more aware now about ethics, and that it is part of their buying decision,'' Deane says. But when it comes to fashion, they are quick to remind themselves that they own leather shoes and leather bags and they eat meat, so why not a bit of fur? ''When you want something,'' she says, ''there's always a way to tell yourself that it's O.K.''

HEADLINE: Schooling Parents

BYLINE: By BY RANDY COHEN

 BODY:
The president of our local board of education sends her children to the public elementary schools, but when they get to high school, she moves them to private schools. Isn't it her ethical obligation either to send her children to the schools she sets policy for and espouses as so wonderful or to step down from the board? JoAnne Manse, Rutherford, N.J.
It is not. It is the obligation of board members to strive mightily to make the public schools so good that even parents with the means to opt out choose to remain. If the public schools are not yet that good, the president may honorably send her kids elsewhere -- indeed, her duty as a parent compels her to. Even where a public school is excellent, parents may seek programs it does not offer -- religious instruction, for example. 
 Enrolling her own kids at a school she administers can give a board member intimate daily insight into how her policies are working out, a real advantage in doing her job. Yet voters must select board members not on the basis of where they send their kids, but on how well they manage the schools. And remember: some excellent educators have no kids at all.
 Ultimately, a board member can home-school her kids for all I care (as long as she doesn't do it in my home); 
 if she is savvy, dedicated and effective, she gets my vote.
 I am a smart veterinary student, and my husband is an uncommonly intelligent engineer. We have degrees from prestigious universities. However, diabetes and heart disease run in my family, and my husband has Crohn's disease and a congenital heart problem. If we had three kids, we would contribute to overpopulation, but perhaps (even despite the medical issues) marginally increase the quality of that population (aren't I pretentious!). May we ethically have more than two children? Alison Cornwall, Davis, Calif.
 Implying that one social class is more entitled than another to have children tiptoes toward the goofball eugenics that should be an ugly anachronism. Even as a matter of nurture, not nature, those who attend ''prestigious universities'' have no greater moral right to reproduce than those at community colleges. Or no college. In fact, one might argue that it is in nobody's interest to replicate Harvardians. And by ''one'' I mean me, and by ''Harvardians'' I mean Robert McNamara. Or do I mean Henry Kissinger? Or is it the jealousy talking?
 If there is a strong chance of your passing on a serious malady to your children, you might forgo having (but not adopting) kids. How great a chance? That's something for you and your husband to discuss with your doctor.
 There are, as you suggest, economic and social arguments against having a third child, but they need not automatically preclude your doing so. What's critical is that in the country as a whole, and on the planet as a whole, the fertility rate does not exceed the replacement level, which in the United States is just over two kids. Some families will have one or no kids, and thus others may choose to have three. One key factor in achieving this global average is to raise the standard of living for all. Families in wealthier places like the United States or Western Europe tend to be smaller. (Other significant factors include the empowerment of women and increased access to education.)
 If you are committed to not increasing the population, to not risking passing on a serious health risk and to having a big family, consider adoption. It's not just DNA that determines how kids turn out.

HEADLINE: Obnoxious Behavior As a Revenue Stream

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MR. CHAIRMAN, members ---- is this thing turned on? (Tap, tap, tap.) Here we are in the year 2009 and the microphones still don't work. First, let me thank you for this opportunity to appear before Congress on my very first day as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.
 As you know, the American income tax system is an abomination. In the 20 years from 1985 to 2005 alone, you made 14,000 changes to the tax code, all of them embroidering a byzantine document that penalizes work, discourages saving and would mystify Einstein. 
Ladies and gentlemen, what do you say we shock everyone and do something sensible? America leads the world in two things: taxable wealth and bad habits. Why not kill two birds with one stone? Let's get away from this obsessive focus on taxing income and look for other sources of revenue that could be taxed with fruitful social consequences.
 I'll give you an example. As things stand, we tax voters by making them spend time and energy going somewhere to cast their ballots. What I propose is a new kind of poll tax: a levy on nonvoters. That's right; if you don't attach a poll receipt to your income tax return, we charge you something. This will encourage voting and help close the deficit, and from a political standpoint, you can't lose. After all, who's afraid of antagonizing people who don't vote?
 Now if you're willing to alienate some actual voters, you'll take my advice and pass an across-the-board B.T.U. tax on all forms of energy, including calories. That would let the federal government do something at last about our chief national addictions -- fossil fuel and fattening food. Chocolate chip cookies, heating oil, it makes no difference. Slap a tax on it!
 What's that? Mr. Chairman, please; there's no need for name-calling. To assuage inevitable voter anger at a measure that would simultaneously raise the price of fast food and fill-ups, I propose that we tax cellphone conversations in public places. Everybody hates these, right? Calls to 911 would be exempt, but on the other hand the National Security Agency has developed software that lets us single out certain calls, such as those placed to Al Qaeda or beginning with the phrase ''I'm on the train.'' Conversations featuring such key terms -- we could have a little fun and hold an Internet vote on which ones people hate most -- would come in for especially stiff levies.
 Now, I live in the real world, ladies and gentlemen. I know that some alternatives, while sensible economically, are suicidal politically. So you'll be glad to hear that at least one of my proposals works on both levels. I am happy to report the findings of actuaries who calculate that a mere 3 percent tax imposed on the New York Yankees' 2009 payroll would yield enough revenue to balance the federal budget.
 But there's no need to single out the Yankees. The possibilities are endless, and I'm directing my staff to explore all of them. We could tax sport utility vehicles by the pound. We could tax biographies by the word. We could tax carry-on luggage by the ton. A tax on e-mail would bring in revenue and cut down on spam. (We could even sell people the right to opt out of junk mail at the post office. The income from that would probably exceed what we make delivering the stuff.)
 The Internet is rich with taxing possibilities. My own favorite is a progressive tax on Internet page views: Web sites with the greatest number of hits would face the highest levies. Projections indicate that this tax on pornographic sites -- for that is what it would amount to -- could bring in huge sums while increasing productivity by discouraging Web surfing at work. Greater productivity should result in more taxable income, meaning that we can't lose. 
 Of course, we wouldn't want to impede important legislative research. So, yes, members of Congress and their staffs would be exempt.

 BODY:
IN the tiny room where I am writing this missive, there are four little display cases and a framed diploma, among many other mementos. The diploma is for my father-in-law, Dale Denman Jr. of Arkansas, and it is from the United States Military Academy, dated June 6, 1944 -- a day when quite a lot was happening of military significance in France.
 Next to that is a display case with two little stars. One is a Silver Star that my father-in-law won in Europe several months after he graduated. It is for running along a road under heavy German machine-gun fire to call in artillery to save the company for which he was a forward artillery observer. Next to it is a Bronze Star that my father-in-law, then a colonel, won in Vietnam in 1966 for holding his unit together when it was ambushed by a Vietcong force and would have been cut to pieces without him. 
I have been thinking a lot lately about these heirlooms that Colonel Denman left to my wife and me. That's because of some mail I have been getting about my recent articles in this space about the way high executives have been treating their employees and stockholders. What I said two weeks ago about UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, prompted hundreds of e-mail messages. (I have still not even remotely caught up with all of them because I read them myself -- no secretary here.) 
 Several people sent clippings describing how UAL provided Glenn F. Tilton, who was living in San Francisco when it hired him as chairman and chief executive, with a suite in a luxury hotel when he spent time at its headquarters in Chicago. UAL was paying for the suite -- which cost $18,000 a month, according to The San Francisco Chronicle -- while it was reorganizing its finances under bankruptcy court protection and telling tens of thousands of workers that their jobs had been eliminated, their pay cut, their pensions terminated or all of the above because the company was broke.
 Some of the letter writers recalled how UAL spent an average of $10 million a month on lawyers, accountants and investment bankers for 37 months while UAL was in bankruptcy, and yet was unable to pay its employees their pensions.
 Now UAL has emerged from bankruptcy with a mighty flourish, and an allowance of hundreds of millions of dollars for its top executives. Some letters pointed out that one of UAL's board members is none other than our old friend Robert S. Miller, chief executive of Delphi, the auto parts maker. 
 Delphi also recently entered bankruptcy -- but proposed to the bankruptcy court a payment of well over $100 million to its top executives to keep them happy while it was in bankruptcy. Mr. Miller, who goes by Steve, a version of his middle name (not the one who sings ''Fly Like an Eagle,'' but an artist of sorts nonetheless), has told Delphi's workers that they will have to take pay cuts of roughly two-thirds in order to save the business.
 But my favorite communication, the one that made me stay up nights, was from a United States Army sergeant who has done two combat tours in Iraq and two more in Afghanistan, and is now home in Georgia training others to serve in those wars. I have been pals with this man for a couple of years now, and we talk on the phone. He has been following my articles online, and he simply asked, ''Was this what I was fighting for in Iraq?''
 The question haunts me, not only because of UAL and Delphi, but also because there is something deeply broken about the corporate system in America. Long ago, my pop was pals with Harlow H. Curtice, the president of General Motors in its glory days in the 1950's. Mr. Curtice presided over a spectacularly powerful and profitable G.M. 
 For that, in his peak year as I recall from my youth, he was paid about $400,000 plus a special superbonus of $400,000, which made him one of the highest-paid executives in America. At that time, a line worker with overtime might have made $10,000 a year. In those days, that differential was considered very large -- very roughly 40 times the assembly line worker's pay, without bonus; very roughly 80 times with bonus. A differential of more like 10 to 20 times was more the norm.
 Now C.E.O.'s routinely take home hundreds of times what the average worker is paid, whether or not the company is doing well. The graph for the pay of C.E.O.'s is a vertical line in the last five years. The graph for workers' pay is a flat line -- in every sense.
 Now, my fellow free-market fans may well say: ''Hey, stop your whining. This is the free market at work.'' Only it isn't the free market at work. It's a kleptocracy at work. (I am indebted to another of my correspondents for the word.) What's happening here is that the governance system for many -- by no means all -- corporations has simply stopped working. 
 For centuries, the idea has held that the stockholders own the company. They are the trustors. The trustors select directors who in turn hire a chief executive and other top officers and then keep an eye on them for the stockholders. They -- the chief executive, other top officers and the directors -- are all agents for the stockholders, many of whom are often the employees, as is the case at UAL.
 But what has happened is that -- as in a corrupt, failed third-world state -- the trustees in too many cases are captives of the C.E.O. and his colleagues; they owe both their places on the board and their emoluments to the chief executive, and they exercise no meaningful restraint at all on managers. The directors are instead a sort of praetorian guard, protecting management from its real bosses, the stockholders, as management sucks the blood out of the company.
 I am by no means saying this is the standard or the usual way business is done in this country. Most managements are still honest and hard-working, I believe. But far too many are simply in the catbird seat to take what is not decently theirs from people who cannot afford to be taken.
 Government, meanwhile, does nothing, or next to nothing. Courts, especially bankruptcy courts, do nothing. And the employees and stockholders and the whole society are looted. Maybe it's not looting in the legal sense, but something basic is removed from the society. In the capitalist society, the most basic foundation is trust. But in today's world, trust is abused, mocked, drained of meaning.
 Again, I am not talking everywhere, by any means. I work with many, many businessmen and businesswomen, and a huge majority are honest and amazingly hard-working. I am sure that this is true nationally. But enough are not so honest and hard-working that it takes a toll on the rest of us. 
 Don't get me wrong. I am not a newborn. I know that looting is not new. Man is highly flawed when money is on the table and not guarded well. I saw it and wrote about it in great detail when Michael R. Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert were ascendant, and in many other cases. It was terrible and dreadful, at least in my view, back then in the 1980's. It has always been terrible.
 But there is something new and unlovely that my pal in the Army brought up. Now, we are engaged in a war. More than 100,000 Americans are fighting far from home. Many don't come back. Many come home crippled. They are fighting for a vision of a just and decent society back home in glorious, shining, blessed America. And back home, meanwhile, the looters are running wild, taking the meaning out of that vision of America, taking some -- by no means all -- of the beauty out of America as a land of justice and fairness.
 ONE of my correspondents wrote that she, a flight attendant at United Airlines,had played by the rules, believed what her bosses told her, trusted that the laws would protect her, believed that fairness would triumph in the end because it's America. ''I guess that makes me a fool in today's world,'' she said, because now she is broke, with no job, barely any pension and no faith. While the soldiers are fighting to protect us from the terrorists with bombs, too few are at home protecting us from the terrorists with briefcases. There aren't a lot of such terrorists, but they do a lot of damage.
 Surely this is not what Colonel Denman won his medals for. Surely this is not the America that our best are fighting and dying for in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is something desperately wrong here, and if President Bush is searching for an issue, I might suggest this: common decency for the workers and the savers and investors of this country, and an end to the hideous breaches of trust that build great mansions in the Hamptons and wreck a free soci-ety.

HEADLINE: I'd Really Like to Thank My Pal at the Auction House 

BYLINE: By HEATHCLIFF ROTHMAN

 BODY:
''COME on, Oscar, let's you and me get drunk,'' snaps Bette Davis as Margaret Elliott, a down-on-her-luck fading movie queen, in ''The Star,'' as she grabs her gold statuette, places it on the dashboard of her 1946 Mercury sedan and heads out on a bender. In an updated version, Davis wouldn't drive to the nearest bar to drown her sorrows. She would go directly to Sotheby's, where her Oscar would net her a half-million or more -- enough to keep her in mink and martinis for the rest of her post-diva days.
 An Oscar has always been as much about commerce as about art; it ups an actor's asking price and box office appeal. These days the trophy itself can mean cold cash as a collectible, worth up to $50,000 for a ''common Oscar,'' as experts call the technical and tangential awards, and from several hundred thousand dollars to $1.5 million for those bestowed upon famous films and actors. The trade in vintage Oscars through publicized auctions and an underground market has become a parallel universe as competitive and bitter as the annual acting derby itself. 
 ''Someone called me up for an important Oscar for an important film, for a lot of money,'' said Josh Evans, chairman of Leland's, a New York-based auction house. He is not about to name names -- not because auctioneering is a business of confidentiality, but because the statuette in question was awarded after 1950, the year the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences began asking winners to sign an agreement that would keep them from selling their awards for profit. (Today the academy requires this.)
 Mr. Evans likens the marketing of the proffered Oscar to getting rid of stolen merchandise. ''I don't see how it's possible,'' he said. ''It's almost like buying the Mona Lisa -- no, like that painting 'The Scream.' There's no or little value, or even underground value. It's too famous.'' (The film of the Oscar in question: ''On the Waterfront.'')
 During the 1990's, prices for collectibles soared into the stratosphere. Recently, the magician David Copperfield paid just under a quarter of a million dollars for the Oscar awarded to Michael Curtiz as director of ''Casablanca.'' In 1999, Michael Jackson paid $1.54 million for the best-picture Oscar for ''Gone With the Wind.'' 
 These days the academy monitors auctions and hinders questionable sales with aggressive tactics. ''This isn't the nice people you see on TV who present the awards,'' says Steven Ames Brown, a lawyer who fought the academy for eight years over Orson Welles's 1941 Oscar for best original screenplay (which he shared with Herman J. Mankiewicz), for ''Citizen Kane,'' which Welles's daughter, Beatrice, wanted to auction in order to finance animal-rights causes. ''This is a business, a very ugly business. They are completely uninterested in anybody else's life or needs. I call them thugs in suits, whose job it is to put a happy face on their conduct.''
 It's interesting that Ms. Welles herself obtained the statuette only by taking legal action against the cinematographer Gary Graver, who was in possession of it. Mr. Graver, who described the gesture as a nod to both their friendship and Welles's gratitude for the years, said: ''Orson gave it to me. He said, 'Here, keep this.' '' Mr. Graver said he worked for next to nothing for the struggling director in the 1960's and 80's. Welles's daughter sued Mr. Graver and won. ''I wouldn't say this in court,'' he said, ''but he also gave me films and personal papers. I was afraid she'd go after everything he gave to me.''
 Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director, defends his organization's crusade by saying: ''The more that Oscars are sold, the more it enables the idea of them as collectible items. This is an award for artistic excellence. So while no particular one is a disaster for us, every time one goes it's another ax stroke.''
 Those sympathizing with the academy include the director Steven Spielberg and the actor-producer Kevin Spacey -- both Oscar winners. They have jumped into the fray by digging into their wallets to rescue Oscars at public auction and then returning the statuettes to the academy. Mr. Spielberg has spent nearly $1.5 million for the cause. He paid $607,500 for Clark Gable's 1934 Oscar, for ''It Happened One Night''; $578,000 for Bette Davis's 1938 Oscar, for ''Jezebel''; and $207,500 for Davis's 1935 Oscar, for ''Dangerous.'' Mr. Spacey paid $156,875 for the composer George Stoll's 1945 Oscar for ''Anchors Aweigh.''
 On the other side of the battle are heirs of deceased Oscar winners and their lawyers and the collectors, many of whom look on the academy as the Evil Empire. One memorabilia seller, Nate Sanders, was sued by the academy when his Web site offered Judy Garland's 1939 juvenile Oscar, for ''The Wizard of Oz,'' on behalf of Sid Luft, Garland's third husband. ''They had sued me for perjury, but the judge immediately dismissed it,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''They had these lawyers come after me and Sid. They were very aggressive. I was very, very angry.''
 The Welles and Garland statuettes are pre-1950, but the legal argument used by the academy hinges on the validity of waivers necessary for the replacement of vintage Oscars lost over the years -- who actually signed the waiver and whether it covers the original as well as the replacement. Two years ago, Ms. Welles finally won her case, allowing her to sell not only her father's ''Citizen Kane'' Oscar -- estimated at $1 million -- but also his lifetime-achievement Oscar.
 Mr. Copperfield, who legally acquired the ''Casablanca'' best-director Oscar at auction, defends his private ownership of the public icon. If Michael Curtiz's ''family didn't want to sell or wanted to keep it in my family, that is their decision,'' Mr. Copperfield said, explaining that the statuette represents the excellence of old films that influenced his illusionist career. ''It's a symbol, a reminder, to get my work even better. It keeps me hungry.''
 Needy heirs who own a statuette don't always have the luxury to debate the pros and cons of selling it. Survival trumps sentiment. ''I came to a low point -- I needed money to survive and get along on,'' Mr. Graver said. There on his mantel, he recalled, stood the ''Citizen Kane'' Oscar. ''And I looked at it, and it dawned on me that the Oscar was worth money, and I felt that after all those years I worked for Orson, for practically little or no money, maybe he would think it was O.K. and I could sell it.''
 When Bette Davis left an Oscar and other artifacts to her trusted assistant, Kathy Sermak, she had a similar motive, Robert Osborne, the Turner Classic Movies host and an old friend of the actress's, speculated. ''I would bet, knowing Bette, that she gave it to Kathy so that if she fell on hard times she would have something to turn into money,'' he said.
 The ultimate hard-luck Oscar sale was made by Harold Russell, the paraplegic World War II vet in ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946). The only winner to sell his own Oscar, he initially said he did it to pay his wife's medical bills. The real story, according to Bruce Davis, was decidedly less heart-tugging. ''A couple of reporters pinned him down,'' Mr. Davis said. ''It came out that his wife wanted to take a cruise. He had a new wife who knew he had a spare Oscar. Lew Wasserman bought it and donated it back to us.'' 
 Unfortunately for Russell, his Oscar for best supporting actor in a best picture netted him only about $50,000 in 1992. Today that would be a bare-bones minimum.
 In the current marketplace, nameplates are sometimes removed from the statuettes in order to make them salable, even though less valuable. The owner of a statuette whose plate is lost can use the serial number on the bottom to replace the plate and thereby bump up the value.
 Mr. Evans of Leland's auction house says a Paramount executive once offered him a blank statuette, claiming it was Leo McCarey's best-director Oscar for ''Going My Way.'' ''I said, 'How do you know it's Leo McCarey's?' '' Mr. Evans said. ''He says, 'I know because I got it from McCarey's son.' '' Mr. Evans said he gave him $10,000 for the anonymous statuette. ''But I told him if he got the nameplate I'd give him another $10,000.'' The executive ordered the plate from the academy, and Mr. Evans paid up. ''That's $10,000 for a little piece of plastic,'' Mr. Evans said with a chuckle. ''And if the academy had known it was going to be sold, they never would have helped him.''
 To claim that the Oscar's image is sullied by the auctioning of the occasional statuette is hypocrisy, said Mr. Brown, the lawyer who represented Orson Welles's daughter. ''If the image of the Oscars is so sacrosanct, I posed to them through the pleadings, then why did you give an Oscar to Roman Polanski after he raped a minor? And why did you not put the Oscars on time delay two years ago and stop Michael Moore from bashing American foreign policy during active combat?''
 Mr. Copperfield simply laughed when asked to comment on the academy's fear that statuette purchases threaten to turn the award into a commercial commodity. ''God knows, nothing's commercial about the Oscars!'' he said with pointed sarcasm. ''Have you ever watched the Oscars?''

HEADLINE: Made-to-Order Artwork To Fit a Corporate Budget

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
FOR decades, companies have bought fine art at auctions or commissioned works by prestigious artists for their office buildings. But as art has climbed in price and spaces have grown in size, businesses have discovered another, less expensive option: made-to-order art.
 One company that offers companies such art is Novo Arts, founded as an art consulting business about 30 years ago in Greenwich Village. In the late 1980's, when the art market was crashing, it began offering art customized for office spaces, produced by a gaggle of artists perched at easels in a studio. At the time, said Marlaina Deppe, founder and president of Novo Arts, ''corporate art budgets plummeted also, and painting had sort of fallen from fashion in favor of art that was less appropriate for businesses.'' 
''Another factor was that office spaces were becoming massive,'' she added. 
 One client, the pharmaceutical company Hoffman-LaRoche, had a 300,000-square-foot building in Nutley, N.J., and was seeking a number of 18-foot paintings. In a serendipitous moment, Ms. Deppe risked presenting a proposal for made-to-order artwork costing 25 percent of the projected cost of collecting or commissioning fine art.
 ''Hoffman-LaRoche had a project manager there who thought our concept was brilliant,'' said Ms. Deppe, an artist, art historian and public relations specialist.
 Thus, the company's concept of manufacturing art was born. The studio evolved over many years as an informal branch of the company, enabling businesses to order art in bulk at a price that was right. 
 But Ms. Deppe said she did not promote the service formally until the economic downturn in the early part of this decade. By then, businesses that were loath to spend the equivalent of an employee's annual salary on a piece of art, but still wanted something nicer than framed posters, were eager to sign on. Now Novo Arts has 44 employees, with seven offices nationwide and one in Tokyo.
 While the company continues to work as a consultant for businesses that have the budgets to collect fine art, the studio program has expanded from handling about a dozen projects at a time to about 240. 
 That keeps the two dozen artists busy. They are recruited through word of mouth and advertising in art magazines and Craigslist.
 Recently, Ms. Deppe, who functions as an art director, wandered through Novo Arts' new Chelsea studio -- it also has a studio in Kent, N.Y., in Putnam County -- critiquing a rather Rubenesque painting of Lady Liberty produced by an enthusiastic young artist from Brooklyn.
 ''I don't know -- the large chest and the sway back, I think we need to rework that a bit,'' Ms. Deppe said. 
 ''Yeah, it's the Statue of Liberty, not the Statue of Women's Liberation,'' joked the studio director, Paul Mulvaney.
 The atmosphere in Novo Arts' studio is light and collaborative, but there is an assiduous attitude toward art production. Artists say they harbor few romantic illusions about what they are producing, with much of it revolving around corporate branding, but they do appreciate the creative challenges.
 Recently, at the request of designers for Bank of America, artists worked around the clock trying to devise a technique to paint on glass without having to bake it, the typical method for making the paint last.
 Novo Arts is now producing huge glass panels painted with Art Deco themes for a dozen floors of Bank of America's space in Rockefeller Center.
 ''Novo Arts can produce to any budget, which is one of the things that's really unusual about them,'' said Keith Rosen, a design director for Gensler, an international architecture and design firm that uses Novo Arts regularly and is handling the Bank of America project. ''Companies get unique pieces of artwork, not necessarily investment quality, but they're very well presented and geared to the project.''
 About 80 percent of Novo Arts' business comes through referrals in the architectural and design business, Ms. Deppe said.
 For instance, VNU Inc., the Dutch publishing and market research company, discovered Novo Arts when its chief executive saw custom artwork in another building. Over the course of several years, Novo Arts has produced about 285 artworks for VNU's approximately 600,000 square feet in a building in Greenwich Village, at a total cost of $760,000. To collect or commission equivalent art would have cost about $2 million to $3 million, Ms. Deppe said. 
 The pieces are oversized, funky and eclectic, except in the executive area, where representational paintings accentuate the soft colors of walls and columns. But the wildly inventive plays the biggest role, with mixed media images that include neon lights and ranks of textured tiles of playful images, from beach balls to bull herds.
 ''The art serves the purpose,'' said Karen LaPak, vice president for corporate real estate services at VNU. ''We're not spending a lot of money. It's colorful, unique and interesting. And they're good conversation pieces when people visit.''
 Ms. Deppe says she has noticed that walls previously dedicated to art in various businesses have lately been usurped by plasma screens. Thus, Novo Arts, which recently added brochure and Web design to its services, has developed another ambitious new program: high-definition video art.
 The company's first project was Chi Bar in the Sheraton Chicago hotel. There, a video screen presents a sequence of images of recognizable Chicago architecture and attractions with musical accompaniment. Since then, several more Novo Arts clients have been inspired to take the plunge into video art.
 ''Marlaina obviously stays ahead of the trends,'' said Richard Kielar, senior vice president at the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, which owns the Sheraton Chicago. ''She was able to get the video aspect of her business rolling with her artists, who are constantly out there and taking photos.''
 Ms. Deppe says she hopes to offer a monthly ''pay per view'' service for clients with plasma screens. Novo Arts also provides art to companies on a lease-to-purchase basis and offers monumental sculpture and installations on a rotating basis to businesses.
 ''I remember Georgia O'Keeffe once said, 'I just want to make a beautiful thing,' '' Ms. Deppe said. ''Our policy is: Anything we make, if you're not 100 percent happy with it, you don't buy it. You have to love your painting.''

HEADLINE: Chasing Full Employment

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
FULL employment! The United States has rarely entered that paradise. There was a hint of it in the late 1990's, but for Americans under the age of 50, the experience has been so fleeting that they may not realize full employment was once a hotly pursued goal -- a condition considered so important that many politicians wanted it legislated and not left to chance.
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt put full employment on the table in 1944, declaring that having a job was a basic human right. During World War II, the nation actually achieved full employment. And twice since then, Congress has considered bills that would have guaranteed a job at decent pay for every adult who wanted work. That doesn't mean everyone; lots of people don't want to work. But in a society that legislated full employment, the government would be the employer of last resort if the private sector came up short of good jobs for those who wanted them.
These are radical concepts today. Fear of another depression prompted the first debate, in the mid-1940's, and a steep recession contributed to the second, in the mid-1970's. Both bills, as finally enacted, failed to achieve their original goal. And as inflation rose in the late 70's, government shifted to fighting it, often at the expense of employment. 
 The old-timers who tried to legislate full employment saw it not as a desirable market phenomenon -- the spinoff of a robust economy -- but as a civil right, on a par with the right to vote. That is still the view of a few economists, including Amartya Sen at Harvard, whose writings on famine, poverty and other injustices won him the Nobel in economics in 1998.
 ''I know that people get scared of inflation and Wall Street is a natural ally in this fear,'' Mr. Sen said. ''But the real costs of unemployment are very high. Having a job confers not only income, but social recognition and self-respect, which comes with having the sense of being wanted by society.''
 Out of the second Congressional debate came not full employment but a fear of it. The law that Congress finally enacted, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, set full employment as a goal -- along with low inflation. Soon, however, each was viewed as the enemy of the other and full employment, defined as the right to a job, lost out.
 Full employment ''was the tradition that flourished after World War II,'' said Helen Ginsburg, a professor emeritus of economics at Brooklyn College. ''Now, it is full employment until the inflation rate goes up.'' 
 For more than two decades, the guiding thesis embraced by economists and policy makers was this: If unemployment became too low, the labor shortage would give workers the bargaining leverage to push up wages. Employers would respond by raising prices to cover the labor costs, starting an inflationary spiral deemed to be more damaging than a rising unemployment rate.
 That dubious proposition kept America away from full employment. Every time the unemployment rate fell below a designated tipping point -- 5 or 6 percent -- the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. The higher rates slowed the economy, muffled hiring and pushed the unemployment rate back up. The spell cast by this way of thinking did not break until the late 1990's, when the economy boomed, the unemployment rate plummeted, wages rose faster than inflation across the work force and, lo and behold, inflation remained low, although the Fed still held down interest rates. 
 As a result, even some Wall Street stalwarts have eased up on their insistence that low unemployment and rising wages lead to higher inflation. Listen, for example, to James Glassman, senior domestic economist at J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. ''This idea that wages are a signal of coming inflation is a bad habit,'' he said. ''Business has control over labor costs more than ever in this global economy, as so many workers unfortunately are finding out.''
 The late-90's hiring boom, approaching full employment, has lingered fondly in public memory. And now that the unemployment rate is falling once more -- it dropped two-tenths of a percentage point last month, to 4.7 percent, its lowest level in four and a half years -- there is talk again of somehow bringing back, if not full employment, then at least the late 90's version of it.
 The unemployment rate, excluding teenagers, fell below 4 percent in 1998, the first time it had dropped that low since 1973. It fell to 3.3 percent in late 2000, achieving briefly what many economists define as the ''full employment unemployment rate'' for adults. Some, however, would put it lower.
 ''Two percent unemployment would certainly be a condition closer to one in which everyone seeking work would be able to land a job at a good wage,'' said William A. Darity Jr., an economist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. 
 Adult unemployment often fell well below 3 percent in the early 1950's and occasionally in the late 1960's. After that, an expanding global production network shifted work overseas, reducing the number of good jobs in America. The late-90's bubble economy was a brief exception to this trend. 
 So does globalization mean that for full employment to exist, there must be legislation that mandates it? A great majority of economists and politicians -- liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans -- resist this view. They count on the markets to bring back full employment, with a smattering of tax breaks, subsidies and low interest rates to help the process. But not government as the employer of last resort.
 That faith in markets, on the other hand, has not yet produced full employment. A famous British economist, William Beveridge, argued in the 1930's that full employment exists when the number of job vacancies exceeds the number of people seeking them. Only then is everyone who wants a job likely to land one, at a good wage. 
 The number of unfilled jobs in the United States is certainly smaller than the number of people seeking work. A survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed, for example, 4.1 million job openings in December. That was well short of the 7.4 million unemployed people seeking work that month, not to mention the roughly 10 million others who say they would look for work if they thought that their hunt would be successful. 
 Recognizing the shortfall in the demand for workers, the federal government generated public-sector jobs in the 70's under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, a program that the Reagan administration ended in 1983. Mr. Darity argues that something like CETA should be revived, not to supply make-work jobs, but to satisfy pressing social needs with projects like public school construction or a national teachers corps or high-speed rail lines.
 ''Certainly there are areas that the private sector does not find profitable,'' Mr. Darity said, ''but the public needs and the private sector would find useful.''

HEADLINE: Camden's Rankled Ranks 

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
IT has not been easy being a member of the Camden Police Department lately.
 First there was last summer's collective shame over failing to find three boys who had climbed inside the trunk of a car and were found suffocated two days later. Next there was a reorganization that shifted specialized officers to street beats, resulting in extensive overtime.
Then there was the unwelcome distinction of being named America's ''most dangerous city'' for the second year in a row, which, though based on the previous year's crime statistics, nonetheless captured headlines in November. And finally, there was an announcement last month that someone from outside the department was being put in charge. 
 Given the awkward title ''interim supersession executive,'' Robert L. Stewart, a police management executive from Florida, took over the reins of the more than 500-member police department on Feb. 1, a position he will hold for the next year. 
 Aside from the ungainly title, Mr. Stewart's arrival marks yet another emergency layer of government applied to this troubled city of about 80,000 -- riddled with crime and poverty -- where things are often not as they appear.
 It is a city run largely on state funds where the elected mayor is merely a figurehead, and the actual running of the city is handled by an administrator appointed by the state. It is a city designated an Abbott school district in which most of the financing and operation of the schools is controlled by the state. And it is a city where, with the authority in the police department ceded to the county prosecutor's office, the new chief will not be a chief at all.
 The appointment of Mr. Stewart has not settled well with many of Camden's rank-and-file officers and supervisors, several of whom had their eye on the top post when the former chief, Edwin Figueroa, announced his retirement late last year. 
 But for those involved in the selection of Mr. Stewart -- a group that included a wide range of public officials but no one from the police department -- the collective thinking was that there was not anyone in line to take over who could bring about the kind of reform deemed necessary for a force that they say has functioned at substandard levels for years.
 ''They've operated in an economically depressed, extremely high-crime area and gotten beaten up a lot over the years,'' said Robert Wasserman, a national police policy expert who was brought in by the state attorney general's office to guide a blue ribbon panel formally known as Camden Public Safety Commission, which was assigned to study the problems within the police department. 
 The panel chairman, Charles Rogovin, said they chose Mr. Stewart, a police captain in the District of Columbia for 20 years and a former police chief of Ormond Beach, Fla., because ''we believed the city needed more sophisticated leadership.''
 ''The people in the city felt they were not getting the kind of response they needed,'' said Mr. Rogovin, an emeritus professor at Temple University Law School. ''The department was full of silos, a lot of small units running around trying to address brush fires.''

In Search of a New Leader
 The panel is expected to release its findings and recommendations by the end of this month. In anticipation of that report, Camden County Prosecutor Vincent P. Sarubbi -- who was given full authority over the department in 2003 -- said it was important to get a new leader in place now so he could immediately begin enacting the recommendations. 
 As for the grumbling over the decision to look beyond the department for a new chief, Mr. Sarubbi said his office chose to go outside because he did not see things changing in the entrenched department of 423 uniformed officers and 85 civilian employees. 
 ''When you look at the criminal justice reports going back to 1969, it's the same criticism over and over again, just change the dates,'' he said. ''We had some concerns that the recommendations of the blue ribbon panel wouldn't be followed through on.'' 
 ''Bob Stewart's lack of pre-existing ties to the department will allow him to make decisions objectively, based on public safety needs of the community,'' Mr. Sarubbi said, adding that one of Mr. Stewart's tasks would be to start grooming a potential chief from within the department, a process that could take a few years. (A second temporary leader is expected to be appointed to replace Mr. Stewart after his one-year stint.)
 Yet union leaders in Camden and police executives elsewhere in the state say such talent already exists in the department, with two deputy chiefs who each have more than 20 years on the job and six captains who have risen through the ranks here. Bringing in someone from outside deals a blow to the department's morale, the head of the supervisors' union said. 
 ''It's a slap in the face,'' said William Murray, president of the Camden Organization of Police Superiors. ''You have people who have spent their whole adult lives preparing to be chief of police. There isn't one candidate that's in line to take over as chief that couldn't do the job.''
 Similarly, Mitchell Sklar, executive director of the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police, said his organization supported the appointment of a chief in Camden from within the ranks, which he said would not only demonstrate a commitment to the officers but also to the city.
 ''There's no reason to go out and parachute someone in from the outside,'' Mr. Sklar said. ''The morale would go straight down the drain if the message was sent out that no matter how much prep you put in, you're not good enough. It permeates from the top to the bottom, and into the community as well.''
 New Jersey's civil service laws require that supervising officers be promoted from within their departments. Qualified candidates take a test, and the position is filled from among the top scorers. So far, no test for a chief has been scheduled for Camden. 

Circumventing State Rules
 The city can circumvent the state rules by naming a civilian police director, like Mr. Stewart. But this has caused some officers here to question what Mr. Stewart's role would be, since civilians are forbidden from many police functions, like carrying a gun or making arrests.
 ''He's not a New Jersey resident,'' said John Williamson, president of Camden's Fraternal Order of Police. ''He's not a certified police officer in New Jersey. So what authority does he have to run the day-to-day operations of the police department?'' 
 A similar conflict arose several years ago in Asbury Park, where the city appointed L. Louis Jordan, a former investigator with the Monmouth County prosecutor's office, to be the police director. Although Mr. Jordan held civilian status, he began wearing a uniform and patrolling the streets.
 The state attorney general challenged Mr. Jordan's behavior and won in both the lower court and on appeal. Exacerbating the situation, Mr. Jordan's impersonation of an officer and the heavy-handed way he ran the department resulted in repeated calls for his dismissal by the rank-and-file officers. In December, he left the department.
 And in Trenton, the city's residents voted to appoint a police director in place of a chief in 2003, although the tenure of the director, Joseph Santiago, has also been rocky, particularly after the city experienced a record 31 homicides last year. 
 Mr. Sklar of the police chiefs association suggested that Camden follow the path taken by cities like Newark, Elizabeth and Jersey City, where the police departments are run by both a civilian director, who handles budgets and policy, and a chief, in charge of implementing that policy in addition to day-to-day operations. 
 For his part, Mr. Stewart -- who will earn an annual salary of $170,000, including benefits -- said he saw no reason for the head of a large urban force to be expected to perform daily police duties.
 ''I have no policing authority,'' said Mr. Stewart, who will report to Mr. Sarubbi. ''My job is to take the report of the blue ribbon panel and begin creating a strategic vision of where the department should be in six months, a year, two years.''
 Since retiring as chief in Ormond Beach in 1997, Mr. Stewart has served for two years as executive director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Officials, and for the last five years has run a consulting business, providing input on police training, efficiency and the use of force in such cities as Kansas City, Mo., Louisville and Dallas. He also served as interim chief of police at the Rutgers Newark campus for four months last year. 
 On several of his consulting jobs, Mr. Stewart was hired by Mr. Wasserman, the security expert and founder of the Maryland consulting firm PSComm, Mr. Wasserman was hired by the state to oversee the work of the Camden Public Safety Commission. For his efforts in Camden, Mr. Wasserman is being paid $300,000 by the state.
 In response to suggestions by union officials that his hiring represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Stewart said: ''I have never been an employee of Bob Wasserman's. I am an independent contractor who has worked for PSComm.'' 
 Noting that Mr. Stewart was the commission's third choice, Mr. Sarubbi said it made perfect sense for Mr. Wasserman to hire someone who had a proven track record.
 And while members of the department who were most likely to ascend to chief were not formally interviewed for the job, Mr. Rogovin said the commission did conduct an assessment of the department's professional staff.
 ''They were reviewed in the sense that 'Were they ready to be chief?' and the conclusion was 'No, not at this juncture,' '' said Mr. Rogovin.

Anxiety Comes With Change
 Mr. Rogovin described Mr. Stewart's hiring as ''an effort to change the ethos in the department, a fundamental change,'' which he recognized would cause some anxiety.
 ''Morale takes a hit when the existing order is disturbed,'' he said. ''Any time there's a change, or you disturb people's vested interest, there's distress.''
 Concurring with that assessment, Mr. Williamson, the head of the local fraternal order who is a 10-year veteran of the police department here, said morale was at ''an all-time low.'' In addition to the surprise appointment of Mr. Stewart -- he and other police leaders learned of the decision the night before Mr. Stewart's appointment and met him an hour before he was introduced at a news conference -- Mr. Williamson said officers had been reeling from the changes brought about by reorganization. 
 With an emphasis on community policing, most of the officers have been assigned to one of four geographic districts, each headed by a captain to whom they will be held accountable. As a result, Mr. Williamson said, there has been confusion and a marked increase in overtime requests as officers have not been permitted to be shifted from one district to another to fill gaps.
 ''It's stressful enough to put on your uniform and kiss your wife and kids goodbye and say 'I may encounter something and I won't come home,' '' Mr. Williamson said. ''Add to that 'If I don't get hurt, I still might not come home because I have to work overtime.' ''
 Mr. Sarubbi said his office has seen ''no clear pattern of significant overtime'' since the reorganization began in September, adding that there were no orders that said the sectors could not share resources. 
 Mr. Stewart said allocation of manpower would be his first priority. Noting that he has gotten a good response from the officers he has met, Mr. Stewart said a second priority was to help groom the department's superiors toward taking over some day.
 ''I suspect there are employees who want to be better managers and they will seek me out,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''The officers want to be a better department than what they read in the paper.''

Troubles Began in 1998
 The department's latest troubles date to 1998, when Police Chief William Hill retired abruptly after accusations of fiscal and personnel mismanagement, and the state asked the county prosecutor at the time, Lee Solomon, to monitor the force. Mr. Sarubbi took over those duties when he became prosecutor in 2002, and in 2003 was asked by the state attorney general to supercede the department's authority in an effort to provide more state resources to the city and get the department back on track.
 ''Based on a 20-year history of law enforcement issues, based on having to assign state police to Camden again and again, the attorney general decided to move to supersession and take a full look at the department,'' said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the criminal justice division of the state attorney general's office. 
 While Mr. Sarubbi said he has sought to remove himself as the person in charge of the police department, that is not likely to happen any time soon, particularly after last year's series of blows to the Camden police. 
 In June, the city attracted national attention when three boys were missing and a force of more than 150 police officers failed to find them in time. Fifty hours after their disappearance, a relative found the boys dead, locked inside the trunk of a Toyota Camry in a yard where they were last seen playing.
 Among other things, a follow-up report found that the department had never implemented the 1998 recommendations of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that search teams immediately investigate closed spaces, like car trunks and refrigerators. Mr. Sarubbi said those standards have since been implemented. 
 The second setback came in November, when, for the second consecutive year, Camden was named ''the nation's most dangerous city'' by Morgan Quitno Press, a publishing company that issues an annual crime ranking survey. Based on the F.B.I.'s uniform crime statistics from 2004, the survey found Camden outpaced other cities with populations of 75,000 or more in per-capita violent crimes. That year, there were 54 murders in the city and a serial rapist in the downtown area. 
 While several other New Jersey cities saw jumps in murder rates last year, Camden's homicides dropped to 38 for 2005, with overall violent crime down by 16 percent, factors that Mr. Sarubbi said he hoped would take the city out of the top slot in this year's Morgan Quitno report. 
 As Mr. Sarubbi points to improved crime statistics and the growing effectiveness of other new policing programs, advocates of home rule say that it is time to turn the reins back to the police department. But Mr. Hagerty of the attorney general's office said such a move would depend on the successful implementation of the commission's recommendations, a measure he refused to attach to a timetable. 
 ''The situation will take as long as it needs to take,'' he said. ''All parties involved have the same goal: a department that provides the best public safety possible to the City of Camden.''

HEADLINE: Wanted: Day Laborers

BYLINE: By Carola Otero Bracco.

DATELINE: Mount Kisco, N.Y. 

 BODY:
IMMIGRATION is the face of this country. In Westchester County and on Long Island, it influences everything from traffic patterns and the kind of ethnic foods we eat to the character of the historic enclaves and towns we live in. 
 Unfortunately, the benefits that immigrants bring to this country are being forgotten on Long Island and in Westchester as battles erupt over the free-flowing and informal labor force that has sprung up in response to our insatiable appetite for cheap labor. 
 Towns like Brewster, Farmingville and Mamaroneck face rising tension between residents and day laborers who line the sidewalks looking for work. And town leaders must balance appeasing irate citizens with providing labor for the businesses that form their tax base. 
 This tension and frustration, which run throughout our country, was certainly one of the reasons that the House of Representatives in December passed a bill that would criminalize, detain and deport the nearly 11 million undocumented workers in this country. Such a simplistic and overreaching approach does nothing, however, to deal with the reality of our economic needs and our broken immigration system. 
 Instead, it helps to perpetuate the ugly myths surrounding these workers, fueling animosity and misunderstanding in communities across America struggling to integrate new immigrants.
 Fortunately, an antidote to these myths is at hand: ''On the Corner: Day Labor in the United States,'' the first comprehensive nationwide study of the day labor phenomenon. Written by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles and elsewhere, it has important implications for towns and localities across Westchester and Long Island. Among its findings are these: 
 Myth: Day laborers get a free ride because they don't pay taxes. 
 Reality: By some measures, day laborers pay more than their share of taxes. Day workers rarely earn more than $15,000 a year, placing them among the working poor. If they were documented, this income would make them eligible for earned income credits and maybe even a tax refund. 
 They also pay property taxes through the high rents charged by the landlords in this area. A bed in a shared apartment can cost $400 a month in Westchester County. Laborers also pay the same sales taxes as everyone else.
 Myth: Day labor is a choice that these workers favor.
 Reality: The largest segment of surveyed laborers is employed in the day labor market for less than one year. For many of these workers, day labor is a stop gap until a permanent job opens up.
 Myth: Day laborers are itinerants and have no ties to the towns where they seek work.
 Reality: According to the study, about one in three day laborers has lived in the United States for six or more years. They attend church regularly and are involved in sports clubs and community centers.
 Myth: Hiring sites are magnets that draw unwanted immigrants to an area.
 Reality: Day labor markets are driven by the simple economics of supply and demand. They develop in areas where there is a need for pools of low-cost labor.
 Without these laborers we would be hard pressed to find nannies in Chappaqua, gardeners in Glen Cove, kitchen workers to prepare food in our favorite restaurants or home health care workers to help keep our elderly parents at home in Wantagh. And we means you and me, not just contractors: On the East Coast, which has the second largest percentage of day laborers, individuals hire 42 percent of day laborers. 
 There are proven solutions to managing this labor demand. Chief among them are day-labor worker centers, 63 of which now operate in 17 states. Communities sponsoring formal worker centers find relief from the tensions between the day workers and residents. These centers also help prevent labor and civil rights abuses, provide improved working conditions and help workers recover unpaid wages.
 In 2000, when the proliferation of informal hiring sites raised tensions in Mount Kisco, community leaders formed my organization, Neighbors Link, as a formal day labor hiring site. Since then, we have expanded into a center that offers workers and their families computer training, English classes and other community-building activities -- a possible model for other towns seeking to integrate workers.
 Without a doubt, the day laborer phenomenon is one of the most vexing challenges facing our region and our country, raising issues of economics, immigration and human rights that will bedevil policymakers for years to come. 
 As long as our need for cheap labor continues, immigrants will come to our borders. But the House bill that seeks to criminalize day laborers, now pending in the Senate, does not fix our immigration system nor does it absolve us of our responsibility to put a human face on this complex problem.

DATELINE: Stony Brook 

 BODY:
HUMAN activities that affect the land are governed by regional planning and zoning laws. The same should be the case for our waterways, especially those surrounding Long Island. 
 Right now, neither the state nor the federal government cohesively regulates the use of coastal waterways. As a result, there are conflicts over how to balance projects that could benefit residents and businesses while keeping the sound, the ocean and the bays healthy. The building of wind farms and liquid natural gas terminals, the disposal of debris from dredging and the laying of power cables are just a few examples. Unfortunately, because of the lack of clear authority and policy in deciding whether these projects are appropriate, emotion ends up playing a bigger role than science in these debates.
We depend upon the marine environment for fishing, manufacturing, recreation, transportation, power generation and distribution, military activities and waste disposal. In addition, the coastline buffers the power of the sea and shelters and nourishes vulnerable marine organisms. Meanwhile, the ever-growing population along the coastlines -- some 20 million people live near coastal waters in the tristate region -- impinges on the marine environment. Nassau and Suffolk Counties, with a population of about 2.8 million, are expected to be completely built up by 2015. 
 With this ever greater reliance on coastal waters, freedom of the seas and laissez-faire can no longer be the sole justification for marine environmental policy in the region. Marine zoning would manage the system as an integrated whole, creating a framework to decide when, say, an industrial project is incompatible with recreational uses or commercial fishing or when it's appropriate to sacrifice marine habitat for an industrial project. 
 Since piecemeal efforts focusing on a single species are largely unsuccessful, zoning that allows for efforts to conserve the entire marine ecosystem is essential. For example, spawning sanctuaries might be set aside as part of such zoning. New York has no such areas at present except for shellfish.
 While preserving marine animal and plant species is vital, it's important to recognize that commercial and industrial projects in Long Island's coastal waters provide crucial benefits to our society, especially as we figure out how to meet demands for energy. Zoning can insure that the placement of wind farms, electrical cables and pipelines is both environmentally acceptable and economically feasible. Decisions on siting such projects are now viewed in isolation, which detracts from developing a comprehensive energy policy. 
 Zoning can also provide a framework to deal broadly with the more than a billion gallons per day of sewage effluent from New York City and Long Island coastal communities that enter marine waters. For now, where those discharges should be and the level of treatment necessary to achieve public health and environmental goals are poorly understood. 
 Businesses worried about the high cost of land transportation will increasingly turn to maritime transit. This means more demand for shipping lanes (some requiring dredging), marine transportation terminals, offshore platforms and sites for disposal of dredged material. A strong case can be made to replace the 100 or so 25-ton trucks per day hauling municipal solid waste off Long Island with barges, particularly if the quantity of wastes being shipped continues to increase. But where might marine transfer stations be acceptable? That's where zoning plays a role.
 Zoning can determine whether marine buffer zones, including areas where spraying for mosquitoes is prohibited, are needed to protect marine life and people living along the coast from exposure to atmospheric or water-borne chemicals. It can decide if buffers are required as part of military and domestic security. Some areas might be set aside to be forever wild -- perhaps areas of high biodiversity, where bird colonies, marine mammals and large fish densities converge, like Gardiners Island, the Gull Islands and Fishers Island.
 A zoning plan also forces people to look at the trade-offs among alternative uses. For example, Long Island Sound may or may not be a good location for the proposed Broadwater liquid natural gas terminal, but if it is not built, the future trade-off is increased use of dirtier fuels like oil.
 We are wasting considerable effort and resources making decisions piecemeal. Marine zoning can help. But it will be a complex process. Water doesn't recognize mapped boundaries and the marine life can't be fenced in. Effective marine zoning will require scientific expertise and input from the fishing, environmental, regional planning, commercial and political communities. Most important, marine zoning will require political will power. 
 Zoning on land has served us well. We must now develop similar plans for our marine environment.

HEADLINE: A Garage Plan, Followed by Fear of Fumes

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
With the Triborough Bridge and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive as crowded as ever and 125th Street overflowing with stop-and-go traffic, some East Harlem residents say they already breathe more than their share of auto exhaust. That is why the neighborhood is casting a skeptical eye on a proposed development that would include 1,000 new parking spaces and an underground garage for Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses. 
 The project, known as Uptown New York, is a joint venture between the city's Economic Development Corporation and a private developer, and would combine commercial and residential uses in an area bounded by 125th and 127th Streets and Second and Third Avenues. It would also contain the garage, which would hold about 80 buses, replacing a street-level depot that has long been unpopular locally.
The garage would not lead to an increase in the number of buses on the site, but opponents say concentrating the vehicles into the smaller area would concentrate pollution. Janel Patterson, a development corporation spokeswoman, said the opposite: that putting the buses underground would be better for the environment. The proposal coincides with other large developments in the neighborhood, including a planned shopping center along the East River between 116th and 119th Streets that would include a Home Depot and a Costco. 
 Neighborhood critics have an ally in Scott Stringer, Manhattan's borough president. ''The high rate of asthma among children in East Harlem is staggering, and we should not be exacerbating that problem,'' Mr. Stringer said recently. ''We are giving this proposal a very critical review.''
 According to Ms. Patterson, the development corporation is meeting with local groups and officials to revisit the project's scope and size. JAKE MOONEY

HEADLINE: Purchase Lures Corporate Jet Set

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
BECAUSE of a general belief among frequent business travelers that corporate flights are safer than going commercial, times are flush for companies like Landmark Aviation, which services private jets. 
 At least that is the way Shawn Vick, the company's president, explained its recent expansion into Westchester, to a ''fixed base operation,'' or F.B.O., at the county airport.
Landmark's customers ''believe they have a higher degree of security on corporate flights that they can control,'' Mr. Vick said, pointing out another asset of fixed-base operations: shorter waits and faster security clearances. ''We're a real time-saver for our corporate customers,'' he said, describing those clients as ''many Fortune 2000's who do business in and around the New York Metropolitan area.'' 
 Landmark, a year-old Tempe, Ariz., company, recently acquired Skyport, a smaller company already operating out of the Westchester airport, which is home to one of the largest corporate fleets in the country, according to Lawrence C. Salley, commissioner for the County Department of Transportation. The purchase gives Landmark 34 fixed-base operations in the United States and Canada, most of them in the Southeast and Texas. 
 The company, which also owns another nine maintenance centers throughout the country, was created by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm in Washington, from the merger of three aviation services companies: Garrett Aviation Services of Tempe; Piedmont Hawthorne of Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Associated Air Center of Dallas. 
 With the merger, Landmark now employs 2,500 people; it had $800 million in revenues in 2005. According to Mr. Vick, it caters to the increasing number of corporations that fly their own jets or own fractional shares in such aircraft. 
 In its annual business aviation outlook last November, Honeywell Aerospace forecast a sharp increase in new business-jet sales in the coming years. ''The industry recovery that began in 2004 gained momentum in 2005,'' Frank Daly, an executive vice president for Honeywell, was quoted as saying. ''If current expectations regarding growth in U.S. Gross Domestic Product and the global economy hold, 2006 should be a record year for business jet deliveries, topping the previous peak in 2001.''
 Security and privacy concerns have corporations leery of identifying their operations hubs, said Tom O'Halloran, who regularly flies a 14-passenger jet into the county airport for Aim Aviation, a private company for one such corporation. But he did explain what might draw a corporate airline to a specific fixed-base operation: a full range of services along with a competitive price on fuel, which can range from $3.65 a gallon to $5.75 a gallon, depending on the volume purchased.
 ''At the end of the day it's about fuel,'' Mr. O'Halloran said, ''but we also look for the whole package, including customer services for the executives who are our passengers.''
 Roughly 50 percent of the county airport's 180,000 flights every year are made by corporations or time-shares, said Mr. Salley, the county transportation commissioner. The remaining flights are made by commercial airlines or by private owners of smaller aircraft. In all, Mr. Salley said, there are 87 corporate-owned planes at the airport.
 Because of its proximity to New York City and Connecticut, he added, the airport has become a major hub of corporate aviation. ''Especially since 9/11, we've seen a shift,'' Mr. Salley said. ''Corporate and charter flights are on the increase, and because of the costs of insurance and fuel, general light aviation is decreasing.''
 Meanwhile, the percentage of commercial flights has held steady. In all, he said, more than a million corporate and commercial passengers were served last year.
 As for Landmark's future, Mr. Vick explained that its acquisition of Skyport was part of a larger plan to operate fixed-base operations at hubs throughout the United States. With footholds already in Syracuse, Albany and Rochester but none in New Jersey or Long Island, the company would consider establishing such service centers at Teterboro or Morristown Airport, he explained. Right now at those sites, it is relying only on mobile service centers. Westchester serves as a base for the mobile technician teams.
 Landmark, which also refurbishes corporate aircraft and installs new aviation technology, maintains an executive terminal and a pilots' lounge in White Plains, where its ground services include interior cleaning, tie-downs, catering, de-icing, and exterior washing and polishing of aircraft. It plans to build a new passenger lounge in White Plains for its customers and has already added more maintenance capabilities there. 
 ''The idea is that you could land in Westchester and get everything done,'' Mr. Vick said. The Landmark fixed base has long-term leases with the county on 80,000 square feet of hangar and office space. Its hangars accommodate 22 private and corporate jet aircraft under multiyear tenant leases, he said.
 It will continue to employ Skyport's 38 workers, but has no immediate plans for hiring more people.

HEADLINE: The Wild Zones

 BODY:
The sneaky thing about the suburban landscape is how natural it looks. The trees turn green, then brown and then green again, there are always leaves to blow and grass to mow, and something is keeping all those greedy deer and evil geese alive. It all looks good, but something is not right. All those highways, sidewalks and housing developments, the products of planning decisions that revolve mainly around people and their cars, keep nature off-balance. They pay little heed to the needs of all the other residents of suburbia -- the wild things that live, move, work and play entirely off the grid.
 Sprawl is bad for wildlife because it cuts habitat into isolated chunks. Plots of undeveloped land become biological islands, melancholy archipelagoes of green. Species that can't easily swim, crawl, flutter or fly from one to another become stranded. Their habits of migration, mating and feeding are disrupted. Biodiversity suffers, and the health of ecosystems declines. According to biologists like Michael Klemens, sprawl is as big a threat to some species as pesticides or global warming. 
Dr. Klemens is a herpetologist and the director of the Metropolitan Conservation Alliance, a program of the Wildlife Conservation Society (Bronx Zoo, to you, although its purview extends far beyond that borough). As Debra West explained in these pages, the alliance (www.wcs.org/international/northamerica/mca) is a leader in promoting ''biotic corridors,'' stretches of protected land that respect animals' habitats and movements. They are an innovative way to confront the problem of threatened environment along what the alliance calls the ''suburban/rural frontier.''
 Northern Westchester is nothing if not the suburban/rural frontier. It is here -- in the towns of Lewisboro, Pound Ridge and North Salem -- that town officials have hired consultants to try to put Dr. Klemens's principles into practice over a 22,000-acre territory. Nothing has been decided yet, but zoning changes could include restrictions on what types of fences and walls go up, how big or tightly clustered housing units should be, and how close development can encroach on wetlands.
 New zoning restrictions, of course, are the last thing that many residents and local officials want, particularly in areas stung by housing shortages and the need to develop and nurture a tax base. But there's a powerful case to be made for ecologically sensible development, for doing more than simply roping off random patches of unpaved turf. Among the arguments that environmental groups have mustered against a large housing complex proposed along the Hudson River in Kingston, in Ulster County, is that it threatens biodiversity. In their view, a responsible plan would take into account the mobility of turtles as well as of cars.
 Biotic corridors are an innovation that arrived too late for many parts of the region. But where they have been proposed, residents and officials have been remarkably open to the idea. Planners and government officials are showing an increasing willingness to give the advocates a hearing. Cortland, New Castle and Yorktown may be getting in on the idea, Dr. Klemens says, as are other communities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. People who hear about biotic corridors, he says, tend to want to be included in them, unaware that wild things, not government boards, set their boundaries.
 If Dr. Klemens is right, biotic corridors could become the land-use planning vogue. We hope they do. It is a wise community that willingly subordinates its needs to accommodate those of a turtle, a salamander or a frog.

HEADLINE: Wanted: Day Laborers

BYLINE: By Carola Otero Bracco. 
Carola Otero Bracco is the executive director of Neighbors Link.

DATELINE: Mount Kisco 

 BODY:
IMMIGRATION is the face of this country. In Westchester County and on Long Island, it influences everything from traffic patterns and the kind of ethnic foods we eat to the character of the historic enclaves and towns we live in. 
 Unfortunately, the benefits that immigrants bring to this country are being forgotten on Long Island and in Westchester as battles erupt over the free-flowing and informal labor force that has sprung up in response to our insatiable appetite for cheap labor. 
 Towns like Brewster, Farmingville and Mamaroneck face rising tension between residents and day laborers who line the sidewalks looking for work. And town leaders must balance appeasing irate citizens with providing labor for the businesses that form their tax base. 
 This tension and frustration, which run throughout our country, was certainly one of the reasons that the House of Representatives in December passed a bill that would criminalize, detain and deport the nearly 11 million undocumented workers in this country. Such a simplistic and overreaching approach does nothing, however, to deal with the reality of our economic needs and our broken immigration system. 
 Instead, it helps to perpetuate the ugly myths surrounding these workers, fueling animosity and misunderstanding in communities across America struggling to integrate new immigrants.
 Fortunately, an antidote to these myths is at hand: ''On the Corner: Day Labor in the United States,'' the first comprehensive nationwide study of the day labor phenomenon. Written by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles and elsewhere, it has important implications for towns and localities across Westchester and Long Island. Among its findings are these: 
 Myth: Day laborers get a free ride because they don't pay taxes. 
 Reality: By some measures, day laborers pay more than their share of taxes. Day workers rarely earn more than $15,000 a year, placing them among the working poor. If they were documented, this income would make them eligible for earned income credits and maybe even a tax refund. 
 They also pay property taxes through the high rents charged by the landlords in this area. A bed in a shared apartment can cost $400 a month in Westchester County. Laborers also pay the same sales taxes as everyone else.
 Myth: Day labor is a choice that these workers favor.
 Reality: The largest segment of surveyed laborers is employed in the day labor market for less than one year. For many of these workers, day labor is a stop gap until a permanent job opens up.
 Myth: Day laborers are itinerants and have no ties to the towns where they seek work.
 Reality: According to the study, about one in three day laborers has lived in the United States for six or more years. They attend church regularly and are involved in sports clubs and community centers.
 Myth: Hiring sites are magnets that draw unwanted immigrants to an area.
 Reality: Day labor markets are driven by the simple economics of supply and demand. They develop in areas where there is a need for pools of low-cost labor.
 Without these laborers we would be hard pressed to find nannies in Chappaqua, gardeners in Glen Cove, kitchen workers to prepare food in our favorite restaurants or home health care workers to help keep our elderly parents at home in Wantagh. And we means you and me, not just contractors: On the East Coast, which has the second largest percentage of day laborers, individuals hire 42 percent of day laborers. 
 There are proven solutions to managing this labor demand. Chief among them are day-labor worker centers, 63 of which now operate in 17 states. Communities sponsoring formal worker centers find relief from the tensions between the day workers and residents. These centers also help prevent labor and civil rights abuses, provide improved working conditions and help workers recover unpaid wages.
 In 2000, when the proliferation of informal hiring sites raised tensions in Mount Kisco, community leaders formed my organization, Neighbors Link, as a formal day labor hiring site. Since then, we have expanded into a center that offers workers and their families computer training, English classes and other community-building activities -- a possible model for other towns seeking to integrate workers.
 Without a doubt, the day laborer phenomenon is one of the most vexing challenges facing our region and our country, raising issues of economics, immigration and human rights that will bedevil policymakers for years to come. 
 As long as our need for cheap labor continues, immigrants will come to our borders. But the House bill that seeks to criminalize day laborers, now pending in the Senate, does not fix our immigration system nor does it absolve us of our responsibility to put a human face on this complex problem.

HEADLINE: Greetings Kill: Primer for a Pandemic

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
TO the pantheon of social arbiters who came up with the firm handshake, the formal bow and the air kiss, get ready to add a new fashion god: the World Health Organization, chief advocate of the ''elbow bump.''
 If the avian flu goes pandemic while Tamiflu and vaccines are still in short supply, experts say, the only protection most Americans will have is ''social distancing,'' which is the new politically correct way of saying ''quarantine.''
 But distancing also encompasses less drastic measures, like wearing face masks, staying out of elevators -- and the bump. Such stratagems, those experts say, will rewrite the ways we interact, at least during the weeks when the waves of influenza are washing over us.
 It has happened before, and not just in medieval Europe, where plague killed a third of the continent's serfs, creating labor shortages that shook the social order. In the United States, the norms of casual sex, which loosened considerably in the 1960's with penicillin and the pill, tightened up again in the 1980's after AIDS raised the penalty. 
 But influenza is more easily transmitted than AIDS, SARS or even bubonic plague, so the social revolution is likely to focus on the most basic goal of all: keeping other people's cooties at arm's length. The bump, a simple touching of elbows, is a substitute for the filthy practice of shaking hands, in which a person who has politely sneezed into a palm then passes a virus to other hands, whose owners then put a finger in an eye or a pen in a mouth. The bump breaks that chain. Only a contortionist can sneeze on his elbow. 
 Dr. Michael Bell, associate director for infection control at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has done the bump a few times already. When Ebola breaks out in Africa, he's usually on the team sent to fight it.
 ''I'll arrive on the tarmac and stick out a hand to say hello,'' Dr. Bell said, ''and someone from the W.H.O. team will say: 'No, no, no, we don't do that. We do the elbow bump now.' ''
 In truth, he said, they do it mostly to set a good example. To stop an Ebola outbreak, visiting doctors must persuade villagers in Angola or the Congo basin to refrain from washing dead bodies and using their bare hands when nursing family members dying of hemorrhagic bleeding.
 Those distancing measures would be easy to enforce in a pandemic in New York City. But other likely steps will strike at things New Yorkers are loath to give up. Dr. Isaac Weisfuse, the deputy city health commissioner in charge of avian flu preparation, said his first move would probably be to ban Major League Baseball games, Broadway shows, movies, parades and other large gatherings.
 Closing schools or shutting the subways might be even more effective, because children are much more efficient than adults at spreading flu, and subways are enclosed spaces where sneezes linger in the air -- but doing that would be harder to pull off, Dr. Weisfuse said. ''People talk about 'flu days' like snow days,'' he said, ''and if it was just days or a week, that would be simple. But if it's weeks or months, that becomes another matter.'' Without mass transit, no one gets to work and the economy collapses, he pointed out, and many poor children depend on the free breakfasts and lunches they get at school.
 An alternative is to limit people to necessary travel and to have them wear masks -- a tricky thing.
 Getting people to don masks in Asia is relatively simple, Dr. Bell said. Particularly in Japan, it is considered polite for anyone going to work with a cold to wear one. And in Asian cities full of soot and diesel exhaust, people often wear gauze masks on the street.
 But in the United States, ''we don't have a culture of courtesy mask use,'' he said, and people may feel foolish wearing them.
 The government of Taiwan faced that problem three years ago during the SARS epidemic. It ordered everyone who had a cough or fever, or who cared for a family member or patients who did, to wear a mask if they ventured outdoors. The head of Taiwan's version of the Centers for Disease Control correctly noted that studies showed that masks do much more good if the sick wear them, keeping sneeze droplets in, than if the healthy do. 
 But masks were rare on the streets, and the mayor of Taipei, the capital city, decided to ignore the data and pay more attention to the psychology. The sick and exposed would never wear masks, he reasoned, if it marked them as disease carriers. So he simply issued a mayoral order: no one without a mask could ride the subway. The next day, everyone in Taipei was wearing them. Within a week, they had become a fashion item, printed with logos like the Nike swoosh, the Burberry plaid and the Paul Frank monkey.
 Pictures of the 1918 flu epidemic include much evidence of that sort of mass psychology. In a photograph of ranks of Seattle police officers, all are wearing masks; in one of 45 Philadelphia gravediggers digging trenches for the dead, none wear them. In a photograph of dozens of beds in a military field hospital, almost all of the patients, doctors and nurses seem to have masks -- but most in the foreground have pulled them down for the photographers. People act as the group acts. 
 When a disease seems far away, as avian flu still does, notions like mask fashion and elbow bumping sound like jokes. But when people start dying, panic ensues, and nothing seems too far-fetched to try. In the 1918 epidemic, Prescott, Ariz., outlawed handshaking. Some small towns tried to close themselves off, barricading their streets against outsiders and telling any citizen who left not to plan on coming back. In factories, common drinking cups gave way to a new invention: the paper cup. 
 Under pressure, people don't adopt only sensible precautions, they overreact, said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. During the anthrax scare of 2001, he said, nervous citizens submitted 600,000 specimens of white powder to public laboratories. The samples included brownies with powdered sugar. Dr. Osterholm said he feared that public reactions would be out of sync with any epidemic; that people would get scared too early, then say the fear was overblown and dismiss it. Then, if a pandemic lasts for weeks, fatigue will set in. ''We tend to be a just-in-time, crisis-oriented population,'' he said.
 It is all in the timing, said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm of the National Academy of Sciences. ''In the middle of a major pandemic, with people dying, we're likely to see people hungry for clear instructions,'' he said. ''What would backfire would be for you to say, 'Start bumping elbows now.' People would look at you as if you were from Mars.''

HEADLINE: Making a Pitch For Film Producers

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
A group of state legislators, led by Representative James Amann, the Democratic speaker of the House, wants to offer tax incentives to movie and television producers who agree to shoot their films and programs in Connecticut. 
 Under the proposal announced on Tuesday, production companies would get a 30 percent tax credit, and those investing in projects would receive a 25 percent tax credit.
 To qualify, 75 percent of the film, program or commercial would have to be shot in the state. Also, production costs would have to be more than $250,000 and 10 percent of the workers would have to be residents.
 ''This is about opportunity, jobs and economic growth,'' Mr. Amann said in a statement. ''We need to use our assets to take advantage of this burgeoning industry and put out the welcome mat.''
 Jennifer Aniskovich, executive director of the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, said Connecticut needed such credits to stay competitive.
 ''Last year, Rhode Island and Massachusetts instituted tax compensation incentives and have seen their film business skyrocket,'' she said.
 Ms. Aniskovich said a lack of tax credits had led to a drop in filming in the state.
 ''We know of 38 films that were shot in the state in 2003, compared to 21 in 2005,'' she said.
 Ms. Aniskovich said a major motion picture with a budget of anywhere from $20 million to $80 million could bring as much as $300,000 a day to the state's economy.
 Movies that have been shot in the state include ''The Family Stone'' in 2005, ''War of the Worlds'' and ''The Stepford Wives,'' in 2004 and ''Mr. Deeds'' in 2001. JEFF HOLTZ

HEADLINE: Fashion Week's Big Tent

BYLINE: By Guy Trebay

 BODY:
IT'S a sure bet that we can expect hundreds of hours of broadcast arias along the theme of international fellowship and universal good will over the next two weeks, as 2,600 athletes from 80 countries gather to compete at the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.
 In the way that World's Fairs and Universal Expositions once did, the Olympics have become billboards for economic and cultural interconnectedness, the ''It's a Small World After All'' concept once beloved of Disney Imagineers and now the hobbyhorse of globalization pundits at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
The world may look small when cut into pie pieces by multinationals looking to capture new markets. But, as the Olympics tend to show, the populations occupying those colorful, mysterious shapes on the global map only look alike when you put them into matching blazers for the opening ceremony.
 The earth is not all that small, as the photojournalist Sebastiao Salgado recently pointed out. Rather, it remains, as he said, a vast sphere still endowed with more hidden cultural difference than likeness and also with an abundance of mystery and human anomaly. 
 One wouldn't automatically look to Olympus Fashion Week in New York for proof of Mr. Salgado's proposition. But as it happens there are few places besides an Olympic Village where one is likely to find so many countries represented beneath a single roof.
 ''Fashion is a completely international business,'' said Carine Roitfeld, the editor in chief of French Vogue, at a party in her honor Thursday at Barneys New York. The party celebrated a collaboration of Ms. Roitfeld, who in her personal style is like a flash card for Gallic chic, and two sweater designers called Lutz & Patmos, one American and one German, both of whom toggle between Tokyo and New York. 
 It's really a big privilege to be in this world that is so mixed up,'' Ms. Roitfeld added.
 Not only is it a privilege, it would seem; it's proof of how expeditiously some parts of New York have helped reestablish the city as a world trade center in the years since 9/11, even as real estate agents and politicians continue to squabble about that huge symbolic hole in lower Manhattan.
 To calculate the extent of Fashion Week's global mixture, one has only to consult the official show roster, where the offerings this season alone included the Turkish designer Atil Kutoglu (whose theme, he explained backstage, was ''the Ottoman Empire but modernized''), the Japanese Akiko Ogawa, the Serbian Dragana Ognjenovic, the French-Armenian Anait Bian, the Briton Alice Temperley, the German Wolfgang Joop, the Malaysian Zang Toi and the Brazilian Carlos Miele, who, despite enormous commercial success in his own country, is committed to making it here.
 ''For me New York is still the center of the world,'' Mr. Miele said before his show on Wednesday. ''I've done shows in London and other places, and the commercial and editorial response is good. But I realize I need to stay in New York because the music is here, the art is here and the market is here. It's still the global city, no matter what anybody says.''
 At least it is for the eight days of Fashion Week, when the precincts of Bryant Park can sometimes resemble a dining hall at the United Nations, albeit one with prettier delegates. ''I just flew from New York to L.A. for a job,'' the Swedish model Caroline Winberg said when asked to describe a typical travel week. As the British hairstylist James Brown twisted her flaxen hair into a ponytail, Ms. Winberg explained that after less than a day in Los Angeles she had flown back on a red-eye to New York, gone to a shoot, left that afternoon for London and reversed direction the following morning for New York's Fashion Week castings.
 ''I didn't have a sleep in a bed for three days,'' Ms. Winberg said. ''I have slept only on planes.'' Was it worth it? ''Oh, it was worth it,'' she said, laughing. ''It was good money jobs.''
 Everywhere one turned backstage at the Temperley show there were people from elsewhere, and usually the kind of elsewhere that requires a visa to get past customs. 
 In one corner of the makeup room the British makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury was spot-checking her MAC staff's work on the heads of a group of young lovelies that included two Estonians, a Belgian, a Canadian, a Dutchwoman and a young model from Shanghai named Du Juan. 
 Drifting through the familiar hubbub with her particular brand of ineffable cool was the model Helena Christensen, there as a supporter of Ms. Temperley. Years after her heyday, Ms. Christensen still manages to put most other professional beauties in her radius to shame. 
 Part of the reason is how hard her looks are to pigeonhole. Like the multicultural ideals imagined and once described by Richard Avedon, Ms. Christensen reads as an ethnic amalgam. And in fact she is one: half Danish and half Peruvian. 
 It could be that there are no grand conclusions to be drawn from the teeming national, social and ethnic microecology that is a fashion show or from the easy, organic way in which Belgian hairdressers and British makeup artists and Ethiopian models and Cuban designers and French publicity flacks and Italian journalists all seem to mesh, dispersing at the end of one cycle and then turning up again for the next in recombinant form on whichever continent is the next designated stop along the fashion caravan. 
 You could probably make a parable of rootlessness out of this phenomenon as easily as one of community. But as Fashion Week closes down and the 2006 Winter Olympics kick in, one finds oneself opting for the latter interpretation. 
 Opportunities to see diverse groups with competing interests pull together are rare enough in a post-Rodney King world. So why not enjoy those arenas where, at least superficially, we all get along? 
 ''Maybe there is hope for world peace,'' said one fashion editor when I shared this observation. ''Fashion!'' he exclaimed, with an appropriately cynical moue.

HEADLINE: Mardi Gras All Set to Go, But Officials Want Help

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
City officials here boldly decided last fall to hold the parades of Mardi Gras, even though the city treasury was empty and large swaths of the town still lay in ruins. The price, though, was their demand that the beloved party abandon tradition and seek corporate sponsors. 
 With the official start of festivities scheduled for next Saturday, no corporation has come up with the $2 million the city was hoping to receive for the naming rights to Mardi Gras, which was first celebrated here 150 years ago.
 So far only a single company, the trash-bag maker Glad Products, has said it will contribute to the cause. On Tuesday, Glad, a subsidiary of the Clorox Company, announced an unspecified six-figure donation to the city and a gift of 100,000 trash bags. 
 If no additional corporate sponsors step forward, the city will have to dig into its nonexistent treasury to pay for the celebration, which many officials say the city needs to raise its spirit and its economy. 
 ''Anyone who understands the local economy here knows this is a significant event,'' said Ernest Collins, the city's director of arts and entertainment. ''Yes, it will be a challenge for us to come up with money, but this is a tourist economy, and we need to have it.'' 
 Reginald Zeno, the city's finance director, said he was ''concerned'' that the extra costs of Mardi Gras would ''put a further drain on a budget at a time we're already facing a deep deficit.'' But like Mr. Collins, Mr. Zeno sees Mardi Gras as an investment that the city has no choice but to make. 
 ''The business of New Orleans is tourism, and New Orleans has got to get back to business,'' said David Rubenstein, a co-owner of Rubenstein Brothers, a clothing store on Canal Street. ''There's all this talk about bringing people back to New Orleans, but without tourism there won't be any jobs for them to come home to.'' 
 Officials are still optimistic that more sponsors will materialize, even at this late date, to help cover an estimated $2.7 million in police overtime, trash collection and other expenses. Mr. Collins says that although he doubts a white knight will sign up as a marquee sponsor, he still hopes that other corporations will follow Glad's example and help defray the costs of Mardi Gras.
 Not everyone here agrees with the wisdom of putting on Mardi Gras, which has been canceled 13 times in the past, almost always because of wars, said Arthur Hardy, who has written extensively on the celebration in New Orleans. That sentiment is particularly true among the tens of thousands of people who have been evacuated from the city, many of whom have said the city's priorities are misplaced.
 Only after a protracted, sometimes clamorous debate this fall did city officials decide to host an abbreviated version of the Mardi Gras parade season, which will last eight days this year, rather than the customary 12, and will use shorter routes. Mardi Gras Day will be celebrated Feb. 28.
 Twenty-eight of the krewes, or social clubs, that build the elaborate floats and organize the parades will be participating this year, compared with 34 last year, Mr. Hardy said.
 One early concern expressed by small-business owners and others was that a lack of money might mean the city could not provide adequate police protection, but those worries seem to have dissipated. Mr. Rubenstein, whose store is on the parade route, said he was not worried ''about rioting or looting or anything like that.'' 
 The city now has 1,300 police officers on its payroll, compared with 1,600 before Hurricane Katrina, said Tami Frazier, a spokeswoman for Mayor C. Ray Nagin. Those officers are keeping watch over a much smaller city, and Ms. Frazier said that the National Guard troops still in town were supplementing the efforts of the police force. 
 ''There'll be adequate security, without a doubt,'' said Hans U. Wandfluh, the general manager of the Royal Sonesta Hotel on Bourbon Street in the heart of the French Quarter. 
 The real worry, then, many say, is financial. Those in the sponsorship business say the city should have started searching for corporate donors in August, when companies typically start thinking about their marketing budget for the coming year. 
 ''Corporations expect a return on investment for these kind of sponsorship deals,'' said Phil Strober, the vice president for corporate alliances at Wakeham & Associates Marketing, which has offices in New York and Los Angeles. For their contribution, Mr. Strober said, companies typically want to produce marketing materials that will help them ''maximize their bang for the buck'' and see their logo displayed prominently in advertising campaigns -- efforts that require months of preparation. 
 Yet Hurricane Katrina struck on Aug. 29, and it was not until October that city officials and others even started to debate the propriety of financing so raucous a celebration when people had lost so much and the city faced so many challenges. 
 ''We knew this would be an uphill struggle to find corporate sponsors in so short a time frame,'' said Mr. Collins, the arts and entertainment director. It was not until late December, he said, that the city enlisted the firm MediaBuys, based in Los Angeles, to seek corporate sponsors. The goals were to help cover the costs of the celebration and to finance a limited national campaign related to Mardi Gras to increase tourism. 
 MediaBuys has approached about 75 corporations in search of sponsors, said the company's chief executive, Chick Ciccarelli, and enlisted the services of several large advertising firms, including Saatchi & Saatchi and Ketchum Inc. 
 ''We're still in negotiations with other corporations,'' said Mr. Ciccarelli, who expressed confidence that more corporations would commit money before next weekend. 
 Ideally, Mr. Collins said, the city would have started running a Mardi Gras campaign weeks ago, but ''nothing about this effort has been ideal.'' 
 There are other factors at work, too. Many image-conscious corporations may be reluctant to lend their name to an event that often becomes a bacchanal. ''This would have been a tough sell even in the best of circumstances,'' said Mr. Strober of Wakeham & Associates.
 There is a chance, of course, that Mardi Gras will more than pay for itself through a significant increase in hotel and sales tax revenue. There are about 36,000 hotel rooms in and around the city, nearly two-thirds of which are taking guests. The hotels are telling city officials that they will be running at or near capacity during Mardi Gras, but that has been the case for months with evacuees, contractors and emergency workers keeping them busy. 
 ''It's impossible for me to predict what kind of revenues we'll see from Mardi Gras,'' said Mr. Zeno, the finance director. ''We're expecting a pretty good turnout, but how this will all fall out is anyone's guess.''

HEADLINE: G-8 Ministers Warn of Wider Risks From Tight Oil Supply

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Finance ministers from the world's richest countries and Russia said Saturday that ''high and volatile'' energy prices posed a risk to global economic growth that otherwise appeared solid. 
 With booming growth in China and India absorbing oil, attention has been focused on the effect of rising demand in pushing up oil prices. The Group of 8, a club of the world's richest capitalist democracies and Russia, meeting Saturday in an icy, mist-covered Moscow, focused instead on the extremely tight supply around the world.
''We're all concerned about the risk of rising energy prices and what they do to global growth,'' John W. Snow, the United States treasury secretary, said after the meeting at a hotel. 
 The solution for a world parched for oil, he said, would come in market mechanisms to open oil producing regions to investment and more transparent energy deals, and improving ties between producing and consuming countries. 
 The ministers called for greater accuracy on the part of oil exporting nations in reporting reserves and production figures, according to a statement by the ministers. They also called for greater investment in exploration and pipelines. 
 Yet the one-day meeting, the first under the chairmanship of Russia, which is pushing the theme of energy security, ended without setting any major new agenda for world energy trading. 
 The ministers issued a statement that made vague promises about ''enhancing the global energy policy dialogue between oil producing and consuming countries and the private sector.''
 The ministers met in the National Hotel, a shimmering white and gold Art Nouveau landmark a few hundred yards from the Kremlin. 
 Overshadowing the meeting was European alarm over a brief natural gas embargo Russia imposed on Ukraine early this year, ostensibly because of a dispute over pricing and transit fees. The embargo raised the threat of shortages in Europe. 
 Peter Westin, the chief economist at MDM Bank in Moscow, said Russia's economic officials were in a defensive mood going into the meeting because of the Ukraine energy dispute, undermining Moscow's proposals on debt and energy security. 
 ''Russia started off the year on a very bad foot,'' Mr. Westin said. 
 Oil-importing countries, including the United States, would like to see producing nations increase supplies on world markets, easing prices even as China and other quickly developing economies burn more oil. 
 A recent jump in Russian oil production -- by 10 percent or more a year at some companies -- compensated for growth in Chinese demand early this decade. But overall supply is expected to grow only about 2 percent next year. 
 Still, Aleksei L. Kudrin, Russia's finance minister, said he pushed Moscow's approach to global energy policy, which calls for consuming countries to diversify supply away from the Middle East, in part by leaning more heavily on Russia's reserves in the Arctic and Siberia. He said this would lower prices by reducing the cartel power of OPEC members. 
 The ministers agreed to work though international groups to bring ''necessary investments in exploration, production, transportation and refining capacity, as well as to improve energy efficiency,'' according to a statement signed by ministers from the eight countries -- Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Canada, the United States and Russia.

HEADLINE: As U.N. Fills Top Job, Many Names, Few Rules and Talk of Asia's Turn 

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Choosing a new secretary general may be the most telling single action the United Nations takes in 2006, but the organization is saddled with an ill-defined selection procedure that leaves the choice subject to 11th-hour compromises, great power maneuvers and regional rivalries.
 The most discussed candidates, at least at the moment, include a Jordanian prince, a Nobel laureate from East Timor, two Eastern European presidents, Sweden's most accomplished diplomat, a former Sri Lankan ambassador to Washington, a Harvard-trained Thai lawyer, a Canadian judge, South Korea's foreign minister and a Turkish economist.
 But if history is a guide, it is likely that none of them will emerge the winner and that the person who does is not being publicly discussed.
 Dag Hammarskjold, the second secretary general, did not even know he was a candidate when he was told on April 1, 1953, that he had been selected. ''He thought it was an April Fool's joke,'' said Sir Brian Urquhart, a former under secretary general who was Mr. Hammarskjold's biographer. 
 Kofi Annan's second five-year term ends on Dec. 31, and there is particular interest in the contest to succeed him because scandals in the oil-for-food program and the organization's purchasing office have prompted calls for an executive with proven management skills in addition to the usual diplomatic talents.
 But there are no established qualifications for the post, no search committees, no interviews, no background checks, no campaign rules and no forums for showcasing aspirants and their ideas. 
 ''I think there are real questions about openness and transparency, and it would be better for the institution if we had a clear understanding of the criteria and qualifications for candidates and an opportunity for member states to be introduced to them before the final selection is made,'' said Allan Rock, the ambassador of Canada, which is circulating a proposal for an eventual overhaul of the procedure. John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said he intended to devote time to discussing the succession plan in the Security Council this month, while the United States occupies the presidency.
 Much of the current jockeying is being done in secret because it can be risky for the hopefuls to make their ambitions known too early. 
 ''It's the exact opposite of a U.S. presidential race where you want to get out of the box early and scare off opponents by fund-raising and showing well in primaries,'' said Courtney B. Smith, an associate professor at the John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University. 
 The job is described in the United Nations Charter as simply ''chief administrative officer'' and the method of choice as ''appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.''
 In reality, reflecting where power truly resides at the United Nations, the 191-member General Assembly ratifies a name selected by the 15-member Security Council. The real arbiters are the council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- who have the veto.
 ''At the U.N.,'' Mr. Smith said, ''the winner turns out to be the least objectionable person to the most number of countries, and particularly to the permanent five.'' 
 The last time the United Nations selected a new secretary general was in 1996, when Mr. Annan was officially named -- only two weeks before he took the job.
 Prompted by Mr. Bolton, a number of countries are backing a plan to hold this year's vote by the time the General Assembly convenes in September.
 ''The idea of having a real transition period makes eminent sense, and most member states would tend to agree in theory,'' said Edward C. Luck, professor of international affairs at Columbia. ''The problem is, can they settle on a candidate by the middle of the year? It would be a major triumph, but I'm not betting the farm on it.''
 This year was long previewed as Asia's turn to fill the post, because it had not done so since the Burmese U Thant finished his second term in 1971. Mr. Bolton has challenged this regional rotation idea, saying that the only criterion should be merit. 
 Of the other four veto holders, Britain shares Mr. Bolton's view, France contends that region should be a priority but not the defining one, and China and Russia say they will insist on an Asian.
 At a recent reception, Wang Guangya, China's ambassador, said his country would support only candidates from Asia, a polite way of saying it would threaten to veto candidates from elsewhere.
 Washington has put forward the idea of a candidate from Eastern Europe, and Mr. Bolton told reporters last week: ''If geographical rotation is a sacred principle, Asia has already had a secretary general. When does Eastern Europe gets its turn?''
 Mihnea Motoc, the Romanian ambassador, said that in addition to the fact that his region had never had a secretary general, Eastern Europeans were underrepresented throughout the United Nations ranks. He also argued that because many of the region's countries had experienced the ''transformational process'' of replacing Communist regimes with democratic administrations, they were well prepared to lead the needed reshaping of the United Nations. 
 Mr. Motoc acknowledged the widespread perception that Russia would veto any candidate from a region that so recently broke from Soviet control, but he added: ''That's not 100 percent accurate. We all know the special role and responsibility Russia has in this process, but this is a highly dynamic process, and I wouldn't assume that anyone's options are fixed at this point.''
 Three Asians are declared candidates: Thailand's deputy prime minister, Surakiart Sathirathai, a Harvard-educated lawyer with a background in finance and international economics; Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka, a former United Nations under secretary general for disarmament and onetime envoy to the United States; and Ban Ki Moon, the South Korean foreign minister, who the Korean mission said would formally enter the race in Seoul on Tuesday. Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the foreign minister of East Timor, said he was not campaigning but would be interested if the Security Council turned to him.
 Kemal Dervis, a former finance minister of Turkey, said he wanted to focus on his new job as administrator of the United Nations Development Program.
 In Eastern Europe, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, the president of Latvia, and Alexander Kwasniewski, the former president of Poland, have said they are available.
 Favorites in the iconic glass headquarters on the East River -- but not necessarily in the major capitals where the final decision will be agreed on -- are Prince Zeid al-Hussein of Jordan, his country's ambassador and a former peacekeeper in Bosnia; Jan Eliasson of Sweden, the president of the General Assembly; and Louise Arbour, the war crimes prosecutor and onetime Canadian Supreme Court justice who is now high commissioner for human rights.
 Toshiro Ozawa, Japan's deputy ambassador, said he believed there was a determination among Asians to ensure that the job went to their region and that more Asian candidacies would be forthcoming. ''Looking at past history, it may make sense to have multiple candidates rather than going for one, and my guess is that there are many candidates out there who may announce,'' he said.
 Mr. Luck, the Columbia professor, said he thought the nod would go to the candidate that the United States and China could agree on. ''That would have tremendous momentum,'' he said.
 Richard C. Holbrooke, the former American ambassador to the United Nations, said he thought China had the influence to guarantee an Asian choice.
 ''A lot of people have thrown up a lot of names, but in the real world, the fact that the Asians have not had a secretary general since U Thant is of tremendous importance to China, and China will make damn sure it happens,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Paterson, the Yellowstone of the East?

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
Email: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J. 

 BODY:
YOU could get a lot of blank stares by trying to make the case for a National Park site in the faded center of New Jersey's third-largest city.
 Which is why, even without Leonard Zax's world-class collection of Paterson ephemera -- vintage postcards and silk ribbons, pieces of china and silver napkin rings, a July 4, 1915, swim competition award -- it's hard at first to know quite what to make of his somewhat fanatical attachment to the town where Mr. Zax, a Washington lawyer, grew up and then left after graduating from Eastside High School in 1967.
But if you get to read the 38-page tour de force he wrote, putting together political and industrial history, art and literature, to argue for adding Paterson's old industrial heart to the National Park System, you understand more than just what drives him. You also understand why getting the world to remember why Paterson matters has been something of a civic crusade for more than 30 years. 
 And upon closer scrutiny, the really striking thing about the seemingly quixotic notion of a national park in Paterson is not that proponents would push for it, but that so few others could tell you why it would be so important.
 So with a response expected from the National Parks Service as early as a month or two from now, let us now praise Paterson, N. J., where Alexander Hamilton, inspired by the power of the second-largest waterfall east of the Mississippi, essentially invented an urban, industrial vision for America. 
 As manufacturing becomes something seemingly relegated to America's past, let us pay our respects to a place that Richard Brookhiser, one of Hamilton's biographers calls: ''the Bethlehem of capitalism, ground zero of modern America.''
 As our collective memory grows ever dimmer, let's salute the birthplace of the Colt revolver, the first submarine and the first steam locomotive made entirely of American parts, a city which once produced more silk than anywhere in the world, and produced the engine for Lindbergh's ''Spirit of St. Louis.'' 
 THIS is where industrial America was born and where a good chunk of it has died. So if Paterson now seems more than a bit down at the heels, well, maybe a big part of the tale is there, too.
 Paterson's heart then and now is the Great Falls of the Passaic River, where every day 2 billion gallons of water thunder over the falls and cascade 77 feet to the gorge below. 
 When looking for a site for America's first industrial city, his counterpoint to Thomas Jefferson's vision of an agrarian America, Hamilton saw the falls as his energy source and located his town there. The result, said another Hamilton biographer, Ron Chernow, was ''this futuristic city, this model of what America could be.''
 Paterson became a city of mills and factories, making everything Hamilton envisioned: cotton, sailcloth, flax, hemp, paper, nails, steel, iron, silk and much more. Then, as happened in the rest of the country, the jobs eventually began to disappear; now what's left behind is a resonant shell that is home to perhaps the largest collection of early manufacturing mills in the United States.
 The industrial district, about 118 acres, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and that offers some protections but little in the way of resources. In 2001, Congress agreed to study whether it should become part of the National Park System. Its 388 sites include both the great wilderness parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite and urban ones like Lowell National Historical Park in Massachusetts, which recaptures America's industrial revolution. The goal is to use federal, state and local resources to portray a key part of the nation's history and to encourage urban redevelopment.
 Everyone knows a National Parks designation for Paterson will not be easy. Resources are scarce, Paterson is not exactly a magic name, and backers must prove not just historical merit but that the park would provide something the rest of the system does not.
 Still win or lose, stand on the footbridge over the roaring falls, or drive past the acres of hulking brick buildings, most converted to shops and offices, vacant, or reduced to rubble, and Hamilton's vision seems like an unfinished letter in a place that's now wildly diverse, still vital but uncertain economically. It's an urban laboratory now as then.
 Which is why, Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., a former Paterson mayor, says a monument to what Paterson was makes more sense now than it ever did. 
 ''We have lost our will to make anything,'' he said. ''A guy or gal who uses plastic, uses metal, uses wood to create objects is looked down on. That's why this is important, and why it's a vital part of our history that should be recognized. This is a place where Hamilton made a point and won -- that we need to have a multifaceted economy, manufacturing as well as agriculture -- which our forefathers understood but our present fathers have not a clue.''

Apples to Apples
 For years, suspicion has been growing in the orchards of the Wenatchee Valley in Washington State and in the food industry at large that fruit, nature's original hand-held convenience food, is simply too poorly designed for today's busy eater. The apple, for instance: whatever it has meant to Americans over the years -- from mom's pie to the little red schoolhouse -- getting our mouths around one has also apparently meant some unspoken aggravation. Next to a banana or a grape, it's a daunting strongbox of a fruit, prohibitively so for anyone with braces or dentures; and even if you can break in, there's no guarantee a given apple will eat as sweet as it looks. 
Nearly half of Americans now consume most of their meals away from home or on the go, utilizing an expedient fleet of Go-Gurts, drinkable soups and cereal bars, while bags of prewashed salad and baby carrots await us at home. Given how many foods we've been able to tweak or outright reinvent to fit into our harried lives, who could take seriously the Granny Smith -- which, not unlike the bayonet or the daguerreotype, is by contemporary standards a cumbersome and unreliable technology? What appeal could an apple have left but nostalgia, the kind of thing you'd find at Restoration Hardware beside a galvanized watering can? 
 ''A bowl of apples is like a piece of art,'' says Tony Freytag, marketing director at Crunch Pak, an apple-processing company. ''It's display. People won't touch it. But you put out a tray of cut-up apples -- that's food.'' 
 Since helping found Crunch Pak in 2000, Freytag has become one pioneer in a rapidly growing industry: packaging bags of ordinary-looking, fresh slices of apples that, bathed in an all-natural flavorless sealant, won't turn brown or lose their crisp for up to three weeks. Last year, McDonald's stocked 54 million pounds of presliced apples, to sell with caramel dip or in salads, and this increased visibility boosted enthusiasm for them in school cafeterias and among time-strapped, health-conscious parents nationwide. Crunch Pak now slices and packs apples under its own name for Wal-Mart and nearly a dozen other chains, under the in-house brand at Whole Foods and for the organic bagged-salad giant Earthbound Farm. In loose one-pound bags (about $2.99), eight-packs of two-ounce snack pouches (about $3.99) or six-ounce cupholder-ready canisters (about $1.99), they have slipped onto refrigerated shelves among packages of herbs and cantaloupe cubes.
 What's astounding is how little these apples ask of us, particularly the nearly two-thirds of us who claim we'd eat more fruit if it didn't go bad ''too soon'' -- meaning, presumably, before we wished it would. Now open your fridge after 17, 18, 21 days of neglect, and you will find the pre-sliced modern apple abiding: a bag of pristine white crescents, still smiling. In short, these are the most utilitarian apples mankind has ever built.
 Not since the canneries of the early 20th century have food processors sought merely to preserve perishables. Processing foods now means redesigning them, making them easier to eat for a population that is steadily less willing to go to any trouble at all. Given the childhood obesity epidemic and the longstanding economic troubles of America's apple growers, boosting the apple's performance so that it could, as an industry observer explained, ''stand up to ordinary use,'' was a doubly urgent project. By making a healthful, fresh fruit that looks and acts more like a bag of chips, a handful of companies like Crunch Pak may have finally figured out a way to compete with the hassle-free junk foods that blazed into this era of hyperconvenience. Some marketers say that the reformation of our venerable apple -- and the sense that this improvement was necessary -- suggest that we may soon buy most of our produce this way. Presliced plums, celery, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, mangoes and star fruits are all in production.
 Crunch Pak was one of the first companies that labored to bring the new apple on line. Each found early on that what can be done casually at home -- slicing an apple and squeezing lemon juice on it -- is maddeningly difficult to pull off in a factory. The anti-browning bath is only one movement in a grand symphony of technologies at work. For nearly two decades, teams of food scientists, engineers and can-do businessmen struggled to pin down the apple, while the apple skirted and ducked them at every turn. They zigged, the apple zagged. Clearing one hurdle only brought more into view, and even now the particulars of production must be reassessed and rejiggered daily. The apple, Freytag told me when we first met, ''is a moving target.''
 Freytag, a 54-year-old, broad-shouldered Texan, stepped out into the central Washington heat last August from Crunch Pak's refrigerated packing facility, an expressionless gray concrete hangar just off the town of Cashmere's American-flag-lined thoroughfare. He had made an unlikely transition into fruit after years of product-development work for retailers like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. He likes to build things, to solve things, and he often talks about slicing apples as an ''equation'' -- a matrix of ''variables'' and ''commonalities'' that may never be fully controlled but, with enough persistence, can be made adequately algorithmic. 
 Throughout the Wenatchee Valley behind us, the first apples, Galas, were rioting into ripeness. Soon they'd arrive at Crunch Pak, and immediately, their vital signs would be taken: sugars, starches, internal pressure in pounds per square inch. The company must understand each crop's singular specifications in the same way a prizefighter studies the height, weight and reach of his opponent. The apple's wildness, so to speak, must be thoroughly assessed before the faintly Rube Goldbergian machinery goes about transforming it into something more sophisticated -- an apple in 12 slices, with a compelling, albeit elusive, advantage. 
 But what precisely makes cutting up a piece of fruit worth the tremendous saga that preceded it? Why, after thousands of years of eating apples, are we losing our patience for them, and where, if not at the apple, will it stop? Strangely, this is one puzzle that the characteristically industrious Freytag seemed uninterested or unable to solve. 
 ''I had a real problem in the beginning, as a consumer, paying $3 for a bag of lettuce when I knew that lettuce cost 89 cents a head,'' he told me, seeming to venture an explanation. ''And yet we all did it,'' he said, and left it at that.

Snackability
 As soon as you slice into an apple, the apple mobilizes against you, swiftly and on many fronts. Chemical signals are broadcast, ramping up its production of the hormone ethylene, which encourages ripening, and increasing the rate at which the apple absorbs oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide -- just as a human's breath will quicken when a person is injured. 
 The knife edge has meanwhile ruptured the architecture of countless cells. Substances normally compartmentalized within the fruit suddenly spill out and intermingle. Freed enzymes seep into cell walls, softening them. Little by little, like moisture in the walls of a house, this enfeebles the entire apple. Phytochemicals called phenols, the wealth of which make apples so good for us, are also loosed. So is an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase. Inevitably the two meet. Their reaction begets others, producing a chain of acids that clump together and coagulate into other acids called polyphenols. The polyphenols are brown and unappetizing. Rapidly, they occupy more and more of the flesh. The apple, left absent-mindedly on the counter when the phone rang or the baby started crying, has now efficiently disfigured itself. It is spectacularly good at this. 
 With no way to tame this mayhem -- to stop a wounded apple from ''turning its artillery on itself,'' as James Gorny, a food scientist, put it recently -- the apple industry was unable to get in on the baby-carrot and bagged-lettuce booms of the mid-90's. Most anti-browning treatments left sliced apples with a sour taste or had names like ''4-hexyl resorcinol,'' which would muddy the fruit's biggest selling point, its wholesome image. 
 ''We studied this at the Apple Commission in the 80's,'' says Steve Lutz, a second-generation apple man who headed the Washington Apple Commission until 2000. ''At the time, it was sort of like the Holy Grail: if we could just figure out how to slice these goddarn things.'' 
 Throughout the last century, food makers have used convenience, or at least its appearance, to add value to small-margin commodities like apples. In the 1960's, new processing plants in Washington State made frozen juice concentrate from the boxcars of unmarketable fruits that growers had dumped in the Columbia River each year. Such ''value-added products'' were right in line with the postwar bounty of timesaving foodstuffs emblematized by the TV dinner. 
 But with the fracturing of the family meal, innovations now center on ease of use, not ease of preparation. True convenience now means being eaten with one hand, no utensils, outside the home and alone. Glass jars of applesauce gave way to single-serving snack packs; more recently, as with Mott's ''Fruit Blasters'' and Birds Eye ''Squeezle-Sauz,'' to applesauce pressed like epoxy from tubes.
 Industry insiders now talk about elevating a food's ''snackability,'' which, in short, means engineering it with enough convenience that picking up a piece and putting it in your mouth becomes an almost perfunctory transaction. A snackable food is crumbless and fussless. It is most likely broken into bite-size pieces, encouraging us to eat more. If the food's form itself doesn't imply a portion size -- the way, say, one apple or one cupcake does -- there's no obvious signal to stop. This triggers what one marketer, Barb Stuckey, calls ''mindless munching'' -- the hand's almost hypnotic back and forth between bag and mouth. Stuckey also explains that plucking at individualized little pieces of something is just ''more fun'' than dealing with a chunkier whole. So pretzels are cut down into stumpy pretzel bits, doughnuts broken into doughnut holes and regular-size carrots scrubbed and lathed into several ''baby'' ones. Even the Kit Kat -- a candy bar designed to be easily handled in the first place -- is now available as a bag of smaller Kit Kat Bites. 
 Still, in light of the incident in Eden, the proposition that a whole apple isn't a particularly tempting item to reach for and bite into may sound absurd. It is not. Research done by the Washington Apple Commission and Mantrose-Haueser, the company that eventually solved the browning issue, sought to establish, empirically, just this. One study showed Florida school students eating slices twice as often as whole apples. In Nevada, elementary-school kids ate nearly triple the fruit when offered apple slices over whole -- and this study even measured how much of each ended up in the garbage, since a whole apple might be tossed after a few bites. 
 ''This all started with children,'' Freytag says. ''I think what parents saw is, here's some piece of fruit my child will actually eat.'' Every parent seems to understand his or her small-mouthed, small-handed child won't get very far with a craggy Red Delicious, and Lutz says that everyone knew that ''if it came down to the consumer standing there, cutting it up themselves, putting some lemon juice on it and putting it in a Ziploc bag, they're just not going to do it.'' More troubling still, research suggests that unless kids develop a taste for apples early, roughly between the ages of 2 and 11, they may never. But children with baby teeth may have trouble eating a whole apple. And with the American Association of Orthodontists recommending that kids get their first consultation by age 7, that all-important window in which to hook people for life was being truncated at both ends. 
 The dream of a presliced apple gained particular urgency during the economic free fall of the 1998-99 crop year. The crop from 1998 was the largest to date, up about 15 percent to 277 million bushels. Yet overall U.S. consumption of apples had been flat for a generation. (Americans eat less than half as many pounds of apples yearly as Europeans do.) Export markets were drying up, and cheaper Chinese apples were coming in to compete. Meanwhile, new exotic-seeming varieties like Braeburns and Galas were driving Red Delicious prices down. They were also refining tastes. A 1999 Associated Press article cited complaints that ''the Red Delicious apple -- the symbol of Washington's apple industry -- too often is about as delicious as a wad of cotton.'' 
 Even without a way to solve the browning issue, Lutz pitched the Subway sandwich chain on slices served with caramel dip, just like the Apple Dippers that McDonald's sells today. He called them Submersibles and proposed, naively, shipping Subway boxes of whole apples and installing a wall-mounted slicer in each franchise -- burdening the kid behind the counter with cutting them. ''We lost out to cookies,'' he says. 
 The commission also introduced a campaign featuring a scooter-riding superhero, Apple Guy, who in one TV commercial delivered energizing apples to a weary father and daughter at a zoo. Apple Guy struggled to convince a demographic that the commission dubbed ''Stressed Moms'' that the apple -- as is -- was in fact a convenient, snackable snack. He failed.
 Clearly all fruit was now competing with processed snacks that, over time, had swayed people's expectations. No matter how convenient the old apple was, it wasn't branded correctly or sending the right signals. No one had done anything to it, vouched for it or made it just for you.
 ''You're being outspent 100 to 1 by items that are prepackaged, easy to eat and also totally consistent,'' Lutz says. (According to one study, in 2000, apples, bananas and oranges together accounted for less than 6 percent of the $80 billion snack-food market.) ''I mean, with apples, you're growing them on a tree. You can only put out what Mother Nature gives you.'' He adds that the path from orchard to eater is fraught with potential stresses. Washington growers have to pick all their apples in late summer and fall. They hold them in oxygen-depleted storage rooms and then trickle them, via various distribution centers, into supermarkets throughout the rest of the year. There's no way for anyone to know how a particular apple has weathered all of this without biting into it. And a bright red apple that greets the teeth like a sponge amounts to a kind of betrayal. 
 ''People were quite discriminating and quite punitive,'' says Desmond O'Rourke, an economist who has studied apple marketing for four decades, describing consumer studies done at the time. ''If they got an apple they didn't like, they wouldn't buy apples again'' for some time. It seemed one bad apple really could spoil the whole bunch. No one, after all, walks down the chip-and-cracker aisle squeezing bags of Fritos to see which one is best.

Making the Cut
 A few mornings after Christmas, Freytag and I looked up at the hulking assemblage of chutes, belts, flumes and fast-moving parts that take up a fourth of Crunch Pak's slicing room. Men and women in purple coats, hard hats and masks were positioned at the opposite end, sorting apple pieces. 
 It wasn't until we climbed a ladder onto a little platform that I could see them: a slow, thick traffic of apples entering the room through a stainless-steel canal of frigid water, 10 feet off the ground. They were hefty and red-speckled, their tops bobbing in a tight phalanx. The odd one sported a few leaves. 
 These were Galas, which, along with Pink Ladies, Crunch Pak sells simply as ''Sweet.'' (Granny Smiths are labeled ''Tart.'') They'd been picked around the time of my last visit in August and sealed in storage ever since. This had slowed, but not completely halted, their ripening. 
 The apple spends its entire life ripening, slowly converting its starches into sugars and making its solids soluble. The exact chemistry inside even apples of the same variety will be different on every day of the season. And once picked, Freytag explained, ''that apple is still a living, breathing thing. Everything from the cellular structure, to the sugars, the starches -- when you store it, nothing in that apple will stay the same.'' 
 All this variability makes it extremely tough to convert those thousands of idiosyncratic fruits into baggies of uniform, ultrareliable snacks. Over the years, Crunch Pak has been building a sweeping apple database. As the company constantly monitors and tweaks everything in the slicing room -- the anti-browning treatments, water temperature, air temperature -- it correlates those variables to the condition of the slices churned out. Entering any bag's 11-digit code gives a snapshot of how the processing floor was configured at the time it was sealed. The company is laboring, like a cryptographer, to decode the apple and predict with greater and greater confidence how any given one will react. 
 ''It's all part of the equation,'' Freytag told me, shouting over the din of rushing water and the machinery's thwacks. ''We look at the apples and have to figure out, what are the physiological issues inside that apple? And what are we going to have to do to sustain and accommodate them?'' Among other things, an apple's specific chemistry dictates the optimal concentration of NatureSeal, the blend of vitamin C and calcium that finally made the nonbrowning apple slice a practicable proposition. 
 Though it may sound like glorified lemon juice, NatureSeal is the product of a decade of U.S.D.A. and private research. It's a flavorless white powder that, mixed with water, penetrates a few millimeters beneath the surface of a cut apple. (According to Crunch Pak, the sliced apples don't lose any nutritional value and in fact NatureSeal ends up fortifying each apple with 200 percent of the daily requirement of Vitamin C.) The ascorbic acid in NatureSeal searches out and bonds to the loose phenols, blocking them off from the polyphenol oxidase enzyme and interrupting the browning reaction. The calcium salts work like cement to stiffen the fruit's softening cell walls. All of this happens inside the apple, so the solution leaves no perceptible layer or shell on the surface -- unlike, say, the high-sheen shellac on Goobers, or the substrate on time-released pain relievers, both of which NatureSeal's producer, Mantrose-Haueser, also makes. Freytag first heard about NatureSeal while trying to figure out a way to slice pears for a packer in Oregon. When he received a sample at his house, the first thing he did was stick his finger in the powder and lick it. Surprisingly, there was no taste. Eventually, he sliced and treated some apples in his kitchen, then stuck them in the refrigerator in his garage to see how long they'd last. 
 ''My son was 20-something, and he wasn't living with us,'' he remembered. ''He'd just come over to eat. And I found that the apples were disappearing. He ate some at one point that were, like, 30 days old. So I said, 'How were the apples?''' Here Freytag affected a slightly stoned-sounding obliviousness: '''Great, Dad. No problem.''' 
 Soon enough, with the brown stuff out of the way, would-be processors could peer inside the split-open apple and see other problems awaiting them. Crunch Pak initially set up shop in a plant also used to slice onions, not realizing a cut apple soaks up odor like a sponge. The facility Freytag and I were now standing in was the company's third successively larger one since going into production in 2001. 
 The only precedent for nearly everything being done to the apples in the busy room was slicing apples for pie filling. Ugliness is of no consequence inside a pie, and the existing machinery wasn't averse to browbeating apples to cheaply and quickly dispatch them into the world's ovens. 
 Gradually each fresh-cut company had to retrofit or build from scratch a kinder network of apparatuses to coddle the apple: water flumes replaced conveyor belts, for example, and the drop height on the bagging equipment -- originally used to bag lettuce -- was reduced. Because competitors often work independently with equipment makers to address problems, the whole industry is now rife with stubbornly guarded secrets. It took four months and a nondisclosure agreement before Freytag would even let me see Crunch Pak cut some fruit. 
 He now reached to a bulky furnacelike compartment of the slicing machine and forcefully pulled its two panels apart. Inside, pistons fired and, centered in this confusion, six shining apples atop six separate cylinders spun furiously on their axes while the entire mechanism supporting them rotated. The whole thing resembled some science-fiction rib cage, as if the small, whirling apples inside were the organic parts powering the entire machine. 
 We were watching Galas be cored, but it was happening so rapidly that I had to take Freytag's word for it. Slices and stray seed-cell divots fell from a chute on our left in quick batches. Each was an apple, sliced in 12 segments, the optimum width to sustain crispness longer. Each of the six machines sheers roughly 90 fruits per minute, 16 hours a day, six days a week, and feeds them to tanks of NatureSeal at the end of the line. 
 A lot is at stake in the split second the apple is sliced. A ragged cut rips open more cells and leads to more browning. Few producers slice Red Delicious, since the irregular humps on its blossom end prevent the machine from clutching it snugly. ''A nice Granny Smith, or a Gala or Fuji,'' Ben Zamore, a sales manager at Atlas Pacific, the company that manufactures the slicing machines, says, ''those are beautiful, well-shaped fruits.'' Meanwhile, much has been done, clandestinely, to hone the blade edges. Atlas regularly tests the efficiency of its blades at a lab at Colorado State University. Freytag wouldn't tell me anything about Crunch Pak's blades.
 Cleaving an apple open obliterates its natural safeguard against contamination -- its skin -- and exposes the moist, absorptive surfaces inside. Since a cut apple browns to kill a layer of itself and shield the rest, NatureSeal similarly weakens its natural defenses.
 ''Once you've cut that apple open, you are challenging the integrity of the fruit,'' explains Richard Olsen of Tree Top, the nation's largest apple processor and the company supplying McDonald's with its slices. (Crunch Pak early on turned down a contract with McDonald's, wary in part of growing too fast. The company now dices apples for Arby's.) Anyone who slices the apple must therefore take responsibility for it -- become the apple's immune system. Air in Crunch Pak's slicing room must be purified and pressurized. Everyone wears latex and plastic, and even I had to walk across a funny platform of spinning yellow shoe brushes before entering. With apples skating through a production line and intermixing, an infectious agent like listeria in one could put an entire day's output at risk. 
 Freytag likes to say: ''When we first got into this business, what we were told is: 'O.K., an apple is an apple is an apple. And you take this solution, and you put an apple in it, and -- Bingo! You've got sliced apples that don't turn brown.' If we knew then what we know now, we might not be in this business.'' Clearly this is more a boast than a confession. 

Disgust
 Freytag conducted Crunch Pak's first market research at Little League games. After dispensing samples, he would ask parents why they would pay extra for what effectively boils down to an apple-chopping service. He claims that the answer he heard most often was ''Because I'd rather be here at the game watching my son play baseball than at home slicing apples.'' 
 Oddly, apple slicing was being denigrated as an unthinkably oppressive undertaking, a kind of punitive kitchen duty, evoking the G.I. obscured behind mounds of to-be-peeled potatoes. 
 ''You look at the number of meals being eaten in automobiles,'' Steve Lutz says (research by John Nihoff, a Culinary Institute of America food historian, estimates that 19 percent of all meals or snacks in this country are eaten there), ''and you'd think the apple is convenient already. But when you finish it, you have a core to deal with. You have waste. Plus, once you've started an apple, you're sort of committed to eating the whole thing.'' 
 ''I don't think consumers are very comfortable leaving a half-eaten apple lying around their car or their house,'' Lutz adds. ''I don't know of a single instance, and I can't imagine a single instance where a mother has said to her child, 'I know you can't eat this whole apple, but take two bites and we'll take the rest home and put it in your lunch for tomorrow.''' 
 This is a peculiar phenomenon of the food industry's escalating arms race of snackability: that once the minor hassles of a given food are eliminated, its original version can feel positively insufferable. ''I call it the Starbucks effect,'' Lutz says. ''Once you get used to Starbucks, you can't go back to Folgers. Even though you might have fond memories of Folgers.''
 Stranger still, I found, if we've become less willing to put up with the old apple, we may also be slightly less willing to stomach it. 
 Paul Rozin is a cultural psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and, though he may not introduce himself this way at parties, an authority on disgust. In even our brief phone conversation not long ago, Rozin assured me repeatedly that he personally enjoys biting into a big apple. He enjoys it very much, in fact. But he immediately intuited why others wouldn't and why, after snacking, we're increasingly more comfortable holding a spent plastic bag than an apple core.
 ''Because the bag doesn't have any of you in it!'' he shot out, as though it were obvious. ''The core is an extension of your tongue and your mouth, and the bag is not.'' We, it turns out, are the thing we find most disgusting. 
 ''As the world gets more and more cleaned up of these things, and as you get highly sensitive to disgust, a bitten piece of food in your hand is not too nice,'' he posited. An eater of the whole apple must, with each bite, readdress his mouth to ''the unsavoriness of the bitten edge in front of you.'' But eating apple slices means treating yourself to a clean, unspoiled, appealingly geometric shape every few seconds.
 Apples do not feature prominently in the literature of disgust -- not yet, at least. Meat is generally considered the most potentially disgusting food, since turning a dead carcass into an unthreatening, appetizing meal involves a nuanced psychological maneuver. (''No one who went into a supermarket would know that beef is from a cow,'' Rozin elaborated. ''We've completely sanitized it.'')
 Analyzing a group of studies in the 1940's, the seminal disgust-psychologist Andras Angyal noted that, with the exception of a few slimy things, ''no plant product was reported as disgusting.'' But given the metropolis of slickly packaged, processed foods we've built up around the apple, perhaps even a fruit might now seem crude in the same way as a raw pork tenderloin. Might the idyllic apple, too, need sanitizing, civilizing?
 ''That would be the next step,'' Rozin assented, later adding, ''We all breathe each other's air. But if there were a way not to, I'm sure people would avoid doing it.''

Savage Tastes
 ''It takes a savage or wild taste to appreciate a wild fruit,'' Henry David Thoreau wrote. In ''Wild Apples,'' he went so far as to claim that a crabby, uncultivated apple can be enjoyed only if it's eaten outdoors. It will actually taste different indoors. ''What is sour in the house,'' he wrote, ''a bracing walk makes sweet.'' 
 We, like Thoreau, are used to eating while walking, though getting up and changing locations to accommodate a piece of fruit is laughably antithetical to the way we snack now. We process our food so we don't have to adapt to its eccentricities. We wedge foods into our lifestyles, and as they get crowded out or accelerated past, we give them the tools to catch us on the fly. But while a cookie or a Cheez Doodle can be reined in without much argument, an apple -- like most healthful alternatives -- has a will of its own.
 ''An apple is like us,'' Crunch Pak's general manager, Craig Carson, explained after my tour. ''It's alive. If we don't handle it correctly, we can kill it.''
 Carson is a slim and serious-looking man who has been growing apples in the Wenatchee Valley for 25 years. He doesn't expect sliced apples to dominate in nearly the same way bagged salad has overtaken the lettuce business, he said. Cutting apples is simply one way to help growers, to make a healthy food more versatile, more likely to be eaten. Talking with him, I began to wonder if processing apples is not so unlike growing them. After all, Thoreau was offended that orchardists cultivated only a few varieties from nature's virtually infinite stock. And growers have long thinned out their boughs to promote fewer, bigger apples rather than the many, smaller ones more advantageous to the plant species. 
 This is to say that our integrity and the apple's have always been at odds, and historically, we haven't been the ones to budge. As our tastes skew in more unexpected directions, we expect more from our apples and must retrofit them accordingly or transform them. As a man named Welcome Sauer, who ran the Apple Commission's consumer research, remembers realizing: ''What we were selling with the fresh-cut apple slice was not an apple anymore. What we were selling was a guilt-free snack food.'' It may be that companies like Crunch Pak are simply furthering the domestication of the apple, just more assertively and invasively than anyone has before. 
 Around the time of my visit in December, a new Nielsen report showed Crunch Pak controlling more than half of the presliced-apple market and the whole category vaulting up 300 percent from the previous year. 
 ''When you see numbers like that,'' Freytag had told me, ''I think back to when people would look at me like I was from Mars and say: 'Why would I want a sliced apple? I've got a whole apple' -- and those were their exact words.'' 
 It was clear they'd come around as bagged apple slices smoothly exited the cutting room on a conveyor belt through the wall. There, more purple-clad employees stood waiting to box them up. Sufficiently enhanced, the apples were now bound for places like Costco and Albertsons and out into what -- standing in the contraption-filled clean room on the opposite side of that wall -- Freytag had maybe generously called ''the normal world.''

HEADLINE: Allstate Won't Renew Some Home Policies 

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

 BODY:
ALLSTATE has stepped up its retreat from the Long Island market for homeowners' insurance. It announced last Monday that it would not renew policies on some houses that are more likely to be damaged by a powerful storm or whose owners have previously filed multiple claims.
 That decision followed the company's announcement in January that it would no longer write new policies in eight downstate counties -- Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and the five boroughs of New York City -- to limit its potential losses from a hurricane. Allstate officials said then that they remained committed to their existing customers, but now that some might have to find coverage elsewhere starting May 1. 
New York State's superintendent of insurance, Howard Mills, said that he was ''terribly disappointed'' at Allstate's latest pullback and that he had written to company executives, asking them to put in writing the criteria they will use to decide which policies, and how many, to cancel.
 Allstate officials said the company needed to reduce its financial risks if a hurricane struck densely populated downstate New York, which is generally low-lying and an area of relatively expensive houses and apartments. With the industry reeling from losses in the Gulf Coast states from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year, company officials cited predictions that the 2006 season could be just as devastating, especially for the East Coast.
 The last devastating hurricane to strike Long Island occurred in 1938, when sustained winds of 120 miles an hour were recorded. Meteorologists say the probability for a major hurricane within the next year is high.
 Mr. Mills called those predictions valid but said that Allstate, which with 26 percent of the market share downstate is the largest homeowners' insurer in the area, was overreacting. ''This subsequent decision is premature and completely unnecessary,'' he said.
 He invited 10 insurers, including Allstate, to a Feb. 27 public hearing in Manhattan. ''I'll ask them about any plans to pull out of the market, or if they're interested in picking up some business,'' Mr. Mills said. ''I do expect that if Allstate follows through, the market won't be in danger of any type of disruption.'' 
 State regulations prohibit an insurer from dropping more than 4 percent of its customers. ''We will definitely stay within the statutory limit,'' said Krista Conte, a spokeswoman for Allstate's regional office in Hauppauge.
 She said that Allstate holds policies on 450,000 downstate homes, so it could legally drop as many as 18,000 customers. Mr. Mills said he had warned Allstate that exceeding the cap would trigger regulatory oversight, including a requirement to give policyholders 60 days' notice of a cancellation.
 The owners of houses that were not built to withstand powerful storms could see their policies red-flagged for cancellation. Asked for specific construction features that would trigger such a review, Ms. Conte said that actuarial studies had shown that tar roofs, wooden roofs and frame construction were most susceptible.
 At least 95 percent of the houses on Long Island have wooden frames, said Robert Wieboldt, the executive director of the Long Island Builders Institute. ''Even those with brick facades have a frame on the inside,'' he said. ''Very few are completely masonry.'' 
 ''Allstate is basically just saying they don't want to write insurance policies here,'' Mr. Wieboldt said.
 Although building and safety codes require new houses within a mile of a coast be built to high standards, they took effect two years ago and did not apply to the houses that already lined the Island's coastline, he said.
 Ms. Conte said that homeowners who filed multiple claims in the last few years could lose their coverage.
 Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute in Manhattan, said that such decisions on renewals were generally based not only on the number of claims but also on their cumulative cost. 
 Allstate customers who have been with the company for many years or have ''other relationships'' with the company -- an automobile policy, for example -- will probably have their policies renewed, Ms. Conte said.
 Allstate's retreat from the downstate market in January sparked a proposal to create a $200 billion federal catastrophic insurance fund. Its co-sponsors, Representatives Steven Israel and Carolyn McCarthy, Democrats from Long Island, said the fund would protect insurance companies and lower consumers' premiums. The bill is in committee.
 But Mr. Hartwig said Allstate's retreat from the downstate market was not unusual; other insurers have done the same in Florida, the Gulf Coast and other places at risk from hurricanes. And many companies restrict where they will write a new policy -- not on homes less than a mile from the coast, for example, or within 1,000 feet of the shore -- or they limit agents to a fixed number of new policies a year.
 ''This is part of Long Island's future, as in Florida,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''Homes less able to withstand hurricane-force winds will have a distinctly harder time finding coverage.''

HEADLINE: You'll Need a Scorecard For Energy Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
WHEN Bill H. Adams read last fall that a bigger tax break on hybrid cars would take effect on Jan. 1, he decided that buying a Toyota Prius could wait. 
 Mr. Adams and his wife, Anna M. Ciambotti, had been considering the car for its gas-sipping engine and environmental elan. The tax benefit didn't hurt, either. People who bought cars last year with gasoline-and-electric hybrid engines can file for a $2,000 tax deduction on their 2005 federal returns. But while researching hybrids, Mr. Adams learned that for 2006 Congress had switched the deduction to a more lucrative tax credit.
He wasn't sure how much more money he and his wife would save -- the I.R.S. hadn't filled in all the details -- but early estimates suggested that the Prius's credit could be as high as $3,200. A tax credit is a subtraction from the amount of tax that a person owes, while a deduction reduces only the amount of income subject to tax. 
 So the Adamses, of Youngstown, Ohio, postponed their purchase until Jan. 12. 
 The tax credit for buyers and lessees of hybrid cars is just one of several new tax breaks for consumers in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The law, which was signed by President Bush in August and governs purchases and tax returns for 2006 and subsequent years, adds benefits for certain energy conservation measures like buying snugger windows and better insulation and installing solar systems for making electricity and heating water. 
 Neither deductions nor credits are available for 2005 federal returns for most types of household energy conservation or solar power purchases; these breaks apply only to improvements made from Jan. 1, 2006, to Dec. 31, 2007. 
 Tax professionals say the new credits probably will not be generous enough to induce people to buy hybrids or rooftop photovoltaic panels if they weren't already planning to do so. Moreover, like much of tax law, the provisions are so knotty that you may need a degree in law or accounting to untangle them. 
 Even the pros are still awaiting answers from the government. Michelle D. Lamishaw, an I.R.S. spokeswoman, could not say when the agency would provide more details but encouraged taxpayers to keep checking www.irs.gov. 
 Heather Smith Linton, a certified public accountant in Durham, N.C., said: ''You'll have to jump through some hoops to take advantage of these things. I certainly wouldn't call them tax simplification.'' 
 Consider the hybrid car credit. It includes a complicated phase-out that may reduce its benefit for people who buy top-selling hybrids like those from Toyota or Honda. The full amount of credit will be available to buyers during the quarter in which an automaker reaches 60,000 hybrids in cumulative sales. It will also be available in the following quarter, but after that it will start to decrease.
 Toyota will probably reach 60,000 in the second quarter of this year, said a company spokeswoman, Nancy J. Hubbell. That means that its customers will probably begin to see the tax credit for their purchases start to decrease in the fourth quarter. If a carmaker doesn't reach 60,000, the credit will be available to its customers through 2010.
 And not everyone who buys a hybrid -- no matter who manufactures it -- may qualify for this credit or any other. People who pay the alternative minimum tax, which limits tax breaks for many Americans, may not be eligible, said Steven M. Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group in Washington. ''The I.R.S. hasn't been clear on that, and that wasn't specifically in this law, but all of the underlying tax law should apply here,'' Mr. Nadel said. 
 Using formulas in the new law, Mr. Nadel's group has estimated the credit amounts for several cars, including the Prius, which it said could qualify for a $3,150 break. (Estimates are at www.aceee.org/transportation/hybtaxcred.htm) 
 New incentives for home energy conservation and solar power are less confusing, but also less generous. 
 The law caps the credit for solar systems at 30 percent of the cost or $2,000, whichever is less. Nationwide, a typical home system costs about $25,000, said Thomas Leyden, a vice president in Lawrenceville, N.J., for PowerLight, a solar installer, so the $2,000 credit would apply in such a case. Mr. Leyden said that many states also offered incentives for solar power. 
 The same thresholds apply to solar-powered water heaters, but the water must be for showers and sinks, not pools or hot tubs, said Bob D. Scharin, editor of Practical Tax Strategies, a journal for tax professionals. A single taxpayer can install both kinds of systems and thus receive $4,000 in credits. Both systems must meet third-party certification requirements in the law.
 The credits for making your home snugger -- which professionals call improvements to the ''home envelope'' -- are even more tightly limited. The maximum amount for all such home applications, combined, is $500 across both 2006 and 2007. If, for example, a person took a $250 credit on a 2006 tax return, only $250 would remain for 2007. 
 ''Even if you're making $20,000 worth of improvements, you're still only going to get $500,'' said Jackie Perlman, senior tax research coordinator at H & R Block in Kansas City, Mo.
 In addition, the law imposes even lower limits for specific measures. Buyers of better windows can receive a credit of no more than $200 or 10 percent of the cost, whichever is less. And people who buy high-efficiency air-conditioners and heat pumps can get a credit of no more than $300. 
 IF you decide to make these sorts of improvements, make sure that you understand which kinds of equipment are eligible, as the law includes specifications, Ms. Perlman said. Some sellers may misunderstand or misrepresent the law and mislead buyers about their eligibility. 
 H & R Block has already seen that happening with sales of new furnaces. ''It has to be gas or propane or oil,'' she said. ''We've had people selling wood, pellet and corn furnaces and telling people that they're eligible.''
 And any equipment installed has to be newly made. ''You can't use your brother-in-law's extra one,'' Ms. Perlman said. 
 Despite the complexity and the limits, she encouraged buyers to take every credit to which they are entitled. Sometimes people are reluctant to take tax breaks out of fear that they will be audited, she said. Even if you are audited, she said, the I.R.S. will allow the credits as long as you have evidence that you made the claimed purchases. 
 ''Keep good records,'' she said. ''That goes for anything in taxes. Even if it's a shoebox with receipts in it, keep it.''

HEADLINE: It Doesn't Pay to Be in the A.M.T. Zone 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
AFTER President Bush and Congress cut tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains to a top rate of 15 percent in 2003, many investors bought stocks that make big cash payouts, expecting to benefit from lower taxes. 
 For many people, it has not worked out that way. That is because your actual tax rate may not be the one that the politicians talked about or that the Internal Revenue Service prints on its tax forms.
 The culprit is the alternative minimum tax, which runs parallel to the regular income tax system. The A.M.T. has its own rules, including fewer deductions and just two tax rates, 26 percent and 28 percent. If the alternative tax is higher than the one you would owe under the regular tax system, you pay the higher bill. 
 Taxpayers subject to the alternative system pay the 15 percent rate on dividends and long-term capital gains unless they fall into a netherworld known as the phase-out zone. In 2005, that zone included married couples with annual incomes of $150,000 to $382,000, and single filers making $112,500 to $273,000. 
 Taxpayers in the phase-out zone pay even higher rates on wage income than other people trapped by the A.M.T. -- as much as 35 percent on each additional dollar of income. For people whose income exceeds the phase-out zone limits, the statutory rates apply and any additional wages are taxed at 28 percent and dividends and long-term gains are taxed at 15 percent.
 But those unfortunate enough to dwell in the zone must pay an effective tax rate on dividends and long-term gains of 21.5 percent or 22 percent, instead of 15 percent.
 This extra tax is just one of the many painful features of the alternative levy. Under the alternative tax, people cannot deduct property taxes, for example, so their cost of homeownership climbs. But the interaction of the alternative tax and the 2003 Bush tax cuts directly affect the taxation of investments in stocks. 
 Imposing higher taxes on people at such incomes was not part of the original intent of the alternative tax. Congress created it in 1969 to make sure that those making more than $200,000 -- the equivalent of more than $1 million in today's dollars -- could not live tax free by making unlimited use of exotic tax breaks like the oil depletion allowance. 
 Over time, Congress has excluded most of these tax breaks from the alternative levy. And in 1986, Congress revised the list of tax deductions that would push a taxpayer into the alternative system to include those routinely taken by most Americans. They include the standard deduction; personal exemptions for the taxpayer, spouse and children; deductions for state income and local property taxes; and even some medical deductions for the severely ill or injured. 
 The White House has said repeatedly that it will take measures to mitigate the impact of the alternative tax on people of moderate income, and restore at least some of the benefits of the Bush tax cuts that were taken back by the alternative tax. 
 In his State of the Union address, President Bush again called for making his tax cuts permanent, but he said nothing about overhauling or repealing the alternative minimum tax. 
 The A.M.T. has become such a money maker that by 2008 its repeal would cost more than repealing the regular income tax, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, two research institutions in Washington. 
 Over the next decade, the alternative tax will cost Americans $1.1 trillion in additional taxes, of which $739 billion is a result of the Bush tax cuts not being integrated into the levy, according to a report by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Those hit hardest are couples with two or more children who own their homes, invest and make $75,000 to $500,000 a year, according to the Tax Policy Center computer model. 
 WHILE the administration has never proposed a specific plan to change the alternative minimum tax or to exempt dividends and long-term gains from the phase-out range, Congress initiated a small adjustment five years ago. It exempted the first $58,000 earned by married couples ($40,250 for singles) from the alternative tax calculation for 2001 through last year. This patch was not renewed for 2006, dropping the exemption to $45,000 for couples ($33,750 for singles) unless a new patch is voted into law.
 Investors who have fallen into the phase-out zone face a quandary. Should they buy high-dividend stocks, even though they will not get the full benefit of reduced tax rates? The short answer is this: if it makes sense to buy the shares for other reasons, the extra tax probably should not deter them.
 Rich Carreiro is one of those rare taxpayers who knew before he invested that he would not get the 15 percent rate on dividends. Mr. Carreiro, 38, takes a keen interest in the tax code, which is as complex as the code he works with as a software engineer in Arlington, Mass. 
 ''To move out of dividend-bearing stocks just because I am paying 22 percent instead of the promised 15 percent would cause more harm than good,'' he said. ''The idea in investing is not to minimize your tax; it is to maximize your after-tax return. After all, you can pay no tax by living off money you've stuffed in your mattress, but that doesn't make good sense.'' 
 One investing change that Mr. Carreiro and his wife did make because of the alternative tax was to avoid money market and bond funds that buy private activity bonds -- those whose proceeds are used by private entities. Under the alternative system, income from these bonds is subject to taxes at the higher rates applied to wages. 
 Ed Grogan, a financial planner in Gig Harbor, Wash., says he tells clients not to let the extra tax deter them from buying stocks that they believe have a good future just because they will not qualify for the 15 percent rate on dividends. 
 ''Stick with your investing fundamentals,'' he said. 
 STEPHEN J. ENTIN, a proponent in Washington of the supply-side theory of taxation that favors eliminating most taxes on capital, said last year that denying the 15 percent tax rate to some investors ''poisons the tax cut.'' 
 Mr. Entin, the president of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, said in an interview last month that ''you should be a little more ticked off at the world'' if you are in the phase-out range and, like Mr. Carreiro, pay higher tax rates on dividends. 
 In a report, Mr. Entin wrote that investors are still better off under the 2003 tax rate cuts even if they are in the phase-out range. That is because the phase-out rates are still significantly lower than the tax rates in effect before the 2003 tax cuts. 
 Investors who are stuck in the phase-out range and avoid dividend-paying stocks may find that they still have a vexing tax problem. That is because the higher tax rates that apply to taxes on dividends also apply to long-term capital gains. If you are in the zone, you must pay the higher tax on capital gains, and you cannot take a federal deduction for state and local income taxes on them. 
 Of course, if the stocks pay no dividend, no tax is due until they have been sold. By that time, your income could be above or below the phase-out range, so you could qualify for the 15 percent tax rate on their gains. 
 By then, though, Congress may have made the tax code even more complicated.

HEADLINE: Diplomat Without Portfolio In Davos

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
DR. DANIEL VASELLA, chief executive of Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, attracted attention in Europe when he questioned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in a videoconference at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He asked whether the United States was ''playing into the hands of enemies'' through its tactics in fighting terrorism. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with him: 

Q. Are there winners and losers in the process of globalization?

A. The concept of winners and losers is wrong. If one looks at economic growth, child mortality and other factors, which you can take as the measure of a country's health, you can see that the number of people living on less than $1 per day has declined steadily, from 38 percent of the world's population in 1970 to 20 percent today. 
But there has been a very different evolution of various parts of the world. Some countries have benefited much more than others. The advanced countries have benefited more. If you look at Latin America, East Asia and South Asia, their average income per capita has increased significantly. There is one remarkable exception, where we see stagnation, which is Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, there has been very slow and poor development.

Q. Do you think the distribution of wealth needs to be improved?

A. There is a maldistribution in the sense that we have about 20 percent of the richest 6.1 billion people in the world getting 74 percent of the income, and 80 percent get 26 percent of the income. If you take the poorest 20 percent, they only have 2 percent of the income. So there is no way we can say it is well distributed.

Q. Why would you, as a chief executive, raise these issues with Secretary Rice and other world leaders?

A. The first responsibility of a C.E.O. is to run his company successfully and generate products which are useful to your customers, resulting in economic value creation. We also have to act responsibly, respecting not only the law, but also fulfilling legitimate expectations that society has of us. Today these expectations in most instances go beyond short-term profit maximization. What people want is that businesspeople behave in a responsible way in communities in which they live, that they treat employees fairly, respect the environment and demonstrate sensitivity to the problems of other, disadvantaged people in the world. I think corporate social responsibility has taken a much more important role than it used to.

Q. What did you say to Secretary Rice about the war on terror?

A. It is not a question of whether one should fight terror or not fight terror. Terror is absolutely unacceptable. What we have to stand for is to create and maintain a free and open society. With terror, you destroy open societies.
 But in an open society, there must be a place for expressing one's opinion. Critiquing is in some ways an expression of respect. If you do not respect somebody, you do not bother to critique them. Having said that, I do believe that if you are economically, politically and militarily a superpower, then you have to be a role model for the world. If you talk about values and you stand for democracy and respect for human rights, then you have to act accordingly. The world will look very closely to see if there is consistency between what you say and how you act. You will empower your enemies and weaken your supporters if you deviate from your values and principles.

Q. What do you mean specifically?

A. You cannot fight a war without casualties and without taking prisoners. But other questions remain, like, Do you torture? We, the open societies in the world, have to apply the strictest standards. We need to treat people with respect. We need to be very thoughtful about not offering ground for anybody to be against us. We have to be thoughtful about the fact that poverty and the lack of education are excellent breeding grounds for terrorists. They can indoctrinate children. That's what's happening in many countries. The perception in people's minds about who we are gets very distorted.

Q. So you're suggesting that there is a connection between poverty and terrorism?

A. No question. You are more willing to risk one's life and one's family when you have nothing to lose. People become more thoughtful when they have something to lose.

Q. Are your views typical of most European chief executives?

A. I don't know about C.E.O.'s, but you would hear these views from many people. I'm certainly not a complete outlier.

Q. Do you think you are more willing to discuss these issues publicly than American chief executives?

A. I don't know about that. But I think if we want an open society and want to have the freedom to express oneself, we have the responsibility to do so. What does it help if you have the right to express yourself and you don't use that right? One must speak up when you believe you have something to say.

Q. Why do you think American chief executives are so reluctant to talk about poverty and the roots of terrorism?

A. I don't know. You will have to ask them. I know that some of my fellow C.E.O.'s believe they should not express themselves on political issues at all. They should just do business. I think that is not the right attitude. First of all, we are citizens of whatever country we are from. We have a citizenship responsibility. Secondly, I do believe we have to examine our own beliefs and value systems regularly. We cannot act in a void. I think there is very clear responsibility.

Q. Might expressing your views hurt your business in America?

A. I don't believe so. I believe the Americans are tolerant and self-assured enough to stand up to these questions. I would say that Secretary Rice was very articulate and very impressive. She is an excellent representative of the U.S. abroad. In some ways, you could even say that only if one is confronted with these questions can you clearly explain your position.

Q. But do you think any American chief executive would publicly confront Secretary Rice on these issues?

A. Why not? It depends on the understanding of your role as a business leader. Do you just have responsibility for your business and just your people?
 Or if you are given this kind of job as a result of fate, your skills or whatever circumstances, do you have also to take stands on subjects that are not directly linked to your business but are important? Many think that politics have supremacy over business, but does this also imply that business is just a tool for government? On this, history teaches us some interesting lessons.

HEADLINE: Trouble In Paradise

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
THE steel is rising from the ground at the Meadowlands sports complex, the bones of a controversial $1.2 billion retail and entertainment center, and when it is completed, the venture called Meadowlands Xanadu will be nearly twice the size of Jersey Gardens or the Mall at Short Hills.
 But now state officials are asking, at least privately, whether the Disney-esque development that they insisted on three years ago will have all of the pieces of what the builder calls ''shoppertainment,'' like a minor league baseball stadium and an indoor ski slope.
Last week, after a barrage of news of financial peril for Xanadu's lead developer, the Mills Corporation of Virginia, reports circulated among stock analysts that the company was considering a sale of some assets or even the entire company. It had already dismissed 14 top executives and abandoned 10 projects.Yet this flurry was just the latest in three years of headaches for Mills's partner in the contentious venture -- the State of New Jersey. 
 The state has authorized $350 million in bonds to aid the project and has committed about $60 million more for road improvements, while the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey promised $150 million for a rail link to the sports complex. State officials have fought spurned bidders, many local officials and legislators, citizens' groups, environmentalists and, most important, the sports complex's biggest tenant, the football Giants. 
 Both the chairman and the president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, after meeting with Mills earlier this month, said that they were reassured about Xanadu's progress, even though only a handful of leases have been signed. Moreover, they said they were also assured that the original plan, ski dome and all, would be carried out for the opening in late 2007. 
 Investors and stock analysts say Xanadu is too big an investment to abandon -- its developers having spent $540 million already. But angry investors are demanding the highest possible return, which usually comes not from ski domes but from ordinary shopping malls. And it is not clear whether Mills can satisfy the stock market and the state at the same time. 
 For a mall developer, ''there's nothing you throw in just because it's a nice thing to have,'' said David M. Fick, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company in Baltimore and a former chief financial officer at Mills. ''Those days are gone. You don't build a baseball park just because it would be a nice thing to see from the window.''
 The shareholders have reason for worry. Last month, Mills disclosed accounting and credit problems, including an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a write-off of $21 million in costs for a shoppertainment center in San Francisco in addition to the dismissed executives and abandoned projects. 
 Since then, shareholders have filed at least seven class-action lawsuits, and Mills's stock, which reached a high of $66.44 in August, was trading in the high 30's last week.
 A spokesman for Mills, David P. Douglass, said the company would have no comment on its recent troubles. State officials, while pressing Mills behind the scenes, have also declined to discuss the company's bigger problems. 

Fear of Unnerving Investors
 George Zoffinger, the president of the sports authority, said Thursday, ''We could say some statements that are only speculation on our part that would end up hurting the company, and that's not right.''
 Indeed, analysts say that it is always dangerous to express concerns publicly for fear of unnerving potential tenants and investors. 
 ''The last thing you want is people suggesting you're in trouble because then it can become a reality,'' said Barry Vinocur, the editor of Realty Stock Review, a newsletter. ''You set in motion a cascade of events that can prove to be the undoing.''
 Michael Turner, a spokesman for the Xanadu partnership, said that the state had received all of its payments on time and that the company was in compliance with its lease. Mr. Turner added that ''we've already invested more than $500 million in the project: concrete poured, steel erected.'' He declined to comment further. 
 Mr. Zoffinger and the sports authority's chairman, Carl J. Goldberg, also insisted that Mills had fulfilled all of its obligations to the state, making an up-front payment of $130 million, and would make its final $30 million payment next month. 
 Some of Mills's other obligations to the state, however, are not so clear. 
 When state officials decided in 2002 that they wanted development in the Meadowlands, they had to ask prospective bidders for recreation and entertainment, since the sports authority is bound by state law to allow retail development on its property only if it is ancillary to recreational activities there. 

A Plan Shapes Up and Pieces Drop
 Mills and its partner in the joint venture, Mack-Cali Realty of Cranford, promised a dizzying array of entertainment: a minor league baseball stadium, a rooftop driving range, an indoor ski slope, a wave machine for surfing, rock climbing, a miniature Formula One-style racetrack, a Canyon Ranch spa, a home for the local Y.M.C.A. and more.
 But in the mall-building business, entertainment is something of a frill. As the plan took shape, it put off most of its more fanciful components, and some of the unprofitable ones, like the Y.M.C.A. As the steel skeleton started to rise, state officials were left demanding, at the least, their ballpark and their ski dome.
 Mr. Fick, who was at Mills when it initiated a plan to build in the Meadowlands in the early 1990's, said he doubted that New Jersey would ever see its indoor ski mountain. He said that a Mills executive told him several weeks ago that the company would build it only if it had a final agreement with the manufacturer and the promise of a return of more than 9 percent, which analysts say is unlikely. 
 ''The investment community is demanding that in order to proceed they must have an economically viable plan for each major piece, including the snow dome,'' Mr. Fick said. He said he would be ''more than shocked'' if Mills did not follow through on its assurances to investors. 

Sticking to the Original Plan
 But Mr. Goldberg said that at their meeting on Feb. 3, the developers ''emphasized quite forcefully that the snow dome would be built.'' And on Thursday, Mr. Zoffinger said that he had received assurances from the manufacturer of the dome in England that they were very close to an agreement with Mills.
 Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Zoffinger insist that they will enforce the original plan, with ample entertainment. Moreover, Mr. Goldberg said, Mills could not change the original plan or get permission to open without the authority's consent. 
 ''We will continue to hold their feet to the fire,'' he said. ''We expect to see each and every new lease. We want to see that the tenant mix stays in place.'' 
 The sports authority also says it will insist on a minor league ballpark at the sports complex. ''There is no stepping away from our commitment,'' Mr. Zoffinger said in a statement after the Bergen Cliff Hawks, the team that had planned to use the stadium, sued Mills and Mack-Cali, claiming that the two developers had reneged on their agreement.
 According to the lawsuit, the team owner, Steven Kalafer, secured the deal, including the terms of the rent at a meeting in 2002 with the developers and their lawyer, M. Robert DeCotiis. In his account, Mr. Kalafer said that he asked twice for an oral confirmation of the agreement, and that Mr. DeCotiis ''offered his hand to confirm the agreement, saying, 'My word is my bond.' ''
 Mr. Kalafer said he was never informed that the developers' agreement with the sports authority, signed in 2003, obligated Mills to build a ballpark only ''assuming favorable economic conditions.'' Nor was he told of a superseding lease with Mills, signed last June, he said, providing that construction of a ballpark was in the company's sole and absolute discretion. 
 Mr. DeCotiis did not return a telephone call seeking response. 
 By the time the ball club filed its suit last month in State Superior Court, the Xanadu real estate partnership or the state had already been sued over the project by Hartz Mountain Industries, which had been a competitor for the arena site; the Town of Carlstadt, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups and the New Jersey Builders Association. The Giants were also in court over Xanadu before they forged their agreement with the Jets last year to replace their stadium. 

More Than a Mall?
 Hartz, a major developer in the Meadowlands for decades, has claimed since the Mills won the project that Xanadu is nothing more than a mall. Irwin Horowitz, Hartz's general counsel, faulted the sports authority as well as Mills. ''They want to hear that everything is all right, and they don't want to look too hard or maybe they'll find out something,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''I'm mystified. How can they go into a meeting with people who are subject to an S.E.C. investigation and come out and announce, 'It looks O.K. to me'? '' 
 Noting Mr. Zoffinger's recent statement that Mills had a ''moral obligation'' to build entertainment facilities, he said acidly, ''They had a moral obligation to build a baseball stadium, they had a moral obligation to build a Y.M.C.A., a Formula One, and none of these things happened.''
 Stock analysts have varying views on Mills's future, but most consider Xanadu a valuable property. ''It's a destination, it's attached to the stadium, people are going to come from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,'' said Jonathan Litt, analyst with Citigroup. 
 An immediate problem is that no one is sure how to value the company, since Mills is undergoing an internal audit and needs to restate its earnings, or Xanadu itself, which is at least supposed to be a one-of-a-kind creation. 
 Rich Moore, a senior real estate analyst at Keybanc Capital Markets, said: ''A lot of people in the investment community have said they don't think Xanadu is going to work. That's a common concern in the investment community. But I believe it's going to work because the government is behind it.''
 ''The government of New Jersey has put a lot of energy behind this, so they don't want it to fail,'' Mr. Moore said. ''It would be a bit of a mess.''

HEADLINE: In a Booker-James Repeat, What Can Be Expected?

BYLINE: By Richard Lezin Jones. 
Richard Lezin Jones reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Now that Candidate Corzine is Governor Corzine and the battle lines have been drawn between Robert Menendez and Thomas H. Kean Jr. in the race for the United States Senate, the mantle of New Jersey's most intriguing political race remaining may now be worn up north.
 In Newark, Cory Booker is steeling himself to challenge the five-time incumbent Sharpe James in the city's nonpartisan general election on May 9. 
Mr. Booker, a 36-year-old Ivy-educated lawyer, gave Mr. James the race of his political life in 2002 before losing the most expensive mayor's campaign in Newark's history by about seven percentage points.
 Besides being the city's costliest political race -- the two sides raised a total of about $5 million -- it was also one of the most contentious, including allegations of dirty tricks and the occasional shoving match at campaign gatherings featuring supporters from the two camps. The vitriol of the race was captured in a documentary released last year, ''Street Fight,'' which is nominated for an Academy Award.
 Mr. James, who will turn 70 on Feb. 20 and who has never lost an election in 36 years in politics, has not yet formally announced his intention to run, but it is widely expected that he will seek a sixth term.
 If so, the outcome of the race could become the crowning moment in a career that began in the cauldron of the civil rights movement, or an embarrassing repudiation of what he has called Newark's renaissance.
 It may also offer a window into the evolution of black political power as two African-American candidates from divergent generations and backgrounds try to settle the question of when the proverbial torch will be passed. 
 But even if Mr. James formally enters the race, political scientists say that voters should not necessarily expect Cory & Sharpe, Part Deux.
 ''Politicians are not like prizefighters,'' said Dr. Clement A. Price, a history professor at Rutgers University's Newark campus and a veteran observer of local politics. ''I don't think either of them will be as animated or forceful as they were four years ago. In the business of history it's hard to repeat the kind of energy and crystal-clear delineations of styles and backgrounds. Politicians really do have to reinvent themselves for the new campaign and the four-year evolution of the city.''
 For Mr. Booker that reinvention has consisted of strengthening his roots in his adopted home by starting a nonprofit organization, Newark Now, and doing pro bono legal work out of his law firm. He has spent the last four years shaking hands and collecting endorsements and has even kept a post-election promise to bone up on his Spanish, taking an immersion course last year in Ecuador.
 For Mr. James, the last few years have seen him continue to consolidate power as a state senator and maintain his control of one of the state's most influential political machines. One of the highlights of Mr. James's fifth term has been his successful effort to bring a sports arena to Newark for the National Hockey League New Jersey Devils.
 But observers say that the arena could prove both a strength and weakness to Mr. James -- the former because of hopes that the complex may help re-energize the economy of the New Jersey's largest city, the latter because of criticisms that money used for the sports complex could have been better spent on projects like improving the city's chronically failing public schools or decaying housing infrastructure. 
 ''There's one school of thought that believes: How do you say 'no' to a guy who finally delivered on the Newark arena, which will give the city a boost image wise, if not to its economy?'' said David P. Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University.
 The wild card in this year's race just may turn out to be the city's increasingly diverse electorate. According to the most recent census estimates, the percentage of Hispanic residents has been on the rise in Newark while the African-American population had fallen by as much as 5 percent as of 2004, the latest year for which figures are available.
 Those numbers may not bode well for the quintuple incumbent. In 2002, Mr. James won the city's predominantly black voting districts by about 60 percent to 40 percent, while Mr. Booker reversed those numbers in mostly Hispanic areas.
 With even greater representation by Hispanics, Mr. James has several options: He may broaden his message to new Newarkers or simply make an even harder pitch to his political base: older African-American voters who remember his leadership not only as mayor but also as an activist and South Ward councilman who helped guide the city out of the rubble of the riots.
 Four years ago, Mr. James opted for the latter to great effect. He tapped into the city's reservoir of distrust for outsiders -- a vestige of lingering civic resentment by many longtime residents for those who abandoned the city after the riots -- and was able to portray Mr. Booker as an opportunistic carpetbagger, even though Mr. Booker's roots stretched no farther than Bergen County.
 For Mr. Booker, the question of birthplace seemed moot. ''Newark hasn't had a mayor who was born here in more than 50 years,'' he said in a telephone interview last week. ''I think what Newark wants to see is that you are committed to the city. They're aware that I stuck with it.''
 Will that persistence change the outcome this time around?
 ''That,'' Mr. Rebovich said, ''is the $64,000 question.''

HEADLINE: UMDNJ NOMINEES 

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine nominated three new trustees, including a former Princeton University president and a former United States attorney, to the board of the embattled University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey last Thursday. ''These nominees will help give UMDNJ a fresh start and bring respect, honor and integrity back to the leadership of this great institution,'' Mr. Corzine said in a statement. Harold T. Shapiro and Oliver Quinn will serve as board members and Robert J. Del Tufo will become the board's chairman. Mr. Shapiro is a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton, where he served as president from 1998 to 2001. Mr. Del Tufo, who served as state attorney general from 1990 to 1993, is counsel at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a New York law firm. He has served as commissioner of the State Commission of Investigations and a United States attorney for New Jersey. Mr. Quinn is the corporate vice president for ethics and employee resolution programs at Prudential Financial in Newark. He has been a deputy solicitor at the United States Department of Labor.

HEADLINE: Eats Shoots, Leaves and Much of Zoos' Budgets

BYLINE: By BRENDA GOODMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Lun Lun and Yang Yang have needs. They require an expensive all-vegetarian diet -- 84 pounds a day, each. They are attended by a four-person entourage, and both crave privacy. Would-be divas could take notes.
 But the real sticker shock comes from the annual fees that Zoo Atlanta must pay the Chinese government, $2 million a year, essentially to rent a pair of giant pandas. Giant pandas are also on loan to zoos in Washington, San Diego and Memphis. 
 The financial headache caused by the costly loan obligations to China has driven Dennis W. Kelly, chief executive of Zoo Atlanta, to join with the directors of the three other zoos to negotiate some budgetary breathing room. If no agreement with China can be made, Mr. Kelly said, the zoos may have to return their star attractions.
 ''If we can't renegotiate, they absolutely will go back,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''Unless there are significant renegotiations, you'll see far fewer pandas in the United States at the end of this current agreement.''
 The San Diego Zoo's contract with China is the first to expire, in 2008. The last contract, at the Memphis Zoo, ends in 2013.
 Mr. Kelly says Lun Lun and Yang Yang, Zoo Atlanta's giant pandas, are draining the zoo's coffers far faster than they can be replenished -- even though visitors flock to see them. And when people cannot make it through the gates, self-described pandaholics blog with doe-eyed ardor about the bears or stay glued to the zoos' panda Web cams.
 Giant pandas are indisputably popular. Two months ago, the public snapped up 13,000 tickets to see Tai Shan, born at the National Zoo in Washington last July, in just two hours. Later that day the free tickets were being traded on eBay for as much as $200 each.
 ''People will get up in the middle of the night to see the pandas,'' said Don Lindburg, head of the office of giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. ''I don't think there is a comparable animal. There isn't the enormity of response that you find with pandas.''
 But after the first year, crowds dwindle, while the expenses remain high. In fact, a panda's upkeep costs five times more than that of the next most expensive animal, an elephant.
 A curator, three full-time keepers and one backup keeper care for Lun Lun and Yang Yang at Zoo Atlanta. A crew of six travels around Georgia six days a week, harvesting bamboo from 400 volunteers who grow it in their backyards. (Zoo Atlanta tried growing its own on a farm, as the Memphis Zoo does, but Lun Lun and Yang Yang turned up their noses.)
 ''It's crazy,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''These bears, year-round, are some of the most pampered animals on the planet. We measure everything that goes in. We measure everything that goes out.''
 Then there are the contracts, most lasting 10 years. Because China retains ownership of the pandas, zoos lease each pair for $1 million a year. If cubs are born, the annual fee increases by an average of $600,000. In addition, each zoo has agreed to pay another million or so each year to finance research and conservation projects in the United States and in China. Taken together, Mr. Kelly says, the contracts are worth more than $80 million to the Chinese government.
 Mr. Kelly said he hoped China would consider the request to reduce the fees because most other countries pay far less for their pandas. Australia and Thailand, he said, pay about $300,000 each year for theirs. So far, China seems amenable to considering it, he said. Chinese officials did not respond to requests for comment.
 ''There's a perception in China that U.S. zoos are very rich because when they come over, the zoos are beautiful,'' said Chuck Brady, the chief executive of the Memphis Zoo.
 Zoos say they can break even on pandas, but only for the first few years.
 ''Year three is your break-even year,'' Mr. Brady said. The Memphis Zoo expects to lose about $300,000 per year on the pandas it leased in 2003. ''After that, attendance drops off, and you start losing vast amounts of money. There is a resurgence in attendance when babies are born.''
 Because they have had cubs born, the San Diego Zoo and the National Zoo have fared better financially than Zoo Atlanta and the Memphis Zoo, which still have not had luck with their breeding programs.
 ''The general feeling on the American side is that when the initial negotiations were done 10 years ago, we had very little information on the impact of pandas on zoos,'' Mr. Brady said. ''Now we're stuck with this template.''
 Apart from foot traffic, pandas also inspire valuable, enthusiastic corporate sponsorships. FedEx, for example, flew Ya Ya and Le Le, the pandas at the Memphis Zoo, to the United States from China in a decorated ''Panda Express'' plane. The public was able to track the flight on a designated FedEx Web site.
 Fujifilm, Home Depot, UPS and others have donated millions to be sponsors of panda exhibits at zoos, hoping to solidify business relationships with China, which regards the animal as a national symbol.
 Mr. Kelly said he expected the negotiations to progress slowly.
 ''They are listening. They are open. They have not responded to anything other than to say that the items that we put on the table are open to discussion,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''They have indicated they think the zoos need to honor their current agreements before we make changes.''
 In the zoos' favor is that the lease program has generated important reproductive successes for a species that is critically endangered, said David L. Towne, director of the Giant Panda Conservation Foundation. Only 1,500 giant pandas are believed to be left in the wild.
 For now, though, zoos with pandas do not inspire the envy they once did. ''It was like having a World Series winner in your town,'' said Mr. Towne, who lives in Seattle. But now, he said, based purely on economics, ''I've told my mayor and everyone else that the last thing we want is pandas.''

HEADLINE: The Heartland Dissident

BYLINE: By Joseph Lelyveld. 
Joseph Lelyveld is the author most recently of ''Omaha Blues: A Memory Loop'' and a former correspondent and executive editor at The Times.

 BODY:
With a bluntness that seems habitual -- and more than occasionally strikes fellow Republicans as disloyal -- Senator Chuck Hagel started voicing skepticism about the Bush administration's fixation on Iraq as a place to fight the Global War on Terror more than half a year before the president gave the go-ahead for the assault. What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force -- he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand -- he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: ''How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world? 
. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets.'' The president had said ''precious little'' about post-Saddam Iraq, which could prove costly, Hagel warned, ''in both American blood and treasure.''
As the months and years wore on, Senator Hagel's public musings on Iraq became less measured, as if his gorge rose a little higher with each day's casualty report. He would say that the White House was out of touch with reality, that the reconstruction effort in Iraq was ''beyond pitiful,'' that he had lost confidence in Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, that we were losing the war and had destabilized the Middle East, that the United States was getting ''bogged down'' in Iraq the way it had been in Vietnam. Some of these observations flew into print during the 2004 presidential race, and one of them, the ''beyond pitiful'' line, was seized upon by John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, in his second debate with President Bush. At the Republican grass roots in Nebraska and in the upper reaches of his party in Washington, the senator's candor was not universally viewed as refreshing. His timing was held against him even more than his dissent. (''Maybe his criticisms are valid,'' a letter to The Omaha World-Herald said, ''but why showcase them and lend credence to the liberal opposition?'') Obviously, this was not a team player. Some of his closest friends and supporters fretted that he was killing whatever small chance he might have had to be the national candidate he plainly aspired to be. Now -- 33 months before a presidential election, two years before the first primaries -- his chances aren't merely discounted; he's seldom even mentioned in Republican circles, as if he has been sidelined by his independence on Iraq.
 The fact that Hagel himself emerged with two Purple Hearts from Vietnam, where he served as an enlisted man in the infantry, has often been mentioned in news reports quoting him on Iraq as if memories, or maybe nightmares, dating back to the war from which he still carried bits of shrapnel in his chest were primary and extenuating factors shaping his seemingly irrepressible utterances on the latest intervention, his regular brushes with apostasy. Compelling as it is, Chuck Hagel's history as an ordinary soldier, a grunt from small-town Middle America who grew up to be a senator, is more layered, less simple. Unlike Senator Kerry, he had never been a Vietnam veteran against the war. Unlike his own younger brother Tom -- with whom, against standard Army practice on exposing brothers to risk, he walked point in the same infantry unit -- he supported that war to the bitter end. The brothers continued to argue about it for another 25 years until the older one's experience of the world as a globetrotting businessman and his autodidact forays into history and foreign-policy discourse brought him to more or less the same place that Tom (now a law professor in Dayton, Ohio, and a Democrat) had reached in instant, visceral reaction to the experience of jungle war. 
 Chuck Hagel never became a dove, but he became a bird that's nearly as rare in the Republican aviary. He became an internationalist, someone who's capable of feeling intensely about alliances, multilateral endeavors, the value of global institutions; a fellow traveler of the Council on Foreign Relations, a politician who actually reads Foreign Affairs. A singular Great Plains Republican, in other words, who cares about the rest of the world for reasons that don't begin and end with agricultural exports. Tellingly, when he was elected to the Senate in 1996, he was the one new Republican whose first choice for a committee assignment was the Foreign Relations Committee, which had declined steadily in prestige since the Vietnam-era days of a Democratic chairman he sometimes mentions as a role model, J. William Fulbright. An instinctive and unwavering conservative on most issues -- in particular, big government and deficits -- he was the antithesis of a neocon, a profile to which The Weekly Standard paid backhanded tribute in 2002 when it included him (along with Powell, Scowcroft and The New York Times) in what it called ''the axis of appeasement.'' In the cruelest cut, in that brief period of easy, triumphalist anticipation before the invasion and its turbulent aftermath, National Review put Nebraska's senior senator down as Senator Hagel (R., France).
 If his tendency to fall out of step with the administration and to ignore talking points sent around by the Republican National Committee has been most conspicuous on foreign affairs, he has been just as much his own man on domestic issues. (''Nothing in my oath of office,'' he recently told reporters, ''says, 'I pledge allegiance to the Republican Party and President Bush.' '') The senator from Nebraska broke with his party leadership to vote against the new prescription-drug program under Medicare, the No Child Left Behind bill and a big farm bill stuffed with incentives for corporate agriculture. Each, he felt, was ill conceived in practical terms and unwarranted as an expansion of federal mandates and spending. Only on the Bush tax cuts -- all of which he has supported -- has he been deaf to warnings about the consequences for the federal deficit. (Though, he says, he'd never take ''the pledge'' to oppose any and all tax hikes.)
 It can be argued, as David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, pointed out, that Hagel has taken a more conservative position than the Bush administration every time he has broken with it on a major issue. Keene's outfit gave the senator a 100 percent rating for his votes in 2003. His lifetime rating for his first eight years in the Senate stood at 85 on the union's scorecard, which translates into baseball talk as better than a .300 batting average. Here's a certified conservative, then, who has regularly decried partisanship -- even during the do-or-die Florida showdown in 2000, when he suggested a statewide recount -- and doesn't go on about ''values.'' (He has them; most people have them, he says, so seeking to impose one's own values on others isn't right.) A regular churchgoer, an Episcopalian who sends his two children to Catholic school, he thinks religion is a private matter. In today's partisan climate, what are so-called movement conservatives to make of such a man? Facing conservative audiences, he struggles to overcome the suspicion that he's unpredictable, a throwback to old-school G.O.P. moderation, a dissident. 
 That suspicion isn't altogether baseless. Hagel is typically more interested in facts on the ground than doctrine. For instance, while he's reliably anti-abortion -- earning a legislative rating of 100 from the Christian Coalition in 2004 -- he's ready to think through an issue that's a litmus test for some religious groups without bothering to figure out what it might cost him. I asked whether he, like the Bush administration, resisted assistance to groups that distribute condoms in the fight against AIDS in Africa. The senator didn't have a potted answer, so I got to watch him think. He said he thought the United States should be careful about the conditions it lays down; he also had no problem with contraception, he said. As far as I could tell, the answer had come through unfiltered, without political calculation. 
 None of this easily adds up to a mandate to seek the presidential nomination of the Republican Party, even if you're the senator and happen to believe strongly that the party has lost its way at home and abroad. Hagel leaves no doubt that this is how he feels, even when he's trying to hold in check the reflexive, often surprising directness that makes him a favorite on Sunday-morning TV gab shows. (''I sometimes question whether I'm in the same party I started off in,'' he will say. Or, ''This party that sometimes I don't recognize anymore has presided over the largest growth of government in the history of this country and maybe even the history of man.'') Though he can be scathing about the Bush administration's policies, he almost always avoids direct criticism of the president (except to express astonishment that a Republican could go five years without vetoing a single spending bill). He also doesn't praise him.
 The problem with making a revival of old-time values of fiscal restraint at home and restraint in the use of American power abroad the starting point for a race is that it presumes a level of disillusion that latter-day Republicans -- the people who'll vote in primaries in 2008 -- show little sign of feeling. Even when George W. Bush was bottoming out in national polls, Republicans gave him a favorability rating of about 80 percent. Nevertheless, Chuck Hagel is still thinking hard about running, even though party professionals place him at the back of the pack; even though running would more than likely entail standing against John McCain, whom he supported in 2000, one of only four senators to do so, and his closest neighbor in the Russell Senate Office Building. McCain, a former naval officer who calls Hagel ''Sergeant,'' is not only another Vietnam vet and therefore a soul mate, he's also the member of the Republican caucus, Hagel will say even now, who has the best shot at giving the party a new direction and balance. But, among other things, they've differed on Iraq.
 Before he can worry about potential rivals, Hagel says, he has to look into himself to see if he has the mettle and ideas needed to offset the disadvantages that make also-rans of senators who discover their Washington experience and voting records only handicap them when they go up against fresh-faced governors able to boast that they're not part of the problem. A veteran of previous administrations who's in fairly regular touch with the senator said he admired him for his seriousness and ''brain power,'' his fresh and independent approach to the toughest issues in foreign affairs especially, but hadn't yet detected the ''single-minded zeal'' that marks successful candidates for the highest office. Judged as a possible president, the former official said, Hagel could be considered impressive, but judged as a possible candidate, he seemed ''basically a dilettante.'' 
 Michael McCarthy, an Omaha merchant banker who once made Chuck Hagel president of his investment bank and is now among his most stalwart backers, said he doubted that Hagel could get very far in presidential politics. But he didn't rule out a race. ''Chuck's a complicated guy,'' he said. ''He thinks with the clarity of an actuary but decides with the heart of an Irishman, so I don't know where at the end of the day he'll land. He sure as hell can overcome doubt and decide to go where his heart tells him to.''
 The issue that could propel him into the campaign is not one on which candidacies normally rise or fall. Call it the issue of competence. Hagel is a small-government man who believes government can be made to work, that it should be managed well. And while he doesn't exactly say that the current administration has been careless and incompetent, that theme cries out between the lines of much of what he does say. After the botched reconstruction of Iraq and the nonchalant response to the hurricane on the Gulf Coast, it's not a stretch to hear an implied critique when he says, as he did talking to local reporters in Ames, Iowa, last fall, that the president should ''stay focused on governing the country'' and ''reach out to Congress.'' It was a polite way of saying the president had done neither. Later, in an interview in his Senate office, I asked how he thought history would judge George W. Bush. He said it would be ''rather harsh'' if things continued for the next three years the way they've gone for the last five. The verdict would depend on Iraq, ''on what happens to the deficit and the debt and some of these issues we've not paid attention to over the last five years.'' His list of ''these things'' is familiar and long, in both foreign and domestic affairs. It includes global warming, an issue Hagel has fastened on ever since sponsoring a Congressional resolution with Senator Robert Byrd, the Democratic elder from West Virginia, that opposed the Kyoto Protocol because it placed no caps on emissions by rising industrial powers like China and India; on climate change, he feels strongly, the Bush White House has muffed a chance to demonstrate that conservatives can say something more useful than no, that they can actually advance ideas and programs.
 An earnest legislator who seeks to legislate across a broad range of big, looming issues, Hagel managed to pass a couple of bills that offered corporations loan guarantees and tax breaks to come up with processes and devices that limit greenhouse gases. Unlike the administration, he actually got to the point of drafting a Social Security reform bill. And finding allies across party lines -- Tom Daschle of South Dakota in the last session, Barack Obama of Illinois as well as a fellow Republican, Mel Martinez, in this one -- he shaped a package of immigration-reform bills that aim to create a system that's not dysfunctional: tough on illegals coming into the country, not impossible for illegals who are already here and manageable for employers who want to obey the law. (To understand why a Nebraska senator might interest himself in immigration issues, it's enough to visit an Omaha meatpacking plant. On the cutting floor, the universal language is Spanish.)
 ''Competent Governance'' may not be a slogan to set Republican pulses racing; and pledging to be ''a uniter rather than a divider'' and to be ''humble'' in dealings with the rest of the world are, in any case, themes that have already been tried. Recently, instead of the pallid term ''competence,'' Hagel has been talking about ''competitiveness'' as he tries to find language that will give some urgency to his sense that the party in power, his party, has failed to address issues that are just as urgent as terrorism. 
 It may say something about the politics of ''tending to the base'' that Chuck Hagel appears today to be the longest of long shots, for he's a politician with attributes that are supposedly sought by the people who package candidates and by the casual, least opinionated voters for whom they package them -- those who drift back and forth between parties, actually deciding elections. The packagers like candidates with what in the trade is called ''a good story.'' Hagel's story wouldn't have to be reshaped by an editor in a cutting room. Voters claim they look for someone who comes across as genuine, talks straight, means what he (or, for argument's sake in the coming campaign, she) says, even if they're not in perfect sync with the candidate on issues. Hagel has that quality of going beyond plausibility to believability, possibly to a fault (in that it sometimes comes with a senatorial tendency to tell you more than you wanted to know; a related liability is that he likes to write his own speeches, which he weighs down with lessons of history and high-minded quotations from his reading, as if he feels a need to show how studious he is).
 A Republican campaign pro, after an astute analysis of Hagel's virtues and drawbacks, zeroed in on a factor no one else had mentioned, one that he seemed to feel said a lot about the reason Hagel's party hasn't warmed to him, and therefore about his limited prospects. 
 ''He doesn't have a happy face,'' the pro said. 
 That's something a good story -- real life, in other words -- can do to a person.
 It's not that Chuck Hagel can't flash a smile. I watched him in Iowa patiently pose with members of his audience who lined up to have their pictures snapped. The strain started to show only after seven or eight little flashes. He also laughs easily, at his own jokes and others'. A tireless networker and campaigner who revels in small-town parades, he never seems to need prompting to attach a name to a face. But his gregariousness, the habit of a lifetime, takes concentration. When he's small-talking his way around a room, he seems to lean into conversations; and his fingers are usually working, if not grabbing elbows or patting shoulders, then knitting themselves together or kneading the palms of his hands, as if typing out signals to his brain to remind him he's on stage. If you had to choose a word to describe him at such moments, it might be ''focused,'' even ''conscientious''; it wouldn't be ''happy.'' Later, while he's waiting to be introduced, his roughly chiseled features may look a little tired or pensive but never less than alert. This is a politician who works at his job.
 That usually animated, hardly woebegone face has taken more than its share of battering. His nose was broken twice in high school and college football games and at least once more in a fistfight. (There was the fight on a dance floor in Schuyler, Neb., when some players from another school started picking on a pal, and another at a party in Lincoln when he advised some crashers to leave a friend's home.) And there was Vietnam, where the left side of his face was scorched after a mine went off under the armored personnel carrier in which he was riding. Harder to read are the tracings of a difficult childhood, over which Hagel usually drops a kind of scrim to obscure the roughest parts.
 If he tells the story of his hard-luck dad, who came down with malaria in the Pacific theater, he's apt to leave out the drinking. And if he mentions the binges, it takes some prompting for him to acknowledge the effect on himself, the eldest of four sons. More often he dwells on the conversion of his German-French father -- Charles Dean Hagel, known as Charlie -- to the Roman Catholicism of his Polish-Irish mother and the lead role he then took in building a small church in the town of Ainsworth, where Chuck and Tom became altar boys. Or he humorously turns the fact that the family had homes in seven different small towns that describe a loop around Nebraska into a bountiful political legacy, one that makes it possible for him to say it's good to be home again practically anywhere he campaigns in his state.
 Hagel, who will turn 60 this year, was born in North Platte, in western Nebraska, less than a year after his parents were wed, and christened Charles Timothy. They then moved north to Ainsworth, where his dad worked for his own father in a lumberyard, loading and unloading trains. When they couldn't get along, he got himself reassigned to a lumberyard in Rushville, farther west. By then the senator's dad had already been hospitalized twice, for polio and for severe injuries sustained in a fall at the Ainsworth yard. When the family caught up to him in Rushville, he was again in the hospital, this time with a broken back, the result of a car crash when he'd been drinking. 
 ''We lived,'' Hagel told me, speaking haltingly, not relishing the details, ''in the basement of this old hotel called the Travelers Hotel in downtown Rushville -- downtown Rushville is like two streets -- and when Dad got out of the hospital, we couldn't find a house. It was like a furnace room. I mean it literally was a furnace room. I mean we had cots down there. It was all dirty. Mice and everything.'' After Rushville came Scotts Bluff, farther west, near the Wyoming border; then Terrytown, just across the Platte River, where his dad would be fired for drinking; then, moving east again, York and the basement of another hotel, the St. Cloud, where young Chuck, by now a freshman in high school, bused tables. ''It was a little better than Rushville,'' he said, ''but not much.''
 By then, he was winning notice for his athletic promise and precocious interest in politics. It was 1960, and he was in a Catholic school called St. Joseph's. ''I was the only kid in the school who was for Nixon,'' he said. ''The nuns and priests were wild, just completely wild, for Kennedy, and everyone was very upset with me because I had a picture of Nixon on one of my books.'' It was also about then that he started getting into occasional confrontations with his dad. As he guardedly puts it now, ''Some of it was physical.'' Feeling that he had a responsibility as the eldest, he'd step between his parents when his father, livid with drink, started badgering his mother. I asked whether his dad ever took a swing at him. He paused for a moment, then said, ''Yeh, uh-huh.'' Again he paused. ''Well, you wouldn't swing back at him,'' he went on. ''I'd just push him back.''
 In his steadier moments, the father was hugely proud of his eldest son, attending all his games, forecasting a great future for him and seeming not to notice that he was slighting his next in line, Tom, who was not an athlete. At the end of a year in York, the family moved north to Columbus, the easternmost point in its circuit of the state, about 80 miles from Omaha. There his dad had one more drunken smash-up. Then on Christmas morning in 1962, the Hagel boys were startled by the sobbing of their mom, who'd come home from early Mass to find her husband dead in bed at 39 of a heart attack. Chuck, just 16, imagined he had to fill the void.
 n the five years between his dad's death and his departure for Vietnam, the new man of the family was sturdy, attentive to his brothers and rudderless in his own life. His first goal, set by a football scholarship to Wayne State College, was thwarted early on when an injury left him with a pinched nerve in his neck that surgery couldn't correct. He then drifted to the University of Nebraska at Kearney (pronounced Carney) and from there, dropping out on a sudden impulse, to a school of broadcasting in Minneapolis, where he tried to support himself by going door to door near the airport, in an attempt to sign up United Airlines stewardesses for the Encyclopedia Britannica. It would be a smart investment, he'd tell them, for the children they didn't yet have. ''Well, I did make some sales,'' the senator said. 
 When his number came up at the draft board in January 1967, he went willingly. And when, after training, he received orders to go to Germany, he requested a transfer to Vietnam. He hadn't been touched by anti-war protests. Where he came from, the feeling was that if there was a war on, that's where a young American soldier belonged. In that reflex, which many would still call patriotic, he briefly found a purpose. 
 It's unclear to the two brothers today how they wound up in the same infantry squad. Tom, drafted as soon as he finished high school, went initially to a reconnaissance unit up north, where he saw heavy fighting. He put in for a transfer, hoping to get closer to his brother, who was serving in the south. Soon they were on patrol together in canopied jungle near the Cambodian border. Over a period of about four weeks, each got a chance to save the other's life. When the first incident occurred, on March 28, 1968, their squad leader had just taken them off point and moved them to the middle of the column. One of the soldiers who replaced them hit a trip wire, setting off a mine that had been placed in a tree so that it would detonate at face level. Bodies, body parts and shrapnel were blasted back into the ranks as the squad was crossing a stream. Tom picked himself up and looked for his brother. What he saw, he says, was a ''geyser'' of blood gushing from Chuck's chest. Tom, then only 19, stanched the bleeding and bandaged the wound, only then noticing that he'd been hit himself in the arm. By the time the medevac choppers had taken off the dead and critically wounded, the Hagel boys were deemed well enough to continue on, which meant going off the booby-trapped trail and hacking through thick undergrowth.
 Twenty-five days later, it was Chuck's turn to rescue Tom, when their troop carrier hit a hand-detonated mine as it emerged from a village in the delta. Tom had been in the turret behind a .50-caliber machine gun. He was unconscious, not obviously alive, when his brother got to him. The blast had blown out Chuck's eardrums and severely burned his left side, but knowing the carrier might soon explode, he worked feverishly to pull Tom from the wreckage, then threw his body on top of Tom's as Vietcong fighters in ambush sprayed the area with gunfire. 
 Chuck left Vietnam in December 1968, Tom the following February. Back in Omaha, they roomed together for a time, then followed separate paths to readjustment to civilian life. Beset by nightmares and feelings of guilt that sent him off on binges, Tom had the most to get over, what seemed to be the harder time. He also had the clearest idea about the war, which seemed to him futile and cruel. Before they could get used to their new lives, their youngest brother, Jimmy, was killed in a car crash at 16, yet another piece of Hagel hard luck. 
 In his reaction to all he'd been through, Hagel mixed repression and a fierce focus on the future. He would do his best to put the war out of his mind, get through his studies finally -- he was in his third college -- and move on. ''I was probably going through something that I didn't quite understand,'' he acknowledges. ''I don't think I'm a person who doesn't reflect, because I do -- I reflect on a lot of things -- but in this case I wanted to get it behind me. . .I wanted a life.'' It happened relatively fast. Working part time as a radio reporter in Omaha, he interviewed the only Republican on the county board, John Y. McCollister, who then was elected to the House of Representatives when Hagel was about to graduate, finally, from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. The young veteran asked the new congressman for help finding a Washington job. A month later, McCollister and his wife invited their protege to stay in their home. Soon his boss was bringing him coffee in bed in the mornings and driving him to work. A year and a half after that, Hagel was his chief of staff, at 26. 
 ''It wasn't very long before he knew everyone on Capitol Hill,'' McCollister told me. ''That's the history of Chuck Hagel. He meets people easily.'' The subsequent lines on Hagel's dense resume had everything to do with this talent for getting to know people. 
 Within 10 years, as Ronald Reagan swept into the White House, he was well-enough connected in Republican circles to be made the second-ranking official of the Veterans Administration. In that capacity, he turned up as one of the main speakers at the groundbreaking for the Vietnam War Memorial. Five months later, in what might be seen as his first declaration of independence, he quit in open protest against cuts in benefits for Vietnam vets, which he'd resisted unsuccessfully. 
 The resignation opened a new chapter in his life. He would now turn his hand to making money. Cashing in his life-insurance policies and selling his car to his mother and stepfather, he managed to raise $5,000, enough to make him a partner in a batch of new companies that would compete in a lottery for licenses to set up systems for a new kind of telephone that worked without wires. The company he helped found, after stock swaps and the arrival of new partners, grew up into Vanguard Cellular Systems. By the time it went public in 1988, it had become one of the country's biggest cellphone companies, and Chuck Hagel's stake made him a wealthy man. By then he'd traveled to some 15 countries, negotiating with governments, usually unsuccessfully, for contracts to set up wireless systems. 
 He'd also married and remarried. The first marriage lasted less than two years. The Nebraska Catholic then got to know a Mississippi Baptist, Lilibet Ziller, who handled press for the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. Their search for a church where they could both be comfortable led them to St. John's Episcopal Church across from the White House, where they now worship and where their two children were baptized and confirmed. (Hagel realizes that if he were to try a national run, he might be called on to explain his choices in religion to Christian groups that are part of the conservative coalition his party has fused together. He doesn't especially like the idea. ''I don't question or critique any other politician's style, but I know who Chuck Hagel is,'' he said. ''I know what fits me, and I know what fits my wife. Religion is important to us, spirituality is important, but it's also private.'')
 His financial independence eased his return to the political sphere and made it only a question of time as to when he'd run for office. He toyed briefly with the idea of running for governor of Virginia, then returned to Nebraska in 1992, going to work for Michael McCarthy as an investment banker. One of the companies he looked after, American Information Systems -- later rechristened Election Systems and Software -- manufactured voting machines in partnership with The Omaha World-Herald, the state's biggest daily. 
 It's sometimes said that Nebraska has two Republican parties, one of which calls itself Democrat. That party had won every Senate race for two decades when Hagel started driving from town to town in 1995 to make himself known. In a state with fewer than a million voters, personal contact matters. Dick Robinson, who runs a steel company in the town of Norfolk, said he'd never heard of his visitor when Hagel dropped by to ask for his support. Ten years later, in his skybox at the always-sold-out stadium in Lincoln where the University of Nebraska plays football, Robinson seemed glad to have a distraction from a game the once-indomitable Huskers were giving away to Oklahoma. ''It was great to meet a politician who could look you in the eye and say, 'I disagree,' '' he said. ''We've been fast friends ever since.'' 
 although their state is one of the two or three most lopsidedly Republican in presidential voting, Nebraskans cling to the notion that their wide open spaces -- populated by nearly four times as many cattle as people -- nurture a spirit of political independence, an indifference to partisanship. Bob Kerrey, a Democrat who couldn't help calling President Clinton ''an unusually good liar,'' is the most recent example. George Norris, a Senate titan for three decades, supported Al Smith in 1928 and Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 against Herbert Hoover while still a Republican, writing an article for Liberty magazine entitled, ''Why I Am a Better Republican Than President Hoover.'' 
 Chuck Hagel isn't likely to go that far. Having resided full time in Nebraska for only 7 of the last 34 years, he's not apt, in any event, to present himself as a Prairie independent. Viewing himself as a self-made man who started out with nothing besides his own inner resources, he has neither broken with his party nor allowed it to define him. Nor did he wait for his party to decide when it was his turn. 
 In 1996, in his first race, he took on a Republican attorney general in the Senate primary and won by nearly two to one. In the general election, he upset a popular Democratic governor, Ben Nelson, by a margin of 14 percentage points. Realizing too late that he was trailing, Nelson ran attack ads portraying Hagel as a Washington insider who'd used his connections to enrich himself in the cellphone business. Hagel had earlier resisted demands by Alfonse D'Amato of New York, then chairman of the Republican campaign committee in the Senate, that he order up a series of attack ads by a favorite D'Amato demolition specialist. 
 Stung by Nelson's barrage, Hagel countered with an ad in The Omaha World-Herald calling them ''the most scurrilous and false attacks ever made in Nebraska politics.'' Not the forgiving sort, he has never quite forgotten his grudge against Nelson, who, for the last five years, has been the state's junior senator. Senator Nelson has since been heard to ask how it could be that he managed to get over a big loss while his colleague has yet to get over a big win.
 In the blogosphere, where conspiracy theories enjoy a certain immortality, the scale of Hagel's upset victories in 1996 made him an object of suspicion after the Florida voting fiasco of 2000. Here was a virtual unknown who'd once been an officer of a company that made the voting machines on which most ballots were cast in Nebraska. But these were scanners, not digital counters; paper ballots survived, available for a recount that neither of his rivals sought. (When he ran for re-election in 2002, he won even bigger, capturing 83 percent of the vote, a Nebraska record. Out on the Web, suspicion lived on.) 
 What Hagel thought he'd showed in his face-offs with Nelson and D'Amato -- who'd called him a ''prima donna'' (and then some) -- was that heavy reliance on attack ads wasn't a winning strategy. After not quite two years in the Senate, he put himself up for the campaign committee's chairmanship, sending around a manifesto to his colleagues that promised to thin the ranks of consultants as a step toward cleansing ''the political culture in America by 'defining up' the standards of debate, political discourse and campaigns.'' It was a direct challenge to the leadership, which he accused of running ''issueless campaigns.'' And it flopped. His colleagues weren't responsive to his musings on the state of the political culture. They decided that winning was still ''the only thing,'' voting 39-13 in favor of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Not for the last time, Hagel's position was shown to be lonelier than he'd realized.
 He may not have become a leader of his caucus, but, to the likely dismay of the White House, he's also not an outcast. On a personal level, he's still a man who forges connections. In addition to John McCain, he gets along well with the chairmen of his key committees -- Pat Roberts of Kansas on Intelligence and Richard Lugar of Indiana on Foreign Relations -- and counts Democrats Joe Biden of Delaware and Jack Reed of Rhode Island as among his best friends on the Hill. ''I've been in the Senate a long time, and there's nobody I've liked more than Chuck Hagel,'' Biden told me. 
 By the time of his loss to McConnell, Hagel had nearly persuaded himself that he felt a fresh breeze blowing in the party from Austin, Tex., which he'd visited in April 1998 for a laid-back overnight at the governor's mansion that included a meandering walk through the gardens with his host, a quiet dinner with just George and Laura Bush, then more talk on an upstairs porch. It was the first real encounter between the two and the most time they'd ever spend together. 
 He found Bush ''a very charming, gregarious person,'' and when, several months later, on a swing through Nebraska, he was asked whom he liked as the next Republican nominee, he all but endorsed the Texan, citing his name recognition, success in a big state, age and conservative profile. 
 It proved to be the first time that Bush learned he could not take Chuck Hagel for granted. Before long, John McCain knocked on the Nebraskan's door, divulged his own ambitions and asked his friend to be co-chairman of his campaign. Hagel had to know there were differences in temperament and outlook between himself and McCain, who was more moralistic about international issues, less fascinated by the intricacies of diplomacy, more inclined, perhaps, to brandish military power. But in the Clinton years, these did not loom large. He knew the senator far better than he knew Bush -- who was pretty much a blank on national-security issues anyway -- and admired him, above all, for his readiness to take lonely stands.
 He was sitting with McCain when the South Carolina primary returns came in following a campaign in which McCain's mental stability was questioned and calls were made to likely Republican voters telling them the former P.O.W. and his wife had a black baby, without mentioning that the little girl had been adopted at an orphanage in Bangladesh. Reached by Don Walton, the respected political reporter of The Lincoln Star Journal, Hagel said Bush had ''sold his soul to the right wing.'' He called it ''the filthiest campaign I've ever seen.''
 ''I'd say the same thing today,'' he said when I asked about South Carolina, nearly six years later. 
 Considering how he'd disappointed Bush after the attention lavished on him in Austin and what he'd said about South Carolina, it's remarkable that Senator Hagel then found himself on the short list for running mate in 2000. To this day, he doesn't know whether he was seriously in contention. Possibly there was some thought that the former member of the Texas Air National Guard could benefit by picking, or at least appearing to consider, a twice-wounded Vietnam vet. Hagel says he spent $15,000 on accountant fees assembling the information the campaign demanded. Dick Cheney, the chief talent scout, interviewed him twice and sent his son-in-law around to pick up a box of documents before it was discovered that the talent scout was actually the talent. 
 ''I still have the box,'' Hagel said. Nothing could be more unanswerable than the question of what might have happened in Iraq had he been picked. It's a testament to the vice president's influence that it even occurs.
 hagel had been to Iraq four times by the time Cheney paid his first visit as vice president in December 2005. Today the war is so much in the front of the senator's mind that it pops into just about any answer he gives to a political question, sometimes more than once. When I asked whether he saw himself as a maverick, his reply boiled down to saying he was a consistent conservative. But here's how it began: ''When I think of issues like Iraq, of how we went into it -- no planning, no preparation, no sense of consequences, of where we were going, how we were going to get out, went in without enough men, no exit strategy, those kind of things -- I'll speak out, I'll go against my party.'' 
 A minute later, still chewing on the same question, Hagel was relating the retort of a Nebraska friend to a Republican who'd complained that the senator was still out of step with the president. Pretty much the same litany then tumbled out as, speaking in what was supposed to be the friend's voice, Hagel went on: ''Who's the conservative here? Who votes against the Medicare reform bill, who votes against No Child Left Behind, who votes against the farm bill, who's opposed to invading another country, occupying another country, with no plans, no exit strategy and not enough troops? Now you tell me who the conservative is.'' 
 The trouble with Iraq as an identifying issue for a potential candidate today is that practically everyone except Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Congressman John Murtha of Pennsylvania, who have flirted with the idea of a deadline for withdrawal, purports to be in essentially the same position with regard to what needs to be happen: hoping that the insurgency will wane, that the Sunnis will somehow be mollified, that the number of U.S. troops can be drawn down this year, that Iraqis will be able to finish the war, more or less on their own. Everyone, for the moment, includes George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Hagel. Some are more hopeful (Bush), and some decidedly less (Hagel). No one now can really know how Iraq will play out in our politics.
 It's not, in any case, an issue on which Hagel can easily ''position'' himself the way most senators who are not satisfied with being senators would. As this least partisan Republican stews on his decision on whether to go national with his sense of frustration, he has to know that his independence and forthrightness, the qualities that so far have defined him, are also his most obvious limitations in the roughhouse game of presidential politics as we know it. A candidate who worries about the price he may have to pay for anything he says would not have called for active engagement with Iran and Cuba as Hagel has regularly done in foreign-policy speeches over the last several years. And he would probably not be displaying, as Hagel has recently done, a newfound sensitivity on civil liberties matters. Through the end of 2004, Hagel's rating on the legislative scorecard of the American Civil Liberties Union was an anemic 22 percent. But at the end of December, as Congress rushed to adjourn, he was one of only four Republican senators whose votes held up an extension of the Patriot Act, arguing for checks on federal powers to invade homes and private records that had passed the Senate unanimously but then had been dropped in conference.
 ''When government continues to erode individual rights, that's the most dangerous, dangerous threat to freedom there is,'' he said, calling it ''far more dangerous than terrorism.'' His reaction was similarly sharp when he first heard of the report in this newspaper that the president had claimed authority to order domestic wiretapping without court approval. ''If, in fact, this is true,'' he said, ''then it needs to stop.'' When the White House acknowledged it was true, Hagel pressed for Congressional hearings and a national debate. ''I think Congress has failed the country in many ways,'' he said at a forum in California last month. One way was to allow the administration ''to completely overpower the debate based on, 'I'm the commander in chief, and I know what's best.' ''
 As he road-tests themes for a possible campaign, he argues that his party is running low on ideas for the country's future, so fixated has it been on the threat of terrorism and maintaining itself in power. The importance of terrorism can't be minimized, he hastens to say, but through neglect of research and infrastructure, through failures in education, the country is losing its edge in a competitive world economy. Sure, globalization causes dislocations, this devout free trader and new-economy entrepreneur says, and, sure, the rise of China presents problems, but these are facts of life ''that we are not going to unwind.'' Forty-six years after a senator last made it directly to the White House, he gropes for words in which to talk about national purpose, about a Manhattan Project for alternate energy sources, about getting the country moving again. These themes are in the air; President Bush latched onto them in his State of the Union address in January.
 Earlier in the month, Hagel had already tried them out at a breakfast talk to a conservative group in Orange County, Calif. The breakfast had opened with an invocation in which ''the vision of a former lifeguard called Dutch'' and the American engagement in Iraq had been gratefully cited as part of ''God's plan'' to spread freedom around the globe. That left Hagel sounding a little impious when he gave his cool assessment of the venture on the Euphrates. Iraq may yet work out, he said. ''I don't think it will, but it may.'' But as for the conservative revolution in America, ''Where,'' he asked, ''is Phase 2?''
 The audience -- youngish businessfolk who had formed a new political action committee called Atlas, after Ayn Rand's paean to competitiveness, ''Atlas Shrugged'' -- seemed mildly appreciative rather than shocked.
 ''This administration has kept America on such a narrow ledge,'' he remarked after the talk. ''Everything is terrorism.'' 
 In Washington, I asked Senator McCain whether he saw his pal next door as a serious candidate in 2008. The senator, who rode a campaign bus he called the Straight Talk Express in 2000, knows something about the advantages and disadvantages of candor in a national campaign. In this instance he either misconstrued or sidestepped my question. He replied that Hagel was definitely serious, one of the two, three or four leading voices on national security and foreign policy in the Senate. ''Chuck really works at it,'' he said.
 McCain was an early enthusiast for the war in Iraq, Hagel an early skeptic. Could he imagine the co-chairman of his first national race having a place on a McCain ticket or in a McCain administration? I asked. ''I'd be honored to have Chuck with me in any capacity,'' McCain replied. ''He'd make a great secretary of state.'' 
 Propriety and common sense argue that it's too early to place such bets. Hagel isn't ready to have the conversation with McCain that he knows he'll have to have. He's still at the stage of testing audience responses, of looking into faces to see if they give back any hint of encouragement, even recognition. ''Hello,'' he'll say, sticking out his hand to a receptionist or a registration clerk, ''I'm Senator Chuck Hagel.'' He has done it often enough to know that the likely response is a blank stare, but still he persists as he travels beyond Washington and Nebraska, to Los Angeles, New York, Iowa, New Hampshire, even McCain territory -- he had a fund-raiser in Phoenix last month -- trying to identify potential donors and supporters.
 Whatever he concludes, he promises he'll go on saying what he thinks a senator should say about issues as they arise. ''I don't have to be president; I don't have to be a senator,'' he said over dinner in an Omaha steakhouse. ''I have to live with myself.'' More striking than the words was the urgency with which he spoke them. He seemed to be speaking more to himself than his companions, as if repeating a vow. Of course, we know, or think we know, that people who don't have to be president are unlikely to get the chance.

HEADLINE: Trying to Get a Read On Amazon's Books

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is a historian and author based in Silicon Valley. E-mail: ddomain@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
TALK to Wall Street analysts who cover the Internet, and one company stands out as the least forthcoming, most furtive, least transparent and most difficult to work with -- and it isn't Google.
 It's Amazon.com.
Yes, Google has a bad-boy reputation for refusing, as a matter of principle, to give Wall Street forward-looking guidance. But the company offers more detailed information than Amazon about its actual operations. By contrast, Amazon is happy to talk about future projections, but it appears to hate to talk about the present.
 Amazon.com's shareholders, who are starved for information that would be helpful in understanding the many different businesses the company is in, have endured more than their fair share of periodic disappointments. This month, Amazon released its fourth-quarter results, and, again, unwelcome surprises arrived: earnings fell 43 percent from the period a year earlier. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of declining profits, versus year-earlier figures.
 At the same time, Amazon vowed to continue heavy expenditures on Web site development and free-shipping programs for shoppers. Rather than telling jittery shareholders how these investments have produced encouraging results so far, the company did as it is wont to do: it sidestepped the questions and cheerily asked everyone to trust that all was well, then dropped the blackout curtains. 
 A sizable number of investors have lost patience and bailed. As of the close of business on Friday, the stock had fallen 22 percent from its recent holiday-season high.
 All companies are protective of whatever they regard as their secret sauce. But that does not impede disclosure of the essential outlines of operations to Wall Street. In the case of Amazon, however, granularity of detail essential for understanding basic facts about its business is missing. 
 About 28 percent of Amazon's unit sales volume, for example, comes not from its own shelves, but from its third-party sellers. That side business is very profitable, said Jim Friedland, an analyst at SG Cowen & Company. Yet Mr. Friedland can only guess how much this business contributes to the company's bottom line, because Amazon does not say. 
 Amazon has also developed another interesting side business in providing e-commerce technology for partners like Target. The royalties earned from these activities -- rough estimates, of course, in the absence of disclosures from Amazon -- probably contribute significantly to profits. 
 Mr. Friedland suggested that if one were to strip away the third-party sales and technology partnerships and just look at Amazon selling its own inventory, ''I wouldn't be surprised if the core business was running at break-even.'' Depending on the size of those sidelines, the core Amazon store may even be losing money, he said. Who knows?
 The Amazon experiment has been under way since 1995, and its core business is taking a good while to fulfill its promise. It has grown from books to products in 35 categories, but most of the original elements of the business model are intact: attract customers with a deep inventory that no retail store can match, offer discounted prices, provide easy navigation and whisk customers through a trouble-free checkout process that is the best in the business.
 One important assumption has fallen by the wayside: unburdened by the weight of a network of retail stores, the company was supposed to enjoy low operational costs and good margins. Geography turned out to be a spoiler. A single centralized distribution center in Seattle meant that many customers found that a speedy one-click purchase online would be followed by a frustrating wait offline for the order to arrive. To reduce delivery times, Amazon had to make colossal investments building a network of distribution centers -- 15 in North America alone. Amazon ''is not as efficient'' as the most efficient offline retailers, said Scott W. Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus in Manassas, Va. 
 Amazon has turned out to be an expensive operation to run, not only because of those distribution centers but also because of heavy subsidization of shipping that insulates customers from the actual costs. Quirky consumer psychology makes this necessary. 
 ''Academic research shows pretty convincingly that people have separate accounts in mind, one for the item itself and one for shipping,'' said John Morgan, an economist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. Using eBay auctions as his real-world laboratory, he showed that changing the ratio of item price to shipping charge, while keeping the total price constant, produces sharply different customer responses.
 On eBay, Mr. Morgan found that bidders happily accepted outrageously high shipping charges if they thought they were getting a good deal on the item price of a used CD. Amazon, however, faces the opposite problem: its customers accord more weight to the shipping charge, even if modest, than to the discount on the item itself. Why should this be? Perhaps it is the online customer's chafing at being asked to pay for the privilege of waiting for a delivery.
 Amazon.com recognized this early. Its first offers of free shipping go back to the holiday season of 2000, when orders of more than $99 qualified. By 2003, the minimum qualifying order had been lowered to $25. The only catch was that the free shipping entailed ground shipment that could be awfully slow. For Amazon, the cost of doing business shot upward. In 1999, the company made a $12 million net profit on shipping; by 2004, shipping was a $197 million loss. 
 A year ago, Amazon offered a new twist: a membership plan called Amazon Prime, which charges a flat $79 a year and offers free two-day delivery with no minimum order size, as long as the items are sold by Amazon and not by its third-party partners. Members can also opt for next-day delivery for only $3.99 for each shipment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the company is handing out trial offers to just about everyone. (Amazon, of course, will not discuss it.)
 This month, the company had its first opportunity to report on Amazon Prime's contribution to crucial holiday-season sales in the fourth quarter. As is its nature, the company disclosed little but its desire to have the program hailed as a success. Amazon.com's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, said that ''Amazon Prime members are shopping more and doing more cross-shopping,'' but he did not provide the information necessary to judge whether those sales were profitable for the company.
 Mr. Morgan drew a distinction between the free-shipping offer that requires a $25 minimum order -- and encourages customers to make incremental purchases they would not otherwise make in order to qualify -- and the no-minimum premise of Amazon Prime, which may turn out to increase Amazon's costs because members will have no compunction about ordering single, low-dollar-value items whenever they wish, without bunching the orders.
 If Amazon Prime has brought in additional purchases, it's hard to see. Revenue growth for the holiday quarter was 17 percent, conspicuously smaller than the 31 percent in the year-earlier quarter, when Amazon Prime did not yet exist. It appears that Amazon Prime has not attracted much interest among consumers, perhaps because they are reluctant to make a large upfront bet about how often they will use the service.
 No one outside the company knows how Amazon Prime is faring on its first anniversary because Amazon is not telling. In response to questions, the company wouldn't say how many members it had signed up -- or give the average size of members' orders. And though the company says it saved customers $475 million on shipping in 2005, it does not say how much of that was reaped by Amazon Prime members, rather than by those placing the $25-plus orders. 
 THE company did offer this nugget in its quarterly report: ''Subscriptions to Amazon Prime more than doubled from November to December.'' This appears to say more than it does. ''Without a baseline, it doesn't mean anything,'' Mr. Friedland at SG Cowen said. If Amazon Prime's membership was only, say, 10,000, then growing to 20,000 ''isn't big enough to move the needle,'' he added.
 Safa Rashtchy, a managing director at Piper Jaffray, described Amazon's incomplete factoid about doubling membership as ''typical of Amazon's disclosures -- most of the numbers that they give out are not useful.'' The company's practice of not disclosing basic information, Mr. Rashtchy warned prospective investors, ''increases the risk of owning the stock.''
 Amazon's management makes much ado about claimed progress without disclosing essential facts. Last week, it again offered a grammatically complete but mathematically incomplete sentence: ''Fourth-quarter 2005 jewelry sales increased more than 100 percent year-to-year.'' Again, no baseline. 
 Something in Amazon's secretive investor relations office has wafted through the air into its customer service department. The company has long provided a toll-free number for customers who want to speak with a human representative to solve a problem. Yet it does not mention the number on any help page on its site. 
 If this guess-our-phone-number game is intended to curtail calls and to keep associated costs low, it seems unlikely to thwart anyone. A search for ''Amazon 800 number'' takes Google's servers an eighth of a second to produce 3.3 million results.

HEADLINE: Good News May Land With a Thud 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
TRADERS will have a lot of information served to them this week, but in the opinion of Mike Williams, a strategist at Tocqueville Asset Management, they will find little of it palatable. 
 Reports on consumer activity (retail sales and consumer confidence), manufacturing (industrial production and capacity utilization) and the housing market (housing starts and building permits) will follow one another in quick succession, beginning on Tuesday.
Mr. Williams foresees readings ranging from neutral to favorable, showing a resumption of healthy economic growth after a subdued fourth quarter. But he is concerned that Wall Street will make the worst of a good situation and sell on the news.
 One of the rosiest reports could be the snapshot of January retail sales, due Tuesday. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts an increase of 0.9 percent. Mr. Williams predicts a higher number, seeing ''a bit of a rebound'' from smaller gains in previous months. 
 When January wholesale prices are announced Friday, ''there may be a bit of elevation,'' he said, but only a bit. ''We've never been believers that we have an inflation problem,'' he added. As for the real estate market, he said, ''everybody already expects a slowdown in housing, and they'll get what they expect.''
 Over all, he anticipates a benign set of numbers, but he warns that stocks may decline when some of them are announced because investors are unsure of what they should worry about.
 After a fourth-quarter ''speed bump,'' in which economic output increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, investors have worried that growth is weakening, he said. He does not share that concern, describing the economy as one of ''sustainable growth, with many sectors operating at full strength.''
 Yet as evidence arrives confirming his view, he said, it may stir fear that the Federal Reserve, in Ben S. Bernanke's first weeks as chairman, is not nearly as inclined to stop raising interest rates as many people think. ''The market's in a no-win situation,'' Mr. Williams said. ''I don't see any real headway in the overall picture. Until Bernanke says it's finished, people are going to be afraid of strong economic numbers.''

DATA WATCH -- A mixed picture of January manufacturing is expected to emerge on Wednesday. The Bloomberg poll forecasts a 0.2 percent increase in industrial production after a 0.6 percent gain in December. Capacity utilization is expected to edge up to 80.8 percent, from 80.7 percent.
 No more clarity is expected from housing reports the next day. Housing starts are estimated to have run at an annual rate of 2.03 million units in January, up from 1.93 million in December. Building permits are thought to have dipped to an annual rate of 2.070 million, from 2.075 million.
 The University of Michigan's initial reading of February consumer confidence is due Friday. The Bloomberg poll predicts a drop to 91, from 91.2 in January.

HEADLINE: Cracking the Tax Code

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ANYONE who thinks that the federal income tax code is baffling now ought to brace for what lies ahead: big changes and uncertainty.
 To many, any change may sound like welcome news. What kind of income tax system could be more incomprehensible and more riddled with special preferences than the current one?
But the main reason for change may be more unsettling. Never before has so much of the income tax code consisted of temporary measures. And never before has it been so inherently unsustainable. 
 Virtually all of President Bush's tax cuts and credits -- the lower rates, the child tax credit, the special breaks for married couples and the lower tax rates on investment income -- are set to expire by 2011. 
 That might not be a huge problem in itself. Mr. Bush and his Republican allies have vowed to make the tax cuts permanent, at a cost of $1.3 trillion over 10 years.
 But the huge volume of expiring tax cuts is set to collide with an equally expensive challenge that neither Mr. Bush nor the Congress has started to address.
 That problem is the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T. -- a tax that was originally aimed at only the very richest people but is now set to impose big tax increases on tens of millions of middle-income families over the next few years.
 Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders in both parties have vowed to prevent that tax increase. But the cost would be more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years -- almost identical to the cost of preserving the president's tax cuts. 
 That leaves taxpayers looking at several possibilities. If Mr. Bush's tax cuts are extended, but the A.M.T. is unchanged, tens of millions of people will face big new surcharges.
 If the alternative tax is frozen or simply repealed, Congress is likely to make up for the lost money by cutting back or eliminating scores of other tax breaks.
 If Congress lets Mr. Bush's tax cuts expire, regular tax rates are likely to shoot up sharply but the A.M.T. may become fairly easy to repeal.
 At the moment, neither Mr. Bush nor Congress is proposing any of those options. Instead, both Congressional and White House budget plans assume that the alternative minimum tax will generate hundreds of billions in extra revenue.
 In a sign of growing paralysis, House and Senate Republicans have also been increasingly unable to agree on any long-term tax plan. Far from making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent, they are now struggling just to extend today's tax breaks for another year or two.
 ''The process itself is really broken,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and author of numerous books on tax policy. ''It presents people with a very misleading picture of what's going on. You have increases in spending without tax revenues to pay for them, and you have tax increases that won't occur.'' 
 Mr. Bush and top administration officials contend that they want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax as part of a top-to-bottom overhaul of the income tax.
 But Mr. Bush has all but abandoned any effort at tax reform in 2006, even though he listed it as a top priority just one year ago. 
 Mr. Bush omitted any mention of the issue in his State of the Union address on Jan. 31, and the White House has been silent about the detailed proposals made last fall by his handpicked advisory council on tax reform.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, defending Mr. Bush's other tax proposals at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, flatly refused to hint at when the administration would propose a broader overhaul. 
 ''I think it's best for me to refrain from offering thoughts on that until we pull together our total package'' and are in a position to present it to the president, Mr. Snow said. 
 To be sure, Congress has a long history of passing supposedly temporary tax breaks that are routinely extended year after year. But where temporary provisions were once a sideline issue, they are now the dominant feature of the tax code.
 That is a result of a deliberate decision by the White House and Republican leaders in Congress to have the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 expire by 2011.
 Part of the reason was procedural: temporary tax cuts can be part of a budget ''reconciliation'' bill, which can pass the Senate with only 51 votes rather than the 60 votes needed to stop a filibuster.
 But Republican lawmakers also saw political advantages. Temporary tax cuts look cheaper than permanent cuts. And many Republicans delighted in voting for the same tax cuts year after year.
 ''What started to happen in 2001 was qualitatively different,'' said Joel B. Slemrod, a professor of tax policy at the University of Michigan. ''Part of it was to fit the letter of the law into the budget rules, and part of it was calculated to keep issues on the agenda that were to the Republicans' favor.''
 Whatever the reasons, virtually all the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 and scores of other tax breaks are set to expire by 2011. The list is long and expensive. Among the biggest items are these:
 The rate reductions for people at every income level; these cuts would cost more than $100 billion a year to extend.
 The tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains, which expire at the end of 2008; an extension of these cuts would cost more than $20 billion a year
 The $1,000 child tax credit, which would cost $35 billion a year to extend.
 Repeal of the estate tax on inheritances, which would cost more than $50 billion a year to extend.
 Mr. Bush and Republican leaders have pushed to make permanent all the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. But that goal will compete directly with a long list of other promises, the biggest of which is to freeze or simply repeal the alternative minimum tax. 
 If the law is left unchanged, about 15 million additional families will face the alternative tax in 2006, and their collective tax increase will be more than $30 billion for this year alone, according to government estimates. 
 Those amounts climb even higher in each subsequent year and would total $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.
 Simply keeping the alternative minimum tax at its 2005 level would cost taxpayers nearly $100 billion in 2010 and more than $200 billion in 2015, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
 To glimpse the difficulty of the tax choices ahead, look no further than the struggle this month among House and Senate Republicans to extend just a small collection of expiring tax breaks.
 President Bush had placed special urgency on permanently extending his tax cut on stock dividends.
 But Republican leaders have not come close to that goal. The Republican-led Senate passed a $60 billion package that omitted any extension of the tax cut on stock dividends, which does not expire until 2008, in order to keep the A.M.T. from rising in 2006.
 Restraining the alternative minimum tax for just one year will cost about $34 billion, while extending the dividend tax cut alone for one year would cost about $10 billion.
 House Republicans were bolder and more willing to increase the deficit. The House passed a $90 billion package of separate laws that included a two-year extension of the dividend tax cut and a one-year fix for the A.M.T.
 House and Senate leaders are still locked in a struggle over their rival approaches. But even if they agree on $90 billion worth of tax-cut extensions, they will face bigger quandaries next year.
 Politically, that means that fewer and fewer tax breaks will be considered too sacred to sacrifice. It also means that tax breaks benefiting those with less political power could be at greater risk.
 Scores of other expiring tax breaks for middle-class and lower-income people could face challenges as well. Among them are a tax deduction for parents who pay college tuition, a tax deduction for schoolteachers who buy classroom supplies, and tax credits for hiring workers in areas of high unemployment.
 As the competition to save endangered tax breaks grows more intense, survival is likely to go to the fittest.

HEADLINE: When Moving a Mountain Is No Longer an Act of God

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:

Lost Mountain
A Year in the Vanishing Wilderness
Radical Strip Mining and the Devastation of Appalachia
By Erik Reece
250 pages. Illustrated.
Riverhead Books. $24.95.
 In the course of his research for this book about the consequences of coal mining in Eastern Kentucky, Erik Reece arranged to join state regulators for a tour of one site. He encountered a representative of International Coal Group, the company that operated the mine. Mr. Reece had filed a citizen's complaint about the effects of blasting on a creek nearby.
''We shook hands grimly and I tried to explain that I had nothing personal against his company -- that I chose to write about this mine site because I just liked the name Lost Mountain,'' Mr. Reece reports. 
 ''Lucky us,'' the mining executive replied.
 Mr. Reece was studying the systematic removal of mountaintops in places where radical strip mining occurs. To fly over this part of Eastern Kentucky, he says, is to view a gray, cratered landscape where a cemetery (which is mining-exempt) provides the rare touch of green. In the course of a year, he chose a particular spot and watched its step-by-step destruction. ''It may be too obvious an irony that this particular ridge was called Lost Mountain,'' he writes. It may be too obvious. But it gave ''Lost Mountain'' a title just the same.
 ''Lost Mountain'' emerged from a summer environmental-writing program run by the University of Kentucky, where Mr. Reece teaches. His experience yielded a prize-winning article for Harper's magazine, and that led to this book. As evidence that not all log-rolling is done by mountain-clearing bulldozers, Mr. Reece's book has been cited approvingly by Bobbie Ann Mason, his colleague at the University of Kentucky. She is also the editor of ''Missing Mountains,'' an anthology about mountaintop removal. 
 ''Lost Mountain'' is assembled as a string of troubling anecdotes and encounters, held together by the author's desire to affirm what he already knows. It's possible to share Mr. Reece's dismay and outrage while also wishing that his book had been more sharply focused.
 ''Lost Mountain'' was edited by Sean McDonald, best known lately as James Frey's editor, but also the editor of episodic, glibly conceptual nonfiction by Steven Johnson (''Everything Bad is Good For You'') and John Crawford (''The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell).'' In similar fashion, ''Lost Mountain'' zeroes in on a riveting, important subject and then roams all over the map. Mr. Reece's conviction is never in question. But his book feels more like extended journalistic glimpses than a fully developed exploration. 
 By way of creating a structure for ''Lost Mountain,'' Mr. Reece describes monthly hikes, each one revealing that the landscape has been further nibbled away. He mentions indigenous flora and fauna, using mining-made dangers to their survival to illustrate larger points. (''In this way, the unassuming liverwort dramatizes one of the issues at the heart of mountaintop removal.'') 
 And he talks to Kentucky residents who are suffering the brunt of strip-mining's consequences and face governmental and corporate brush-offs that are truly Kafkaesque. Has a trailer near a mine site begun to tilt? ''You've got an old trailer.'' Has blasting damaged the roof of the church? ''You've got an old roof.'' 
 It's true that Mr. Reece has a lot of ground to cover. He addresses the economics of mountaintop removal. There is vast environmental peril to describe. He explores the expedient use of Appalachia by politicians of many stripes, beginning with President Lyndon Johnson and his War on Poverty, all of them realizing that poverty has public relations value. ''Hollows look enough like suburbs to Northerners,'' he is told by Greg Howard, director of the grassroots arts center Appalshop. ''Poor white children look enough like their own kids.'' 
 Mr. Reece dissects unholy alliances between politicians and the coal industry. He considers the effects of voracious globalism and suggests alternatives to a coal-based Kentucky economy. He advocates that other kinds of Kentucky-based industry (like furniture-making) be encouraged. He underscores the urgency of sustainable forest management. And he suggests that taxes reflect the true social and environmental costs of coal. Why? Because, as a woman who grew up in Harlan County puts it: ''We all live downstream.'' 
 When Barbara Kopple's documentary ''Harlan County, U.S.A.'' was released in 1976, it depicted a fierce union struggle on the part of coal miners who worked underground. ''Lost Mountain'' argues persuasively that these dire conditions have only gotten worse. Beyond the catastrophic underground accidents that still take lives, the mountaintop mining described here inflicts much more onerous long-term damage. And it's done so easily, Mr. Reece says, ''It doesn't take a whole lot of faith to move mountains; it takes about 10 men and a company called Caterpillar.'' 
 At such moments, the anger of ''Lost Mountain'' is clear. It would have been clearer if the book avoided repeating itself, ascribed its facts more carefully (notes on sources are sketchy) and relied less on generalizations. Still, Mr. Reece ultimately makes his impressions all too believable. No wonder some Eastern Kentuckians were skeptical about Neil Armstrong's 1969 walk on the moon. They thought NASA had put Mr. Armstrong in a space suit and photographed him at a strip mine.

HEADLINE: It's Like Lending to a Friend, Except You'll Get Interest

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
THE Internet has become a great place to track down friends -- or friends of friends -- for advice or for a date. Now you can ask them for money, too. Prosper.com, a start-up company based in San Francisco, started operations last week, offering a mixed brew of eBay, Friendster and the local bank.
 Prosper's users lend money to and borrow money from other people on the site at what the company says are better interest rates than those available through traditional financial institutions and without some of the risk that comes from typical person-to-person loans. 
''We looked at eBay and said, 'Why can't we do this for money?' '' said Chris Larsen, Prosper's chief executive.
 Mr. Larsen, who founded and led E-Loan, an online lender that was bought last year for $300 million by Popular Inc., says Prosper could save borrowers and lenders money because it was a leaner operation than traditional financial institutions. He noted that consumers make, at most, about 4 percent on their savings accounts, which banks then lend to credit card customers at 14 percent or more. 
 ''That's just a huge spread,'' Mr. Larsen said. ''We think if you allow people to participate directly, it's a more efficient marketplace. People can make a better return on their deposits, which then become the source of credit to others.''
 On Prosper.com, prospective borrowers register with the site and allow the company to review their credit history. Then borrowers post a loan request of up to $25,000, along with an upper limit for the amount of interest they are willing to pay. Loans are not secured by collateral and are paid off over three years at a fixed rate, with no prepayment penalty.
 Lenders essentially deposit their money with Prosper -- which holds it in an interest-bearing account with Wells Fargo -- and either review the loan requests individually or fill out a form permitting Prosper to allocate money to borrowers who meet certain criteria. 
 Chief among those criteria is the borrower's rating from the credit reporting bureau Experian, but borrowers can also join or create groups with defined interests or characteristics that, they hope, will make them more attractive to some lenders.
 Among the groups on Prosper are aficionados of the Porsche 914 model, associates and employees of a Berkeley cafe and Vietnamese-American students. Borrowers, who typically post their loan requests and any group affiliation, along with a description of who they are and why they need the money, then wait a maximum of two weeks for lenders to bid in ever-lower interest increments for the right to issue the loan.
 To help lenders minimize risk, Prosper permits them to finance just part of a given loan, so a typical lender may offer, say, $100 at 6.5 percent interest toward a loan to someone with excellent credit.
 Once the bidding is complete, and if enough lenders bid enough money to finance the loan at a single rate acceptable to the borrower, Prosper transfers the money to the borrower's account and establishes a monthly repayment system that withdraws money from the borrower's checking account. (Should a borrower default, Prosper hires a collection company on the lender's behalf and alerts credit bureaus.) 
 Prosper makes money by charging borrowers 1 percent of the loan amount, while lenders pay 0.5 percent of the loan's balance each year.
 The community aspect of the site, Mr. Larsen said, is an important component. ''It's satisfying to place money in little bits with people who have stories, and in groups that you know and trust and want to support,'' he said. ''And if you're part of a group, the theory is that you'll perform better as a borrower than if it was some disconnected credit card company.''
 Some prominent venture capital firms, including Accel Partners and Benchmark Capital, have rallied around the idea. Jim Breyer, an Accel partner who serves on the board of Wal-Mart Stores, is a Prosper director, as is Bob Kagle, a general partner at Benchmark, who also serves on eBay's board.
 Mr. Larsen said the site's two-month testing period went well, and as of last week, Prosper had attracted lenders with a total of about $750,000 to lend.
 Although Prosper is among the first to try this business in the United States, the idea has a track record abroad. Zopa.com, which operates in Britain, introduced a similar service in March (also with backing from Benchmark Capital) and has attracted more than 50,000 registered users, said Richard Duvall, Zopa's chief executive. At any given time, he said, about 15 percent of the users are either lending or borrowing money.
 Mr. Duvall would not disclose the privately held company's revenues, but said he was ''very pleased with our numbers'' -- so much so that he planned to start a site in the United States to compete with Prosper this year. Mr. Duvall said Zopa would also soon let users affiliate in groups, as Prosper does.
 According to Asaf Buchner, a financial services analyst with the Internet consultancy Jupiter Research, that component could be critical to these sites becoming profitable. 
 Mr. Buchner notes that Prosper's group leaders receive a commission on the group's lending and borrowing activities, which they sometimes share among the group.
 ''If the sites are able to recruit strong group leaders with strong affiliations, they shift the marketing burden to those people, who have the incentive to go after others to become part of the group,'' Mr. Buchner said.
 The group approach enticed at least one of Prosper's lenders, Stephen Russell, who registered with the site during its testing phase, and who is the brother of a Prosper engineer. Mr. Russell, the chief executive of a San Francisco technology company, 3VR Security, has put up $25,000 to invest on the site. He has also started a group to lend money to people affiliated with the Climb High Foundation, which trains women in tourist destinations to become climbing and trekking guides.
 ''I'm not just optimizing the rate of return on my assets,'' Mr. Russell said. ''It's also a way to facilitate lending that'll help women in developing countries. That takes the lending and borrowing process one step further.''

HEADLINE: Egyptian Mobile Phone Provider Treads Where Others Dare Not

BYLINE: By ABEER ALLAM; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
From an office on the 26th floor of his family's gold-domed twin towers overlooking the Nile, Naguib Sawiris, chief executive of Orascom Telecom, scans the world for opportunities to expand his telecommunications empire. He tends to find them in places others fear to tread. 
 Take, for instance, Orascom's $160 million investment in Iraqna, the first mobile phone provider in Iraq. Iraqna operates in the volatile central provinces of Baghdad, Anbar and Diyala. Its employees have been kidnapped and its outlets have been attacked, pushing the company's annual security costs to $30 million. 
But two years after it introduced service, Iraqna has 1.5 million subscribers, or 41 percent of the current Iraqi market. In the first nine months of 2005, the company generated $249 million in revenue. 
 ''Wherever the risk is high, the profits are also high,'' said Mr. Sawiris, 50, the son of an Egyptian construction magnate. ''Soon we will reach two million subscribers in our network.'' 
 The only major difference between doing business in Iraq and any other place in the world, said Mr. Sawiris, is having to negotiate with kidnappers. ''We know that calm will come one day and Iraq will be a second Saudi Arabia,'' he said. ''In the mobile telecom business, we invest where the service is needed and we can create value.''
 Iraqna is just one example of a drive by Orascom into emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East. The company has a subscriber base of 30 million people in Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Zimbabwe, among other countries. Those countries represent a market of 460 million people, but on average only 11.5 percent of them have mobile phones. 
 In 2005, the company more than doubled its subscriber base, and it is on target to reach 50 million subscribers by the end of 2006. Orascom's net income was $298 million in 2004, up 184 percent from 2003. Income in the first half of 2005 was $296 million, up 49 percent from the same period a year earlier. 
 Mr. Sawiris said he approached each market the same way, through quick decisions and network-building. In 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority, the United States-led civil administration in Iraq, awarded a two-year operating license to Orascom Telecom, one of three cellphone companies to receive licenses. Mr. Sawiris embarked on a network construction spree and an intensive advertising campaign, and dotted Iraqi cities with distributor outlets. 
 ''He has the companies that sell the network,'' said Wael Zaida, a senior analyst with EFG-Hermes, a brokerage house based in Egypt. ''He has the companies that provide the handsets. All he needed is a license to start operations.
 ''Despite the high risk involved in putting an operation in Iraq, it is the Iraqi operation that has been doing fantastically well,'' Mr. Zaida said. 
 Orascom has weathered its share of reversals, and Mr. Sawiris admits to having made some mistakes. He says that his business partner in Syria, a cousin of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, took over the partnership for his own benefit, prompting Orascom to pull up its stake and arbitrate the dispute, settling for $20 million. After similar problems in Yemen, Mr. Sawiris decided he would never again enter into partnerships with those who have close ties with a country's leadership. 
 Orascom moved into 22 countries between 1999 and 2002, but that rapid expansion led to ballooning short-term debt. Mr. Sawiris decided to sell most of Orascom's African holdings as well as its Jordanian subsidiary, Fastlink, even though it had been performing well. 
 In May, Mr. Sawiris moved into the European market, paying $3.6 billion to take control of Wind, a leading phone company in Italy. To limit Orascom's debt burden, Mr. Sawiris made a leveraged purchase by fusing personal and family funds; he created a buyout vehicle called Weather Investments in partnership with Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the American buyout specialist, and Philippe Nguyen, a French financier. 
 The Wind deal ''was an opportunity to gain a foothold in Europe,'' Mr. Sawiris said. He has also shown interest in buying TIM Hellas Telecommunications, a Greek operator. ''I am convinced that telecoms will consolidate and I do not want to sell off my companies,'' Mr. Sawiris said. ''I want to be one of these players at the end of the game.'' 
 In December 2005, Orascom paid $1.3 billion for a 19.3 percent stake in Hutchison Telecommunications International, a unit of the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. Mr. Sawiris said the deal was part of an effort to take a slice of the Southeast Asian market, which he said he wished he had entered earlier. 
 Though the strategy of investing in emerging markets is risky, other companies have taken the same path as Orascom. ''Those countries have more resources than you read, because of the gray economy and the cash economy,'' said Azmi T. Mikati, chief executive of Investcom Holding, a mobile communications provider that operates in countries like Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan. ''These countries are not as poor or as dangerous as they are portrayed.'' 
 Mr. Sawiris says that people do not fully understand the needs of his customers. ''Whether poor or rich, people still need to communicate,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Down to the Wire at Ground Zero

 BODY:
Economists and lawyers working for New York City have shown why we should be concerned that Larry Silverstein, the real estate developer who held the lease to the World Trade Center, appears to have so much control over ground zero. These analysts have waded through the agreements between Mr. Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site. They have looked at the insurance payouts to Mr. Silverstein after the buildings he had leased for only a few weeks were destroyed. And their conclusion is grim: if Gov. George Pataki fails to persuade Mr. Silverstein to cede about half of the development rights back to the Port Authority, where they belong, the former World Trade Center site might not be rebuilt for a decade, maybe much longer. 
 The city's analysis -- which has drawn a vigorous rebuttal from the Silverstein group -- estimates that the developer will run out of money before the rebuilding is finished. That could leave a large part of the area as blighted as an abandoned construction site, even though Mr. Silverstein and his partners could still reap considerable profits. The city's report estimates that even if he and his company default early, they could still walk away with as much as $500 million in fees, commissions and equity.
Mr. Silverstein's company quickly responded last week that the entire report was ''flawed.'' Yet, the city's analysis looked solid enough for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose business acumen at least rivals Mr. Silverstein's.
 The mayor's voice here is certainly needed, but Governor Pataki holds the key to these negotiations. Mr. Pataki controls $1.7 billion in Liberty Bonds that Mr. Silverstein needs to continue building commercial space on the site. The bonds are Mr. Pataki's leverage, but at this point, the governor seems to be tiptoeing around Mr. Silverstein. The developer controls the clock on rebuilding the Freedom Tower, the site's centerpiece, and Mr. Pataki desperately wants to break ground on the tower before he leaves office at the end of the year and ventures out into presidential politics.
 But such a groundbreaking would be a hollow event that would do little to increase Mr. Pataki's stature. The Freedom Tower design still needs work, and a groundbreaking would look forced -- possibly as forced as the dramatic but premature placement of the tower's cornerstone shortly before the Republican Convention a year and a half ago. Mr. Pataki should look instead to the groundbreaking for the Sept. 11 memorial, which is expected in March. The governor could couple that genuine achievement with a demonstration that he is setting the rest of the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan on the best track possible. That means settling matters now with Larry Silverstein.

HEADLINE: Shiite Alliance Votes to Retain Iraq's Premier

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi and Khalid al-Ansary contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Shiite lawmakers decided by a one-vote margin on Sunday to retain Ibrahim al-Jaafari as prime minister in Iraq's next government, after a bitter internal struggle that exposed the growing power of anti-American fundamentalists within the new Parliament.
 As the largest single bloc in the Parliament, the Shiites have the right to choose a prime minister under Iraq's Constitution, and they will now begin negotiating with the leaders of other political groups to fill out Iraq's first full-term, four-year government.
Mr. Jaafari, a moderate Islamist, has been widely criticized as a weak leader over the past year and was considered a long shot to continue in his post. But he defeated his main rival by 64 to 63 in a vote of members of the Shiite bloc on Sunday morning after gaining support from followers of Moktada al-Sadr, the renegade Shiite cleric who is outspoken in his hostility to the United States. 
 Mr. Sadr's followers now control the largest bloc of seats -- 32 of 130 -- within the Shiite alliance. They decided to vote for Mr. Jaafari after he promised to help carry out their political program, said Bahaa al-Aaraji, a member of Parliament and a spokesman for Mr. Sadr's group. 
 Mr. Aaraji would not say exactly what the prime minister had agreed to. Mr. Jaafari may also have benefited from Mr. Sadr's longstanding grudge against the religious Shiite party of Mr. Jaafari's main rival.
 But Mr. Jaafari's surprise victory illustrated the growing political power of Mr. Sadr, who led two bloody uprisings against the American occupation and the interim government in 2004 and has made it clear that he favors a prompt American withdrawal from Iraq. 
 In recent visits to Iran and Syria, Mr. Sadr has expressed solidarity with the leaders of those countries and angry opposition to American policy toward them. Mr. Sadr also commands the Mahdi Army, a broad-based militia that has been largely quiet since 2004 but is still armed and is said to be behind some recent deadly attacks on British troops in Basra.
 Until the weekend, Shiite leaders had said they expected the prime minister's job to go to Adel Abdul Mahdi, an economist and a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, or Sciri. Mr. Mahdi has a reputation for decisiveness and consensus-building, and he is more popular with Kurdish and Sunni Arab leaders than Mr. Jaafari is. But Mr. Jaafari refused to withdraw, and after efforts to achieve consensus broke down in rancor, the alliance's leaders agreed to decide the issue with a vote.
 Afterward, Shiite leaders made a show of unity at a news conference, with Mr. Mahdi congratulating and praising his rival on a podium surrounded by banners bearing Shiite religious slogans. ''It's not important who won; the important thing is that the United Iraqi Alliance stays unified,'' Mr. Jaafari said.
 A number of Iraqi leaders outside the Shiite alliance expressed surprise and concern about the selection of Mr. Jaafari and about what appeared to be the influence exercised by Mr. Sadr's followers.
 ''I was surprised and rather disappointed,'' said Adnan Pachachi, a former foreign minister and member of the secular alliance led by the former interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, that has 25 seats in the 275-member Parliament. ''If he follows what the Sadrists want, we will not be able to have a government of national unity.''
 In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice rejected the suggestion that Mr. Sadr had played a important role in the choice of prime minister. Asked about Mr. Sadr's influence, she said on the ABC News program ''This Week'' that ''Iraq is a complex place with a lot of voices'' and ''there are many forces behind the apparent election of -- or selection of Jaafari.''
 Mr. Jaafari's government has been especially unpopular with Sunni Arabs, who have accused the Interior Ministry of backing death squads that have rounded up and murdered hundreds of Sunnis in Baghdad and elsewhere in recent months. Many Sunnis have also accused Shiite militias, including Mr. Sadr's Mahdi Army, of playing roles in the killings.
 ''Jaafari failed to provide security and protect Iraqis,'' said Mahmoud al-Mashadani, a Sunni Arab and a leader of the Iraqi Accordance Front, which has the third-largest bloc in Parliament, with 44 seats. 
 Talks on forming a cabinet are still in the earliest stages, and Parliament has yet to meet. But signs of tension were already apparent on Sunday, as the president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who has often sparred with Mr. Jaafari, angrily criticized Shiite leaders for trying to exclude Mr. Allawi's group, the Iraqi National List, from the new government.
 ''We will never under any circumstances allow the Iraqi National List to be excluded from the next government,'' Mr. Talabani said, speaking at a news conference. ''Those who reject the Iraqi National List should understand that they are rejecting the Kurdish alliance as well. I say it loud and clear.''
 Some Shiite leaders had said last month that they intended to form a government in which they would share power with the main Kurdish and Sunni groups, relegating Mr. Allawi's secularists and some smaller parties to the opposition. (Under the Constitution, any group that controls two-thirds of the seats in Parliament can form a government.) But the mostly secular Kurds, who have the second-largest bloc with 53 seats, appear to be vetoing that option.
 Sunni Arab leaders also insist on a broader coalition. In the past week, the Iraqi Accordance front announced that it was teaming up with Mr. Allawi's group and a smaller Sunni Arab party to form a single negotiating bloc, the Joint Council for Patriotic Work, with 80 seats.
 The task of accommodating all these groups within a single government will now fall in large measure to Mr. Jaafari. A white-haired doctor with a quiet, apologetic manner, Mr. Jaafari, 59, fled Iraq in 1980 and spent years living in Iran, where he established close ties with Iranian leaders, like many other members of his Dawa Party.
 Since Mr. Jaafari became prime minister last year, suicide bombings and assassinations have surged and oil production and exports have plummeted. Some Iraqi leaders, including fellow Shiites, have said he was not decisive enough for the job. Others said he allowed Shiite militias to infiltrate Iraq's police forces and the military, leading to a rash of sectarian killings in Sunni neighborhoods that have harmed efforts to draw Iraq's Sunni insurgents into the political process.
 The expanded power of Mr. Sadr could further complicate the process. Last fall, in an effort to keep Mr. Sadr from forming his own party, leaders of the United Iraqi Alliance offered his followers 30 seats -- the same number as Sciri, the largest Shiite party. A small Sadrist party also won two seats in the December elections, and in recent days they have joined the alliance, making Mr. Sadr's faction the largest.
 It is unclear how much control Mr. Sadr exercises over his followers in Parliament. During the past year he has often suggested that he is a clerical figure above the fray of politics. He has been similarly vague about his ties to the Mahdi Army, which unofficially polices parts of Baghdad but is regularly accused of carrying out assassinations and bombings.
 Nassir Saadi, one of Mr. Sadr's followers in Parliament, said Sunday that he and other members of the group would be free to vote their consciences. But he said all of the members met regularly with a three-man committee that was in constant touch with Mr. Sadr. Mr. Aaraji saidhe expected the Sadr bloc to be given control of four or five ministries when a government was formed.
 On some issues, Mr. Sadr's views are at odds with those of fellow Shiites and could provide a bridge to other elements within Parliament. Most Shiite representatives, for example, favor the creation of semiautonomous regions within Iraq, a proposal that has caused tremendous anger among Sunni Arab leaders. Mr. Sadr has said he believes that it would be premature to create such regions now. His strong opposition to the American presence is also echoed by many Sunni figures.
 Mr. Jaafari's election came as insurgent violence left at least a dozen people dead across Iraq on Sunday. In southern Baghdad, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt blew himself up near a mosque, killing three police commandos and a woman and wounding four people, Interior Ministry officials said. 
 Gunmen opened fire on a truck near a food market in the Shiite Shola district, killing two people inside, the officials said. Elsewhere in the city, a roadside bomb exploded near a passing Iraqi police convoy, killing an adult civilian and a child and wounding three others.
 At least three more bombs exploded in other areas of Baghdad, including two near a downtown bakery that wounded a dozen people.
 Interior Ministry officials said two unidentified bodies, blindfolded and handcuffed, were found in western Baghdad with bullets in their heads.

HEADLINE: Iraq-Bound Marine Leaders Cram on Civics and Economics 

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: CAMP PENDLETON, Calif., Feb. 7 

 BODY:
Maj. Gen. Richard C. Zilmer is busy these days poring over classified intelligence reports on the insurgency in Iraq's restive Anbar Province. 
 But as General Zilmer, a 53-year-old veteran of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, prepares to take command this month of 30,000 marines and soldiers in what may be the most dangerous region in Iraq, he is also focusing on some less obvious projects.
 Those include collecting information on the 10 largest employers in the province, the vast desert area west of Baghdad, trying to figure out how to ensure that local police officers and health workers there are being paid and thinking about the region's business challenges like an entrepreneur. 
 As new Marine commanders prepare to head to Iraq for a yearlong tour and gird for new battles there with insurgents, they say they must also put greater emphasis on helping the new Iraqi government provide essential city services, create jobs and promote local governmental control.
 ''Our focus of operations has been along security lines in the past, and they'll remain imperative,'' said General Zilmer, who as a young officer in the 1980's served in the Marine peacekeeping mission in Beirut. ''That said, we think there are other things that also require attention to be successful, including economics and governance. These are all happening at once.'' 
 That philosophy fits neatly under the strategy of Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli of the Army, the new overall commander of daily operations in Iraq, who says the military must not shortchange reconstruction and democratization efforts even while it battles insurgents. 
 Here at this sprawling base north of San Diego, General Zilmer's 700-member staff from the First Marine Expeditionary Force has been taking that guidance to heart.
 Last month, General Zilmer sponsored a two-day conference here to develop ideas on how to help speed reconstruction and the growth of civic organizations in Anbar, a contested region about the size of Arkansas that includes Falluja and Ramadi. 
 The 75 participants in the conference included military civil affairs specialists, specialists from the State and Commerce Departments, Iraqi business groups and an array of American private contractors who are working in Iraq. Practical tips, like those General Zilmer is studying, flowed from the meeting. Marines said they met contacts who could help them in Iraq. 
 ''They'll be working in the most dangerous part of Iraq, and will need to have a lot of flexibility on the ground,'' said Frederick D. Barton, a specialist on reconstruction at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who attended the conference. 
 General Zilmer said an officer might be assigned to Amman, Jordan, to help promote job growth and business development in western Iraq. Marine commanders expressed support for establishing military-civilian provincial reconstruction teams in Anbar similar to those operating in Afghanistan and other parts of Iraq. 
 The Marines express hope that promoting economic gains and political growth in the impoverished region will dissuade Sunnis in Anbar from supporting the insurgency. 
 ''This is all about converting those Iraqis on the fence,'' said Lt. Gen. John F. Sattler, who oversees all marines in Southwest Asia, including Iraq, from his headquarters here. 
 But Marine commanders say they face a shrinking window of opportunity. American influence is expected to diminish as Iraq's new government takes control. If Sunnis feel shut out of the political process by Shiite and Kurdish leaders, insurgent attacks are expected to increase, despite a series of operations last summer and fall in the Euphrates River Valley that commanders say disrupted the insurgents' ability to send suicide bombers into Baghdad and other major cities. 
 The 30,000 marines and soldiers in Anbar have represented about 20 percent of the total American force in Iraq since last April, but they also have suffered about 35 percent of the combat deaths in that period. Homemade bombs remain the No. 1 killer. 
 ''I don't see it decreasing,'' said Brig. Gen. Robert B. Neller, a veteran of American military missions in Panama, Somalia and Bosnia and General Zilmer's deputy for operations, referring to the number of bombs. ''It's clearly the weapon of choice.'' 
 To combat the insurgency, the Marines plan to increase the training of Iraqi soldiers, border guards and the police force, whose numbers in the province have grown to about 24,000 from a few thousand a year ago. ''Some of them still have a long way to go,'' General Zilmer said, referring to the recruits. 
 With growing domestic pressure to reduce the number of American forces in Iraq, General Zilmer will command a staff that is about 500 marines smaller than that of the headquarters he is replacing. He and his deputies have been talking regularly with the departing command under Maj. Gen. Stephen T. Johnson in Anbar since last summer, and they visited Iraq in October. 
 More than 60 percent of the marines under General Zilmer have previously served in Iraq or Afghanistan. They conducted training exercises in mock Iraqi villages in the nearby Mojave Desert, including tactics to counter roadside bombings. For his headquarters staff, General Zilmer had briefings prepared on Iraqi culture, geography and politics. 
 For now, General Zilmer discounts fears that simmering sectarian strife in Anbar could boil into civil war. 
 ''The challenge,'' he said, ''will be to demonstrate to them that there's some benefit to being a single people, to being an Iraqi people.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Muslims Try to Ease Europe's Discord

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN; Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting from Paris for this article.

 BODY:
As the crisis over the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad flared over the last two weeks, leaders of several American Muslim groups began working quietly to try to mediate between European Muslims and the West. 
 The leaders -- representing three national organizations and two mosques -- say they share the outrage over the cartoons felt by Muslims in countries where riots have turned bloody and Danish embassies have been burned. Yet in phone calls to Muslim leaders in Europe and in interviews with media outlets in the Middle East like Al Jazeera, they have offered a consistent message to Muslims: you must stop the violence because the Prophet Muhammad would never have approved, and you are playing into the stereotype of Muslims as barbarians.
At the same time, in meetings at the Washington embassies of European nations, the American Muslim leaders have presented their concerns to foreign diplomats: we, too, value free speech, but your governments should condemn the cartoons as hateful and bigoted and work at better integrating your alienated Muslim minorities. 
 ''The reason that Muslims in America have not responded the way they have in Europe is that we have come to know that so many people here speak out against such bigotries, and so many newspapers have not published the cartoons,'' said Mohamed Magid, the imam and executive director of a large mosque in Virginia, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, who was among a group of Muslim leaders who met with the ambassador of Denmark, Friis Arne Petersen, last week in Washington. 
 The American Muslim leaders are holding up their approach to living in a Western nation as a model. They told the Danish ambassador that they had lived in the United States longer than Muslims have lived in most European countries, and despite obstacles had managed to build effective organizations and achieve greater integration, acceptance and economic success than their brethren in Europe have. They portray the cartoons as part of a wave of global Islamophobia and have encouraged Muslim groups in Europe to use the same term.
 ''We told the ambassador flat out that the biggest resource you have is the American Muslim community,'' said Ahmed Younis, national director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, referring to the meeting with Mr. Petersen. ''We, too, deal with Islamophobia and discrimination, but we have developed lines of communication for trying to resolve these problems.''
 The American Muslims noted that a group of Danish Islamic clerics had traveled to Egypt, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East in December to try to stir up support and force an apology from the paper that published the cartoons, but that one result was an uproar among Muslims around the world. 
 The American Muslims are encouraging European Muslims to build better alliances with leaders of other faiths. In the United States, Muslims across the country intensified their involvement in interfaith organizations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, an effort they say has helped defuse tension. 
 Asked why Europe's Muslims would listen to America's, Abdul Karim Bangura, a professor of international relations and Islamic studies at American University, said, ''Muslims in America and in Canada are doing very well economically and in other ways, and that gives them pretty significant clout to get Muslims in Europe to listen to what they have to say.''
 How the American Muslims' efforts will play out in Europe remains unclear. Muslim leaders in Europe insist that they have already been playing a pivotal role in appealing for calm and persuading some Muslims to vent their anger through peaceful means.
 After the publication of the cartoons in Denmark and Norway last fall, a French newspaper reprinted them on Feb. 1. On Wednesday, another French paper followed suit. Several Muslim organizations in France are planning legal action. 
 Abdul Wahid Pedersen, an influential imam in Denmark, said Friday that Denmark's 250,000 Muslims could learn from their American counterparts by becoming more united. ''In the past the community here has been divided, and this had made it difficult to speak with one voice,'' he said. ''It is important in a crisis like this that moderate voices in the community are heard.''
 Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, based in Washington, said American Muslim leaders had been invited by Danish Muslim groups to help ease relations with the Danish government. Mr. Awad said the Danish Muslims were looking to the American Muslims for advice because they were aware that when anti-Muslim statements were made in the past by American religious leaders or talk show hosts, the American Muslim groups had persuaded the Bush administration to issue denunciations. 
 Karen P. Hughes, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, said, ''The voices of Muslim Americans have more credibility in the Muslim world frankly than my voice as a government official, because they can speak the language of their faith and can share their experience of practicing their faith freely in the West, and they can help explain why the cartoons are so offensive.'' 
 Muslim American leaders say they feel anguish over the Muslim world's violent protests, which have left at least 11 people dead. Azeem Khan, assistant secretary general of the Islamic Circle of North America, based in New York, said, ''It hurts us when people attack embassies, because it reinforces the image that we were protesting in the first place, which is that Muslims are violent.''
 Imam Magid said he recently told worshipers at his mosque that during the Prophet Muhammad's life, a woman threw trash in his house, and other people called him crazy and spat in his face. ''He responded by forgiving her and asking God to guide those who had wronged him,'' he said. ''I told them every time a Muslim commits a suicide bombing, walks into a pizza place and kills innocent people, that person has offended their own prophet.''

HEADLINE: An Unheralded Frenchman Finds the Course Fits His Style

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: SESTRIERE, Italy, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
In two of the days of training runs preceding Sunday's Olympic downhill, the Austrian and American skiers strutted.
 Daron Rahlves, America's most decorated downhill skier, won the first day's training run by so much that he took the next day off. Four Austrians, led by the world's top-ranked downhill skier, Michael Walchhofer, took turns finishing first, second, third and fourth in those practices.
 But lurking in fifth place on both days was Antoine Deneriaz of France. And as the weekend came, the Kandahar Banchetta course in western Italy's Alps had dried after four successive sunny days. While still technically demanding, the course increasingly became one that rewarded smooth, economical skiers who negotiated bumps and rises with quiet legs that kept their skis tracking downhill. In racing parlance, such skiers are gliders.
 Deneriaz is one of the World Cup circuit's best gliders. But few took note of his position just behind the training leaders because he tore two knee ligaments in a crash 13 months ago and had not been in contention for a victory since. 
 Even Sunday, after Rahlves and his teammate Bode Miller had skied unspectacularly, joining the Austrian legend Hermann Maier on the sideline and out of the medal hunt, Deneriaz was still under the radar as he awaited his run.
 It was Walchhofer, after a proficient run, who held the lead, and Austrian fans near the finish line had begun to serenade him in anticipation of crowning a seventh Austrian Olympic downhill champion.
 But then Deneriaz left the starting gate, 10 to 20 racers after the favorites had, and sped through the first section of the course, posting a time well ahead of Walchhofer's. At each time interval, Deneriaz's lead grew, until it was obvious that all he had to do to win was finish upright. When he crossed the finish line, France had its fifth Olympic downhill champion.
 As surprising as Deneriaz's victory was, his competitors agreed it made sense. If healthy and under the right course conditions -- like Sunday's -- Deneriaz had proved his skill before.
 ''He likes this course; he is the perfect glider,'' Maier said of Deneriaz, whose winning time of 1 minute 48.8 seconds was 72-hundredths of a second -- a wide margin -- ahead of Walchhofer. Bruno Kernen of Switzerland won the bronze medal.
 ''It would have taken a hurricane wind to get me into first place,'' Miller said. ''The way Deneriaz skied, he was untouchable.''
 Miller, who experimented with newly designed skis, made two small mistakes at the bottom of his run and finished fifth, the top finish for the United States. Miller's day started late. He did not inspect the downhill course before the start of Sunday's race, a time when most racers slowly ski down the course to plot their path. But Miller, who had been spotted in Sestriere nightclubs in the past week, did not take that opportunity and arrived well after 10 a.m. for a race that began at noon.
 Rahlves, meanwhile, seemed to ski more cautiously Sunday than he had in training and finished 10th. Rahlves had experimental skis similar to Miller's, but he decided at the last moment Sunday not to use them.
 Maier, who was sixth, said he was battling a cold and would leave Sestriere for the Mediterranean Sea until his next competition, the super-G on Saturday.
 With the big names out of the way, there was more time for Deneriaz, and the several dozen French fans who feted him, to celebrate at the bottom of the course.
 ''It's the best day of my life,'' said Deneriaz, 29, who dedicated his victory to those who had assisted him while he recovered from his knee injury. ''It's like a dream. No one believed it could be true.''
 Deneriaz joined a long list of surprise winners in the Olympic downhill, including Austria's Fritz Strobl (2002), France's Jean-Luc Cretier (1998), the Americans Bill Johnson (1984) and Tommy Moe (1994), and the Austrian Leonhard Stock (1980).
 There are many theories as to why Olympic upsets are commonplace, but the most accepted one is that Olympic downhills are not as challenging as the top World Cup races. The field for an Olympic downhill includes the world's best racers but also many less accomplished skiers from nations that do not regularly participate in the World Cup. To accommodate those skiers, and to keep them safe, the Olympic downhill is less of a test than the marquee World Cup downhills in Kitzbuhel, Austria; Wengen, Switzerland; or Beaver Creek, Colo.
 But ratcheting down the danger in the Olympics levels the field, giving more racers a chance.
 Still, Deneriaz is a veteran with a downhill pedigree, having won three World Cup races from 2002 to 2004. But after his injury in January 2005, he drifted from the spotlight. He had two top-10 finishes in the downhill this season, with his best result a ninth at Kitzbuhel.
 ''It was a long 13 months back from my knee injury,'' Deneriaz said. ''There were some very difficult days. But always I told myself, 'The Games, the Games, the Games are coming.'
 ''Getting ready was difficult, but with little successes, I knew I had the strength and confidence to go on.''
 As for the Americans, their performances Sunday were subtly wrapped in the intrigue of new downhill skis. At this level, that is no minor equipment change. Miller used new skis from Atomic; Rahlves changed out of his only minutes before pushing out of the starting gate. 
 Miller used the skis in Saturday's final training run, when he was the fastest skier for most of the way down the course. The skis are made of a cap construction, something customarily used for slalom and giant slalom skis, but not for downhill. Miller said the skis were fast Sunday as well, though he conceded that he did not have the speed he had Saturday.
 Rahlves, who left the starting gate two skiers after Miller, apparently changed out of the new skis after hearing Miller's time, which at that juncture placed him fourth.
 ''The skis weren't the difference,'' Rahlves said later. ''I had done well on the skis I wore today in training, too.''
 Rahlves's principal problem was a serious mistake he made just out of the gate. By the first timed interval, he was 21-hundredths of a second behind Walchhofer. Rahlves, smaller than most downhillers, had to be fastest in that steep first section to have any opportunity to win.
 Miller had a faster early interval than Walchhofer and was very close to Walchhofer's pace near the end of the race. But he lost time in the race's final segment.
 ''I got over-rotated on two consecutive turns at the end,'' Miller said. ''I didn't do too bad, but they were the kind of mistakes that will cost you a race.''
 Rahlves, who has said he plans to retire at the end of the current ski season, was one of the contenders for the 2002 Olympic downhill title. He finished 16th in those Games.
 ''It's disappointing because I really wanted to win this downhill more than anything,'' he said. ''But this is what happened today. I felt I had skied well until I saw my time at the bottom.''
 Rahlves shrugged and smiled.
 ''This is the Olympics; it's one shot,'' he said. ''The best man on this day won the race.''

LOVE AND BIG MONEY -- Tomorrow is Valentine's Day, when affection is traditionally expressed through the giving of overpriced romantic gifts. A survey conducted by the National Retail Federation indicates that the average American man is likely to spend $135.67 on gifts this year, almost double the $68.64 that the average woman will spend. Total holiday-related spending could reach $13.7 billion, up from $13.2 billion last year. 


THE NOMINEES ARE -- Randall S. Kroszner and Kevin M. Warsh, nominees for vacant slots on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, will begin testifying tomorrow in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Kroszner is a professor at the University of Chicago who worked on the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Mr. Bush's first term. Mr. Warsh, a former banker at Morgan Stanley, is now a special assistant to Mr. Bush on economic policy.

PRICE SCAN -- The big economic report of the week will be the producer price index for January, due out on Friday. Economists expect the index, a measure of increases in wholesale prices for goods and services, to have risen 0.2 percent for the month, a smaller increase than the 0.9 percent rise recorded in December. Also on the list are retail sales for January and business inventories for December, to be released tomorrow; industrial production for January, on Wednesday; and import prices and housing starts for January, on Thursday.

CHINA AND THE NET -- Amid plenty of publicity over how American technology companies have jumped through government hoops to do business in China, the House subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations has called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday. Representatives from Google, Yahoo, Dell and Cisco will attend.

PROFIT WATCH -- The main earnings reports this week will come from Hewlett-Packard on Wednesday and DaimlerChrysler and Dell on Thursday. Sirius Satellite Radio reports on Friday.

HEADLINE: Debt And Denial

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman

 BODY:
Last year America spent 57 percent more than it earned on world markets. That is, our imports were 57 percent larger than our exports.
 How did we manage to live so far beyond our means? By running up debts to Japan, China and Middle Eastern oil producers. We're as addicted to imported money as we are to imported oil.
Sometimes large-scale foreign borrowing makes sense. In the 19th century the United States borrowed vast sums from Europe, using the funds to build railroads and other industrial infrastructure. That debt-financed wave of investment left America stronger, not weaker. 
 But this time our overseas borrowing isn't financing an investment boom: adjusted for the size of the economy, business investment is actually low by historical standards. Instead, we're using borrowed money to build houses, buy consumer goods and, of course, finance the federal budget deficit. 
 In 2005 spending on home construction as a percentage of G.D.P. reached its highest level in more than 50 years. People who already own houses are treating them like A.T.M.'s, converting home equity into spending money: last year the personal savings rate fell below zero for the first time since 1933. And it's a sign of our degraded fiscal state that the Bush administration actually boasted about a 2005 budget deficit of more than $300 billion, because it was a bit lower than the 2004 deficit.
 It all sounds unsustainable. And it is.
 Some people insist that the U.S. economy has hidden savings that official statistics fail to capture. I won't go into the technical debate about these claims, some of which resemble arguments used not long ago to justify dot-com stock prices, except to say that the more closely one looks at the facts, the less plausible the ''don't worry, be happy'' hypothesis looks. 
 Denial takes a more systematic form within the federal government, where Dick Cheney is doing to budget analysis what he did to intelligence on Iraq. Last week Mr. Cheney announced that a newly created division within the Treasury Department would show that tax cuts increase, not reduce, federal revenue. That's the Bush-Cheney way: decide on your conclusions first, then demand that analysts produce evidence supporting those conclusions.
 But serious analysts know that America's borrowing binge is unsustainable. Sooner or later the trade deficit will have to come down, the housing boom will have to end, and both American consumers and the U.S. government will have to start living within their means. 
 So how bad will it be? It depends on how the binge ends. If it tapers off gradually, the U.S. economy will be able to shift workers out of sectors that have benefited from the housing boom and the consumption spree into sectors that produce exports or replace imports. Given time, we could bring the trade deficit down and bring housing back to earth without a net loss in jobs.
 In practice, however, a ''soft landing'' looks unlikely, because too many economic players have unrealistic expectations. This is true of international investors, who are still snapping up U.S. bonds at low interest rates, seemingly oblivious both to the budget deficit and to the consensus view among trade experts that the dollar will eventually have to fall 30 percent or more to eliminate the trade deficit. 
 It's equally true of American home buyers. Most Americans live in regions where housing remains affordable. But a detailed new study by HSBC, a multinational bank, confirms what I and others have been saying: most of the rise in housing values has taken place in a ''bubble zone'' along the coasts, where housing prices have risen far more than the economic fundamentals warrant. According to HSBC's estimates, houses in the bubble zone are overvalued by between 35 and 40 percent, creating trillions of dollars of illusory wealth. 
 So it seems all too likely that America's borrowing binge will end with a bang, not a whimper, that spending will suddenly drop off as both the bond market and the housing market experience rude awakenings. If that happens, the economic consequences will be ugly.
 All in all, Alan Greenspan, who helped create this situation, can consider himself lucky that he's safely out of office, giving briefings to hedge fund managers at $250,000 a pop. And his successor may be in for a rough ride. Best wishes and good luck, Ben; you may need it.

BYLINE: By Dan Shea. 
Dan Shea is a lawyer for an insurance company.

DATELINE: Seattle 

 BODY:
MY brother Lt. Col. Kevin Shea was killed by a rocket attack in Falluja on Sept. 14, 2004. He knew the risks when he joined the Marine Corps in 1989. But he also thought that if anything ever happened to him, the United States government would take care of his wife, Amy, and his two children. Sadly, that's not the case. 
 Since Kevin died, Amy has had to deal with not only the grief of losing her husband and her best friend, but also with the difficulties of financially coping with life without him. Like most military spouses, during her time with Kevin, Amy endured multiple moves across the country and long deployments that forced her to put her career on hold. There are federal programs to assist her, but she and other widows of service members have found that these programs do not provide nearly enough.
You see, basically, a widow of a service member killed in the line of duty has two programs (excluding Social Security) to rely on for financial help. The first is a survivors' plan paid by the Department of Defense, which is about 41 percent of the deceased person's monthly salary before taxes. The second program is a dependent's compensation paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs that is $1,033 a month tax free, plus a modest sum added for every dependent child. 
 Sounds fair, right? But here's the problem: under the current law, the payment from the Defense Department to a surviving spouse is reduced dollar for dollar by the Veterans Administration's payment. So while you would think my sister-in-law, as the wife of a lieutenant colonel whose basic monthly salary is $4,431.60, would receive about $2,850 a month (41 percent of $4,431.60, or $1,817, plus $1,033), in fact, all she's getting is $1,817, that is, $784 from the Pentagon and $1033 from Veterans Affairs. Moreover, if Amy, who is 41 years old, remarries before the age of 55, she gets nothing.
 The wife of a low-ranking enlisted soldier, say, a Marine lance corporal, is even worse off. All she gets is the dependent's payment of $1,033, because there is nothing left of her husband's salary after this so-called widow's tax takes its bite.
 We all know it's not about the money, but come on, how can you survive on that in this economy? 
 This past Veterans Day, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to endorse an amendment proposed by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, to the defense authorization bill that would have eliminated the widow's tax. The bill then went into conference, where House and Senate members worked out various differences before a final vote by Congress. During that time, the amendment was removed. One can only assume that certain members of the Senate had no intention of backing the amendment but were reluctant to appear unsupportive of our troops on Veterans Day, of all days. 
 If President Bush really wants to honor the men and women fighting this war -- and dying like my brother -- then he should call on Congress to eliminate the widow's tax. It's the least he can do.

HEADLINE: An Outspoken Conservative Loses His Place at the Table

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Va. 

 BODY:
What happens if you're a Republican commentator and you write a book critical of President Bush that gets you fired from your job at a conservative think tank?
 For starters, no other conservative institution rushes in with an offer for your analytical skills.
''Nobody will touch me,'' said Bruce Bartlett, author of the forthcoming ''Impostor: Why George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy.'' ''I think I'm just kind of radioactive at the moment.'' 
 Mr. Bartlett, a domestic policy aide at the White House in the Reagan administration and a deputy assistant treasury secretary under the first President Bush, talked last week at his suburban Washington home about his dismissal, his book and a growing disquiet among conservatives about Mr. Bush. 
 Although ''Impostor'' is flamboyant in its anti-Bush sentiments -- on the first page Mr. Bartlett calls Mr. Bush a ''pretend conservative'' and compares him to Richard Nixon, ''a man who used the right to pursue his agenda'' -- its basic message reflects the frustration of many conservatives who say that Mr. Bush has been on a five-year federal spending binge. Like them, Mr. Bartlett is particularly upset about Mr. Bush's Medicare prescription drug plan, which is expected to cost more than $700 billion over the next decade. 
 He is unhappy, too, with the president's education and campaign finance bills and his proposal to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, which many Republicans call a dressed-up amnesty plan. The book, to be published by Doubleday on Feb. 28, also criticizes the White House for ''an anti-intellectual distrust of facts and analysis'' and an obsession with secrecy.
 ''The Clinton people were vastly more open and easier to deal with and, quite frankly, a lot better on the issues,'' Mr. Bartlett said in the interview, in the kitchen of his pared-down modern house on a street of big new homes in Great Falls. Mr. Bartlett hastened to add that although he admired Mr. Clinton's economic policies, that did not mean he had changed sides.
 ''I haven't switched to the Democratic Party,'' he said. ''I wrote this for Republicans.''
 One Republican, Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, responded to Mr. Bartlett's book by e-mail over the weekend. ''Spending is coming under control,'' Mr. McClellan wrote, adding that in the 2007 budget submitted to Congress earlier this month, ''the president put forward the most disciplined non-security discretionary proposal since the Reagan era.''
 Mr. Bartlett is well regarded in conservative circles, even as the tone of his book has made him a maverick.
 ''Bruce is really an exception, not the rule, in the degree and thoroughness of his discontent,'' said William Kristol, a conservative strategist and the editor of The Weekly Standard. ''So I wouldn't make too much of it. On the other hand, one thing I've noticed giving speeches in the last couple of months is that conservatives remain pro-Bush, but the loyalty to the movement and the ideas is deeper than the personal loyalty now. Two years ago, Bush was the movement and the cause.''
 Mr. Bartlett, 54, the author of a syndicated newspaper column and articles in academic journals, was dismissed in October as a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a research group based in Dallas. In the interview, Mr. Bartlett said he had been fired because his increasingly critical comments about Mr. Bush, in his column, in his book and in other publications, had hampered the ability of the research institution to raise money among Republican donors. 
 He also provided a copy of an e-mail message that he said was sent to him in August 2004 by Jeanette Goodman, the vice president of the research institution. ''100K is off the table if you do another 'dump Cheney' column and 65K donor is having a rebuttal done, in a national magazine, to your attack on the fair tax people so that 65K may be gone also,'' Ms. Goodman wrote about one of Mr. Bartlett's columns about the vice president. ''Do you have any ideas on where I could raise that amount quickly?''
 John C. Goodman, the president of the organization and Ms. Goodman's husband, said in a telephone interview over the weekend that he did not know what his wife had said to Mr. Bartlett and that he did not want to say whether Mr. Bartlett ''did or didn't hurt fund-raising.'' But Mr. Goodman added, ''That's not why he was fired.''
 Mr. Goodman said he dismissed Mr. Bartlett because after reading the manuscript of ''Impostor'' last fall, he determined that Mr. Bartlett had reneged on an agreement not to personalize his criticism of the president or any other individual, in the Bush administration or not. ''He was supposed to write a book on policy,'' Mr. Goodman said.
 Mr. Bartlett, for his part, said he was fine financially but hoped his book would be a best seller. In any case, he is tired of think tanks.
 ''Some reporter called the other day and asked me about the budget,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''It's just a boring subject. It's never changed in the 30 years I've been working on the budget. But if I were still working for a think tank, I'd have to be up on that kind of stuff and ready to give a quote or some intelligent analysis, and I feel I can kind of ignore some of that.''
 So what now?
 ''I've been thinking about writing a history of the Democratic Party,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''It kind of seemed an interesting thing for a Republican to do.''

HEADLINE: Dance Center Has an Apt Vista in New Home

BYLINE: By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
The southern windows of Dance New Amsterdam's new studios offer sweeping views of the old Tweed Courthouse and New York City Hall. It is an apt vista: the political will, however faltering, to foster a cultural renaissance in Lower Manhattan after 9/11 was crucial to the company's success in finding a new home.
 Classes start today at the $5.5 million, 25,000-square-foot center in the historic Sun Building at 280 Broadway. It has seven studios, one of which can be converted into a 135-seat theater, as well as a cafe; a mini-gallery; and ample administrative space. 
''If we had found something on 34th Street and 10th Avenue, I don't think we would have gotten the interest we did,'' said Charles Wright, the executive director of Dance New Amsterdam, formerly known as Dance Space Center. ''This is the right place in the city for us, and it's right for the city at this time.''
 The City Council, the mayor's office and the office of the Manhattan Borough president together contributed $2.2 million, and the September 11 Fund gave an additional $500,000. The nonprofit studio attracts more than 2,000 students a week to its dozens of classes in ballet, jazz and modern dance. Now, it is starting a performance series in its theater. On Feb. 23 the Sean Curran Company is to open the season, which runs through June.
 ''This will enliven what has been a dead area, especially in the evening hours,'' said Councilman Alan J. Gerson, who Mr. Wright said had been instrumental in helping him obtain city money. ''It is precisely the immediate economic shot in the arm we need.''
 The studio, which has long catered to amateur, aspiring and professional dancers, will expand its offerings for the public, adding, for example, yoga and Pilates classes in the early morning and late evening. It also plans to begin an in-house dance company in September, with members to be chosen by audition for a six-month paid contract, and to sublet office space to choreographers.
 Mr. Curran, who has been running his dance company out of his cramped East Village apartment for eight years, said he planned to commandeer two desks. ''It's going to give me roots, which I very much need,'' said Mr. Curran, who started teaching at the studio after he left the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company about 15 years ago. 
 Manhattan already has a lot of small to medium-size performance spaces. Does it need another one?
 Dance New Amsterdam says yes. ''I don't want to say our theater will be a step up from the Joyce SoHo, but it will,'' Mr. Wright said. Unlike the Joyce SoHo and Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church in the East Village, its stage will have wings. Unlike the Kitchen and Performance Space 122, it will present exclusively dance. And, Mr. Wright said, the programming would be more diverse than that of Dance Theater Workshop.
 Theaters aside, there is a dearth of studio space in the city, said Robert Yesselman, the director of Dance/NYC, a service organization that does market research. ''You might argue about a theater, but the studio situation in New York City is ridiculous,'' he said. ''We're losing artists.'' (Studio rentals at Dance New Amsterdam cost $10 to $35 an hour.)
 In its rise, fall and current reincarnation, Dance New Amsterdam has exemplified the shifting fate of the dance community in New York. It was founded in 1983 as Dance Space Center by five choreographers weary of the peeling paint and errant windows (a window once plummeted to the street) at the old Morelli Ballet studio on West 14th Street. 
 ''We said, 'Enough of suffering,' '' Mr. Wright recalled. ''Dance needed to be elevated, and we set about doing that.''
 With what little equity (about $120,000) and prodigious sweat the founders possessed, they opened Dance Space Center at 622 Broadway, just north of Houston Street. ''It wasn't NoHo then,'' Mr. Wright said. ''On weekends, newspapers would blow around on Broadway. It was like sagebrush in the Old West.''
 In 1999, unable to renew its lease, the studio moved to 451 Broadway, shrinking from 15,000 to 10,000 square feet. It was one of at least nine studios in Manhattan forced to close or move in the heat of the dot-com era.
 ''Landlords were saying, 'Money, money, money, money,' '' Mr. Wright said. ''Economically, culture wasn't viable.''
 These days, money, at least for capital projects, seems to be flowing back to dance. Dance New Amsterdam's new home is the latest in a wave of state-of-the-art spaces to open in Manhattan in the last year or so. Making buildings is one thing, however; making art quite another. 
 ''I worry there are all these spaces; are we going to have money to commission scores and pay dancers?'' Mr. Curran said. ''I need some money for costumes and salaries. I hope that will follow.''
 But for now, dance is enjoying a happy, quasi-European moment. Last week, Dance New Amsterdam showed off its new home at an open house. A circle of young women, made up of dancers who had come from the Netherlands, Belgium, Slovenia and Germany to study at Dance New Amsterdam, sat around a table in what, as soon as the theater is finished, will become the lobby. What did they make of the bright colors, the fresh light and the clean expanse of floors? 
 It reminded them of home. As Fleur Notting, a 23-year-old from the Netherlands, said contentedly, ''It's quite similar to my old dance academy.''

HEADLINE: Playing the Game, Then Seeking to Change It

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, may have secured her position through secret deals with party bosses, but she is seeking to curb many of those same backroom tactics as a somewhat unexpected champion of government reform.
 In her first five weeks leading the Council, Ms. Quinn has proposed giving lawmakers more input on bills and hearings, which have historically been tightly controlled by the speaker. She has banned citywide mailings from the speaker, which were often criticized as thinly veiled political ads financed with taxpayer money.
Ms. Quinn has also called for broad changes in the budget process to promote more meaningful negotiations between the legislative and executive branches, and, in what may be her most ambitious effort yet, she has pledged to address abuses by lobbyists seeking to influence city officials -- an issue also raised by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 ''For me, it isn't necessarily reforms just for reforms, per se,'' Ms. Quinn said on Saturday during an interview. ''It's about making us a better legislature so we're better serving New Yorkers and eliminating their problems and challenges.''
 Ms. Quinn's attempts to fashion a more democratic and transparent government have won support among many council members and advocates. But others are cautious, saying that for all Ms. Quinn's talk of reforms, the speaker has been just as quick as previous Council leaders have been to reward political allies.
 ''It's a mixed bag for me,'' said Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn, who has criticized Ms. Quinn's relationship with the party bosses. ''On one hand, she's showing some signs of progressive reform, but on the other hand, the way she came in was business as usual.'' 
 Ms. Quinn defeated six rivals to ascend to the speaker's chair, mostly by striking a deal with the Democratic organizations in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn. In return, Ms. Quinn steered plum committees and assignments to party loyalists. 
 Councilman Joel Rivera, whose father, Jose, is the Bronx Democratic leader, was named the majority leader and also inherited the leadership role in Ms. Quinn's former committee, Health. Queens council members were chosen to lead the more powerful committees, and Brooklyn members moved up in the leadership ranks.
 Moreover, Ms. Quinn also seemed to strike, however subtly, at those who were out of favor with party leaders. Several council members were moved to less desirable seats on the floor, and Councilman James Sanders Jr. of Queens lost the chairmanship of the Economic Development Committee.
 Mr. Sanders protested with an impassioned speech on the Council floor, in which he blamed ''outside influences'' for losing his committee and invoked the spirit of Friedrich Nietzsche, saying, ''What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.'' 
 But since then, Ms. Quinn has distanced herself from party politics and focused on improving the inner workings of the Council and city government at large. She has worked to build consensus for these changes not only among council members, but also within the Bloomberg administration. 
 ''She's a deeply caring public servant who is motivated by all the right reasons,'' said Councilman Eric Gioia of Queens, who is close to Ms. Quinn.
 Ms. Quinn's proposals are hardly groundbreaking, and have been carried out, in various forms, by municipalities across the nation. Peter F. Vallone Jr., the former Council speaker, said that in New York and elsewhere, the days of a few powerful officials making decisions behind closed doors are disappearing. 
 ''These reforms are very relevant to the present time,'' he said. ''The Council has to evolve just like anything else.''
 But whether Ms. Quinn is the one to lead the reforms is still a matter of debate in some political circles. 
 Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor of public policy at Baruch College, said Ms. Quinn's earlier politicking did not necessarily rule out her efforts now to make substantive changes. ''Those were the rules of the game that she was confronted with, and since she wanted to be speaker, she played by them,'' he said.
 But some council members and political experts caution that Ms. Quinn would not be the first elected official to make a show of reform in hopes of personal gain. The previous speaker, Gifford Miller, had also sought to portray himself as a reform-minded leader, but his efforts dissipated shortly after taking office. 
 Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said that while he was encouraged by Ms. Quinn's interest, he had yet to decide whether her proposals were the start of serious reform or merely token gestures.
 ''Chris is untested, and she's going to face some very tough choices,'' Mr. Russianoff said. ''At this early point in her tenure, our philosophy is to hope for the best, and be on guard for the worst.''

HEADLINE: Standardized Tests in College?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Education Secretary Margaret Spellings's assertion that families need accurate information to make good decisions about college is true, but this implies neither the unavailability of such information nor a government mandate for attaining and providing it. 
Such information is readily available from any number of sources; most major bookstores have entire sections full of books on colleges, replete with student reviews, information about grade inflation or deflation (a proxy for rigor), and required courses. Web sites abound with more informally presented insights.
 To impose some sort of universal test would be not only an absurd waste of public money in a deficit-ridden time, but also a Procrustean bed ignoring the inherent differences across disciplines. 
 The skills gained by an aerospace engineer and a musicologist, for example, are so different that no universal measuring stick would provide the simple answers Ms. Spellings seems to want.

Interior Department Plan Forgoes $7 Billion In Royalties for Domestic Oil Drilling
The federal government is on the verge of one of the biggest giveaways of oil and gas in American history, an estimated $7 billion over five years. New projections, buried in the Interior Department's just-published budget plan, anticipate that the government will let companies pump about $65 billion worth of oil and natural gas from federal territory over the next five years without paying any royalties to the government. [Page A1.] 


An Opening for the Defense in Early Enron Testimony
After seven days on the stand in the Enron fraud trial, Mark E. Koenig, who ran investor relations and was a polished performer on Wall Street, may have served to advance the defense's argument as much, if not more, than the government's in its prosecution of Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay. [C1.]

Business-Backed Group Takes Aim at Organized Labor
A new business-backed group is mounting a highly visible attack against organized labor, just as unions are trying to pick themselves up after suffering a schism and years of decline. The group, the Center for Union Facts, ran full-page advertisements in national newspapers yesterday and started a Web site, UnionFacts.com, asserting that many unions are corrupt and have hurt the airlines, steelmakers and auto makers. [C1.]

I.R.S. Offers Leniency in Questionable Tax Shelter Cases
The Internal Revenue Service is making an unusual offer of leniency to firms that made and sold questionable tax shelters: come forward, pay penalties and turn over information and you may avoid criminal prosecution. [C1.]

The Slow Rise of Genetic Engineering in Crops
At the dawn of the era of genetically engineered crops, scientists envisioned all sorts of healthier and tastier foods. But so far, most of the genetically modified crops have provided benefits mainly to farmers, by making it easier for them to control weeds and insects. Now, the next generation of biotech crops -- the first with direct benefits for consumers -- is finally on the horizon. But the list does not include many of the products once envisioned. [C1.]

U.S. Export Tax Breaks Set Back in Europe
The World Trade Organization ruled that tax breaks the United States gives to some of its largest companies are illegal and the European Union said it would impose new trade sanctions in three months unless the tax breaks are abolished. Peter Mandelson, left, the union's top trade official, reiterated his concerns about the tax breaks, saying the change in the laws had failed to rectify the situation. [C6.]

Test of Cancer Drug Set Back by Deaths
The biotechnology giant Genentech and its majority stockholder, Roche Holding, said they had temporarily stopped recruiting volunteers for a large test of the cancer drug Avastin after more patients than expected died. [C4.]

Data on Nuclear Waste Site in Nevada Prove Elusive
The Energy Department no longer has an estimate of when it can open the nuclear waste repository that it wants to build at Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, and it may never have an accurate prediction of the cost, the energy secretary said. [C4.]

Securities Charges in Internet Company Case in Japan
Takafumi Horie, the founder of the Internet company Livedoor whose brash tactics challenged Japan's business establishment, was charged with violating securities law. [C6.]

German TV Company No Longer For Sale
Haim Saban, the Los Angeles investor who controls ProSiebenSat.1 Media, the commercial television group, said that he and his partners had decided not to seek a buyer for the company. The announcement ended speculation that a new sale might be in the works after the cartel office in Germany blocked the broadcaster's sale to Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, in January. Axel Springer, which owns Germany's top-selling newspaper, Bild, had offered 4.2 billion euros ($5 billion) for ProSiebenSat.1. The acquisition would have joined one of the country's largest broadcasters with its No. 1 publisher. [C6.]

HEADLINE: Skepticism And Praise For Change At the Met

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Peter Gelb's bold effort to remake the Metropolitan Opera drew praise from the opera world yesterday as a necessary jolt to what some see as a stodgy institution. At the same time, the risks quickly became apparent, with some longtime audience members and others sensing betrayal of cherished traditions.
 ''The Met certainly needs a shake-up,'' said John Allison, the editor of the London-based magazine Opera. ''Looked at from a sort of European perspective, lots of the arts in American certainly seem exciting, but the big New York institutions seem a bit moribund,'' Mr. Allison added. ''I'm a little bit wary of what Mr. Gelb has in mind, because I'm not sure he has enough core operatic experience. But at the same time, these plans sound on the whole quite exciting.''
Mr. Gelb, a former record company executive, formally takes charge as general manager on Aug. 1, but he has quickly put his stamp on the company, having laid out his plans in an interview last week. He said he would emphasize directors with theater and film backgrounds, embrace digital delivery of opera, bring in conductors like Riccardo Muti who have never conducted at the Met before and introduce major voices in new roles, like Karita Mattila as Tosca. 
 Mr. Gelb will also establish a joint commissioning program with the Lincoln Center Theater, which would solicit works from musical theater composers as well as from more traditional classical composers. He will increase the number of new productions from about four a season to seven.
 Yesterday, after 18 months at the Met quietly working alongside Joseph Volpe, the general manager who is retiring after this season, Mr. Gelb stepped into the spotlight with a news conference of grand-opera scale on the Met's stage to introduce his plans.
 With his back to the hall, he faced a large projection of scenes from next season's opening production of ''Madama Butterfly,'' directed by Anthony Minghella. Many of the directors for next season's new productions were present, as was the Met's music director, James Levine. Mr. Volpe did not attend, ''but he may be listening,'' Mr. Gelb said with a smile.
 Mr. Gelb assured the opera world that he respected ''the great history of the Met and the faithful zeal'' of its fans. Quoting a previous general manager, Rudolf Bing, he said, ''The Metropolitan must adapt its methods to prevailing conditions of the day.''
 The schedule for next season, mostly the work of Mr. Volpe, includes new productions of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' directed by Bartlett Sher; Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice,'' directed by Mark Morris, with Lorraine Hunt Lieberson and Lisa Milne in the title roles; Strauss's ''Agyptische Helena,'' starring Deborah Voigt; and Puccini's ''Trittico,'' directed by Jack O'Brien. 
 Although box-office figures have been weak in recent years, Mr. Gelb inherits a Met on solid financial footing, Mr. Volpe said yesterday. He pointed out that the endowment had tripled, to $300 million, on his 16-year watch and that the Met is expected to have a small surplus this year, thanks in part to a recent $25 million gift from Mercedes Bass.
 Mr. Volpe said he had concerns about how the house would pay for Mr. Gelb's ambitious plans. ''Hopefully it will be financed and it will be funded,'' he said. ''If it's not, then Peter will have to reconsider.''
 Paul Kellogg, general and artistic director of the New York City Opera, praised Mr. Gelb's plans and said complaints would be expected. ''But in the arts, change is inevitable and healthy,'' he said in an e-mail message. Mr. Kellogg acknowledged that the new plans could be a challenge to City Opera. ''We've always been Avis to their Hertz, which just means we will have to try even harder.''
 Peter Jonas, the general director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, said that the Met's ''intractable'' problem was the high cost of labor. ''To feed that bill,'' Sir Peter said, ''you need to raise an enormous sum of money'' -- at the box office and from merchandising, annual fund-raising and large gifts. The Met's huge size (almost 4,000 seats) makes it especially difficult to sell out.
 ''You've got to think about new ways of thinking about opera presentation,'' Sir Peter added. ''If Peter Gelb is doing that with his background in media, if he's intellectually fleet-flooted and agile enough to do that, then all power to him. The Met can't go on as it is.''
 Or can it? Many among the Met's base of support -- the loyal audience members who attend performances every week, who donate money, who sit by their radios for every live Saturday broadcast -- actually like a lot about the way the Met is and say they are wary of Mr. Gelb's focus on directors and his effort to reach out to nontraditional opera composers. 
 The feeling is strong among supporters of Mr. Volpe. ''He wants to revolutionize the Met, but it's looking very showbiz to me,'' said Katherine Gill, who attends several performances a week and is vice president of the Wagner Society of New York. ''It seems like he's following the buzz and commercially orientated. The question is, why do we love opera? It's not for jazz or popular music or theater that he wants to introduce. It's the singers.
 ''It's the music, stupid,'' Ms. Gill added, paraphrasing a Clinton-era dictum about the economy. ''I hope he doesn't dumb it down to sell it.''
 Mr. Allison said that while he thought bringing in new musical ideas was not a bad idea, he remained skeptical about seeking commissions outside purely classical music. ''There's plenty of Broadway-style stuff on Broadway,'' he added. 
 Dr. Ellen Silverstein, a patron who has been going to the Met for 45 years, said she welcomed Mr. Gelb's efforts to commission works from Osvaldo Golijov and John Adams, two composers of note, and to bring in major conductors like Mr. Muti. 
 But, she said, ''the emphasis seems to be on directors, which is what they do in Europe, which is why European opera is so flaky these days.
 ''We call it Eurotrash,'' Dr. Silverstein added. ''We go to hear people sing. We don't go for any production.'' 
 Frank Raysor, who fits almost precisely into the Met's average demographic (63, college educated, financially comfortable), said he worried that innovative new productions would not wear well for repeat Met-goers. ''It'll be fun for the critics to review once, but will you want to see it every three years after?''
 Still, Mr. Raysor said he was giving Mr. Gelb time. ''I have to see how it's going to unfold,'' he said. ''We got just kind of a grab bag of ideas floating around and many years over which it's going to play out.''

HEADLINE: Harvard's President Is Again at Odds With His Faculty

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER; Jonathan D. Glater contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, MASS., Feb. 13 

 BODY:
A year after weathering a no-confidence vote by the faculty, Harvard University's president, Lawrence H. Summers, is facing another showdown with dissident faculty members, raising new questions about his ability to maintain control over the university and perhaps even to remain in office.
 The latest conflict was set off by the abrupt announcement late last month that William C. Kirby, the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, the university's largest school, would step down in the summer. The arts and science faculty has scheduled a vote on Feb. 28 on a new resolution of no-confidence in Mr. Summers.
''I believe that the business of the university has been seriously compromised by this bad leadership and it has become evident to a lot of people on campus,'' Mary C. Waters, a sociology professor, said in an e-mail message.
 Mr. Kirby, a professor of Chinese history, has said the decision to relinquish his post was reached mutually with Mr. Summers, but many professors say they view it as a forced resignation, particularly because The Harvard Crimson, the student daily newspaper, quoted unidentified university officials as saying Mr. Summers had pushed out Mr. Kirby. 
 Professors are now demanding a significant role in the selection of a new dean, a decision that is ordinarily the province of the president and the six other members of Harvard's governing board. Mr. Summers has already agreed to give the faculty a bigger role than it has played previously, but some professors have begun calling for his removal from the process altogether.
 Some faculty members also say they would like the university's governing board, the Harvard Corporation, to force Mr. Summers to resign. Some professors have begun talking about adding a vote calling for Mr. Summers's removal to the Feb. 28 agenda, along with the no-confidence resolution.
 ''Is it not time to reverse this tide of chaos and dysfunction, to appoint an acting president, and to allow a new presidential search to be initiated?'' Farish A. Jenkins Jr., a professor of biology, recounted telling Mr. Summers at a closed faculty meeting last week. 
 Mr. Summers has declined to comment, and it is not clear where the board stands. Several members did not return phone calls seeking comment. Mr. Kirby, who will remain a Harvard professor, declined Monday to discuss his relationship with the president or the circumstances of his resignation.
 He spoke instead about ways he said the arts and science had improved in his four-year tenure. ''We've overseen a period of faculty growth in the last four years larger than the growth we've had in the last 40,'' Mr. Kirby said.
 Mr. Summers's critics said the anger unleashed by Mr. Kirby's pending departure was comparable to the uproar last winter over the president's suggestion that women's ''intrinsic aptitude'' might contribute to their low number in science and engineering. 
 At the extraordinary meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Science last week, about a dozen professors, including at least one department chairman, spoke bluntly to Mr. Summers for an hour about their deep reservations over how he ran the university. Several suggested that it was time for him to step down.
 They cited deficits in the budget of the Faculty of Arts and Science; what they described as a slowdown in the hiring of new faculty members in disciplines not favored by Mr. Summers; the departure of a number of senior administrators; and a $26.5 million settlement by Harvard of a civil suit filed by federal prosecutors that involved investments by a Harvard economics professor, a friend of Mr. Summers, who was working on a federal contract to help privatize Russia's economy. 
 No one stood up to defend the president, although he still appears to have considerable support among some segments of the faculty. 
 This latest debate comes after a relatively quiet fall semester. Mr. Summers survived the controversy that roiled the university last year, despite the no-confidence vote by the Faculty of Arts and Science in March, which passed 218 to 185. The governing board has continued to back Mr. Summers.
 Mr. Summers embraced a series of recommendations made in May by two committees he appointed on how Harvard could better recruit, support and promote women for the faculty, especially in science and engineering. He appointed several of his most public critics within the faculty to senior positions. And he apologized repeatedly for his remarks about women in science.
 Some of the president's supporters said his critics were now emboldened precisely because he sought accommodation last spring. 
 ''I think they feel that he is more and more vulnerable, because when he was attacked, he did not defend himself,'' said Ruth R. Wisse, a professor of Yiddish and comparative literature. ''I think that this is a posse looking for excuses to lasso its target.''
 The Crimson has twice written editorials in the last week chiding the faculty as allowing grievances with Mr. Summers to distract from what it said were more important matters, like revising the curriculum.
 The newspaper came strongly to the president's defense in an editorial Monday, saying he had done nothing conspicuously wrong, as it says he did a year ago in his comments on women and science, and did not warrant another vote of no-confidence. ''The time has come to move past the melodrama that plagued last year,'' the editorial said. "Summers has done his part; faculty members must do theirs.''
 Professors who support Mr. Summers say he has been moving Harvard forward.
 ''I think he's been a terrific president,'' said Edward L. Glaeser, an economics professor. ''There's no question that he's made some mistakes, but governing Harvard is very difficult.''
 Dr. Glaeser added, ''The idea of tossing the president out of the dean selection process strikes me as a really dangerous break from Harvard tradition.''
 Several supporters said the attacks on Mr. Summers had their root in political differences.
 ''These people are mostly the feminist left and its sympathizers,'' Harvey Mansfield, a professor of government, said of the president's detractors. ''They fear that affirmative action will be abolished or diminished. They want more diversity, which means, paradoxically, more people like themselves. They want to run the university, and I think that Larry Summers wants to take it in a different direction.''
 Many professors, though, continue to chafe under Mr. Summers, saying he has not altered his abrasive personal style or brought order to the university. ''The faculty didn't have the sense that the president had really turned the situation around,'' said Everett Mendelsohn, a professor of the history of science.
 Judith L. Ryan, a professor of German and comparative literature, who introduced the no-confidence resolution, said, ''He's a superb economist, but he has less experience in other fields.'' Ms. Ryan added: ''And we're troubled by that. And we're troubled by his emphasis on subjects that are of interest to him.''

HEADLINE: U.S. AND ISRAELIS ARE SAID TO TALK OF HAMAS OUSTER

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The United States and Israel are discussing ways to destabilize the Palestinian government so that newly elected Hamas officials will fail and elections will be called again, according to Israeli officials and Western diplomats.
 The intention is to starve the Palestinian Authority of money and international connections to the point where, some months from now, its president, Mahmoud Abbas, is compelled to call a new election. The hope is that Palestinians will be so unhappy with life under Hamas that they will return to office a reformed and chastened Fatah movement.
The officials also argue that a close look at the election results shows that Hamas won a smaller mandate than previously understood.
 The officials and diplomats, who said this approach was being discussed at the highest levels of the State Department and the Israeli government, spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. 
 They say Hamas will be given a choice: recognize Israel's right to exist, forswear violence and accept previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements -- as called for by the United Nations and the West -- or face isolation and collapse. 
 Opinion polls show that Hamas's promise to better the lives of the Palestinian people was the main reason it won. But the United States and Israel say Palestinian life will only get harder if Hamas does not meet those three demands. They say Hamas plans to build up its militias and increase violence and must be starved out of power.
 The officials drafting the plan know that Hamas leaders have repeatedly rejected demands to change and do not expect Hamas to meet them. ''The point is to put this choice on Hamas's shoulders,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ''If they make the wrong choice, all the options lead in a bad direction.''
 The strategy has many risks, especially given that Hamas will try to secure needed support from the larger Islamic world, including its allies Syria and Iran, as well as from private donors.
 It will blame Israel and the United States for its troubles, appeal to the world not to punish the Palestinian people for their free democratic choice, point to the real hardship that a lack of cash will produce and may very well resort to an open military confrontation with Israel, in a sense beginning a third intifada.
 The officials said the destabilization plan centers largely on money. The Palestinian Authority has a monthly cash deficit of some $60 million to $70 million after it receives between $50 million and $55 million a month from Israel in taxes and customs duties collected by Israeli officials at the borders but owed to the Palestinians.
 Israel says it will cut off those payments once Hamas takes power, and put the money in escrow. On top of that, some of the aid that the Palestinians currently receive will be stopped or reduced by the United States and European Union governments, which will be constrained by law or politics from providing money to an authority run by Hamas. The group is listed by Washington and the European Union as a terrorist organization.
 Israel has other levers on the Palestinian Authority: controlling entrance and exit from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for people and goods, the number of workers who are allowed into Israel every day, and even the currency used in the Palestinian territories, which is the Israeli shekel. 
 Israeli military officials have discussed cutting Gaza off completely from the West Bank and making the Israeli-Gaza border an international one. They also say they will not allow Hamas members of the Palestinian parliament, some of whom are wanted by Israeli security forces, to travel freely between Gaza and the West Bank.
 On Sunday, Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced after a cabinet meeting that Israel would consider Hamas to be in power on the day the new parliament is sworn in: this Saturday. 
 So beginning next month, the Palestinian Authority will face a cash deficit of at least $110 million a month, or more than $1 billion a year, which it needs to pay full salaries to its 140,000 employees, who are the breadwinners for at least one-third of the Palestinian population. 
 The employment figure includes some 58,000 members of the security forces, most of which are affiliated with the defeated Fatah movement.
 If a Hamas government is unable to pay workers, import goods, transfer money and receive significant amounts of outside aid, Mr. Abbas, the president, would have the authority to dissolve parliament and call new elections, the officials say, even though that power is not explicit in the Palestinian basic law.
 The potential for an economic crisis is real. The Palestinian stock market has already fallen about 20 percent since the election on Jan. 25, and the Authority has exhausted its borrowing capacity with local banks.
 Hamas gets up to $100,000 a month in cash from abroad, Israel and Western officials say. ''But it's hard to move millions of dollars in suitcases,'' a Western official said.
 The United States and the European Union in particular want any failure of Hamas in leadership to be judged as Hamas's failure, not one caused by Israel and the West.
 The officials say much now depends on Mr. Abbas, the Fatah-affiliated president who called for the January elections, has four more years in office and is insistent that Hamas has a democratic right to govern. 
 But Mr. Abbas has also threatened to quit if he does not have a government that can carry out his fundamental policies -- which include, he has said, negotiations with Israel toward a final peace treaty based on a permanent two-state solution. The United States and the European Union have strongly urged him to stay on the job and shoulder his responsibilities, the officials say.
 Western diplomats say they expect Mr. Abbas to repeat those positions in his speech on Saturday when the new parliament is sworn in, laying the groundwork for a future confrontation with Hamas. 
 In preparation for a Hamas-led government, Mr. Abbas is also said to be insisting on reinforcing his position as commander in chief of all Palestinian forces, even though the prime minister and the interior minister also have control over them through a security council that the prime minister chairs.
 On Monday the departing parliament made an effort to boost Mr. Abbas's powers by passing legislation giving him the authority to appoint a new constitutional court that can veto legislation deemed in violation of the Palestinians' basic law. 
 Mr. Abbas would appoint the nine judges to the new court without seeking parliamentary approval. Hamas immediately objected. ''The parliament has no mandate and no authority to issue any new legislation,'' said a Hamas spokesman, Said Siyam, adding that Hamas would try to overturn the decisions once the new legislature convened on Saturday.
 Hamas will control at least 74 seats of the 132-member parliament, and it is likely to have the support of six more members on key votes. But more than 10 percent of the new legislators are already in Israeli jails: 10 from Hamas, 3 from Fatah and one from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
 The United States and Fatah believe that the Hamas victory was far less sweeping than the seat total makes it appear, said Khalil Shikaki, a pollster and the director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. 
 In an interview in Ramallah, Mr. Shikaki said that if Fatah had forced members to withdraw their independent candidacies in constituencies where they split the votes with official Fatah candidates, it might have won the election. Half of the 132 seats were decided by a vote for a party list, and the other half by a separate vote for a local candidate.
 Hamas won 44 percent of the popular vote but 56 percent of the seats, while Fatah won 42 percent of the popular vote but only 34 percent of the seats. The reason? ''Fatah ran a lousy campaign,'' Mr. Shikaki said, and Mr. Abbas ''did not force enough Fatah independents to pull out.''
 If only 76 ''independent'' Fatah candidates had not run, Mr. Shikaki said, Fatah would have won 33 seats and Hamas 33. In the districts, Hamas won an average of only 39 percent of the vote while winning 68 percent of the seats, Mr. Shikaki said.
 ''Fatah now is obsessed with undoing this election as soon as possible,'' he said. ''Israel and Washington want to do it over too. The Palestinian Authority could collapse in six months.''
 New Hamas legislators were unimpressed. Farhat Asaad, a Hamas spokesman, and Nasser Abdaljawad, who won a seat in Salfit where two Fatah candidates split the vote, gave the United States ''a year or two'' to come around to the idea of dealing openly with Hamas.
 Mr. Asaad, a former Israeli prisoner, said: ''We hope it isn't U.S. policy. Because those who try to isolate us will be isolated in the region.''
 Hamas will move on two parallel fronts, he said: the first, to reform Palestinian political life, and the second, ''to break the isolation of our government.'' If Hamas succeeds on both fronts, he said, ''we will achieve a great thing for our people, a normal life with security and a state of law, where no one can abuse power.''
 Hamas will find the money it needs from the Muslim world, said Mr. Abdaljawad, who spent 12 years in jail and got a Ph.D. while there. Hamas will save money by ending corruption and providing efficiency. Hamas will break the Palestinian dependency on Israel, he said.
 Mr. Asaad laughed and added: ''First, I thank the United States that they have given us this weapon of democracy. But there is no way to retreat now. It's not possible for the U.S. and the world to turn its back on an elected democracy.''

HEADLINE: With Much of Northeast Coated in White, New England Resort Businesses Say, Why Not Us? 

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
While the weekend's record-breaking storm left 12 to 27 inches of snow from Virginia to coastal Maine, it spared Vermont, New Hampshire and western Maine, much to the regret of ski lift operators, snowmobile clubs and businesses already reeling from a warmer-than-normal winter.
 ''It makes me sick that you guys got that snow down there, and I'm sure you don't want it. It would be like falling gold up here, no doubt about it,'' said Ann Shangraw, president of the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers. 
 Association members have access to the state's snowmobile trails, about 80 percent of which are closed because of a lack of snow, Ms. Shangraw said. Annual memberships, which are $65 to $95 plus local club dues, have dropped by half, to about 18,000, because of the warm weather.
 ''We haven't even had six inches,'' said Ms. Shangraw, who lives in Williamstown, Vt. ''I could rake my lawn if I wanted to, and usually I can ride right out of my house.'' 
 While most large ski resorts with snowmaking equipment are faring well because of the low temperatures in the past week, smaller downhill resorts and cross-country areas are slashing the number of available trails and, in some cases, struggling to stay open.
 Magic Mountain in Londonderry, Vt., opened on Monday, the first weekday since Jan. 30, thanks to four inches from the weekend storm coupled with manmade snow.
 ''It's catastrophically bad,'' said Michael Gerow, a lift operator there. ''We're fighting it tooth and nail all the way, no question about that.''
 Across northern New England ice fishing tournaments have been called off, while the New England Sled Dog Club in Andover, Vt., has canceled or postponed three of its five races this year because of a lack of snow.
 But some areas with snowmaking ability could not be happier that areas like Boston and New York City bore the brunt of the storm.
 ''It's great. What we find is that when people get snow in their backyards they think about skiing and snowboarding,'' said Laurie Newton, a spokeswoman for Mount Snow in West Dover, Vt., which got four inches Sunday and where 79 of 104 trails were open. ''When you're in this business, you expect the ups and downs of the weather. To be honest, we know the snow will come; it's just a question of when.''
 Others are not so optimistic. Warren Miller, the owner of the Elmore General Store in Elmore, Vt., said that on a normal winter weekend 600 to 800 snowmobilers gas up and take a break for sandwiches and coffee at his store. Last weekend about a dozen stopped in, Mr. Miller said.
 ''We've been here 24 years, and this is our worst ever,'' he said. ''There's flat out no snow. When there's no snow, there's no business in Elmore. It's that simple.''
 The region is only about five or six inches below its normal snowfall totals, with 46.8 inches having fallen in Burlington, Vt., so far this year, said John Goff, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service there. An abnormally warm and rainy January made things melt quickly, Mr. Goff said, although it has been very cold in recent days.
 For some ski areas, the problem is not a lack of snow but a perception that the slopes are not covered.
 ''People come up here on a whim thinking that the conditions won't be that great, but they try anyway and are extremely surprised at how well-kept the mountains are,'' said Matt Zogby, a spokesman for Killington Mountain, Vt., which used 10 million gallons of water last week to make snow. ''It hasn't been all bad for us, and now that the temperatures are staying a lot colder, it improves the amount of snow we can make.''
 Art Woolf, a professor of economics at the University of Vermont, said he could not declare this winter a bust because not all of the economic data had been reported. But, he said, all signs point to a bad season for winter businesses.
 ''I can't believe it's going to be a very good year,'' Professor Woolf said. ''It's just a light snowfall year. The impulse travelers are the ones who are probably not going to be here this year.'' 
 He added: ''I think you'll see a lot of people not going to Vermont this weekend and staying in Massachusetts to ski.''

HEADLINE: U.S. ROYALTY PLAN TO GIVE WINDFALL TO OIL COMPANIES

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The federal government is on the verge of one of the biggest giveaways of oil and gas in American history, worth an estimated $7 billion over five years.
 New projections, buried in the Interior Department's just-published budget plan, anticipate that the government will let companies pump about $65 billion worth of oil and natural gas from federal territory over the next five years without paying any royalties to the government.
Based on the administration figures, the government will give up more than $7 billion in payments between now and 2011. The companies are expected to get the largess, known as royalty relief, even though the administration assumes that oil prices will remain above $50 a barrel throughout that period. 
 Administration officials say that the benefits are dictated by laws and regulations that date back to 1996, when energy prices were relatively low and Congress wanted to encourage more exploration and drilling in the high-cost, high-risk deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
 ''We need to remember the primary reason that incentives are given,'' said Johnnie M. Burton, director of the federal Minerals Management Service. ''It's not to make more money, necessarily. It's to make more oil, more gas, because production of fuel for our nation is essential to our economy and essential to our people.''
 But what seemed like modest incentives 10 years ago have ballooned to levels that have alarmed even ardent supporters of the oil and gas industry, partly because of added sweeteners approved during the Clinton administration but also because of ambiguities in the law that energy companies have successfully exploited in court.
 Short of imposing new taxes on the industry, there may be little Congress can do to reverse its earlier giveaways. The new projections come at a moment when President Bush and Republican leaders are on the defensive about record-high energy prices, soaring profits at major oil companies and big cuts in domestic spending. 
 Indeed, Mr. Bush and House Republicans are trying to kill a one-year, $5 billion windfall profits tax for oil companies that the Senate passed last fall.
 Moreover, the projected largess could be just the start. Last week, Kerr-McGee Exploration and Development, a major industry player, began a brash but utterly serious court challenge that could, if it succeeds, cost the government another $28 billion in royalties over the next five years. 
 In what administration officials and industry executives alike view as a major test case, Kerr-McGee told the Interior Department last week that it planned to challenge one of the government's biggest limitations on royalty relief if it could not work out an acceptable deal in its favor. If Kerr-McGee is successful, administration projections indicate that about 80 percent of all oil and gas from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico would be royalty-free. 
 ''It's one of the greatest train robberies in the history of the world,'' said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who has fought royalty concessions on oil and gas for more than a decade. ''It's the gift that keeps on giving.'' 
 Republican lawmakers are also concerned about how the royalty relief program is working out.
 ''I don't think there is a single member of Congress who thinks you should get royalty relief at $70 a barrel'' for oil, said Representative Richard W. Pombo, Republican of California and chairman of the House Resources Committee.
 ''It was Congress's intent,'' Mr. Pombo said in an interview on Friday, ''that if oil was at $10 a barrel, there should be royalty relief so companies could have some kind of incentive to invest capital. But at $70 a barrel, don't expect royalty relief.''
 Tina Kreisher, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said Monday that the giveaways might turn out to be less than the basic forecasts indicate because of ''certain variables.'' 
 The government does not disclose how much individual companies benefit from the incentives, and most companies refuse to disclose either how much they pay in royalties or how much they are allowed to avoid.
 But the benefits are almost entirely for gas and oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico.
 The biggest producers include Shell, BP, Chevron and Exxon Mobil as well as smaller independent companies like Anadarko and Devon Energy. 
 Executives at some companies, including Exxon Mobil, said they had already stopped claiming royalty relief because they knew market prices had exceeded the government's price triggers.
 About one-quarter of all oil and gas produced in the United States comes from federal lands and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 As it happens, oil and gas royalties to the government have climbed much more slowly than market prices over the last five years. 
 The New York Times reported last month that one major reason for the lag appeared to be a widening gap between the average sales prices that companies are reporting to the government when paying royalties and average spot market prices on the open market. 
 Industry executives and administration officials contend that the disparity mainly reflects different rules for defining sales prices. Administration officials also contend that the disparity is illusory, because the government's annual statistics are muddled up with big corrections from previous years.
 Both House and Senate lawmakers are now investigating the issue, as is the Government Accountability Office, Congress's watchdog arm.
 But the much bigger issue for the years ahead is royalty relief for deepwater drilling. 
 The original law, known as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, had bipartisan support and was intended to promote exploration and production in deep waters of the outer continental shelf. 
 At the time, oil and gas prices were comparatively low and few companies were interested in the high costs and high risks of drilling in water thousands of feet deep.
 The law authorized the Interior Department, which leases out tens of millions of acres in the Gulf of Mexico, to forgo its normal 12 percent royalty for much of the oil and gas produced in very deep waters.
 Because it take years to explore and then build the huge offshore platforms, most of the oil and gas from the new leases is just beginning to flow. 
 The Minerals Management Service of the Interior Department, which oversees the leases and collects the royalties, estimates that the amount of royalty-free oil will quadruple by 2011, to 112 million barrels. The volume of royalty-free natural gas is expected to climb by almost half, to about 1.2 trillion cubic feet.
 Based on the government's assumptions about future prices -- that oil will hover at about $50 a barrel and natural gas will average about $7 per thousand cubic feet -- the total value of the free oil and gas over the next five years would be about $65 billion and the forgone royalties would total more than $7 billion.
 Administration officials say the issue is out of their hands, adding that they opposed provisions in last year's energy bill that added new royalty relief for deep drilling in shallow waters.
 ''We did not think we needed any more legislation, because we already have incentives, but we obviously did not prevail,'' said Ms. Burton, director of the Minerals Management Service.
 But the Bush administration did not put up a big fight. It strongly supported the overall energy bill, and merely noted its opposition to additional royalty relief in its official statement on the bill.
 By contrast, the White House bluntly promised to veto the Senate's $60 billion tax cut bill because it contained a one-year tax of $5 billion on profits of major oil companies. 
 The House and Senate have yet to agree on a final tax bill. 
 The big issue going forward is whether companies should be exempted from paying royalties even when energy prices are at historic highs.
 In general, the Interior Department has always insisted that companies would not be entitled to royalty relief if market prices for oil and gas climbed above certain trigger points.
 Those trigger points -- currently about $35 a barrel for oil and $4 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas -- have been exceeded for the last several years and are likely to stay that way for the rest of the decade.
 So why is the amount of royalty-free gas and oil expected to double over the next five years? 
 The biggest reason is that the Clinton administration, apparently worried about the continued lack of interest in new drilling, waived the price triggers for all leases awarded in 1998 and 1999.
 At the same time, many oil and gas companies contend that Congress never authorized the Interior Department to set price thresholds for any deepwater leases awarded between 1996 and 2000.
 The dispute has been simmering for months, with some industry executives warning the Bush administration that they would sue the government if it tried to demand royalties.
 Last week, the fight broke out into the open. The Interior Department announced that 41 oil companies had improperly claimed more than $500 million in royalty relief for 2004. 
 Most of the companies agreed to pay up in January, but Kerr-McGee said it would fight the issue in court. 
 The fight is not simply about one company. Interior officials said last week that Kerr-McGee presented itself in December as a ''test case'' for the entire industry. It also offered a ''compromise,'' but Interior officials rejected it and issued a formal order in January demanding that Kerr-McGee pay its back royalties.
 On Feb. 6, according to administration officials, Kerr-McGee formally notified the Minerals Management Service that it would challenge its order in court. 
 Industry lawyers contend they have a strong case, because Congress never mentioned price thresholds when it authorized royalty relief for all deepwater leases awarded from 1996 through 2000. 
 ''Congress offered those deepwater leases with royalty relief as an incentive,'' said Jonathan Hunter, a lawyer in New Orleans who represented oil companies in a similar lawsuit two years ago that knocked out another major federal restriction on royalty relief.
 ''The M.M.S. only has the authority that Congress gives it,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''The legislation said that royalty relief for these leases is automatic.''
 If that view prevails, the government said it would lose a total of nearly $35 billion in royalties to taxpayers by 2011 -- about the same amount that Mr. Bush is proposing to cut from Medicare, Medicaid and child support enforcement programs over the same period.

HEADLINE: As Monsters Go, This Storm Had A Lighter Tread

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN; Reporting for this article was contributed by Janon Fisher, Robert D. McFadden, Colin Moynihan and Sam Roberts.

 BODY:
No one disputes it: The weekend snowstorm was the biggest since record-keeping began in 1869, delivering 26.9 inches to New York City in 24 hours. That's a half-inch more than the old record, set in 1947 by a swirling blizzard still described in awed tones by those who lived through it. This one will go down in the history books.
 And yet.
Even as the snow fell, and fell and fell, late Saturday and throughout Sunday, it never felt like the end of the world. Almost no one lost power. No one died from the storm. Hospitals were not swamped with shoveling-related heart attacks. No state, county, city or borough of emergency was declared. 
 By yesterday, life in the city felt amazingly normal, especially once the sun came out. Every single street was plowed and salted by morning in New York City, according to the Sanitation Department, so school was open and commuters could commute, if slowly. The snowscape had already become an inconvenience rather than a monument. Whither the sense (except, of course, at the airports) of having survived an Ordeal, the we're-all-in-this-together camaraderie that New Yorkers are periodically famous for? 
 Old-timers still speak reverently of the chaos and death wrought by the great blizzard of 1947 and the hardy resourcefulness it necessitated. New Yorkers of many ages can recall the blizzard of Jan. 7-8, 1996, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani closed the streets to nonemergency traffic, ordered New Yorkers to stay home from work and all but declared martial law. 
 Now that was a snowstorm for the books. The mayor said so himself. ''The city is being hit with the largest storm it's ever had,'' he announced gravely at City Hall. While he wasn't correct in the boring technical sense -- a piddling 20.2 inches fell -- in the perhaps more important perceptual sense he was.
 So if this weekend's storm was really the biggest, why did it not feel like it? Meteorologists and historians offered several reasons.
 The timing of the storm was obviously a big one. There was no rush hour to disrupt on Sunday, and the snow stopped soon enough for the plows to get in gear. The city had plenty of warning, and because the winter had been mostly a washout until then, the stockpiles of road salt were full. 
 Another big one was -- for lack of a better phrase -- the fluffy effect. Because the track of this storm was relatively far offshore, it did not pack the wallop of wet warm ocean air that northeasters can, so the snow was dry and fluffy. Very, very fluffy. Like a Persian cat in a roomful of hair dryers. Thus it blew right off tree branches rather than snapping them down onto power lines. It practically shoveled itself. 
 Perhaps perception, and the psychological need to embrace and even exaggerate the old days in one's memory, has led to past blizzards' being described in apocalyptic terms. Then again, people were shorter then, so the drifts may well have seemed deeper. Seriously.
 In 1947, New Yorkers were, on average, more than an inch shorter than they are today. In 1888, when the blizzard that is branded on the city's collective memory as the Greatest of All Time hit New York, people were, on average, about three inches shorter. 
 ''That would affect people's impressions of getting through deep snow,'' said Richard H. Steckel, an economics professor at Ohio State University, who has analyzed changes in human height.
 Also, back in 1888, the tallest building in the city was 11 stories.
 Billy Slavin and Earl Williams were not around in 1888, but they were in New York in 1947. Mr. Slavin is a retired Sanitation Department tow-truck driver. Mr. Williams, 65, drives a gypsum truck.
 As they sipped their midday beverages yesterday at the H. & S. Cichon American Legion Post in Elm Park, Staten Island, the men were talking meteorological history.
 They have seen their share of storms. In 1996, it took Mr. Williams two days to get out of the driveway. In 1978, his colleagues had to walk home from work because there was no way to drive. In 1947, Mr. Slavin's father had to walk out the front window to get to work. 
 News of the record-breaking storm that rolled through this weekend did not particularly impress Mr. Slavin. ''They keep records for Central Park,'' Mr. Slavin said. ''This is Elm Park.''
 Mr. Slavin hit on another mitigating aspect of this storm. There really was less snow in Elm Park. And it wasn't just Elm Park. Borough Park, Ozone Park, Parkchester, Park Ridge, Minnewaska State Park, the Vince Lombardi Park & Ride -- just about any park other than Central, the record-breaking storm actually broke no record at all.
 For according to Geoff Cornish, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, the heaviest snow fell in a 15-mile-wide band that passed directly over Midtown Manhattan, the southeastern Bronx and northwestern Queens. Thus La Guardia Airport in Flushing received 9 inches more snow than Kennedy, and nobody in Brooklyn saw even 20 inches, let alone two feet.
 In fact, of the 17.7 million people who live in the National Weather Service district that includes Central Park, fewer than half live in counties that recorded a two-foot snowfall.
 One more thing. Not to cast doubt on a record -- or on the hard-working people who keep it -- but do you know who measures the snow at Central Park? The security guards at the zoo. They read the numbers off a stick set in a flat, tree-ringed clearing near the sea lion pool.
 Therefore, the words, ''According to the National Weather Service, the snowfall in Central Park'' actually mean, ''According to the security guards at the Central Park Zoo.''
 In the final analysis, it's hard to imagine what old-timers will tell the young ones about this storm in 60 years, if anything.
 ''Grandpa, you were around during the great Blizzard of '06?''
 ''Well, it wasn't technically a blizzard, son, but yes.'' 
 ''Jeepers! What was it like?''
 ''It was, uh, snowy. I think I went sledding a couple of times. We had school the next day.'' 
 The boy returns to his cereal.

 The massive storm that swept across the Northeast left record snowfalls in many areas. The depths taken after the storm ended on Sunday are shown in inches. The heaviest snowfall in each county is shown in black.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Australia: Iraq Suspends Purchase Of Australian Wheat 

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER (NYT)

 BODY:
Iraq has suspended the purchase of wheat from the Australian wheat export company AWB pending an Australian royal commission investigation into allegations that AWB paid more than $200 million in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's government from 1999 through 2003, in violation of United Nations sanctions. Iraq's move is certain to please American wheat farmers. U.S. Wheat Associates, a trade association representing American wheat growers, had urged the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq to take similar action after Mr. Hussein was toppled in 2003, and has led an effort to have AWB investigated. The Australian trade minister, Mark Vaile, called Iraq's action ''regrettable given that Australia has been a reliable supplier of high quality wheat to Iraq for many years.'' RAYMOND BONNER (NYT)

HEADLINE: City's Hurricane Evacuees Can Stay On in Hotels for Now

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Paula King, a widow who lost everything when Hurricane Katrina hit her Mississippi town, awoke yesterday to the possibility of being evicted from the hotel room in Queens she has lived in since September. 
 Tens of thousands of evacuees across the country were moving out of their hotel rooms to comply with a deadline set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is no longer paying their hotel bills. Many were facing homelessness.
Then, word came that the Radisson evacuees were getting a reprieve. As a throng of television crews gathered outside for a midday news conference, hotel officials announced that despite the end of federal compensation for evacuees affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the 17 families remaining at the Radisson could stay on indefinitely. The more than 100 evacuees in six other hotels across New York City will also be allowed to stay for now, advocates said. 
 It was the latest of several eviction scares for local evacuees in the past month. At the Radisson, Mrs. King, 59, sank into her bed, sighed in relief and called the close call another episode of a life lived in limbo.
 Mrs. King had fled Biloxi, Miss., as the hurricane headed for the city, leaving behind her new four-bedroom home. Since September, her address has been Room 612 of the Radisson Hotel J. F. K. in Jamaica. She lives out of suitcases and stores her food in cardboard boxes.
 ''Now this is my bedroom, living room and dining room right here,'' she said, starting to cry. ''My church is gone, my friends are gone, there's nothing there. Everything is gone, just devastated. You wonder where the people are.''
 At the news conference, held on the first floor of the hotel, evacuees and their advocates criticized FEMA's decision to stop the hotel payments. 
 Charlie King, a lawyer and a Democratic candidate for New York State attorney general, said the evacuees in New York City would be protected by city and state housing laws and could not be thrown out without a formal eviction proceeding, which could take months. 
 Still, he said, given what many evacuees had already endured, ''it is just unbelievable that we are in this situation.''
 City Councilman Charles Barron criticized a federal judge's rejection of a last-minute appeal to extend the FEMA deadline, and urged New York's Congressional leaders to fight the ruling. 
 Other speakers called FEMA's decision to end the subsidies another example of the bungling that has characterized the government's response to Katrina, one of the worst disasters in American history. Brenda Stokely of the People's Hurricane Relief Fund called it ''the worst displacement of African-Americans and others since the Civil War.''
 In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Libby Turner, FEMA's transitional housing director, defended the decision.
 ''We looked at the situation and this is what we decided as the best way to go,'' she said.
 Ms. Turner said FEMA had spent $542 million on hotel accommodations for the hurricane evacuees. 
 About 88 percent of all evacuees staying in hotels and motels, or about 10,500 families, have moved into longer-term housing with rent-assistance checks from FEMA, she said. Evacuees still living in hotels are eligible for assistance from state, city and charity organizations, she said.
 Tony Pinto, the manager of the Radisson in Jamaica, said the hotel had been charging FEMA a $129 nightly rate. ''Were not throwing anybody out,'' he said. ''We're just following the rules.''
 The Rev. Donald Hudson, a Queens pastor helping local evacuees, said that many of the hotel guests who had moved into rental apartments were getting rental assistance from FEMA. But, he added, others have had trouble getting leases because of problems with credit checks, unemployment and skeptical landlords.
 Of the 373 families that came to New York City because of the hurricane, 245 have moved into apartments and other types of housing, said Angela Allen, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless Services.

HEADLINE: Screeners at the Heliport

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your Feb. 9 editorial about scheduled helicopter service at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport was unfair. It is wrong to criticize the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for working with the private sector to help revitalize downtown's transportation facilities and thereby increase trade, commerce and tourism. 
 That is one of the Port Authority's most important responsibilities.
Criticism of how many screeners are assigned to various facilities should be directed at those who make the decisions: officials of the Transportation Security Administration. 
 The Port Authority has been vigorous in seeking more screeners for our area, but it is up to T.S.A., not us, how many we get and where they are posted.
 And even if you were to argue that our support of the helicopter service would cause screeners to be transferred from an airport to the heliport, we are talking about 8 out of almost 4,000. It is hard to imagine that would have much of an effect at all.

HEADLINE: More Sticker Shock for the Weary

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Hotel stays are getting even more expensive.
 Anticipating strong demand by travelers of all kinds -- from business to leisure to groups -- hotels across the United States have begun to push rates up further this year.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm, predicts that the average daily hotel rate nationwide will rise by 5.8 percent this year, after an increase of 5.3 percent last year, and that in many major business travel cities, the increases will be even higher. In New York, according to a new report from the firm, the average price for a hotel room is projected to go up by 14 percent; in Miami, the figure is 9.1 percent, and in Chicago, 7.6 percent.
 ''The only things that will slow down the rate increase would be a severe economic slowdown and a lot of new hotel supply,'' said Michael Rietbrock, who follows the hotel industry for Citigroup Investment Research. ''There is not a lot of new supply coming.'' 
 Arriving in the wake of last year's rate hikes, the higher rates continue to make life difficult for corporate travel managers and business travel agents, who are trying to hold the line on employee travel expenses. They say business travelers are cutting the length of their business trips and looking for cheaper alternatives to their favorite lodgings. 
 Cindy Shumate, director of travel services for the Estee Lauder Companies, said her employer was putting its staff members up more often at limited-service hotels rather than more expensive ones. Limited-service hotels generally do not provide a restaurant or room service.
 Ms. Shumate says that as rates climb, she is having ''stronger conversations'' in her negotiations with hotels about including amenities such as high-speed Internet access, breakfast, fitness club access and parking in Estee Lauder's corporate rates.
 Bjorn Hanson, a lodging specialist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that hotels can impose higher rates because ''demand growth is strong in every category -- business travelers, groups and conventions and leisure travelers, and it's strongest in major cities.'' 
 Strengthening demand is also the result, he said, of ''some unwinding of constraints on business travel in the last five years.''
 He further attributes the rate increases to hotels' continuing investments in amenities, like nicer bedding, flat-screen televisions and high-speed, wireless Internet access. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that hotels in the United States spent a record $4.8 billion on these amenities last year and will spend an additional $5 billion this year.
 The consulting firm projects that the average daily rate charged by hotels in the United States will jump to a record $96.11 in 2006, from $90.84 in 2005. The projected 2006 rate also represents the second-highest percentage increase since 1985; only the 6.4 percent increase in 1996 was greater, and that was from a lower base rate.
 PricewaterhouseCoopers further predicts increases in the average daily rate of 8 percent in Philadelphia this year, 7.8 percent in Washington and 7.2 percent in Los Angeles.
 The consulting firm also expects that the increase in the average daily rate in San Francisco will mirror the national average, while rate increases in Atlanta, Dallas and Orlando, Fla., should drop below the national average, rising only 5.3 percent, 5.2 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.
 Mr. Hanson said that increases in the rates paid by business travelers will vary in the 10 cities. But during peak periods, he said, business travelers will probably pay even more than the average daily rate increases: for example, he said, some business travelers in New York may pay 30 percent more during peak times.
 Mr. Rietbrock of Citigroup said he expected domestic rates paid by business travelers to rise about 8 percent this year, compared with last year's increase of 7 percent.
 One reason business travelers are willing to accept the increases, he said, is ''the emergence of discounted airlines, which have made the cost of air travel a lot more affordable.'' That, he said, has ''opened up a lot of space in the corporate travel budget, and hotels partially have filled this gap.''
 Major hotel chains also forecast high-single-digit increases in rates paid by business travelers this year. Hilton Hotels Corporation, for example, predicts that rates paid at Hilton-owned hotels by what are called transient business travelers -- executives who do not use a negotiated, corporate rate -- will climb 9 to 10 percent. Marriott International says its negotiated corporate rates will rise an average of 7 to 9 percent, while transient rates will climb slightly less.
 One factor contributing to chains' ability to impose increases, said Marc A. Grossman, Hilton's senior vice president of corporate affairs, is that ''in a lot of big cities, including New York, you're seeing a shortage of first-class hotel space, with conversions of hotels into condominiums.''
 Although hotel chain officials say they do not see signs of business travelers cutting back on their stays or trading down to less expensive brands, corporate travel managers and agents disagree. Almost 94 percent of the corporate travel managers responding to a survey on 2006 costs by the National Business Travel Association, a trade group, identified a trend in the industry ''to book fewer luxury hotels in favor of midclass properties.''
 Nicholas Lananna, the New York-based chief of travel and general services for Unicef, said that the average hotel rate paid by his employees in the United States had jumped from $159 in 2003 to $188 late last year. ''We may have to look into raising our per diem,'' now pegged at $275 for lodging, meals and other expenses, he said.
 Individual business travelers are also taking steps to control hotel costs.
 Anky van Deursen, a marketing consultant at NuVista Strategies in Los Altos, Calif., said that to keep clients' costs low, her company did not permit stays at hotels that charge more than $200 a night.
 So, for a trip she planned for this week, she made reservations at a Hilton Garden Inn in New York, the Courtyard Los Angeles Marina del Rey and the Hilton Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport Mall of America. Previously, when she visited these cities, she would stay at the Grand Hyatt, the Westin Bonaventure and the Minneapolis Marriott City Center.
 ''There will be more driving to where I need to go, and it took me a day to print out the maps from my computer,'' she said. ''They will probably be all right, but you never know.'' 
 To cut her hotel costs, Sharon Adcock, a technology consultant in Manhattan Beach, Calif., now stays at Hampton Inn or Fairfield Inn hotels rather than full-service Marriott or Hilton hotels. She says she also uses discounts offered by organizations such as the American Automobile Association and books stays using prepaid, nonrefundable rates, which are often cheaper than other rates. 
 Last year, to reduce her hotel bill, she took a red-eye flight to New York, arriving on the morning a convention started rather than the night before. ''In the past,'' she said, ''my personal policy was never to do red-eyes.''

HEADLINE: Bush Advisers Foresee Robust Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Economic growth will be robust for several years and inflation will remain tame, fueling an expansion that will keep unemployment low and foreign investment flowing into the economy, White House aides said yesterday. 
 ''The economy has shifted from recovery to sustained expansion,'' according to an annual report that the White House Council of Economic Advisers prepared for President Bush. Mr. Bush's economic aides said foreign investors would probably continue to contribute to financing the current-account deficit, though at lower rates than recently.
 ''While U.S. capital inflows can continue indefinitely, recent levels of net inflows received are likely to moderate in the future,'' the report said. At more than 6 percent of gross domestic product, it said, ''U.S. net inflows are unusually high by historical standards.'' 
 To reduce the imbalance, the United States needs a higher savings rate, economies in Europe and Japan need to expand more rapidly and China needs ''greater exchange rate flexibility'' and a stronger banking industry to increase domestic demand, the report said.

HEADLINE: World Trade Group Rules Tax Benefits by U.S. Illegal 

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization ruled yesterday that tax breaks the United States gives to some of its largest companies are illegal and the European Union said it would impose new trade sanctions in three months unless the tax breaks were abolished. 
 The ruling is the second in four years involving tax breaks that the United States granted to 6,000 exporters, including Boeing, Microsoft and General Electric, initially under the Foreign Sales Corporation program and subsequently under the American Jobs Creation Act.
The W.T.O. rejected an appeal by the United States of a trade organization ruling that the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 failed to bring the United States into compliance with the first ruling, which had held that tax breaks provided under the Foreign Sales Corporation arrangement amounted to unfair subsidies. 
 The initial ruling, made in 2002, allowed the European Union to impose $4 billion in sanctions on imports from the United States. 
 Those sanctions were lifted when the American Jobs Creation Act was passed. But the W.T.O. subsequently ruled that the act perpetuated the illegal subsidies with a two-year phaseout of the tax breaks and a grandfather clause covering exporters that had sales contracts dated before Sept. 17, 2003.
 Peter Mandelson, the European Union's top trade official, reiterated his concerns about the tax breaks on Monday, saying that the change in the laws had failed to rectify the situation.
 ''The tax benefits preserved by the jobs act have been repeatedly declared in violation of W.T.O. rules,'' he said. ''The E.U. will not accept a system of tax benefits which give U.S. exporters, including Boeing, an unfair advantage against their European competitors.''
 In 2004 the European Union imposed only 5 percent of the $4 billion worth of sanctions it was allowed to charge. This time trade officials said they plan to impose 14 percent, or $560 million, of the $4 billion in the form of additional customs duties on American imports.
 The office of the United States Trade Representative issued a statement Monday urging the European Union not to impose sanctions. ''Prolonging this dispute will not serve to foster harmonious trans-Atlantic relations,'' the statement said. 
 The dispute about tax breaks for American companies dates back to the mid-1980's but it became more complicated when the United States and the European Union both turned to the World Trade Organization to try to resolve a separate dispute over subsidies to Boeing and Airbus.
 European trade officials argue that Boeing is the single biggest beneficiary under the American Jobs Creation Act. If nothing is done to repeal the law, Boeing will benefit from $615 million over the next 10 years, according to the European Commission.
 American trade officials also made a link between this longstanding dispute and the relatively new one over subsidies to Boeing and Airbus. ''New sanctions will reinforce the perception that the E.C. is primarily acting in response to the U.S. filing of a W.T.O. complaint against Airbus subsidies,'' the trade representative's office said.

HEADLINE: City's Day Of Delays, Shoveling And School

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and MIKE McINTIRE; Reporting for this article was contributed by Ann Farmer, David M. Herszenhorn, Michael Luo, Patrick McGeehan and Richard Perez-Pena.

 BODY:
As commuters throughout the New York region returned to work yesterday, the routines of daily life had a hit-or-miss quality. Major city streets were cleared, but officials warned of possible floods from melting snow as meteorologists projected midweek temperatures in the low 50's. The city's public schools were open, though many Catholic schools were closed. On the economic front, companies reported delays in deliveries, but hotels and restaurants said stranded travelers seemed to make up for canceled reservations.
 The storm crippled the morning rush on the Long Island Rail Road, but the city's subways and buses largely ran on schedule. Many air travelers had to grapple with the lingering effects of the storm: at 6 a.m., LaGuardia Airport became the last of the region's three major airports to reopen, yet a shortage of planes on the ground there forced the cancellation of about 100 outbound flights and an equal number of arrivals.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the northeaster, which began late Saturday and ended late Sunday, ''the biggest snowstorm in the city's history.'' Parts of the region, however, received much less snow than Central Park, where the snowfall was the deepest ever recorded, 26.9 inches. 
 Since the storm left the region and warmer weather was returning, the city shifted its efforts from clearing major traffic arteries to tackling the mounds of snow that have arisen like pyramids at street corners. Some side streets, like Park Place in Lower Manhattan, were all but given over to hills of snow taken there by the city's trucks.
 The city's sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty, said he was particularly concerned about removing the snow piles at 300,000 street corners and making sure that the adjacent sewer drains were clear. 
 ''That's what I'm really concerned about, those catch basins,'' he said. ''As it gets warm, you're already seeing flooding on the corners. I mean, you've got to wear your high boots out there or be a great broad jumper. You can't get through the intersections right now, and that's frustrating.'' 
 Mr. Doherty said his department gave building and property owners four hours after the end of the snowfall to clear their sidewalks. Only ''a very small number'' of summonses, if any, were issued to violators, he said, in part because his enforcement agents were being used to oversee squads of temporary workers hired to shovel snow for $10 an hour, or $15 after 40 hours. By late yesterday, more than 500 had been hired. 
 The police said that a sanitation employee, Anatoly Zaborsky, 60, crashed his plow yesterday into two vehicles at 85th Street and 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, and was charged with driving while intoxicated. 
 Some hospitals reported taking in patients with storm-related injuries. St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan in Greenwich Village treated a man who was knocked unconscious when a snow-laden storefront awning collapsed on his head, said Dr. Yves M. Duroseau, director of urgent care. He said he also saw several slip-and-fall injuries. At Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, Dr. Joseph Feldman, chairman of the emergency department, said ''we had some partial finger amputations'' from snowblower accidents. 
 The leftover snow snarled commutes for tens of thousands of riders. 
 The Long Island Rail Road, which cut back service during the storm, did not resume carrying Manhattan-bound passengers into Pennsylvania Station until about 7:15 a.m., and full service was not restored on the Port Washington branch until 2:19 p.m. 
 Two hours later, as the outbound rush began, signal problems in an East River tunnel caused the railroad to cancel three trains due to leave between 4:43 and 5:11. A fourth train, the 4:54 to Farmingdale, was taken out of service because of equipment problems at Jamaica, Queens. The snow also halted service between Ronkonkoma and Greenport, forcing the railroad to run shuttle buses until 5:17. 
 For many, the storm's aftermath disrupted everyday routines. School attendance citywide yesterday was 62 percent, though it was 87 percent on the last three Mondays. Elementary school attendance yesterday was 66 percent, middle school 65 percent, and high school 52 percent.
 The city's decision to keep schools open angered some parents. ''I have no idea why it's open after the worst snowstorm New York City ever had,'' said Louisa Ruby, 46, whose twin girls are third graders at Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where some parents pulled their children to school on sleds. ''What is the mayor trying to prove?''
 Her daughter Emily chimed in, ''I would really rather be throwing snowballs and playing with my friends than going to school.''
 At a news conference, Mayor Bloomberg said: ''There was no reason to close public schools today. What we're trying to do is to get our kids an education that they're going to need for the rest of their lives.'' He added that while ''the streets were certainly passable,'' it was ''probably a little bit annoying for some people, a little bit tougher to get to school on a day like today.''
 Catholic schools in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island were closed yesterday. Local superintendents for each borough made their decisions separately on Sunday night, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, adding that he expected the schools to be open today. At Catholic schools in Brooklyn and Queens, the decision was left to individual principals.
 Car owners are in luck. Alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules will be suspended today, but parking meter rules are being enforced and city officials urged people to dig out their cars from the snow.
 By certain measures, business activity in the city was slower than usual yesterday, a drop-off that may have been partly due to the observation of Lincoln's Birthday, which, while not a legal holiday, is treated as a day off by some employers.
 A Midtown tourism information center logged far fewer visitors than normal, and theaters reported that cancellations by out-of-town ticket holders were up, although some of the tickets were grabbed by bargain seekers.
 Courier services reported that the number of requests for deliveries from corporate offices, retail stores and other customers was down as much as 50 percent. 
 Food distributors in the Bronx saw their delivery operations brought to a crawl because of the snow, but most remained open or were closed for only a short time, said Bruce Reingold, general manager of Hunts Point Cooperative Market, a wholesale meat market that serves about 200 tractor-trailers a day.
 ''Sunday is a heavy day for us, because everyone's inventory runs low at the end of the week and they need deliveries,'' he said yesterday. ''Every small street around here was blocked. It was taking trucks 45 minutes just to get down the street. But today, things are getting back to normal.''

HEADLINE: Working to Sell Advertisers on Newspapers and Magazines 

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE print media, beset by intensifying competition for advertising dollars, are seeking to strike back.
 Trade organizations for the newspaper and magazine industries plan to introduce elaborate and expensive campaigns that tackle a daunting task, persuading marketers and agencies to think better of print as an ad medium. Both are suffering from sluggish growth as they face off against the Internet, e-mail marketing and other, newer rivals.
The magazine campaign is scheduled to start first, on Feb. 27, with a series of eye-catching ads for the Magazine Publishers of America from Mullen in Wenham, Mass. The campaign, to be formally announced today, is the second part of a three-year, $40 million effort on behalf of the magazine industry.
 The focal point of the magazine campaign will be ads for eight brands and products like Altoids, sold by Kraft Foods; Cover Girl, made by Procter & Gamble; the Infiniti car line, sold by Nissan Motor; and J. C. Penney. The ads are slyly designed to look as if they have been ripped from the magazines in which they appear. Text next to the torn-out ads makes the point that magazines engage readers with ''ideas that live beyond the page.'' 
 The newspaper campaign, to be announced Monday, is scheduled to begin March 20. It is being created by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., for the Newspaper Association of America, which hopes its members will donate ad space worth as much as $50 million to run the campaign this year.
 The newspaper campaign takes a humorous tack to pitch the virtues of buying ad space; one ad, for instance, declares, ''Every day we try to print something that people on the right and the left can actually agree on. We call it 'advertising.' '' The campaign asserts that the advertising in newspapers, unlike that in some other media, is ''a destination, not a distraction.''
 Both trade organizations have recently run campaigns aimed at Madison Avenue. But the need for the print media to make their case in a more noticeable, even intrusive, manner is growing as their share of advertising revenue shrinks.
 ''I'm surprised they haven't tried to do something like this sooner,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, who follows the ad industry for Merrill Lynch.
 ''There's still value in print advertising, but advertisers are assessing the return they're getting from it,'' she added. The difficulties for the print media were encapsulated in a report Ms. Fine published yesterday about the newspaper industry. The headline called 2005 ''a year to forget.''
 A specialist in the newspaper industry, Miles E. Groves of MG Strategic Research in Washington, echoed Ms. Fine's concerns.
 ''The weak performance of the industry coming into 2006 makes it tough on the forecast I thought was pretty bearish to begin with,'' Mr. Groves said. He predicted in December that ad spending in newspapers would rise 3.4 percent this year from 2005.
 Previously, sluggish growth for newspaper ad revenue was typically attributable to a poor economy or even a recession, Mr. Groves said. But now ''there's more going on here than a cycle,'' he said, as many marketers ''look for better ways to tell their stories, like more investment in direct marketing, one-to-one marketing, online marketing.'' 
 John Kimball, chief marketing officer at the newspaper association, based in Vienna, Va., acknowledged that newspapers were ''somehow, in the minds of many people, a medium that's in this great trouble.''
 ''When you dig a little deeper, we have a compelling story,'' he said, ''but we didn't tell it to anybody.''
 So the newspaper association returned to Martin, with which it worked on a campaign in 2003, and also met with agencies and advertisers.
 From that came a decision to focus the campaign on the idea that consumers may ''buy subscription radio to avoid commercials, TiVo commercials on TV and hate pop-up ads on the Internet,'' Mr. Kimball said, ''but would not want to read a newspaper that did not contain advertising.''
 One ad makes that point in a cheeky manner. ''What made freedom of the press so important to the founders?'' a headline asks. The answer: ''Maybe it was the coupons.''
 The newspaper industry was ''spending a lot of time on the defensive,'' said Earl Cox, partner and chief strategy officer at Martin, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. ''A lot of people have written off newspapers as old-school and static, but consumers don't just read newspapers, they use them, to research and shop for the things they want to buy.''
 In addition to appearing in newspapers, the campaign is to run in trade publications like Advertising Age, Adweek, mediapost.com and mediaweek.com. A Web site dedicated to the campaign (naa.org/advertiser) is to be put up next month.
 The magazine campaign will run in the same trade publications and on the Web sites of national newspapers. The magazine association also plans a Web site dedicated to the campaign (magazine.org/beyondthepage). 
 The mock torn-out ads will also appear in the thousands of free copies that agencies receive of more than 30 magazines, including BusinessWeek, Cosmopolitan, Family Circle, Fortune, Maxim, Men's Health, Newsweek, Vanity Fair and Woman's Day.
 Reminding media professionals that consumers rip ads out of magazines ''is very visceral,'' said Nina B. Link, president and chief executive at the magazine association in New York. ''They get it immediately.''
 ''We want to show that magazines are where consumers are going to engage in the advertising,'' she added, ''and that engagement leads to action.''
 The other advertisers scheduled to take part in the campaign are also big brands: American Express; Lexus, sold by Toyota Motor; Microsoft; and XM Satellite Radio.
 Mullen, another Interpublic agency, took over the magazine campaign after the closing of the New York office of Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, which created the first phase.
 Last year's ads had futuristic themes, including magazine covers designed to look as if they had been published decades from now. The message was that whatever new media may emerge, magazines are here to stay.
 ''It felt a teeny bit defensive,'' said Edward Boches, chief creative officer at Mullen, ''as if you were not coming at it from your strong suit.''
 ''We came into it with a very aggressive thought, that magazines are getting a bad rap,'' he added. ''The people who read them are doers and trend-setters, who are a very desirable target audience, and this is a different way of saying they are engaged in magazines.''

HEADLINE: Changes Ahead For a Theater Near You

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LET'S say you decide to take a break tonight and go out to a movie. It's Wednesday, of course, so when you walk up to the ticket counter, there is not another person in line. You settle on ''Glory Road,'' an inspirational basketball movie that has been out for a month. The theater is so empty that it almost feels as if you are watching it in your den. Your ticket costs $8.
 Now it's the weekend. You meet up with some friends to see ''Date Movie,'' a spoof that has just opened to good buzz. You have to stand in a long line to get a ticket, and the only seats you can find are in the third row. It is clearly a hot ticket. Yet it costs the same $8 as ''Glory Road.''
 This isn't the way much of the American economy works. It's not how airlines sell seats, the Gap sells shirts or eBay sells anything. 
 Soon, it won't be the way the movies work either. You will pay more for a ticket on the weekends and less on weekdays. You'll be able to buy a reserved seat in the center of the theater for a few extra dollars. One of these days, you may even have to pay more for a hit movie than for a bomb. The changes are under way, and they are long overdue. 
 The theater industry's attempt to ignore the laws of supply and demand is as good an example of corporate inertia as you will find. For decades, going to the movies was one of the rituals of American life, and competition among theaters revolved mainly around trying to land more hot films than the theater down the street.
 But now theaters face a very different competitive landscape, thanks to DVD's, high-definition TV's, Netflix and TiVo. Family night at the movies, meanwhile, can cost $60. It's no wonder that the share of disposable income spent on moviegoing has fallen a stunning 17 percent in just the last three years. 
 There is no easy fix for industry. But it's clear that it can't afford to leave easy money sitting on the table any longer, which is why executives are finally thinking about a more sensible business model. It is called variable pricing, and the first step is likely to be extending the old matinee discount to weeknights. ''I predict we will see it within a year,'' said Peter C. Brown, who runs the nation's second-biggest theater chain, AMC Entertainment, which invented the multiplex in the 1960's and the armchair cup holder in 1981. ''There are people looking at it. I'll leave it at that.''
 VARIABLE pricing has been around as long as outdoor markets, but the modern version of it really began at American Airlines more than 20 years ago. Robert Crandall, the chief executive, was trying to beat back a discount airline named People Express, and he devised a computerized system he called ''yield management'' to adjust prices constantly. 
 American sold cheap tickets to vacation travelers who were willing to fly when planes weren't full and expensive ones to last-minute business travelers who were never going to choose People Express anyway. The goal was figuring out exactly how much somebody was willing to pay to fill a seat and then selling the person a ticket at that price. It worked.
 The Internet has basically recreated Mr. Crandall's system across the economy. Businesses can tweak prices to maximize revenue, and consumers can shop around. We are now comfortable with the idea that books, concert tickets or, yes, movies can have very different price tags, depending on convenience and demand. On Amazon, the new two-disc ''Harry Potter'' DVD set costs $6 more than the two-disc ''Rent'' set. 
 But this is a tricky game, which is why so many companies are still struggling with it. You may recall that Coca-Cola announced in 1999 that it was thinking about installing thermometers in its vending machines and charging more on a hot day. Economically, it makes perfect sense that a cold soda is worth more when the temperature hits 90. But consumers thought they were being gouged, and the ensuing uproar caused Coke's executives to insist that the plan was never serious.
 It is not entirely rational, but shoppers usually need to be tempted with a discount first. Companies can sneak in a surcharge later, as part of a broader price increase. Or they can offer obvious benefits to people willing to pay more. That is how the theaters are proceeding: slowly and quietly, so that people won't notice the change until it's too late.
 The chain that probably has the best understanding of this is National Amusements. It has recently opened 10 upscale multiplexes, mostly in the East and Midwest, and has plans for more. In each, at least two theaters have wider seats and sell only reserved tickets. Every ticket costs about $2 to $3 more than in the other theaters. 
 Last fall, the company also started advertising ''Bargain Tuesday'' at many of its theaters, when all tickets cost just $5, even less than matinees do on other days. (Other theater chains that use weeknight pricing usually offer a discount of $1 or less, which doesn't make enough of a difference.) 
 The idea, on either end of the spectrum, is that people should be able to buy the product the way they want it -- or they might not buy it at all. A theater can't sell marked-up popcorn to someone who doesn't buy a ticket first. 
 The toughest job for the industry will be putting different prices on different movies, and we are not likely to see much of it anytime soon. If a theater cut the price of a movie on its opening weekend, it would announce that the film is a dog, turn off the audience and offend the studio. But theaters are starting to tinker.
 In December, the Ziegfeld theater in New York charged more for the first week of ''The Producers.'' Another option, Mr. Brown of AMC points out, is to mimic the old second-run movie houses and cut the prices of most movies after they have been in theaters for a few weeks.
 ''It's a bit of a slippery slope,'' he said, ''when you start to be someone who would be suggesting that, say, 'King Kong' is a product that should be priced differently from 'Memoirs of a Geisha' or 'Capote.' Because ultimately it is art.''
 Fair enough. But the next time you're in an art gallery, check the price tags to see if all the paintings cost the same.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Euro Zone Growth Slows to 0.3%

BYLINE: BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Growth in the $9 trillion euro zone economy grew only 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, when it expanded at twice that rate, the European Union's statistics office said in Luxembourg. The German economy, the region's largest, failed to grow, a separate government report showed. But European finance ministers expressed optimism in the face of the sluggish figures. ''The fourth-quarter growth results for the euro zone were rather disappointing, below what we'd expected,'' Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg, above, said after leading a meeting of his counterparts in Brussels. ''Nonetheless, we have a view that growth is strengthening.'' Euro area growth weakened as oil prices held near $60 a barrel and the United States economy grew the least in three years. The commission will update its growth forecasts next week.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Restaurants, Unsung to Famous, Are Leading a Revival

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Gerri Valene has been eating at Galatoire's for decades, and so she was apparently quite comfortable giving her hips a little shimmy and plopping down at the table next to the couple from Missouri, her Champagne glass as steady as a trained dachshund. 
 ''They say Missouri is the Show-Me State!'' bellowed Ms. Valene, 60, at the man, one of the few tourists in the place, who was celebrating his 75th birthday. ''So show me, hon!'' 
Across the room, a woman in a large turquoise hat, festooned with something floral, teetered toward the back of the restaurant, three martinis in, and paused to examine the large table of off-duty lawyers. 
 Once again, New Orleanians have begun to return to the elegant main dining room of this famous Bourbon Street restaurant, whiling away the better part of each Friday afternoon downing oysters en brochette and eggs Sardou, preceded (and followed) by ample doses of martinis and old-fashioneds. And they are not the only ones with full stomachs.
 From the French Quarter to the area near Tulane University, from the highest-end bistros to the tiniest neighborhood rice-and-bean joints, restaurants are leading the slow economic and spiritual revival of New Orleans, outpacing every other business but the ones that repair damaged homes. 
 With many of the city's neighborhoods still in rubble and its population scattered across the nation, restaurants have been able to capitalize on their ability to provide three things that depleted local residents are still unable to get at home: calories, comfort and conversation. Of the 3,400 eating establishments across the New Orleans metropolitan area, 35 percent have been recertified to open, according to the Louisiana Restaurant Association.
 Every night across the functioning parts of the city, restaurants and bars are packed with patrons: children with their parents downing pizza Uptown; heavily pierced, studiously cranky twenty-somethings eating beans in the Quarter; out-of-town lawyers spending their per diem at Cuvee and Emeril's in the warehouse district; and the Friday lunch crowd at Galatoire's. The restaurants stand in stark contrast to many other New Orleans businesses that remain empty or bereft of customers. 
 ''Today it feels like nothing ever happened,'' said Lana Werner, a Galatoire's Friday regular, whose chair was tied with five black balloons to mark her 50th birthday. Her gift from five girlfriends: a bottle of Champagne, wrapped in a piece of blue tarp used to cover blown-away roofs, tied with yellow ''caution'' tape. 
 While New Orleans struggles to recover from Hurricane Katrina, restaurants are still hampered by a lack of workers, many of whom cannot find affordable housing. In many cases, the lack of help has forced many restaurants to limit their hours. And the recovery in this area, like that across much of the city, leaves behind many poor and black residents, whose restaurateurs lack resources and, because many operated in the most devastated areas of the city, customers. 
 Although restaurants catering to tourist and conventioneers often fared best in the past, restaurants catering to local clienteles appear to be coming out on top right now. Many residents still do not have working kitchens, and, frankly speaking, going out to eat is one of the few entertaining things to do in town.
 ''We used to have 250 people on the weekends, and now we have maybe 180,'' said Donald Link, the chef at Herbsaint, a well-known restaurant in the Central Business District. ''But now we have 80 to 100 during the week when we used to serve 50. New Orleanians like to eat out, and it has been kind of a healing process for them to do it.''
 Mr. Link said he felt bullish enough about the restaurant business in New Orleans to open another one next month.
 Less than a month after the storm, New Orleans residents sought comfort in any restaurant that dared to open. Kappa Horn, who owns Slim Goodies, a diner on Magazine Street, said that when she came back three weeks after the levees broke, she quickly found customers waiting in the parking lot for her each morning.
 Some hauled in ice, others mixed pancake batter. Ms. Horn still lacks enough employees to stay open past 2 p.m. because workers from the city cannot afford the skyrocketing rents to return. ''It's give-and-take at this point in New Orleans,'' she said. 
 While far more restaurants have opened and many more returning residents are getting their kitchens back in order, eating out remains a fierce tradition, none other quite so than Fridays at Galatoire's.
 After serving classic Louisiana dishes in the same fleur-de-lis wallpapered spot for a century, Galatoire's flung open its doors last month for the first time since Hurricane Katrina, welcoming back the artists, judges, remarkably blond ''charity organizers'' of a certain age, restaurateurs, former Saints football players and random others who have spent much of their lives lining up patiently every Friday in their jackets, ties and pumps, awaiting a table with their favorite waiter, requested by name. 
 (Or paying someone else to stand in line for them, someone who cannot afford a $29.50 platter of crabmeat and shrimp, someone who, in some cases, cannot afford a home.)
 Galatoire's customers line up for their spot in the morning (reservations are taken only for the upstairs room, a place for tourists only) and then begin their morning with gin and tonics, bloody Marys served with a green bean and the like at the bar before retiring to their table. There they are given a choice of what to eat from what the waiter suggests: fish dishes and New Orleans specialties. The whole affair lasts deep into the afternoon, at which point people in Chanel suits have been known to toss rolls at each other. 
 Mimi Peake, a BMW dealer with a diamond ring that could be mistaken for one of the oysters, said she felt that Fridays at Galatoire's told the world her city would be back.
 ''The people aren't all here,'' Ms. Peake said. ''But the spirit is.''

HEADLINE: What Fuel Bills? U.S. Consumers Still Spending 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Shaking off a middling holiday shopping season and fears of higher heating bills, Americans spent freely in January, the government reported yesterday, providing reassurance that the economy is beginning the new year with fresh strength. 
 Buoyed by the unexpectedly robust spending data and a drop in oil prices, investors sent stocks higher across the board. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1 percent, to 1,275.53, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed above the 11,000 level again, climbing 1.3 percent, to 11,028.39. Crude oil prices dipped below $60 for the first time since late December.
''The momentum going into 2006 is clearly healthy,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan's private client services group. ''We will be able to withstand weaker growth for the rest of the quarter and almost not miss a heartbeat.'' 
 While many economists expect spending increases to slow for the rest of the winter, the strong consumer spending and solid job gains last month helped overcome fears that economic growth was about to stagger under the weight of rising energy costs, higher interest rates and a slowing housing market. The jump in retail sales virtually assures that economic growth, which slowed to just 1.1 percent for the final quarter of 2005, will register a much stronger showing in the first quarter of 2006.
 Retail sales jumped 2.3 percent last month, recovering from a modest 0.4 gain in December, to register their biggest monthly increase since May 2004. Americans, flush with year-end bonuses, took advantage of the warmest January on record, leftover gift cards and enticing discounts to shop avidly for clothes, furniture and cars.
 There was little doubt that the unusually warm weather last month contributed to the strong start for the economy this year. Temperatures averaged 39 degrees for the country as a whole -- the highest on record for January -- and 8.5 degrees warmer than the average for the month, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
 Warmer weather helped bolster inventories of oil, natural gas and other energy sources, pushing down prices -- at least for now -- and leaving consumers more to spend on other things like food and clothes.
 Gary Nicosia, 29, a waiter in Buffalo, said mild weather shaved $100 from his home heating bill last month and let him dine out, guilt-free, two to three times a week.
 ''It was so warm out we had our windows open,'' he said.
 Sales at restaurants and bars, a measure some economists look to as a barometer of consumer sentiment, rose 3.2 percent in January.
 The increasing use of gift cards, which stores count as sales when they are redeemed, appears to have pushed some holiday sales into January from December. The National Retail Federation had projected that gift card sales would increase 7 percent, to $18.5 billion, during the holiday shopping season. 
 Many retailers, including Abercrombie & Fitch and Coach, introduced spring lines earlier than usual to entice consumers back into their stores, stocking polo shirts and floral-patterned handbags in midwinter.
 ''There is no question gift cards helped,'' said Peter E. Nordstrom, president of full-line stores at Nordstrom, the high-end department store, which reported strong sales of handbags, sunglasses and lingerie. 
 Over all, sales at department stores rose 1.6 percent last month after a relatively weak holiday season.
 January proved a strong month for a wide range of retailers, including chains like Gap and Kmart, which have struggled for much of the last year. 
 Still, the role of the weather and gift cards -- both seen as one-time benefits -- suggest that January's economic gains are not likely to maintain their strength over the next few months.
 Already, the weather has turned markedly cooler and last weekend's record snowfall in the Northeast forced some store closures in New York City and elsewhere.
 Economists also noted that gasoline prices and other energy costs, in spite of the recent drop, could easily reverse course with a persistent cold snap.
 ''We will see much weaker sales in February,'' said Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. ''I think consumers will be harder pressed to spend the way they have been spending.''
 But few analysts now fear that consumer spending will fall off a cliff. Job gains and wage growth, typically the leading factor in consumer behavior, appear to be on an upward trajectory after their post-Katrina sluggishness of last fall. The economy added 193,000 jobs in January; wages rose 0.4 percent; and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent, its lowest level in four and a half years.
 ''The deep fundamentals, the personal income numbers, are healthy,'' said Gregory Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Bank in Atlanta.
 With growth picking up again, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to increase its benchmark short-term interest rate, currently at 4.5 percent, at least once but possibly twice more over the next few months before it brings its tightening cycle to an close. They will be paying particularly close attention today and tomorrow to the Fed's new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who is scheduled to testify to Congress for the first time since replacing Alan Greenspan. 
 ''The way data is coming in sort of confirms the high probability that the Fed goes to 5 percent,'' Mr. Miller said.

HEADLINE: Chester, Pa., Depressed for Years, Awaits a Casino 

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: CHESTER, Pa. 

 BODY:
As a former industrial planner at the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Monir Z. Ahmed can mentally recreate every square foot of the 64-acre shipyard on the Delaware River southwest of Philadelphia.
 But Mr. Ahmed, a Chester native whose father also worked at Sun Ship, hopes he won't recognize a square inch of the property when he attends the opening of the new Harrah's Chester Casino and Racetrack there this summer.
''I pray it's 100 percent different, because that's progress,'' said Mr. Ahmed, who serves on the City Council of this once-proud industrial powerhouse. ''We're not a manufacturing country anymore.'' 
 Mr. Ahmed should get his wish. 
 As the Las Vegas-based Harrah's Entertainment Inc., the world's largest casino company, pushes forward with a $429 million gambling complex, all but one of the 27 shipbuilding structures have been demolished. 
 All that remains is the steel skeleton of the fabricating shop. It will act as the bones of a four-level entertainment complex that will put slot machines and gambling on harness races under one roof.
 Even a wet dock did not escape conversion. It was covered by a bridge to make way for the first and second turns of a five-eighths-mile harness track.
 The sense of optimism in Chester surrounding the waterfront project, which is about seven miles south of Philadelphia International Airport, is in sharp contrast to the reactions of some other Pennsylvania communities as developers scramble to get a share of the coming gambling action. Legislation passed in 2004, which allows for 14 slots operations, has generated more than two dozen proposals from Allentown in the east to Erie in the northwest corner of the state. 
 While some casino projects, like a proposed gambling resort near historic Gettysburg, have met with intense opposition, Chester has adopted a more pragmatic attitude. Officials see the Harrah's project as a potential economic engine that will bring new investment, service jobs and increased revenues to a Colonial-era city that has been battered by high unemployment, poverty, crime and drugs in recent decades.
 ''Chester has a different starting point than Gettysburg in terms of its economy and image,'' said John W. O'Neill, an assistant professor of hospitality management at Pennsylvania State University.
 Despite its rich industrial, social and cultural heritage, Chester has not had much to brag about in recent decades. The city's poverty rate is nearly three times higher than the statewide figure, while its schools rank near the bottom, said Keith W. Reeves, who heads the Center for Social and Policy Studies at Swarthmore College. The population has dropped almost in half, to 36,854, from its World War II level.
 ''It's interesting that in a city with 25 houses of worship per square mile, the ministers have not preached against the casino from the pulpit,'' Mr. Reeves said. ''I think the community is essentially saying: We'll take the casino and the racetrack and the potential negative externalities that will come with it, provided the revenues are reinvested in the community.''
 Harrah's plans to create 800 to 900 new jobs, a big boost for a city with just 6,000 private-sector jobs. What's more, the gambling legislation guarantees Chester a minimum $10 million in revenues, which represents almost 29 percent of the city's current budget.
 There are benefits for Harrah's, as well. The site, which is on Industrial Highway, next to a state prison, is designated as distressed under a community development program. As a result, Harrah's is eligible for a range of state and local tax breaks through 2013, including local property tax relief.
 Chester is not troubled by the tax abatement. David N. Sciocchetti, executive director of the Chester Economic Development Authority, said the city's so-called Keystone Opportunity Zone did what it was set up to do: attract new business to a blighted area.
 While the city has not done an economic-impact study, Mr. Sciocchetti predicts the daily influx of visitors to Chester will prompt new restaurants, gas stations and businesses catering to tourists. He also sees an opportunity for companies that will supply the complex with goods and services. 
 Already, real estate investors are showing interest in buying vacant properties, said Mayor Wendell N. Butler Jr.
 Harrah's is the managing partner in the development company, which also includes three Pennsylvania business executives as limited partners.
 For some residents, the abandoned shipyard was a painful reminder of Chester's glory days as part of the ''arsenal of democracy.'' Still, Kim McCarron of SOSH Architects in Atlantic City recalled being somewhat awestruck when she first visited the site. 
 ''It had a ghostlike quality to it,'' Ms. McCarron, the project architect, said. ''You could just picture what had been there.''
 Today, work is continuing on the waterfront racetrack, with plans for a 45-day meet starting this summer, said Vince Donlevie, general manager of Harrah's Chester.
 When designing the stone-dust track, Daniel Coon of Charles E. Coon & Sons in Lexington, Ky., worked around challenges left by the previous owners, like the wet dock, the area where work was completed on ships after they were launched. A substantial portion of the 131-stall paddock has been completed.
 The entertainment building, which is attached to a parking garage, will house an area to simulcast the races, as well as races from tracks across the country. It will also have restaurants, a clubhouse, a banquet room, a V.I.P. lounge and a casino. 
 The 100,000-square-foot slots parlor, designed to hold 2,750 machines, is scheduled to open early next year, pending state gambling licensing approval. Because the slots parlor is part of a parimutuel racetrack, the granting of a license is almost guaranteed, Mr. O'Neill said. Altogether, the development will total nearly 700,000 square feet.
 Designers said those who have visited the site understand the appeal of the scenic view of ships passing by on the river. 
 ''I can't think of a racetrack where you look out over the back stretch and see the water,'' Mr. Coon said. ''It's very striking.''

HEADLINE: Hot Niche in the Rental Market: Housing for the Elderly

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
AFTER terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center, the owners of a nearby luxury retirement and assisted-living home wondered if their new project was also doomed. Would elderly people want to live just four blocks from Ground Zero?
 Four years later, the 14-story building, known as the Hallmark of Battery Park City, is fully rented and there is a waiting list with 40 names.
In Palo Alto, Calif., a new $370 million Classic Residence by Hyatt next to Stanford University charges entry fees ranging from $586,500 to $4.3 million. Monthly charges range from $3,105 to $7,430. The development opened in June and is already 88 percent full.
 Only a few years ago, the commercial real estate sector known as senior housing was in trouble. Inexperienced (and sometimes unscrupulous) developers had overestimated the demand for assisted living and underestimated how long it would take to fill their units. With a strong economy and readily available capital, many companies went public, but by the late 1990's, their stocks had tumbled. Bankruptcies mounted, and many operators went out of business. 
 These days, however, the sector is in much better shape. ''Without a doubt, the industry is quite healthy now,'' said David S. Schless, president of the American Seniors Housing Association, a trade group. ''One of the things we're seeing is a growing acceptance on the part of institutional investors and others that typically have not been willing to invest in senior housing.''
 Unlike age-restricted housing developments for active people in their mid-50's or older, senior housing is aimed at a more frail population, usually people in their 80's.
 Residents have their own apartments (with kitchens), but their monthly fees include two meals or more as well as many social activities. Medical care is generally an added expense. Many homes also include units for people who need help with daily activities and for Alzheimer's patients, and some -- like the Palo Alto development -- also offer nursing care.
 Development has slowed considerably since the 1990's. Last year, the top operators built 23,000 units, compared with 62,000 in 1999, said Robert G. Kramer, president of the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industries, a research organization in Annapolis, Md. 
 The number of public companies operating senior housing with services has shrunk from 18 to 6, and share prices have soared. ''The industry is absolutely in a rebound in terms of the stock performance,'' said Jerry L. Doctrow, a managing director at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, a brokerage and investment banking firm. 
 Shares of Brookdale Senior Living, the rapidly expanding Chicago company that owns the Hallmark in Lower Manhattan, have risen from $19 at the company's public offering in November to $31.93 at yesterday's close.
 In recent years, senior housing operators have been experimenting with different models. Sunrise Senior Living, for example, which used to specialize in assisted living, now offers a variety of housing types and services, including home health care. The company is also building condominium developments in Bethesda, Md., and Dallas, which will have the type of common areas and treatment rooms usually found only in rental buildings. 
 ''Anybody who thinks that one size fits all is somebody who's going to fail,'' Mr. Kramer said ''The customer is looking for choice.''
 For investors, senior housing is often seen as an appealing alternative to traditional apartment buildings because the initial returns, or capitalization rates, are higher -- an average of 9 percent, compared with 5 percent or less for conventional apartments.
 Competition among investors for quality retirement homes has been increasing, however, and those properties are selling faster than they used to, said Mel Gamzon, president of Senior Housing Investment Advisors, a brokerage company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Some high-end homes are trading for as much as $225,000 a unit, according to the trade group, and capitalization rates for some properties have fallen to 7 percent or less.
 ''There's absolutely no question that dollar for dollar you get a much better return,'' said Gary R. Lucas, managing director for senior housing in the San Francisco office of Marcus & Millichap, an investment firm. ''But there is also a higher risk. It's not just real estate. It's not just a business. You're taking care of humans.''
 One reason these properties are risky is that ever-rising labor costs make up a high percentage of an operator's expenses. According to industry figures, operators offset these increases by raising monthly fees by 4 percent to 6 percent a year. 
 In an October 2005 report, based on telephone calls to 873 assisted-living homes in 87 major markets throughout the country, the MetLife Mature Market Institute, a research arm of the insurance company, found that monthly rates had increased by 15.1 percent from 2004 to 2005 -- a figure that other senior housing specialists said was wildly off base. (When different levels of care were quoted, researchers used an average figure, which might have accounted for some of the discrepancy, said Sandra Timmermann, director of the institute.)
 Operators need to know their market and avoid, say, installing chandeliers in places where they might not be welcome, said Noah R. Levy of Prudential Real Estate Investors, who manages senior housing funds. ''If you give me a not-so-fancy building but you've got a great operator, it can be a spectacular investment,'' he said. ''But give me a perfect building with a not-so-great operator, and I could lose a lot of money.''
 Mr. Levy said he has only recently begun investing in large-scale developments that offer a range of care within the same building or campus and require a sizable entry fee, which is usually partly or mostly refundable when the resident moves or dies.
 In the past, pension fund investors have tended to shy away from these so-called continuing care retirement communities because it was hard to pin a value on the real estate. About three-quarters of them are owned by nonprofit groups. Among them is the Amsterdam at Harborside in Port Washington, N.Y., which is being developed by Greystone Communities, now owned by Sunrise. Entrance fees will range from $399,000 to $1.9 million, and monthly charges will be $2,600 to $6,000. 
 The upscale version of this model is more profitable than other types of senior housing, but building such projects often requires years of planning. In New York, a state with only eight such developments, 70 percent of all the units have to be sold before developers can break ground, which means that potential residents have to be willing to wait. 
 ''Some of my residents have told me, 'We don't even buy green bananas,' '' said Randal J. Richardson, the president of Classic Residence by Hyatt, a subsidiary of the hotel company. ''They say, 'We want to move in today.' '' Hyatt hopes to get final approval soon on a long-delayed project in Briarcliff Manor in Westchester County that will be similar to the new development in Palo Alto.
 While many companies are growing through acquisition, Sunrise has 50 projects under development, said Paul J. Klaassen, chief executive of Sunrise. Only a handful are condominiums, including the two projects in Bethesda and Dallas, where units will probably be priced from around $500,000 to $2 million, with monthly fees about twice what an ordinary condo would command. Two floors with rental units will be set aside for people who need more care.
 Response has been good, Mr. Klaassen said, but it is too early to tell if the ownership model will catch on. ''We don't know if it's going to be the next S.U.V. or minivan -- or if it's just going to be a niche player,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bush to Exert More Pressure On China Over Trade Rules

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Using stern language, the Bush administration said yesterday that it would exert more pressure on China to adhere to global free trade rules.
 But in a report, the United States trade representative, Rob Portman, did not ask for or threaten any specific sanctions against the Chinese, an omission that will not escape the notice of both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who have been calling for the administration to take a far tougher line with China. 
 The report came just four days after the United States announced a record trade deficit of $201.6 billion with China for 2005. That report stoked what was already a heated debate about the role that free trade has played in the loss of American jobs caused by a shift in production to lower-cost countries like China.
 At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Portman registered concern about China's enforcement of intellectual property rights and the lack of openness of its markets to American goods and services, a reference to Chinese restrictions on certain foreign investments and trade in financial and other professional services.
 Noting that American trade with China ''lacks equity, durability and balance in the opportunities it provides,'' Mr. Portman said: ''This disparity is due in part to China's failure to honor certain commitments, including its failure to enforce intellectual property rights, its protection and support for certain domestic industries, and its refusal to fulfill certain market opening commitments.''
 The report said that Mr. Portman's office would establish a chief counsel for China trade enforcement who will lead a task force to ensure better compliance by China with rules of the World Trade Organization. The report, which was first disclosed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, also called for coordinating China trade policy with other countries and working with Chinese officials on improving financial, antitrust and agricultural regulations.
 The steps are far milder than what many lawmakers have asked for. In the Senate, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have proposed imposing a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese goods until Beijing allows its currency to float more freely against the dollar. The senators say they may bring their bill up for a vote as early as March. 
 Last summer, the Chinese government allowed the yuan to appreciate against the dollar and float in a narrow band, giving in to pressure by its Western trading partners who have said China's artificially cheap currency gives its goods an unfair advantage on the world market. 
 In a statement released yesterday, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that the yuan had risen to a new high since last summer. It said that further appreciation would be gradual, given that the Chinese government ''places priority on promoting balanced international payments this year.'' One dollar currently buys about 8.0472 yuan.
 Mr. Portman's office does not have jurisdiction over currency matters. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, who has taken the lead role for the administration on the yuan, has repeatedly called on China to further relax the yuan's peg to the dollar but has resisted calls for sanctions.
 Most economists say protectionist measures could cause harm by distorting global trade and raising the price of imported goods that Americans rely on. They also note that many financial institutions in China are not structurally sound enough to survive the instability that would come with a fully convertible yuan.

HEADLINE: G.E. Sees Much to Like In Alternative Energy

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
It's hard to be in a business where you literally -- as well as figuratively -- are tilting at windmills. But that business may have just gotten its biggest tail wind yet. 
 When President Bush called last month for more effort in alternative energies, a business that last year attracted only about $7 billion in investment nationwide, the 300 engineers and financiers at GE Energy Financial Services were already in the game. But that does not mean they were not happy that the White House acknowledged the sector.
''The president's speech changed zero for us; it was simply a recognition of what we already knew,'' said David L. Calhoun, vice chairman of GE Infrastructure, the group that includes both turbine manufacture and energy financing. 
 For now, wind energy is the only profit star in G.E.'s alternative energy galaxy, and both the finance and equipment sides of the company know they are gambling when it comes to solar and other fledgling technologies. Still, analysts applaud their decision to move on them. 
 ''When you get the president talking about renewable energy, it has to be turning up the dial at G.E.,'' said Deane M. Dray, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who has an outperform rating on General Electric shares. 
 Certainly, it is getting attention from Energy Financial Services. The unit recently bought a wind farm in Germany and is installing new turbines there at a rapid pace. It has invested in solar energy farms in California and is in the end stage of negotiations for a large solar project in Europe. Indeed, renewable energy projects already account for $1 billion of the unit's $11 billion portfolio and are its fastest-growing niche. ''The renewables space has really heated up, and I hope it will account for 20 or 30 percent of our investments in five years,'' J. Alex Urquhart, the unit's president, said.
 Today, alternative energy financing is barely a footnote in G.E.'s revenue stream. But the G.E. machine is gearing up for change. On Jan. 30 -- a day before the president bemoaned the nation's ''addiction to oil'' -- Mr. Urquhart carved out a separate group to focus solely on renewable energy projects. Lorraine Bolsinger, who runs G.E.'s Ecomagination program, says she has begun to ''run the financial projects through our scorecard process'' to see which ones she should include in her group of G.E.'s ''green'' products.
 The pace is quickening in G.E.'s industrial camp, too. Energy equipment and related services, which accounted for about $42 billion of G.E.'s $149.7 billion in revenue last year, is G.E.'s largest industrial business. Alternative energy products like wind generators accounted for less than $6.3 billion of last year's sales.
 Four years ago, G.E. bought Enron's wind-turbine unit, and it is now a $2 billion business, heading rapidly toward $4 billion. In five years, G.E. expects that alternative energy products will account for more than a quarter of energy equipment revenue. 
 If that happens, it will probably be a boon for Energy Financial Services, too. Last year, energy financing got plucked out of G.E.'s financial stable and placed under Mr. Calhoun's umbrella, along with the equipment makers.
 The financial team members say that working side by side with the technical equipment gurus is helping them pick and choose among potential investments. They get early alerts, they say, on which blade designs and composites make for the most efficient wind turbines, on whether solar energy is gaining momentum, or whether the technologies will have any resale or reuse value if a project does not work out or a borrower defaults.
 ''Only 60 percent of our projects involve G.E. technologies, but the global research center helps us decide which technologies to invest in,'' said Kevin Walsh, managing director of Energy Financial's new renewable energy group.
 The potent mix of expertise is already paying off. Energy Financial, for instance, invested in a solar farm in California after G.E.'s industrial experts gave the project -- which does not use G.E. equipment -- a thumbs-up. The energy finance specialists are helping Mr. Calhoun evaluate the economic potential of a coal gasification project; if it proves viable, they will help promote and finance similar projects elsewhere. 
 G.E. is not alone in backing renewables, of course. In November, Goldman Sachs committed to investing $1 billion in renewable energy, and it is already ''well on its way'' to achieving that, according to Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman.
 J. P. Morgan Chase, too, has said it will invest more than $250 million in wind-energy projects. And venture capitalists have for some time been investing in smaller renewable energy projects and technologies.
 Over all, says Michael T. Eckhart, president of the nonprofit American Council on Renewable Energy, the $7 billion invested in renewable energy projects last year should increase by 25 percent a year over the next few years.
 He and many others say they believe that, if the president's imprimatur results in new regulations or tax incentives, even more Wall Street money will be attracted to such projects.
 Wind power has been the leading alternative energy source in recent years. The costs of turbines have come down even as their reliability and efficiency have increased; G.E., Goldman, J. P. Morgan Chase and others are snapping up wind farms across the world.
 By contrast, persistent shortages of silica, needed to make solar panels, have kept the solar energy sector from taking off on a similar trajectory.
 And few Wall Street dollars are going to projects that involve wresting megawatts from agricultural waste, be it crops like corn or the switchgrass Mr. Bush mentioned. And there has been almost no interest, at least so far, in methane generated from manure. 
 Industry supporters see President Bush's speech as sending a new signal that might favor some of the more exotic energy sources, though. ''Now that the president has put the power of the bully pulpit behind ethanol,'' Mr. Eckhart said, ''a lot of conservative people who thought biofuels were silly will view them as a mainstream investment.''
 For now, investors say that the logistics of selecting sites for factories and transporting biofuels keep them from being economically competitive. ''George Bush said interesting things about potential opportunities in biomass, but we need a better understanding of any legislative or regulatory changes his comments might spur,'' Mr. Van Praag of Goldman said.
 GE Energy Financial Services has taken a few tentative steps toward biomass. It has a longtime, if small, investment in plants that burn woodchips for fuel. It is seeking advice about potential biofuel investments from colleagues at Jenbacher, an Austrian company G.E. bought in 2003 that makes generators that run on the gases emitted from landfills. And Mr. Urquhart said he is ''going to keep calling our people in Washington, and see what kind of rule-making is evolving around the biofuel idea.'' 
 In the meantime, he is keeping his eye out for projects that might merit investment even without additional government incentives. Mr. Calhoun has his eyes on Mr. Urquhart's quest, in case it turns up something G.E. should buy or make. 
 ''Alex helps us decide where to put our development dollars, and we help him evaluate where to invest,'' Mr. Calhoun said. ''And if he finds a great biomass plant, we'd be delighted.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Cuts Funds for Family Planning Overseas, Stirring Opposition

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush, who acted on his first full day in office five years ago to deny federal aid to overseas groups that help women obtain abortions, is for the first time proposing sharp cuts in financing for international family planning programs that the White House had described as one of the best ways to prevent abortion. 
 Since 2001, the administration had adhered to Mr. Bush's commitment to maintain the financing of such programs at $425 million, the same level as in the last year of the Clinton administration.
But in the president's new budget proposal, financing would fall 18 percent, from $436 million this year to $357 million. 
 The cuts are stirring strong opposition from nonprofit groups and Democrats on the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees responsible for foreign aid. They say the reductions would mean more unintended pregnancies for the world's poorest women, and more dangerous abortions in countries where the procedure is outlawed.
 ''It's ironic that an administration outwardly committed to reducing the incidence of abortion would take away valuable tools for preventing unwanted pregnancies,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York.
 Ed Fox, an assistant administrator at the United States Agency for International Development, said the budget cuts for family planning should be viewed in the broader context of large proposed increases for presidential initiatives to combat AIDS and malaria that will greatly benefit women. 
 He also pointed to a $21 million program to help African women combat sexual violence.
 ''This is a much better budget than we've had in the past for women's health,'' he said.
 The extent of the reductions for family planning became apparent only this week when Mr. Fox provided an overall estimate of financing from ''all spigots'' in both the State Department and A.I.D. budgets -- a figure requested Wednesday. The budget released Feb. 6 contained clues to the decline in financing but not the total number.
 The disagreement over Mr. Bush's approach to family planning services in developing countries dates back to one of his first acts as president. On Jan. 22, 2001, he reinstated a Reagan-era rule that prohibited the financing of groups that provided abortion services, counseled women about abortion or advocated for the legalization of abortion.
 Critics of this policy called it the ''gag rule'' because it penalized groups that pushed for changes in laws. 
 The International Planned Parenthood Federation, with membership associations in 151 countries, lost an estimated $15 million a year in federal financing because it refused to comply, said its director general, Dr. Steven W. Sinding.
 Just last week, on the same day the president's budget was introduced, the British development agency announced a global program for safe abortion, pledging about $4.5 million to Planned Parenthood to carry it out. 
 In a news release, the agency said the funds were intended to ''support work on abortion that has suffered or been neglected as a result of the Global Gag Rule.''
 Even as the abortion debate raged, the administration had stuck to a commitment the president made the same day he reinstated the Reagan-era rule. 
 A White House news release said President Bush would maintain the $425 million financing level because he knew family planning services were ''one of the best ways to prevent abortion.''

HEADLINE: Following Alan Greenspan

 BODY:
The new chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, delivers his first report to Congress today, covering interest rate policy and the Fed's economic forecast for this year and next. 
 It's a big moment for Mr. Bernanke, and perhaps for the economy. The new chairman's success at establishing his Street cred will be a big factor in controlling that most unpredictable of economic forces: market psychology.
His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, could help by playing the circumspect banker a while longer. Last week, days after becoming a private citizen, Mr. Greenspan talked privately to an audience at Lehman Brothers, the world's biggest bond-trading outfit. His remarks were promptly leaked, and traders quickly concluded that interest rate increases were bound to continue. 
 The extent to which Mr. Greenspan's remarks moved the markets is debatable. We also don't know how accurate the leaks were. (It does seem unlikely that Mr. Greenspan has suddenly taken to speaking with crystal certainty, as suggested by the traders' interpretation of what he is supposed to have said.)
 What's not arguable is that any transition at the Fed is tricky, and that this one is particularly fraught. What will happen to consumption -- and economic growth -- when the housing boom subsides? Will Mr. Bernanke cut interest rates if housing prices tank, as Mr. Greenspan did after the Internet bubble burst? Would the new chairman even be able to do that, given that higher rates help to attract the foreign capital to cover America's deficits? How would more rate increases affect deeply indebted households? 
 Mr. Greenspan's devotion to the strength and integrity of the Federal Reserve is beyond doubt; the institution's solidity owes much to his leadership. But the public and the markets need to have confidence in the new chief, and that is best built by hearing from Mr. Bernanke without what is likely to be interpreted as cues from the wings or, worse, cross talk.

HEADLINE: Fed Nominees Vow to Make Inflation Control a Top Priority

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The nominees for the Federal Reserve, Randall S. Kroszner and Kevin M. Warsh, said yesterday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee that controlling inflation was the best way to keep the United States economy growing. 
 Stable prices are ''crucial to achieving maximum employment and overall economic stability,'' Mr. Kroszner, 43, a University of Chicago economist, said. Mr. Warsh, 35, a White House adviser, said he was devoted to keeping prices in check and fostering ''maximum sustainable employment.''
 If confirmed, Mr. Warsh and Mr. Kroszner would join the Fed's board of governors as the central bank begins its biggest transition in almost two decades. Ben S. Bernanke, who succeeded Alan Greenspan as chairman two weeks ago, has pledged more openness and will need support from Fed members for new policies like a numerical inflation goal.
 Mr. Bush's nomination of Mr. Warsh, a lawyer by training who would become one of only two members of the Fed's seven-member board of governors without a Ph.D. in economics, has been greeted by criticism and bewilderment by some former Fed officials and economists. They point to his political connections and inexperience, and say the White House could have found a better-known, more qualified choice.
 ''The Warsh nomination came out of left field,'' said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, which monitors the Fed.
 If Mr. Warsh and Mr. Kroszner are confirmed, Bush will have appointed all seven members of the Fed board. The reaction to Warsh contrasts with the praise Mr. Bush has received for his other appointments.
 The new governors would provide Mr. Bernanke, an academic specialist on central-bank policy, with banking and markets expertise and return the Fed's board to a full seven members for the first time since June.

HEADLINE: Closed By Snowstorm? On the Contrary

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Middlefield, Conn. 

 BODY:
HAD he not become entranced with the idea of running a water park, Ken Leavitt would not be where he is today: checking the weather like a doctor monitoring a patient's vital signs, praying for snow, sounding like someone who has come to realize that an M.B.A. and a master's in international management are entirely insufficient training for the ultimate business challenge -- running a mom and pop ski center during this bipolar winter.
 But at least he's still in business, a week after balmy winter weather forced him to shut down the Powder Ridge ski area in central Connecticut and lay off its 300 employees. Three days later, last weekend's storm allowed him to turn on a dime and open it back up. 
''What was it that John Lennon said, 'Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans?' '' Mr. Leavitt said in the blessed chill of his reopened ski center on Monday night, as snowblowers blasted out geysers of frigid mist. ''Before this, I co-founded a high-tech company that grew to $20 million in international sales in five years, and that was much easier than operating a ski area. Much easier.''
 Mr. Leavitt's circuitous path to Alpine economics began after he and his brother sold their high-tech company, CGX Corporation, and he was on vacation with his family in Florida. Visiting Disney World in 1986, they realized everyone had more fun at half the price at a nearby water park, Wet 'n Wild. Soon he was traveling the country visiting water parks -- he has since gone to 90 or so -- with the idea of creating a natural park that is less towers and slides and more a natural attraction for a family outing built into a mountain.
 Eventually, he settled on a promising site in central Connecticut on the grounds of a beloved local ski area that the Zemel brothers, Herman and Louis, had started in 1959. With attractive demographics -- more people in a 15-mile radius than in the entire state of Vermont -- he figured he could run it as a ski center in the winter and a water park in the summer.
 And then things began to go awry. There was community opposition to building the water park and he was not prepared for the myriad complications of the process of getting permits. Ten years after buying the 300-acre property, less than 100 of it used for skiing, it's still just a ski area, though he finally has the approval to build the water park and is considering building houses as well.
 Still, in a good year, the ski area works -- as does his family. His wife and two daughters help run the place. Powder Ridge isn't like Killington or Stowe in Vermont. Its vertical drop is 500 feet, compared with 3,050 at Killington, and its annual attendance of 100,000 doesn't compare with the big boys with higher hills and better snow farther north. 
 But that is also its appeal, and Powder Ridge, particularly on weekdays, functions as a local ski center in the best sense, where kids go after school, the Glastonbury Special Olympics ski team comes to practice, where high school students from Durham, Middletown or Middlefield sell hot dogs one day and snowboard the next. 
 IN fact, that's part of what allowed him to reopen. He called it quits after the warmest January in history, when rain washed away the snow and strips of grass surfaced on the mountain. He said at the time it would take a foot of snow or more for him to reopen.
 When he got 18 inches last weekend, local officials and loyal customers formed a phone tree to get in touch with employees and season-ticket holders, and then many of them decided to fill in as workers for no pay. So on Monday the help included Bonny Fowler and Karen Fowler, sisters-in-law married to a chiropractor and an engineer, who bused tables, while Bonny Fowler's 9-year old son, Luke, skied with a friend.
 Aside from running a business, Mr. Leavitt's experience thus far has allowed him to formulate Leavitt's First Principal of Thermodynamics, which states that there is a correlation between the costly production of man-made snow and the certainty of rain, a formulation which may be proved again later in the week, with more rain predicted. Still, the weekend is supposed to be frigid, and if it stays cold for much of the busy week including Washington's birthday, the year could turn out to be reasonably productive after all.
 Mr. Leavitt snowboards and skis, but asked if he was one of those people imbued with the spirit of winter, who lives for each frigid moment on the slopes, he shrugged. 
 ''I'd take the Caribbean any time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Truck Traffic Needs Work, Critics Say As Study Lags

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The New York City Department of Transportation, which is two years behind schedule on a study on overhauling truck traffic, is facing criticism from lawmakers and neighborhood activists who say the city is failing to address the congestion, pollution, noise and safety issues associated with commercial vehicles.
 The transportation commissioner, Iris Weinshall, told the City Council Transportation Committee yesterday that her department had ''underestimated the length of time required for such a large undertaking'' and had expanded the study to include, among other things, more community involvement and an analysis of the locations where truck accidents most frequently occur. She said the report, begun in 2003, would be completed by April. 
On Friday, the department released a 14 pages of preliminary recommendations from the $1.3 million study, including incentives to encourage deliveries during off-peak hours.
 Truck traffic has become a major quality-of-life issue in certain neighborhoods, and some estimates show the volume of truck traffic rising 70 percent by 2025. 
 Following some of those suggestions, the city intends to replace a hodgepodge of more than 20 different truck-related traffic signs with a uniform design, to be used for 4,000 to 10,000 new signs to more clearly highlight truck routes. It also plans to distribute laminated cards to police officers with a map of the truck routes in their precincts and an explanation of truck-traffic rules.
 But at the meeting yesterday, advocates said that the department's recommendations failed to address their longstanding complaint: trucks that roll lawlessly over residential streets and insufficient enforcement by the Police Department. 
 There are just 17 officers dedicated to truck-traffic enforcement, said Inspector Patrick J. McCarthy, commander of the Traffic Management Center in Long Island City, Queens.
 The authors of the city-financed study seem to agree with an argument long made by neighborhood groups: that officers get inadequate training on truck-traffic rules and as a result do not enforce them well. 
 The police are not known to be tough on truck drivers. Inspector McCarthy testified yesterday that the police issued more than 13,000 summonses for truck infractions last year. By comparison, officers issued more than 40,000 citations to bicyclists, according to Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for pedestrians and cyclists.
 The preliminary recommendations also include engineering improvements and the creation of an office to distribute truck-route information on the Web and even lobby persuade Hagstrom, the map publisher, to highlight truck routes in maps of the city.
 Beyond signs and enforcement, the preliminary findings point to a more fundamental problem in the truck-traffic system, which has not been significantly changed since 1982: ''New York City is faced with an arterial system that is more conducive to automobile traffic than trucks.'' 
 Last spring, the Council held a hearing on two bills that would have required truck drivers to carry color-coded maps of truck routes and the police to assign more officers to enforce the trucking rules, but the bills were put on hold after Ms. Weinshall promised to release the study by the end of the year. The new delay has infuriated some members.
 ''If we have a lack of agents out in the streets, how are we ever going to have adequate enforcement?'' asked Councilwoman Diana Reyna, a Brooklyn Democrat. The chairman of the Transportation Committee, Councilman John C. Liu, a Queens Democrat, said there was ''no good reason for the prolonged delay.''
 Ms. Weinshall said her goals were ''minimizing the negative impacts of truck traffic on our residential communities without unduly harming trucking and commercial activity,'' but Teresa Toro, the New York City coordinator at the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, which opposes dependence on automobiles, said the city had failed at the first goal. 
 ''We have found communities under siege by truck traffic and feeling utterly abandoned by city government under the Bloomberg administration,'' she said. 
 Ken Thorpe, president of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association, an association of 80 small trucking companies, said he feared that law-abiding truck companies would be unfairly blamed. 
 ''Trucks are a sore sight, and you don't want beeping and honking, but trucking is of monumental value to our city's economy,'' he said. ''Trucking is not a pretty thing, but it needs to be respected.'' 
 In a related development yesterday, Citizens for NYC, a philanthropy that gives grants to community groups, announced its own effort to monitor truck traffic in five neighborhoods: Chinatown; Downtown Brooklyn; Williamsburg, Brooklyn; Hunts Point, in the Bronx, and Flushing, Queens.

HEADLINE: Car Dealerships a Sign of Economic Revival in Harlem

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In another sign of Harlem's reviving economy, two car dealerships are set to open there on March 1, the only such dealerships in Harlem and the first in northern Manhattan in more than 40 years.
 The initial investment is at least $60 million and may eventually approach $100 million, creating as many as 175 jobs.
In recent years, as the United States auto industry's fortunes have declined and Manhattan real estate has prospered, city car dealerships have closed to be replaced by high-rises and other more lucrative developments. About a dozen multifranchise dealerships remain in Manhattan, all of them below 61st Street. 
 At the same time, Harlem has been gentrifying, helped by low-cost bonds, tax breaks and other investment incentives. But it has not been gentrifying uniformly, raising anxieties in different neighborhoods that are eager for jobs but worry about rising rents.
 The new dealerships are opening in East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem, where the pace of economic development has lagged that of the more vibrant Central Harlem, which is well known for being the home to the Apollo Theater and former President Bill Clinton's office.
 But vacant land is more readily available in Spanish Harlem and closer to transportation hubs like the Triborough Bridge.
 Yesterday, the new dealerships -- Potamkin Cadillac-Hummer and Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem -- received 60 new cars at the site known as Harlem Auto Mall, at 127th Street and Second Avenue.
 The prime mover behind the project, aided by agencies like the city's Economic Development Corporation and the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, is the Potamkin organization, which has 50 auto franchises nationwide, including 9 in New York City.
 Robert Potamkin, co-chairman of the group with his brother Alan Potamkin, said in a telephone interview yesterday that the organization started considering Harlem about five years ago.
 ''What was appealing to us was the location,'' Mr. Potamkin said. ''This is the entrance to Manhattan, bridges and tunnels and drives and expressways, the whole deal.''
 When he inspected the site, he asked marketing officials the name of the smaller bridge next to the Triborough Bridge. They told him it was the Willis Avenue Bridge, which carried 15,000 cars a day, and was not included in the total traffic estimated because it was so small it was considered ''rounding error.'' 
 ''Most car dealerships don't have 15,000 cars driving by,'' Mr. Potamkin said. ''But we have 300,000 cars and rounding error.''
 Mr. Potamkin estimates the total cost of the mall, for buildings and land but not cars, is $50 million to $60 million. At $30,000 a car, what Mr. Potamkin calls inventory adds tens of millions of dollars to the final price tag, he said. Both dealerships will be run by African-Americans, recruited through affirmative action programs, one by General Motors and the other by Potamkin. 
 The president of Potamkin Cadillac-Hummer, Craig Lee, 46, is a former general sales manager at Princeton Porsche in Lawrenceville, N.J. He expects 75 to 100 jobs to be created. 
 ''We're anxious to be a part of this community,'' he said.
 Otis Thornton, 54, a former salesman at Joe Heidt Volkswagen-Buick in Ramsey, N.J., will be the owner-operator of Chevrolet Saturn of Harlem. He expects 50 to 75 jobs to be created at his dealership.
 ''My market is going to be Harlem, the five boroughs, Westchester County and southern Connecticut, and I am just so glad to be here,'' Mr. Thornton said.
 The immediate neighborhood of East Harlem has been making slow economic progress. Median income for the area was $14,896 per household, according to the 2000 census, up more than 30 percent from $11,348 in the 1990 census. Poverty has eased, too, to 43.7 percent of the population in the 2000 census from 46.4 percent in 1990.
 ''In Spanish Harlem, there has been great anticipation of the accelerated gentrification'' seen in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and the Lower East Side, said Rafael Merino, chairman of Community Board 11's economic development committee. He lives a few blocks from the new auto mall.
 Mr. Merino singled out for praise the Potamkin officials behind the auto mall project because they consulted with neighborhood leaders.
 Still, Mr. Merino said, his neighbors are anxious. ''People aren't really saying keep the yuppies out,'' he said. ''But if the yuppies come in here to take over our neighborhood, buy our buildings and raise the property values so that we can no longer live here, well, that's going to be a problem.''
 Paying $1,500 to rent a studio apartment ''may be a cute thing downtown,'' he said, ''but here in Spanish Harlem that's not so cute for people who have been living here for 20 years.''

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Is Climbing Skills Ladder 

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The globalization of work tends to start from the bottom up. The first jobs to be moved abroad are typically simple assembly tasks, followed by manufacturing, and later, skilled work like computer programming. At the end of this progression is the work done by scientists and engineers in research and development laboratories.
 A new study that will be presented today to the National Academies, the nation's leading advisory groups on science and technology, suggests that more and more research work at corporations will be sent to fast-growing economies with strong education systems, like China and India. 
In a survey of more than 200 multinational corporations on their research center decisions, 38 percent said they planned to ''change substantially'' the worldwide distribution of their research and development work over the next three years -- with the booming markets of China and India, and their world-class scientists, attracting the greatest increase in projects. 
 Whether placing research centers in their home countries or overseas, the study said, companies often use similar criteria. The quality of scientists and engineers and their proximity to research centers are crucial. 
 The study contended that lower labor costs in emerging markets are not the major reason for hiring researchers overseas, though they are a consideration. Tax incentives do not matter much, it said.
 Instead, the report found that multinational corporations were global shoppers for talent. The companies want to nurture close links with leading universities in emerging markets to work with professors and to hire promising graduates.
 ''The story comes through loud and clear in the data,'' said Marie Thursby, an author of the study and a professor at Georgia Tech's college of management. ''You have to have an environment that fosters the development of a high-quality work force and productive collaboration between corporations and universities if America wants to maintain a competitive advantage in research and development.'' 
 The multinationals, representing 15 industries, were from the United States and Western Europe. The authors said there was no statistically significant difference between the American and European companies.
 Dow Chemical is one company that plans to invest heavily in new research and development centers in China and India. It is building a research center in Shanghai, which will employ 600 technical workers when it is completed next year. Dow is also finishing plans for a large installation in India, said William F. Banholzer, Dow's chief technology officer. 
 Today, the company employs 5,700 scientists worldwide, about 4,000 of them in the United States and Canada, and most of the rest in Europe. But the moves overseas will alter that. ''There will be a major shift for us,'' Mr. Banholzer said.
 The swift economic growth in China and India, he said, is part of the appeal because products and processes often have to be tailored for local conditions. The rising skill of the scientists abroad is another reason. ''There are so many smart people over there,'' Mr. Banholzer said. ''There is no monopoly on brains, and none on education either.''
 Such views were echoed by other senior technology executives, whose companies are increasing their research employment abroad. ''We go with the flow, to find the best minds we can anywhere in the world,'' said Nicholas M. Donofrio, executive vice president for technology and innovation at I.B.M., which first set up research labs in India and China in the 1990's. The company is announcing today that it is opening a software and services lab in Bangalore, India.
 At Hewlett-Packard, which opened an Indian lab in 2002 and is starting one in China, Richard H. Lampman, senior vice president for research, points to the spread of innovation around the world. ''If your company is going to be a global leader, you have to understand what's going on in the rest of the world,'' he said. 
 The globalization of research investment, industry executives and academics argued, need not harm the United States. In research, as in economics, they said, growth abroad does not mean stagnation at home -- and typically the benefits outweigh the costs. 
 Still, more companies in the survey said they planned to decrease research and development employment in the United States and Europe than planned to increase employment.
 In numerical terms, scientists and engineers in research labs represent a relatively small part of the national work force. Like the debate about offshore outsourcing in general, the trend, which may point to a loss of competitiveness, is more significant than the quantity of jobs involved.
 The American executives who are planning to send work abroad express concern about what they regard as an incipient erosion of scientific prowess in this country, pointing to the lagging math and science proficiency of American high school students and the reluctance of some college graduates to pursue careers in science and engineering.
 ''For a company, the reality is that we have a lot of options,'' Mr. Banholzer of Dow Chemical said. ''But my personal worry is that an educated, innovative science and engineering work force is vital to the economy. If that slips, it is going to hurt the United States in the long run.''
 Some university administrators see the same trend. ''This is part of an incredible tectonic shift that is occurring,'' said A. Richard Newton, dean of the college of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, ''and we've got to think about this more profoundly than we have in the past. Berkeley and other leading American universities, he said, are now competing in a global market for talent. His strategy is to become an aggressive acquirer. He is trying to get Tsinghua University in Beijing and some leading technical universities in India to set up satellite schools linked to Berkeley. The university has 90 acres in Richmond, Calif., that he thinks would be an ideal site.
 ''I want to get them here, make Berkeley the intellectual hub of the planet, and they won't leave,'' said Mr. Newton, who emigrated from Australia 25 years ago. 
 The corporate research survey was financed by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which supports studies on innovation. It was designed and written by Ms. Thursby, who is also a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and her husband, Jerry Thursby, who is chairman of the economics department at Emory University in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: For Pakistan, American Aid Is All Guns, No Butter

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: LAHORE, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Syed Jawad Ahsan's Valentine's Day this year was a heartbreaking window into the box in which this country is trapped.
 Around 10:30 on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ahsan, chief executive of Irfan Textiles Pvt. Ltd., got into his car and headed for the factory just outside town where his workers, some 5,000 of them, stitch and weave underwear for Jockey. As he was leaving Lahore's outskirts, he saw some boys in the middle of the road, setting fire to car tires. A group of Sunni parties had called for yet another of the seemingly never-ending protests against the Danish cartoon caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, and the boys had apparently decided that torching tires on their own turf would teach the West a thing or two.
Mr. Ahsan threw his car into reverse and started to back away. But behind him, another group had gathered, throwing rocks at a parked car, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Frustrated, Mr. Ahsan turned left and made a quick exit, heading back to town. Using his cellphone, he called and left a message that I should meet him at his downtown office for our interview on Pakistan's textile industry. ''I think it's safer for us in town today,'' he said. 
 An hour later, we were drinking Pepsi and eating crackers in his office in Lahore. Mr. Ahsan was visibly saddened. ''Pakistan didn't used to be like this,'' he said. ''All this extremism that you see here now is because of Afghanistan.''
 He meant the Afghanistan war that started in 1979, not the one that came after Sept. 11. The way Mr. Ahsan sees it, Pakistan before 1979 was a much more open society, with wine bars in the cities and a small measure of freedom. But when the Russians invaded Afghanistan, America responded by arming, and largely creating, the Islamist fighters who drummed up religious fire in their war to drive out the Russians. Next door, Pakistan became a front-line state, and American money flooded to the mujahedeen. Ever since, Pakistan has been home to a growing cadre of fundamentalist Islamists, many of them bent on jihad.
 With the huge gap here between rich and poor, militants find young boys with nothing to do easy prey. Mr. Ahsan can't fathom why Americans aren't working on the economic conditions that breed discontent.
 ''We don't need more of your F-16's,'' he said. ''What we need is trade in textiles. We need a free trade agreement, like the one you're going to give Egypt, like the one you gave Jordan, like the one you gave Morocco.''
 The United States agreed in 2005 to resume sales of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan. The sales had been suspended for more than a decade because Pakistan began developing nuclear weapons. But Washington has refused to grant a bigger and far more important concession: duty-free access for Pakistani imports.
 If there is a stronger case than Pakistan's for duty-free access, it is certainly hard to find. This place is a breeding ground for Muslim extremists, but it also has a population and government that has, by and large, maintained cordial relations with America. Pakistan's biggest industry is textiles, accounting for 45 percent of its manufacturing jobs, and its biggest market is the United States. Pakistani factories make everything from bras to shirts and sheets for companies like Wal-Mart, Polo Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. 
 Since Sept. 11, it's been an uphill battle for such Pakistani companies. American buyers have been skittish about trusting their orders to a place that looks like a war zone on TV. Meanwhile, other countries, including China, Bangladesh and India, have been quick to try to woo business away. The overwhelming belief here is that without duty-free access to the U.S. market, the textile and apparel industry here can't compete. 
 Mr. Ahsan says his knitwear exports are down 17 percent in the past year alone, and he believes that Pakistan's knitwear industry -- the staple of its textile industry -- is dying. This week, another knitting factory in Lahore became a casualty: 1,000 jobs will be eliminated, although the workers haven't yet been told. 
 It is the end of our interview, and Mr. Ahsan and I have spent as much time talking about religion and why Muslims are so upset about the cartoons as we have about trade and textiles. Reaching into his back pocket, he pulled out a Muslim prayer book -- he said a friend had given to him to help him get through the difficult times he is facing as he tries to keep his business together.
 He said he was waiting to see whether President Bush's visit next month would produce any new American promises to help Pakistan on trade, but he admits that if past is prologue, Pakistan will come away empty-handed on what really counts. ''Textile trade, not F-16's, is the only thing the U.S. should do if at all U.S. wanted to mellow extremism here,'' he said. ''It must be employment.''
 I left him and headed to a Lahore suburb to meet some friends. About a half-hour later, the mob of boys, now thousands strong, reached Lahore's downtown area, which locals call the mall. They ransacked around 500 cars, burned 75 motorcycles and 10 other vehicles, and torched the Punjab Assembly. A bank security guard opened fire and killed two boys. Three others were shot and injured.
 The mob then turned to the business district, setting fire to a Norwegian cellphone company's office and a KFC. Nestled between those two buildings was an office belonging to Mr. Ahsan and his brother. It, too, was burned down.

HEADLINE: Trying a New Tack, Fed Chief Is Brief, Clear and Also Upbeat

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
He was calm and he was cool, and he most certainly was not Alan Greenspan.
 Ben S. Bernanke, testifying to Congress for the first time since he succeeded Mr. Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve, did three things on Wednesday that his predecessor usually did not:
 He gave short answers, generally free of twists and turns that could be interpreted in two or more ways.
 He simply refused to answer questions that would ensnare him in politically charged battles over tax cuts, spending cuts or the overhaul of Social Security.
 He said nothing that rattled the financial markets. 
 In an upbeat, generally soothing assessment of the economy, Mr. Bernanke's remarks on monetary policy suggested that the Fed might still have to raise interest rates one or two more times to ensure that inflation does not flare any higher. But he kept his options wide open, offering just as many reasons not to increase rates in the future as to raise them.
 ''Most of the evidence,'' he told members of the House Financial Services Committee, ''suggests that the economic expansion remains on track.''
 It has been more than 18 years since anybody other than Mr. Greenspan occupied the bully pulpit of Fed chairman, and there may never be anyone else in the position whose every utterance is parsed so painstakingly by so many people.
 But Mr. Bernanke, a former professor at Princeton whose name is still unfamiliar to some members of Congress, barely broke a sweat in three hours of nonstop testimony that was broadcast live on C-Span and scrutinized by analysts around the world.
 ''I give him an A-plus,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, a forecasting firm in New York City. ''Job 1 was, 'Don't upset the market,' and he didn't do that.''
 But for all his insistence on remaining nonpartisan, and on staying out of the political warfare over fiscal policy, there was a clear hint of preferences in the questions he chose to answer versus those he chose not to answer.
 He said President Bush's tax cuts had probably helped the economy recover from the recession of 2001, prompting one happy Republican to declare: ''I heard what I wanted to hear.''
 And he refused to echo Mr. Greenspan's longstanding plea that Congress reinstate budget rules requiring that it pay for both new tax cuts and new spending with savings in other parts of the budget.
 That was the one point on which Mr. Greenspan consistently disagreed with Mr. Bush, who has opposed any such restriction on tax cuts.
 ''I don't feel it's appropriate for me to make recommendations to Congress about their procedures,'' Mr. Bernanke said. 
 For the most part, Mr. Bernanke was soothing about the risks ahead.
 In particular, he played down worries about the United States' record trade deficit, its growing foreign indebtedness and the possibility of a plunge in the housing market. 
 The central bank's current forecast, he said, calls for the economy to expand at a fairly strong pace of 3.5 percent in 2006, the fifth year of above-average growth, and unemployment to remain at 5 percent or below. 
 Core inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, is expected to be 2 percent in 2006 -- just at the upper end of the Fed's unofficial comfort zone. 
 ''I am comfortable with these projections,'' Mr. Bernanke said, carefully warning lawmakers and investors not to assume that the Fed has finished raising its benchmark interest rate, currently at 4.5 percent.
 The central bank will have to make ''ongoing provisional judgments'' about the risks to inflation and growth, he said, and decisions will be ''increasingly dependent on incoming data.''
 In its substance, Mr. Bernanke's message embodied an almost classic Greenspanian hedge to preserve as much flexibility as possible.
 But in style and word choice, Mr. Bernanke was quite different. Addressing anxieties about a possible crash in housing, for example, Mr. Greenspan delighted in a colorful if perplexing metaphor: housing prices might well be ''frothy'' but the market was probably not a ''bubble'' about to burst.
 By contrast, Mr. Bernanke delivered essentially the same message this way: ''Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth.''
 Mr. Bernanke's most notable trait on Wednesday was the comparative brevity of his answers. He fielded questions about the trade deficit, inequality in wages, terrorism risk insurance and reforming the government-sponsored mortgage finance companies.
 And while Mr. Bernanke was often quite specific about each of those topics, his answers were often shorter than the questions -- and almost always shorter than those of Mr. Greenspan.
 ''No one talks like him, and we don't want you to,'' said Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California.
 Mr. Bernanke, a Republican whose previous job was as a top economic adviser to President Bush, made it clear when he was nominated as Fed chairman that he wanted to stay out of political battles that were unrelated to monetary policy or to the Fed's role as a financial regulator.
 But within an hour of answering his first question, Mr. Bernanke had offered opinions on contentious legislative proposals that have little direct connection to monetary policy. 
 He strongly endorsed efforts by President Bush and Republican leaders to speed up the construction of big new terminals for importing liquefied natural gas. 
 Supporters of such terminals say they would lower natural gas prices in the United States, which are much higher than prices elsewhere in the world. But political leaders in many port cities oppose such terminals, fearing that they could lead to deadly explosions.
 Similarly, Mr. Bernanke also supported legislation to reduce government guarantees for terrorism risk insurance, arguing that private insurers should assume more of the financial responsibility.
 And when asked about legislation to increase the number of scientists and engineers, he suggested that the government focus on giving students tuition vouchers and letting them choose where to spend them.
 And while Mr. Bernanke tried valiantly to sidestep both Democrats and Republicans on whether President Bush's tax cuts should be made permanent, he did not entirely succeed.
 ''If the tax relief expires, which would amount to basically a tax increase at that point, what if any impact do you think that would have on the economy and jobs and growth?'' asked Representative Paul Gillmor, Republican of Ohio. 
 Mr. Bernanke responded that ''most economists would agree that the tax relief earlier this decade was helpful in helping the economy recover from the recession in 2001.''
 But when Mr. Bernanke said he did not want to comment on whether to make the tax cuts permanent, Mr. Gillmor cut him short. 
 ''You're forgiven,'' Mr. Gillmor said. ''I heard what I wanted to hear anyway.''

HEADLINE: New Orleans Will Hold Jazzfest This Spring

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
After financial hardships, dislocations and storm and flood damage to their site, the producers of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival yesterday announced details of the festival's post-Katrina return over two weekends in late April and early May. 
 Contrary to organizers' initial fears in the months after Hurricane Katrina, the festival, known as Jazzfest, will be barely diminished, offering both big-name acts and even more local musicians. 
At a news conference at the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel, Quint Davis, the Jazzfest producer and director, said the festival this year will take place over six days -- April 28 to 30 and May 5 to 7 -- as opposed to its usual seven. 
 One of the festival's main events will be a performance by Fats Domino, the kingpin of the city's R&B history, who was saved by rescue workers during the storm. Other marquee attractions include Dave Matthews, Keith Urban, Jimmy Buffett, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Allen Toussaint with Elvis Costello, and Yolanda Adams. The festival's core heritage elements -- Southern blues, R&B, gospel, Cajun music and zydeco, brass bands and Mardi Gras Indian bands -- will be represented even more strongly than before, Mr. Davis said. 
 The festival will be held at the Fairgrounds Race Course, in the Mid-City neighborhood of New Orleans, as it has been for 34 years. It has taken on Shell as a presenting sponsor, which means that the festival will be officially referred to as the 2006 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival Presented by Shell. (In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Davis said the company's presence would otherwise be signified in the festival's literature and posters by logos, not by its name.) American Express has also agreed to be one of the festival's larger corporate sponsors, particularly of the stages showcasing the local musicians. In the last few years, the festival has cost over $10 million to produce. 
 Last September, in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Mr. Davis declined to say whether there would be a festival this year; he was too concerned with the safety of his local staff members and with finding out if they could resume work in time to book the acts. For the month of November, the Sheraton New Orleans put up a dozen members of the Jazzfest staff while it regrouped; the first thought was to put on the festival elsewhere in Louisiana, or maybe even in Central Park in New York. ''It seemed hard, when we looked at the logistics,'' Mr. Davis said. ''The labor pool, getting trailers, getting the Fairgrounds fixed.'' 
 Even though much of the Mid-City neighborhood survived fairly well through Katrina, Mr. Davis explained, the roof and the ends of the grandstand building at the racetrack were torn off by the storm, and there was a great deal of water damage to the building. Restoring the electrical network to the area inside the racetrack oval alone, he said, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. (These costs were borne by Churchill Inc., which had bought the fairgrounds out of bankruptcy a month before last year's festival.) As recently as five weeks ago, organizers still had not secured the new sponsorships necessary to put on a festival of a size comparable to those in recent years. Shell committed to its sponsorship only around mid-January, Mr. Davis said. 
 Most of the event's food vendors -- a big draw for festivalgoers -- are returning, despite tremendous hardships to their homes and businesses. And the local musicians themselves, spread all over the country, had to be tracked down by the festival's staff.
 Those musicians and bands will be back in force in Jazzfest 2006: about 330 of the 360 acts on this year's festival are local, Mr. Davis said, a slightly higher percentage than in past years. The list includes Irma Thomas, Buckwheat Zydeco, Rebirth Brass Band, Snooks Eaglin, Clarence Frogman Henry, Walter Wolfman Washington, Irvin Mayfield and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, Trombone Shorty, Big Chief Bo Dollis and the Wild Magnolias, Eddie Bo, Soul Rebels Brass Band, D. L. Menard and others. 
 Before 2005, the festival used almost no national advertising; word-of-mouth was strong enough. But now, to lure visitors back to the state, the festival will have a sizable advertising campaign, thanks to support from the Louisiana Office of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. Mr. Davis said the city would have almost double the usual number of hotel rooms available for this year's festival because of a drop in convention business this spring. 
 Jazzfest is an important moneymaker for the city: about 400,000 people attended the festival last year, and Mr. Davis estimates that the festival generates $200 million to $300 million for New Orleans, second only to Mardi Gras in its local economic impact. (The Mardi Gras parade season this year has been slightly abbreviated with shorter routes.) 
 ''The festival is the ultimate musical benefit for a destitute city,'' Mr. Davis said.

HEADLINE: Moscow Moves to Restore A Cap on Price of Gasoline 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Russian government officials said Wednesday that they were in talks with the country's large oil companies to restore a cap on gasoline prices here. 
 In September, the oil companies made an agreement with the government to freeze gasoline prices at their current levels until the end of the year. Since then, some companies have kept to the deal, while others have raised prices at the pump. 
Now the government wants to reintroduce the moratorium. German O. Gref, Russia's economy minister, said Wednesday that ''it is necessary to urgently resume work with oil companies to ensure a moderate pace of growth of prices for petroleum products in 2006,'' the Interfax news agency reported. A spokeswoman, Svetlana R. Suleimanova, confirmed that the ministry and an antimonopoly agency were in talks to restore the price cap. 
 While gasoline prices swoop and dive on markets in Western Europe and the United States, they have remained mostly on an even keel in Russia. Analysts say this is a result of government control, though the Kremlin has portrayed it as voluntary on the part of the oil companies.
 The talks suggest Russian officials are worried about inflation, a stubbornly high 10.9 percent last year, though analysts believe the price rises are overwhelmingly driven by a tide of returning oil revenues. The gasoline pact is seen mostly as a populist measure to appease drivers angered by prices at the pump. 
 In an informal survey, prices for gas in Moscow ranged from around $2.17 to $2.36 a gallon, not far from the $2.27 average in the United States. (Russia does, however, subsidize natural gas used here for heating, pricing it around $30 for 1,000 cubic meters, as opposed to the roughly $250 Russia charges for the same amount in Western Europe.) 
 Investors, however, are dubious that the gas deal was voluntary, especially after the government took over parts of the oil industry last year. Most saw the pact as an effort by the Kremlin to dictate policy even to private companies, a factor that has raised the political risk in energy investment.
 Lukoil, a private company and Russia's largest oil company, has not raised prices from the level agreed on in September at its 1,500 gas stations in Russia, Dmitri M. Dolgov, a spokesman, said Wednesday. Lukoil charges 16.10 rubles a liter, or $2.17 a gallon, in Moscow, he said. 
 A Rosneft spokesman, Nikolai V. Manelov, said the company was in talks with the government. Rosneft, which is wholly owned by the government, has 650 gas stations. 
 Mr. Dolgov shrugged off the domestic price freeze, saying it had little effect on Lukoil's profits, which are driven mainly by crude oil exports from Russia. But the company is in talks with the government for tax breaks for its refineries and other incentives to bring down gas prices in Russia. In the meantime, it will observe the price moratorium until these are in place, he said. 
 Alex N. Kormschikov, an oil analyst at the UralSib brokerage firm in Moscow, said companies had little choice but to accept the Kremlin's demands, which come on top of already high export taxes of 90 percent on the value of oil above $27 a barrel. Some companies are supposedly winning backroom deals for new exploration licenses and other benefits by capping domestic prices, he said. ''Of course this isn't voluntary,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Utility Output Fell in January 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Industrial production unexpectedly fell last month as the warmest January in more than a century led to a record decline in utility use even as manufacturing strengthened, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. 
 Output at factories, utilities and mines declined 0.2 percent after a revised 0.9 percent December gain that was more than previously reported, according to the report. The share of industrial capacity in use was 80.9 percent, down from December's 81.2 percent, the highest level since September 2000.
''The decline was because of warm weather, but it's a strong report and another solid gain for manufacturing,'' said Nigel Gault, director of United States research at Global Insight, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. 
 Utilities generated less power as heating demand fell during the warmest January since records began in 1895. Utility production fell 10.1 percent, the biggest drop on record, the report said.
 Manufacturing, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the industrial output index, rose 0.7 percent after rising 0.5 percent in December, the fourth consecutive increase. Capacity use at the nation's factories rose to 80.5 percent, the highest since July 2000.
 Business equipment production, which includes transportation and information-processing equipment, increased 0.9 percent in January after rising 0.7 percent in December.
 Production of all consumer goods including autos fell 0.4 percent in January, largely because of energy, after rising 0.3 percent in December. Output of automotive products, including cars, rose 2.3 percent after falling 1.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Crackdown By N.C.A.A. 

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
The National Collegiate Athletic Association, in a crackdown on correspondence schools and other nontraditional institutions that give fast, inflated grades to high school athletes seeking college scholarships, will not accept such transcripts starting this spring, leaders of an N.C.A.A. task force said yesterday after two days of meetings in Newport Beach, Calif. 
 ''We know that the abuses are going on as we speak,'' Kevin Lennon, the vice president for membership services of the N.C.A.A. and the chairman of the 23-member task force, said in a telephone conference call with reporters.
The N.C.A.A. Presidents Council could act as soon as April, Lennon said, to send a message to students who are thinking of transferring to diploma-mill schools that grades from those schools will not help get them into college. ''In no way should those students be rewarded,'' Lennon said.
 Two schools have already been told that their transcripts will no longer be accepted by the N.C.A.A., said Diane Dickman, the N.C.A.A.'s managing director for membership services. She did not identify the schools. A third, University High School of Miami, closed Dec. 31. The New York Times had earlier raised questions about the academic credentials of football players who had dropped out of public schools to attend University High.
 The N.C.A.A. task force, in draft recommendations released yesterday, will set criteria to identify other nontraditional schools that fall outside state oversight; possibly subject them to audits; and identify high school students who make ''miraculous recoveries'' in grades in their senior or prep school year. A final report is due by June 1. 
 Lennon said that there were about 5,000 nontraditional high schools on the N.C.A.A. approved list, and that ''the vast majority do a good job and have integrity.''
 University High School had no teachers or classes, and charged $398 for diplomas. Twenty-eight Miami-area athletes submitted transcripts from the school to the N.C.A.A.; 14 signed with Division I football teams.

HEADLINE: A Bit of the Old West Finds It Hard to Resist the New West

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ALPINE, Wyo. 

 BODY:
The booming, glittering resort town of Jackson has always been 40 miles, and a whole universe, away from the Star Valley of far western Wyoming and its mostly Mormon farming communities.
 ''People don't like Jackson, and they don't like Jackson ways,'' said Jymme Snider, who runs Snider's Rustic Inn with her husband. Ms. Snider said lots of people in her part of the valley around the town of Thayne, at the navel of the 50-mile-long valley, thought of Jackson as arrogant in its wealth and gloss.
But now Jackson is spilling out, or dumping out, as some in the valley put it, residents who cannot afford its sky-high real estate prices. And the tiny town of Alpine, closest to Jackson at the northern end of the valley, is holding out its pan to catch the gold, reviving more than a century of hard feelings between Alpine and its neighbors. 
 The exodus from Jackson made Alpine the fastest-growing town in the state from 2000 to 2004, with a 40 percent population increase. Lincoln County officials say Alpine could easily double over the next three to five years to perhaps 2,500 people or more. That would make it the biggest town in the valley. In 2000, the population was 550, the census reported.
 Alpine was different from its neighbors even when Jackson was just a gleam in the eye of the glitterati. Where most of the valley was quiet, conservative and agricultural, dominated by families whose ancestors came from Utah in the 1870's to raise dairy cows, Alpine had honky-tonks, yee-haw cowboy high jinks -- and not a Mormon church in sight.
 Now Jackson's reach, mostly concentrated from here to the next town south, Etna, has heightened those divisions again. 
 ''There's a lot of jealousy out there,'' said Don Lloyd, owner of Lloyd's Auto Care in Alpine.
 In some ways the Alpine-Jackson-Star Valley story is a familiar one at resort destinations across the tourism-and-real-estate-besotted West. In Colorado, Aspen has sent out tendrils to places like Glenwood Springs, 40 miles away, which has become a bedroom town for resort workers. Park City, Utah, has become a sprawling hive in the Wasatch Mountains as builders have clustered houses miles out from the center.
 What is most notable here is the enduring culture clash. The place in the valley that was always out of step with the region's Mormon roots -- people still talk about a bar nicknamed ''the passion pit'' that reigned in Alpine for decades -- has stepped even further askew, inviting the dreaded Jackson into the valley with fast growth and expensive houses. The class clown, the town that always had its thumb in the eye to authority, hit the lottery.
 ''It's going to be the ruination of the Star Valley,'' said Jed Heap, a fifth-generation valley farmer who lives 20 miles south of Alpine.
 Mr. Heap concedes that his land is worth more than it was a few years ago and that the prospects of his children landing jobs that could keep them in the valley were probably increasing. But now there is crime, and people have to lock their doors, he said, and he fears Jackson will push poorer workers from the resort farther and farther south, raising burdens as the wave of change advances.
 Alpine is certainly not the only emerging satellite of Jackson. The towns of Driggs and Victor, just across the border in Idaho, have become home to many workers, as well, including many foreign-born employees from Mexico, whose work is the heartbeat at many Western resorts. 
 Many people in the valley say Alpine's new relationship with Jackson has resonated more deeply because of the long and often hostile history between Alpine and its neighbors. The town, for example, has been trying for years to have a school of its own. In 2004, a group of families actually sued the school board, based 35 miles south of here in Afton. 
 ''I thought we'd passed the feuding and fighting, but it opened up old wounds and polarized everything,'' said Donn H. Wooden, a lifelong valley resident and former Alpine mayor. 
 Alpine residents, he said, came off arrogant. People in other parts of the valley became defensive. Religion became a football, with Alpine's lack of a Mormon church raised by both sides, and the mostly Mormon control of the school board raised by the Alpinites.
 ''They thought we were picking on the Mormons,'' Mr. Wooden said. ''But it wasn't about Mormonism. It was about power.''
 School officials ultimately reaffirmed their decision to build a school farther south in the valley, but said that the reasons were geographic and that in a rural district where nearly every student rode buses centralization was important.
 Newcomers like Melissa and Charlie Shinkle, who moved from Jackson to Etna two years ago -- and continue to commute to jobs in Jackson -- said they thought that economic disparity would only increase the cultural divide. 
 ''There are some really big developments that are going to be occurring in Alpine and Etna, and that's just going to support their animosity toward us,'' Ms. Shinkle said. ''They'll see it as more housing for Jackson people who are taking over.''
 Other people say the new blood is more than welcome. Karen Merritt, a Mormon who lives in Afton, said newcomers were opening up a community that had for too long been closed to new ideas. When Ms. Merritt, a nontraditional healer and nutritional consultant, started her business six years ago and began teaching feng shui, the Chinese philosophy of achieving balance with one's environment, people looked at her as if she was nutty, she said. The new people are more accepting.
 ''And that makes people who are already here more accepting,'' she said. ''I'm all for it.''

HEADLINE: 'First' Suburbs Growing Older and Poorer, Report Warns

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT; Fernanda Santos, in Washington, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Half a century ago, millions of young white couples left America's central cities for greener places to build homes and rear families. Their move created booming commuter communities and a new way of life.
 But that idealized picture has been transformed and the future of those pioneering suburbs is in jeopardy, according to a study issued yesterday by the Brookings Institution, a research group in Washington.
 Now home to 52 million people, the early suburbs -- like Nassau and Westchester Counties in New York, Bergen and Hudson Counties in New Jersey and Fairfield County in Connecticut -- are struggling with unexpected and often unrecognized problems that demand new solutions and leadership, the report said.
 ''Neither fully urban nor completely suburban, America's older, inner-ring 'first' suburbs have a unique set of challenges -- such as concentrations of elderly and immigrant populations as well as outmoded housing and commercial buildings -- very different from those of the center city and fast-growing newer places,'' the report said. 
 Echoing an earlier era's worry that the decline of cities threatened entire regions, the report said, ''A recent survey of urban scholars ranked the deterioration of first suburbs as one of the most likely influences on metropolitan America for the next 50 years.'' 
 Solving the problems will not be easy, said Bruce J. Katz, a vice president of Brookings. ''First suburbs are caught in a policy blind spot,'' ignored by traditional urban assistance for cities. Also hurting them is ''the new attention lavished on fast-growing outer suburbs,'' he said at a forum on the report in Washington.
 Those newer suburbs include Rockland, Orange and Suffolk Counties in New York, but many of the newer and healthiest suburban communities are in the Sun Belt. 
 The first suburbs once led the nation in population growth. But now the growth of many has slowed to a trickle. Some have even lost population, while newer suburbs are galloping ahead.
 The traditional married-with-children family now accounts for only 27 percent of the households in the aging suburbs. The average household size was 2.7 people in 2000, down from 3.2 in 1970.
 Once-youthful suburbanites are graying. On average, they are now older than the rest of the country. The 65-and-over segment in the original suburbs has been growing at nearly double the national rate. The housing they live in is also older now than the national average.
 The face of the early suburbs, which to some were initially a retreat from increasingly multiracial cities, has also changed. Those suburbs are now more racially diverse than the nation as a whole. From 1980 to 2000, the percentage of minority residents in those suburbs doubled; black, Asian and Hispanic residents now make up a third of the population there.
 The first suburbs are also drawing more immigrants than the cities, the historic destination for the foreign born, the study said. Those suburbs had 9 million immigrants in 2000, eclipsing the 8.6 million in the adjoining primary cities.
 ''The enormous inflow of foreign-born residents is literally transforming many first-suburban communities,'' the report said. ''First suburbs are just now starting to come to grips with these new trends.''
 By many measures, the older suburbs remain strong -- some are among the nation's richest communities -- with employment, education levels, income and home prices all exceeding national averages. But even those indicators show the older suburbs lagging as the competition catches up, with New York and many other cities in revival mode and newer suburbs flourishing farther out.
 Median income stagnated in the older suburbs in the 1990's, while rising elsewhere. A troublesome 45 percent of Hispanic students are dropping out of suburban high schools.
 ''Alarming'' pockets of poverty have emerged, counter to national trends, the report said. Among all first suburbs, the number of census tracts where 20 percent or more of the residents lived below the poverty line more than tripled from 1970 to 2000.
 The report, titled ''A Fifth of America,'' focused on 64 counties where suburbs bloomed before and after World War II. They include communities around New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle. ''Think the Levittowns or, from television, Robert Petrie's New Rochelle, N.Y.,'' the report said. 
 Just as city problems prompted urban renewal, the report called for efforts for older suburbs. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Representative Peter T. King of Long Island have introduced a bill for federal assistance of $250 million to older suburbs for economic redevelopment programs. Speaking at Brookings, Mrs. Clinton said, ''Most first suburbs don't qualify for existing federal programs.''
 The report urged first suburbs to provide more apartments and assisted living for the elderly, integrate the influx of immigrants, promote business development and combat poverty and blight.
 Hurdles include the fragmented, parochial and often competing local governments, the report said. Suburban leaders need to cooperate, devise solutions and maximize their political clout, it said. The report praised coalitions like the First Suburbs Development Council in the Cleveland area, state efforts promoting planning in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and multigovernment alliances in Los Angeles.
 The report also cited the ''new suburbia'' proposals from the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, who spoke at the forum. He has called for reviving Long Island's small downtowns and creating a high-rise hub in Uniondale.
 Suburban leaders at the forum agreed that older suburbs need to build housing that more people can afford, a challenge because of diminishing vacant land. Beyond the common problems, the study found that ''first suburbs are also often quite different from each other.''
 Immigrants were generally rare in the Midwest but common in California. Suburban Dade County, outside Miami, had the highest Hispanic population, 56 percent. Hudson County, N.J., was next at 47 percent. Nearly half of the Asians in first suburbs were clustered in four California counties. Blacks were 62 percent of the residents of Prince George's County, Md.
 But the report cautioned seekers of the suburban dream: ''The experience of today's minorities in first suburbs may not represent the same upward mobility transitions that it did for whites in earlier decades.''

PERSON: Peggy Appiah

HEADLINE: Peggy Appiah, 84, Author Who Bridged Two Cultures 

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Peggy Appiah, who as a daughter of a British chancellor of the exchequer defied the conventions of her time by marrying an Ashanti political leader and who went on to become an author and a revered figure in her adopted homeland, Ghana, died Saturday in Kumasi, Ghana. She was 84. 
 The cause was a heart attack at Akomfo Anokye Hospital, according to her son, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah. 
Reared in upper-crust Britain, the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford Cripps, a Labor party leader and cabinet officer in the Clement Attlee government (1945-51), Peggy Cripps caused an international sensation when she announced plans to marry in July 1953. Her fiance was Joseph Emmanuel Appiah, who was in London as a law student and representative of Kwame Nkrumah, prime minister of the Gold Coast, the British colony that became Ghana in 1957. 
 Nkrumah was Ghana's first president, and Mr. Appiah was a close associate and his choice for vice president, until political differences led Nkrumah to imprison him several times. 
 The Appiahs are said to have been the inspiration, along with another African-British couple, Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, for the 1967 film ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' which dealt with a California couple's reaction to their daughter's engagement to a black doctor. 
 That view was lent support by Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the department of African and African-American studies at Harvard, and a friend of Mr. Appiah's since their student days, who noted that it was a marriage of equals at the highest levels of their societies.
 ''She was to the manner born and he was an aristocrat related to the king of the Ashanti,'' Mr. Gates said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''He was the John Adams of his country; its founding father with Kwame Nkrumah.''
 The couple met at a gathering of the West African Students Union, of which Mr. Appiah was president. From the start, Miss Cripps made it clear that she would not be intimidated by the firestorm of criticism the couple endured. 
 ''If we experience any difficulties in mixing with Europeans, I shall throw in my lot with the colored people,'' she told The Sunday Express of London. 
 The marriage came to symbolize far more than the union of two individuals. Richard Weight, a British historian who is making a documentary about interracial marriage, said: ''For a lot of people, it drew the line between those who thought Britain had an integrated postcolonial future and those who didn't. And it became an international story with particular resonance because it involved the daughter of a former chancellor.'' 
 Born in 1921, Enid Margaret Cripps, who used the name Peggy, was the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford and Lady Isobel Swithenbank Cripps. On her father's side she could trace her lineage back to William the Conqueror. She was reared at a rambling country house, Goodfellows, and spent much of World War II in Moscow, where her father served as ambassador. After the war, she went to Iran, where she worked for the British Army, which ran the railways. 
 She is survived by her son, the Laurance Rockefeller professor of philosophy at Princeton, who lives in Manhattan and Princeton, N.J., and three daughters, Isabel Endresen, an economist, of Windhoek, Namibia, Adwo Edun, a landscape gardener, of Lagos, Nigeria, and Abena Appiah of Kumasi; and eight grandchildren. Settling in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti people, shortly after her wedding, she shunned the traditional British -- and Ghanaian-- role of homemaker, even as she reared her children, served as helpmate to her husband, kept the family going when he was in prison and established several philanthropies. 
 ''At one time there was an effort to deport her,'' said Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker, who is Professor Appiah's companion. ''She said the airport was a long way away and she would kick and scream every inch of the way. Fearful of the publicity that would engender, they backed down.''
 Known to many in Ghana as Auntie Peggy, Mrs. Appiah was a prolific writer of children's books, many of them based on the Ghanaian folk tales her husband told their children, as well as of novels, poetry and most recently a collection of 7,000 Ashanti proverbs, on which she collaborated with her son. 
 The book, published in English and Ashanti, had its origins in her collection of gold weights. 
 ''She collected weights used for weighing gold but made of brass,'' Professor Appiah said. ''Many of them had figurative art that came from proverbs. When a dealer came to the house, she would ask, 'What is the proverb?' and if he didn't know, she would eventually travel to the village to find out.'' 
 Though she had a house in Brighton, England, Mrs. Appiah considered Ghana her home.
 ''When my father died 15 years ago, people asked her, 'When are you going home?' '' her son said. ''She kept saying, 'I am home.' Finally she bought herself a plot of ground to be buried in, so when people said, 'When are you going home?,' she could answer: 'I am not going home. I have my burial plot here.' ''

PERSON: Norton J. Kiritz

HEADLINE: Norton Kiritz, 70, Teacher Of the Art of Seeking Grants

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Norton J. Kiritz, who found his niche teaching people with a worthy cause how to pitch it effectively to potential sponsors, died Jan. 30 in Los Angeles. He was 70 and lived in Redondo Beach, Calif. 
 The cause was melanoma, according to the Grantsmanship Center, of which he was the founder and president. Mr. Kiritz started the center, which is based in Los Angeles, in 1972 as a boot camp for community groups, nonprofit organizations and public agencies that hoped to start programs or keep them alive but that lacked the know-how to make the potential benefits clear to skeptical donors.
The center offers a Grantsmanship training program, a five-day workshop that helps groups clarify and organize their plans, frame their proposals and apply for grants themselves, bypassing costly outside fund-raisers. The center says it has instructed more than 100,000 representatives of private and government agencies nationwide. 
 In 2000, the California Community Foundation described Mr. Kiritz's text, ''Program Planning and Proposal Writing,'' as ''the proposal writer's bible.'' Mr. Kiritz had said he wanted to take the hustle out of the process and was convinced that prospective supporters, wary of money-chasers, could be swayed by demonstrations of solid planning and accountability. 
 Norton Julian Kiritz grew up in the Bronx and attended Bronx High School of Science. He became a cryptologist while serving in the Army in the mid-1950's and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1959. He held a number of jobs working with juvenile offenders and disadvantaged children before joining the Community Action Agency of Los Angeles in the 1960's.
 The agency was an offspring of the Johnson administration's antipoverty program under the aegis of the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mr. Kiritz was the planning director of the Los Angeles branch and conceived of the Grantsmanship Center as he dealt with a welter of neighborhood groups with plenty of ideas and not enough money. 
 As president of the center, he also lobbied for more openness on the part of grant-makers. In 1975, Congress appointed a commission to look into the matter, and testimony by Mr. Kiritz and others helped prompt the formation a year later of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy in Washington, a clearinghouse and research tool for the nonprofit sector.
 Mr. Kiritz is survived by his wife of 22 years, Cathleen Elliott Kiritz; two sons, Nicholas M., of Washington and Alexander C., of Redondo Beach; and a brother, Stewart, of Palo Alto, Calif. 
 ''The world if full of good intentions, and I never met a nonprofit whose mission statement I didn't like,'' Mr. Kiritz told The New York Times in 1998. ''But I have not met all that many who could present some evidence of specific accomplishments that would lead in the direction of fulfilling their mission.''

HEADLINE: Beauty on the Black Market

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
SEVERAL times a week, friends of a Miami clothing importer tip her off about illegal beauty treatments offered by unlicensed practitioners. Recently they have recommended a doctor from Peru who flies in to perform plastic surgery in a Miami apartment, a woman from Colombia who gives shots that melt fat off the hips, and an aesthetician who injects material that permanently bulks up the buttocks, she said.
 ''They call all the time to say that someone from Colombia, Venezuela or Peru is coming to Miami, and he can inject you or do surgery,'' said the woman, 41, who was not identified to avoid causing her further embarrassment about having tried one of these illicit procedures. Four years ago, the woman said, she and five friends went to a house in Coral Gables, Fla., a wealthy suburb, where a woman -- she was introduced as the medical assistant to a renowned plastic surgeon in Colombia -- injected their faces with a cosmetic filler to smooth their wrinkles and plump their lips.
''Afterwards my friends all looked fine, but my lips looked horribly swollen,'' the clothing importer said last Thursday in the office of Dr. David A. Rodriguez, a dermatologist in Coral Gables. She had come to Dr. Rodriguez in hopes of fixing several pea-sized protrusions in her lips. 
 ''These beauty sessions they go to are like Tupperware parties,'' Dr. Rodriguez said. ''But instead of getting a free casserole dish, the hostess gets free injections.'' 
 He added, ''But there's no one for them to go back to when they end up with side effects.'' 
 In the last few years South Florida has become the nation's capital of black-market beauty treatments, in the view of many licensed doctors in the region who regularly see patients hoping to repair botched procedures. At parties like the one the clothing importer attended, or during private appointments in houses, hotel rooms, beauty salons and makeshift offices, people are getting everything from silicone shots to Botox, and in some cases plastic surgery, police and health department officials say. 
 The unlicensed practitioners, who include doctors trained in other countries, nurses, medical aides and even beauticians, attract patients with low fees, a willingness to use illegal permanent wrinkle fillers, a congenial atmosphere or the convenience of not needing to make an appointment weeks in advance. 
 ''It's an epidemic,'' said Dr. Flor A. Mayoral, a dermatologist in Miami who sees two or three patients a day who have been deformed by illegal beauty procedures.
 In 2001 the Miami-Dade Police Department responded by setting up an unlicensed practitioner unit, one of the few such task forces in the country dedicated to investigating medical fraud. The Florida Department of Health has an Unlicensed Activity Office, the only one of its kind, to investigate those who perform medical and cosmetic procedures without a license. Since its inception in 1998, this office has investigated more than 4,000 complaints and has led local police departments like Miami-Dade to arrest 485 unlicensed practitioners.
 Miami's proximity to Central America and South America, along with a huge immigrant population and a party scene that caters to sculptured models and bodybuilders make it an ideal hothouse for bootleg procedures, said Spencer Marc Aronfeld, a lawyer in Coral Gables who is suing three unlicensed plastic surgeons on behalf of clients.
 ''Miami offers perfect-storm conditions for cosmetic crime,'' Mr. Aronfeld said. ''It's a nexus of vanity, greed, corruption, warm weather, beautiful men and women walking around all the time wearing as little clothing as possible and unsophisticated immigrants trying to compete with them.''
 Miami's tightly knit immigrant groups inadvertently foster the underground providers, Dr. Mayoral and Dr. Rodriguez said. ''It may be a cultural thing,'' Dr. Rodriguez said. ''College-educated women who trust the recommendation of their friends and family go to unlicensed practitioners. If you are Colombian and your friends say this man is a doctor from Colombia, you may go to him.''
 In October 2004 Miami-Dade police arrested Daniel Acosta after he offered injections to a detective posing as a client. ''He specialized in injecting lips and buttocks,'' said the 33-year-old detective, who was not identified because she works undercover.
 After Mr. Acosta was arrested, police found needles, syringes, Botox and prescription drugs in the apartment in Kendall, Fla., where he worked. 
 In April 2005, Mr. Acosta pleaded guilty to practicing medicine without a license and was sentenced to probation.
 Another unlicensed injector arrested in 2004 had a five-gallon bucket of industrial silicone, the kind used to seal furniture or lubricate car engines, that she injected in her clients' faces and bodies, detectives said. The woman also kept a tube of Krazy Glue in a night stand next to her syringes.
 ''Sometimes they use Krazy Glue to plug up the holes they have injected into,'' the undercover detective said. ''But some of them tell us they mix Krazy Glue with saline and inject that. I don't think the public is aware of the consequences of being injected with unknown substances in unsanitary apartments.''
 The most frequent side effects from these beauty treatments are lumps and bumps and lopsided or grossly exaggerated facial features. More serious consequences, ranging from infection to death, have also occurred. Vera Lawrence, a 53-year-old secretary, died in 2001 after having silicone injected into her thighs and buttocks in an apartment in Miramar, Fla. One of the people who gave the injections, Mark Hawkins, is serving a 30-year prison term for his actions in the case. Most illicit beauty treatments in South Florida are offered by immigrant practitioners who live in the state, or foreign practitioners who fly in regularly to treat clients, police detectives say.
 ''We get a big influx of people who got their medical training elsewhere,'' said Sgt. Hector Llevat, a detective who oversees the Miami-Dade police's unlicensed practitioner unit. ''When some foreign-trained doctors get frustrated trying to pass American medical exams, they decide to risk practicing without a license.'' 
 In addition to women looking for bargains, the clients for black-market treatments include transsexuals seeking to augment breasts and buttocks with large volumes of silicone, Sergeant Llevat said, procedures the medical establishment considers too dangerous. Also, doctors say some women who can afford legitimate doctors get a thrill from having illicit treatments.
 ''Wealthy women are going to injection parties,'' said Dr. Daniel Kane, a plastic surgeon in Miami who treats complications from these procedures. ''They tell each other: 'So-and-so is having a guy over to inject stuff. She looks gorgeous.' And then they go. They're proud of it, until they have a problem.'' 
 The three most prevalent unlicensed medical activities here are plastic surgery, injections to the face and body, and dentistry, said Bob Mundy, the investigation manager for the Health Department's Unlicensed Activity Office for South Florida. 
 Practicing medicine without a license in Florida is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Helping unlicensed practitioners is also a felony. Because of this, detectives say, illicit beauty practitioners use word-of-mouth marketing through networks of hairdressers, manicurists, aestheticians and personal trainers.
 ''You have to be very careful about who you refer, but it's still easy to get a referral,'' said a 45-year-old hairstylist who works in a Coral Gables salon that caters to affluent clients. The stylist's name was not used to avoid associating him with providers of illicit treatments. ''Instead of walking up to a stranger and asking, 'Who did your hair?,' you ask 'Who did your lips?' '' he said. ''Usually, someone will give you a phone number.''
 Dr. Mayoral sees serious side effects from black market beauty treatments. She photographs the most egregious cases and categorizes them by appearance. She classified one woman whose face looked hollow after she had illicit injections as a ''cadaver.'' The terms ''chipmunks'' and ''blowfish'' cover women who have been injected with so much material that their faces are severely bloated. ''Parrots'' are patients whose injections by amateurs cause their lips to resemble snouts.
 ''Some say they were injected with shark cartilage or with sheep collagen,'' Dr. Mayoral said. ''But most of them have no idea what they've got in their faces, which makes them hard to treat.''
 Repairs can be expensive. When patients come in with lopsided faces or lumpy lips, Dr. Mayoral injects fillers like Restylane. This works, but a treatment lasts no more than six months and can cost $600.
 Patients offer different explanations as to why they get beauty treatments from amateurs. ''Greed over getting a cheap deal made me do it, combined with my anxiety to be pretty,'' admitted Wilma Sepulveda, 51, an administrator at a real estate development company who is now one of Dr. Mayoral's patients. 
 Five years ago Ms. Sepulveda said she paid $2,000 for a series of 10 injections from Maria Collado, a cosmetologist who had an office in Hialeah. Ms. Sepulveda said she believed the woman was a dermatologist who was licensed in the Dominican Republic.
 After the injections Ms. Sepulveda's face became swollen and her lips developed irregular lumps, she said. Ms. Sepulveda's sister, Thelma Vasquez, who had her buttocks injected by the same practitioner, developed lesions and pus-filled sores. 
 (Police arrested Ms. Collado in 2003 for unlicensed medical activity unrelated to the case of Ms. Sepulveda, who did not file a criminal complaint. The charges against Ms. Collado were dropped in March 2005 after she completed an education program for first-time nonviolent offenders. Reached in the Dominican Republic, where she performs surgery, Ms. Collado denied ever practicing medicine in Florida.) 
 ''I thought just because she does not have credentials here does not mean she is not a doctor,'' Ms. Sepulveda said. ''But I learned my lesson.'' She then mentioned a cautionary phrase in Spanish. ''Lo barato sale caro,'' she said. ''Something that looks cheap can end up costing you dearly.'' While people like Ms. Sepulveda willingly visit unlicensed practitioners, other would-be patients in Miami believe they are seeing licensed doctors.
 In 2004 ''De Mananita,'' a Miami-based talk show on the Telemundo network, broadcast a series on cosmetic treatments featuring Luis Ayala, whom one talk show hostess referred to as ''our own trusted plastic surgeon.''
 Watching the segments, Victoria Arnaiz, a manicurist in Hialeah Gardens, was impressed by Mr. Ayala's professionalism. She had always wanted to have liposuction. So when the show flashed the name of Mr. Ayala's clinic, the Advanced Center for Cosmetic Surgery, she asked her husband to copy the phone number.
 Ms. Arnaiz then went to the clinic in Weston, an upscale suburb of Fort Lauderdale. There she met Mr. Ayala and Gregorio Nosovsky, a man wearing green surgical scrubs whom she believed to be another plastic surgeon. 
 They promised her that surgery would give her a body like Barbie's, she said. ''You say to yourself, 'These are the doctors I have been looking for,' '' Ms. Arnaiz said. Two weeks later both men were in the operating room before she received anesthesia for her liposuction, she said. After the post-operative corset was removed, Ms. Arnaiz discovered craterlike indentations on her back and cottage-cheese-like lumps in her abdomen, which a licensed plastic surgeon told her would cost $18,000 to $20,000 to fix. She cannot afford either fee. 
 Last April Mr. Nosovsky was arrested for the unlicensed practice of medicine after another patient complained. After Mr. Nosovsky's arrest, 35 women who had procedures at the clinic, including Ms. Arnaiz, contacted the police. Mr. Nosovsky's criminal case is pending in state court. His lawyer, J. David Bogenschutz, said Mr. Nosovsky is licensed in Mexico and ''may have explained operations and recuperations to people, but he never operated on a single patient while he was in the state of Florida.'' 
 Ms. Arnaiz has sued Mr. Nosovsky and Mr. Ayala, who has not been charged in a criminal complaint, for personal injury. Their civil lawyer, Louis Giovachino, declined to comment because of the lawsuit.
 Professional medical societies advise would-be patients to check the Web sites of state medical boards to verify that the doctors they consult are licensed. 
 In addition patients seeking cosmetic procedures are advised to contact medical boards to see that doctors are board certified in dermatology or plastic surgery. 
 ''People are so anxious to have beauty procedures that they spend less time investigating the practitioner than they would spend researching a new car or a piece of jewelry,'' said Dr. Michael D. Storch, a plastic surgeon in Miami. ''A recommendation from a friend, a neighbor or a hairdresser is not more important than a state license.''

HEADLINE: Profit Jumps 30% at Hewlett A Year Into Chief's Tenure

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
Nearly a year into his job as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, Mark V. Hurd is overseeing a company that is doing what he said it would do: increasing its revenue and improving its profit margins. 
 The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., reported yesterday that net income for the first quarter, which ended Jan. 31, rose to $1.23 billion, or 42 cents a share, from $943 million, or 32 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, a 30 percent increase.
 Revenue increased 6 percent, to $22.66 billion. When adjusted for the effects of currency exchange losses due to a weak dollar, growth would have been 8 percent. 
 ''We have a company riveted on what we can do,'' Mr. Hurd said. For instance, not only did sales in the company's personal computer business increase 8 percent from a year earlier, but operating profit as a percentage of revenue improved to 3.9 percent from 2.1 percent a year ago -- ''the highest level in many years,'' Mr. Hurd said. ''The results are showing up in the top line and in our margins.''
 ''For H.P., relative to its history, that is a good growth rate'' for revenue, said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. 
 Hewlett reported the results after the market closed. In after-hours trading, the stock was up $1.13, or 3.6 percent, to $32.80, largely because it surpassed analysts' expectations by 4 cents a share. The strong earnings growth can be attributed in part to continued cost-cutting. Mr. Hurd said he cut 1,800 jobs in the first quarter, only a portion of the 14,500 jobs Hewlett had already announced that it planned to cut. He said the company has completed about 40 percent of its plan to trim costs. 
 The company is also pushing new products to fuel growth. That earnings growth is larger and coming faster than investors had expected. For example, the company has been finding new uses for its inkjet printer head technology by making multiple printer heads on one cartridge capable of printing large advertising signs or quickly producing large print jobs. 
 The success of Hewlett's business model in this segment, what Mr. Hurd described as a ''demand creation model,'' depends on selling more of the printers that consume a lot of ink or toner. The company said it was experiencing strong growth as it advanced into commercial printing and continued to push color laser printers and copiers in offices. Shipments of its color laser printers were up 36 percent and shipments of multifunction printers increased by 43 percent. 
 Hewlett also said it sold 10 percent more printers to consumers in the quarter, which also bodes well for the supplies business over the next few quarters. That, in turn, bodes well for Hewlett's future earnings growth in this segment. Analysts calculate that operating margins on supplies are about 25 percent. 
 The result has been that revenue in the company's printing and imaging group grew 8 percent, to $6.5 billion, in the first quarter over a year earlier, the company said. The printing supplies business grew by 11 percent. 
 ''We've grabbed market share in printers that use a lot of supplies,'' Mr. Hurd said.
 Hewlett's personal computer business was also unusually strong, with unit shipments up 16 percent from last year. Earlier this week, the company said that because it expected strong sales of its laptops and its handheld computers, it had split off the responsibility for running the combined business to two executives. It hired David Rothschild, an executive with Sun Microsystems, to serve as the vice president of the handheld business. Ted Clark, a senior vice president, will continue to run the laptop business. 
 The only flagging segment was its consulting services division, where revenue declined 2 percent, to $3.8 billion. Mr. Hurd said that the company was being more cautious on which jobs it bids for. 
 Investors have been rewarded by the company's rising stock price. Hewlett was the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average in 2005, rising 37 percent. But many analysts are more cautious on the stock now because some question how the company will continue the pace of earnings growth once the cost-cutting program is finished later this year. 
 The company said it was sticking with earlier forecasts that it would bring in $90 billion to $91 billion in revenue for the full year. Hewlett estimates its second-quarter revenue will be $22.4 billion to $22.6 billion. It expects earnings per share in the current quarter will increase by 30 to 36 percent over 2005.
 ''We see a strong economy out there,'' Mr. Hurd said.

HEADLINE: Falling Oil Price Overshadows Concerns on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as lower oil prices tempered concern that the Federal Reserve's new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, might keep raising interest rates.
 Mr. Bernanke, in his first testimony to Congress, said sustained growth might lead to rate increases to contain inflation. Stocks slipped to the day's lows after his comments, only to rebound as oil retreated.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 30.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,058.97. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 4.47 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,280. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.26 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,276.43. 
 Oil prices slumped 3.2 percent, to $57.65 a barrel in New York, the lowest close since Dec. 19, after the Energy Department reported a jump in United States inventories. 
 The decline in oil prices helped push a measure of retailers up 1.1 percent for the biggest gain among 24 industry groups in the S.& P. 500. The S.& P. 500 retailing index has climbed for six consecutive days as the pullback in oil has eased concern that higher fuel costs would crimp consumer spending.
 Home Depot added 40 cents, to $41.53. Wal-Mart added 44 cents, to $46.89. Kohl's, a department-store company, climbed $1.28, to $46.80.
 Schlumberger, the oil-field services company, fell $2.22, to $112.65. Halliburton declined $2, to $68.61.
 Gold futures fell 1.1 percent on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $542.70 an ounce, as the slumping fuel prices reduced gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation. Copper futures declined for the first time this week, falling 3.3 percent, to $2.191 a pound, as imports by China were reduced.
 A gauge of raw materials producers in the S.& P. 500 fell 0.3 percent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, which runs the world's biggest gold mine in Indonesia, lost $2.21, to $50.27. The gold producer Newmont Mining dropped 34 cents, to $54.82. 
 Shares of BlackRock reached a record, while Merrill Lynch climbed to a five-year high after Merrill agreed to swap its fund-management unit for a 49.8 percent stake in the firm. The deal combines Merrill's funds, mainly in equities, with BlackRock's specialty in bonds, creating a company with $1 trillion in assets.
 BlackRock, which will become the fourth-largest United States investment company, jumped $5.29, to $151.25. Merrill, which will record a $1.1 billion gain from the sale, added 14 cents, to $75.30. 
 PNC Financial Services, whose stake in BlackRock will fall to 34 percent from 70 percent, rallied $2.10, to $69.07. PNC, Pennsylvania's largest bank, said it would record a $1.6 billion gain on the investment.
 Bear Stearns rose $2.07, to a record $131.61. The stock was upgraded to buy from neutral by a Merrill analyst, Guy Moszkowski.
 Biogen Idec, which is testing the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri with Elan of Ireland, gained $1.34, to $45.72, to help lift the Nasdaq. The companies said the Food and Drug Administration would allow a clinical trial of the drug to resume.
 Shares of Verizon Communications added 63 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $34.15. The company's chief executive, Ivan G. Seidenberg, urged lawmakers to adopt a rule that would make it easier for telephone companies to sell television service and compete with cable providers. 
 Almost seven stocks rose for every four that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.73 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 5.7 percent more than the three-month average.
 United States Treasuries were narrowly mixed yesterday. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 99 7/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.60 percent, from 4.61 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A Way to Cut Fuel Consumption That Everyone Likes, Except the Politicians

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the co-author, with Ben S. Bernanke, of "Principles of Economics." E-mail: rhf3@cornell.edu

 BODY:
SUPPOSE a politician promised to reveal the details of a simple proposal that would, if adopted, produce hundreds of billions of dollars in savings for American consumers, significant reductions in traffic congestion, major improvements in urban air quality, large reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and substantially reduced dependence on Middle East oil. The politician also promised that the plan would require no net cash outlays from American families, no additional regulations and no expansion of the bureaucracy. 
 As economists often remind their students, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. So this politician's announcement would almost surely be greeted skeptically. Yet a policy that would deliver precisely the outcomes described could be enacted by Congress tomorrow -- namely, a $2-a-gallon tax on gasoline whose proceeds were refunded to American families in reduced payroll taxes. 
Proposals of this sort have been advanced frequently in recent years by both liberal and conservative economists. Invariably, however, pundits are quick to dismiss these proposals as ''politically unthinkable.'' 
 But if higher gasoline taxes would make everyone better off, why are they unthinkable? Part of the answer is suggested by the fate of the first serious proposal to employ gasoline taxes to reduce America's dependence on Middle East oil. The year was 1979 and the country was still reeling from the second of two oil embargoes. To encourage conservation, President Jimmy Carter proposed a steep tax on gasoline, with the proceeds to be refunded in the form of lower payroll taxes. 
 Mr. Carter's opponents mounted a rhetorically brilliant attack on his proposal, arguing that because consumers would get back every cent they paid in gasoline taxes, they could, and would, buy just as much gasoline as before. Many found this argument compelling, and in the end, President Carter's proposal won just 35 votes in the House of Representatives.
 The experience appears to have left an indelible imprint on political decision makers. To this day, many seem persuaded that tax-cum-rebate proposals do not make economic sense. But it is the argument advanced by Mr. Carter's critics that makes no sense. It betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how such a program would alter people's opportunities and incentives. 
 Some examples help to illustrate how the program would work. On average, a family of four currently consumes almost 2,000 gallons of gasoline annually. If all families continued to consume gasoline at the same rate after the imposition of a $2-a-gallon gasoline tax, the average family would pay $4,000 in additional gasoline taxes annually. A representative family with two earners would then receive an annual payroll tax refund of $4,000. So, if all other families continued to buy as much gasoline as before, then, this family's tax rebate would enable it to do so as well, just as Mr. Carter's critics claimed.
 But that is not how things would play out. Suppose, for example, that the family was about to replace its aging Ford Explorer, which gets 15 miles per gallon. It could buy another Explorer. Or it could buy Ford's new Focus wagon, which has almost as much cargo capacity and gets more than 30 miles per gallon. The latter choice would save a whopping $2,000 annually at the pump. Not all families would switch, of course, but many would. 
 From the experience of the 1970's, we know that consumers respond to higher gasoline prices not just by buying more efficient cars, but also by taking fewer trips, forming carpools and moving closer to work. If families overall bought half as much gasoline as before, the rebate would be not $2,000 per earner, but only $1,000. In that case, our representative two-earner family could not buy just as much gasoline as before unless it spent $2,000 less on everything else. So, contrary to Mr. Carter's critics, the tax-cum-rebate program would profoundly alter not only our incentives but also our opportunities. 
 A second barrier to the adoption of higher gasoline taxes has been the endless insistence by proponents of smaller government that all taxes are bad. Vice President Dick Cheney, for example, has opposed higher gasoline taxes as inconsistent with the administration's belief that prices should be set by market forces. But as even the most enthusiastic free-market economists concede, current gasoline prices are far too low, because they fail to reflect the environmental and foreign policy costs associated with gasoline consumption. Government would actually be smaller, and we would all be more prosperous, if not for the problems caused by what President Bush has called our addiction to oil. 
 At today's price of about $2.50 a gallon, a $2-a-gallon tax would raise prices by about 80 percent (leaving them still more than $1 a gallon below price levels in Europe). Evidence suggests that an increase of that magnitude would reduce consumption by more than 15 percent in the short run and almost 60 percent in the long run. These savings would be just the beginning, because higher prices would also intensify the race to bring new fuel-efficient technologies to market. 
 The gasoline tax-cum-rebate proposal enjoys extremely broad support. Liberals favor it. Environmentalists favor it. The conservative Nobel laureate Gary S. Becker has endorsed it, as has the antitax crusader Grover Norquist. President Bush's former chief economist, N. Gregory Mankiw, has advanced it repeatedly. 
 In the warmer weather they will have inherited from us a century from now, perspiring historians will struggle to explain why this proposal was once considered politically unthinkable.

Broadway

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman)

'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JUMP/CUT' Neena Beber's play about an aspiring filmmaker's effort to document his best friend's illness limns despair while leaving the audience exhilarated -- by the fierce beauty of Beber's writing, and by a captivating performance by Luke Kirby as the brilliant, charismatic, darkly funny manic-depressive whose inescapable fate is the central mystery of the work (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn)

* 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the archmanipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)

'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)

'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

* 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates)

'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'THE BOOK OF THE DUN COW' An animal allegory about good and evil, this family musical by Randy Courts and Mark St. Germain is on the didactic side and could use more oomph. Providing some are an electric villain, Micah Bucey, and a warm-voiced mezzo, Carol Hickey. Still, a number of children at a recent performance seemed absorbed: they didn't squirm, they watched (2:15). West End Theater in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens)

* 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'PARADISE' A mostly articulate drama about an inarticulate young man who may have found Mr. Right or the tipping point that leads him into madness (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444.( Zinoman)

'REAL BLACK MEN DON'T SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR' The poet and playwright Malik's series of quick, interwoven scenes tracing the lives of African-American men in America, mainly in the last half century, can pack an emotional punch, but it works better as a showcase for some outstanding performances by its eight-member cast than it does as a theater piece (2:00). New Federal Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Stevens)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian''comedienne'' is a Style book prohibition/lg Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212).868-4444. closing March 10 !(Phoebe Hoban)

* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by H.I.V. diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)

* 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closing Sunday. (Brantley)

'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine-tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden)

'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)

* 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'CACHE (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)

* 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens)

'DESERT WIND' (No rating, 80 minutes, in French) In March 2004, the Swiss documentarist Francois Kohler took 13 men -- Canadian, French, Swiss and Belgian -- on a two-week trek in the Tunisian Sahara. The group was accompanied by a Swiss psychotherapist, as well as by a team of Tunisian guides with pack camels. The purpose of the trip: to stage a kind of men's encounter group in the desert, encouraging the participants to break away from received notions of masculinity and to talk about their desires, anxieties and deepest fears. Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, ''Desert Wind'' does manage to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind. (Stevens)

'FILM GEEK' (No rating, 78 minutes) Scotty Pelk (Malik Malkasian) is a diminutive, socially addled young man whose sole interest in life is the cinema. When he's fired from his job for, in essence, being too annoying, Scotty goes on a downward spiral, begging for work at every video store in town and obsessively courting a pretty film fan (Tyler Gannon) despite her increasingly humiliating rejection of him. Despite this semiautobiographical film's likable premise, Scotty Pelk, as written by James Westby and played by Mr. Malkasian, is actually so irritating, so genuinely hard to take, that like the rest of the characters in the movie, we soon find ourselves itching to get away from him. (Stevens)

'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee)

'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie cliches, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis)

'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott)

* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)

* 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)

'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee)

'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis)

* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)

'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis)

* 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden)

* 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)

'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)

'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)

* 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)

'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden)

'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden)

* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)

'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee)

'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School on Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture cliches. (Scott)

* 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)

'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned uber-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis)

'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)

'A YEAR WITHOUT LOVE' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Spanish) Anahi Berneri's debut film recounts in uncomfortable close-up the day-to-day activities of a youngish gay writer from Buenos Aires afflicted with AIDS, who becomes involved in S-and-M. Based on the diaries of the real Pablo Perez (he is also co-writer of the script), the film reveals rare insight into the endurance and treatment of illness, but is never fully arresting. (Laura Kern)

* 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis)

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ANTI-SOCIAL MUSIC (Thursday) The Anti-Social Music is a forum created to nurture a hybrid chamber music that is filtered though a punk sensibility, drawing on the talents of musicians in local bands like the Hold Steady, Ida, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Gang Gang Dance, World/Inferno Friendship Society and Balkan Beat Box. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $10. (Laura Sinagra)

BOBBY BARE JR., TEDDY THOMPSON (Tuesday) Bobby Bare Jr. of Nashville is a blunt songwriter who doesn't mince words. His music tweaks Americana with sounds from the new weird America. Another musical scion, Teddy Thompson, looks to distinguish himself from his folk-rocker parents, Richard and Linda, while still honoring their legacy. His baritone voice sounds like his father's without the bite, not always a bad thing. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)

BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB, ELEFANT (Tomorrow) Moving lately from the surly, noisy sound its name implies to a rootsier realm, the Los Angeles rockers Black Rebel Motorcycle Club now play harmonica and strum away on acoustic guitars. Elefant mines the same dark post-rock vein as Interpol, but without the tension and heft. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $22 in advance, $25 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)

BUCKWHEAT ZYDECO (Tomorrow) Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural Jr. is a zydeco accordionist whom rockers can love.

The band is an indefatigable party generator. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $20.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

GENO DELAFOSE AND FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Sunday).

Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $27 to $32. (Midgette)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tonight) Now in its third season, the Met's resident chamber ensemble offers another enticing program: Schnittke's Third Quartet, Giya Kancheli's ''Rag-Gidon-Time,'' Schumann's Piano Quartet and Dvorak's Bagatelles for two violins, cello and harmonium. 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $30. (Eichler)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic has made a big deal of paying tribute to Elliott Carter this season, but its performances of his works are so few and so widely spaced that you've probably forgotten about it. Not to worry: this week, Lorin Maazel and the orchestra get to one of Mr. Carter's true classics, the Variations for Orchestra, along with works by Brahms and Kodaly and, with Gil Shaham, Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1. On Thursday, Robert Spano takes over for the premiere of John Harbison's ''Milosz Songs,'' with Dawn Upshaw as the soloist, as well as works by Bartok and Bernstein. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76 today; $26 to $94 tomorrow and Thursday. (Kozinn)

JOHN O'CONOR (Thursday) This Irish pianist returns to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with a program of Beethoven, Schubert and Haydn. 8 p.m., Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Holland)

* 'LA PASION SEGUN SAN MARCOS' (Monday and Tuesday) ''Fasten your seat belts'' was one insider's advice at the Brooklyn Academy of Music a few years ago when this lionized piece by the composer Osvaldo Golijov had its New York premiere. A recasting of a Bach Passion for the South American vernacular, this ''Pasion'' is certainly approachable and stirring, and Mr. Golijov's biggest popular success -- if not perhaps as ground-breaking as many seem to think. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65. (Midgette)

* MARGARET LENG TAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) John Cage's 1944 score-painting, ''Chess Pieces,'' disappeared into a private collection soon after he wrote it, so when the pianist Margaret Leng Tan first saw it, last year, she knew she had a virtually unknown Cage work to perform. It wasn't that easy: the painting is a chessboard made of score shards, and Ms. Tan's job was to determine how those fragments were meant to fall together. She is playing the work, along with Vittorio Rieti's ''Chess Serenade'' and Michael Nyman's ''Pawn to King Four,'' as part of the Anthology Film Archives' ''Chess and Surrealism'' program. 8 p.m., Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 979-1027 ; $12. (Kozinn)

* CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF (Wednesday) This exceptional 39-year-old German violinist does not have the name recognition of some other soloists or the marketing muscle behind his career, but the depth and sensitivity of his playing have rightly made him a favorite among critics and connoisseurs. This week, he is joined by the pianist Lars Vogt in a promising program of all three Brahms violin sonatas. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45. (Eichler)

'VoiceS OF LIGHT' (Tonight) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and of her execution by being burned at the stake. It is to be performed by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers, and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn)

VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) George Steel and his superb chamber choir turn their attention to Jacobus Vaet, an obscure Flemish Renaissance master. This program of Vaet's sublime sacred music is filled out with works by Clemens Non Papa and Nicolas Gombert. 8 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 854-7799; $35; $21 for students. (Kozinn)

Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

* CARRIE AHERN (Thursday) Ms. Ahern describes her new ''Red,'' inspired by Margaret Atwood's ''Handmaid's Tale'' and by the clean lines of the performance space, as a ''work of beautiful suffocation.''

RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and Etudes; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38. (Roslyn Sulcas)

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday night at 7:30. , Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Dunning)

(La Rocco)

SARA EAST JOHNSON'S LAVA (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Johnson's award-winning, all-female company, LAVA, presents ''(w)HOLE'' (short for ''The Whole History of Life on Earth''), its first new work since 2003. Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25. (Erika Kinetz)

BILL T. JONES/ARNIE ZANE DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday, Thursday and Feb. 25) Dance gets a remix in ''Another Evening: I Bow Down,'' featuring old and new work by Mr. Jones, as well as live music and digital manipulations by Daniel Bernard Roumain. 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200; $35 and $45. (La Rocco)

Wyer and Jerome Begin, conducted by Andrea Quinn.

* KINGS OF THE DANCE (Thursday through next Sunday) Conceptually yet another ripoff of the Three Tenors, this program upon closer inspection looks a little more interesting than that. It offers Angel Corella and Ethan Stiefel of American Ballet Theater, Johan Kobborg of the Royal Ballet and Nikolay Tsiskaridize of the Bolshoi Ballet, joined by Alina Cojocaru and others from the Royal Ballet. There will be new choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, Roland Petit, Nils Christie, Stanton Welch and Tim Rushton, along with solos by Balanchine, Grigorovich, Petipa and Bournonville, and Fleming Flindt's complete ''Lesson,'' in which each king will dance the role of the teacher on successive nights. Thursday through Feb. 25 at 8 p.m., Feb. 26 at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.citycenter.org; $35 to $150. (John Rockwell)

ROMULO LARREA TANGO ENSEMBLE (Tonight) Three tango-dancing couples, and music by Carlos Gardel and Astor Piazzolla. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50. (Dunning)

SUSAN MARSHALL AND COMPANY (Wednesday) Ms. Marshall celebrates her company's 20th anniversary with her new ''Cloudless,'' a variety show, she says, of ''short, punchy, poem-sized pieces.'' (Through Feb. 25.) 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, corner of Valley Road and Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $35. (Dunning)

* 'MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP: THE EARLY YEARS' (Through March 5) This free exhibition of photographs by Tom Brazil is the opening event of a five-week celebration of the 25th anniversary of Mr. Morris's company. Daily, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. (Dunning)

(Through Feb. 26.) 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $18; $15 for students and 65+; T.D.F. accepted. (Dunning)

* NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Performing this weekend will be Cristina Hoyo's Ballet Flamenco de Andalucia (tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Compania Antonio el Pipa with the guest performers Mariana Cornejo, Concha Vargas and Juana del Pipa (Sunday at 7 p.m.) City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org or www.flamencofestival.org; $30 to $65. (Dunning)

92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL: SALLY-ANNE FRIEDLAND DANCE DRAMA COMPANY (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Tel Aviv-based Sally-Anne Friedland Dance Drama Company makes its United States debut. The South African-born Ms. Friedland danced with the Batsheva and Bat-Dor companies, but her own work is (according to the press materials) inspired by Carolyn Carlson and Pina Bausch. In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas)

BETH SOLL & COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Soll will present ''Mortal Angels,'' a dance (Ms. Soll) and video (Bryan Hayes) piece inspired in part by the image of a hidden child angel. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 924-7882; $12. (Dunning)

MAXINE STEINMAN & DANCERS (Wednesday, Thursday, Feb. 25 and Feb. 26) The 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Festival continues with a program that includes two premieres, one a collaboration between Ms. Steinman and her husband, the sculptor Alfredo Cardenas, and the video artist Tom Ruth. Wednesday, Thursday and Feb. 25 at 8 p.m., Feb. 26 at 2 and 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500; $20; students and 62+, $15. (La Rocco)

SUMMERFEST '06: BATOTO YETU (Wednesday) This free series -- what more do you need than palm trees for an early summer -- continues with music, dance and storytelling by bust-a-gut child performers. 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505 or www.worldfinancialcenter.com. (Dunning)

THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) This year's Pow-Wow, the company's 31st, includes dances, stories and traditional music from the Iroquois and American Indians of the Northwest Coast, the Southwest, the Plains and the Arctic regions. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 or www.theaterforthenewcity.net. Evening performances: $10.

(Dunning)

 Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)

* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)

International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

* MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

* MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith)

* P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)

Galleries: Uptown

Boyd & Evans: Color in Black and White' This husband-and-wife team from England makes large landscape and cityscape photographs in which all but selected central images have been drained of color. The best pictures, like that of the rusty brown tank standing all by itself in the midst of a black and white desert, are more strange and dreamy than gimmicky. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 439-1700, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson)

Robert S. Neuman: 'Fifty Years' With good humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through March 4. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

* 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

Norman Ballard: 'Standing Waves' A theatrical lighting designer and veteran laser light artist presents recent compact sculptures in which fine, colored laser lines rhythmically swing or rotate through colored liquids in glass containers. Framed by rugged metal elements, the sculptures combine industrial-strength materialism and the hypnotic appeal of the lava lamp. Bryce Wolkowitz, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 243-8830, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

EIRIK JOHNSON: 'BORDERLANDS' Small, serendipitous encounters in the landscape are the subjects of Eirik Johnson's large color photographs: junk hung picturesquely on a wire fence along a shore; a red sweater splayed between trees in a woods; a fragile, impromptu bridge of skinny longs laid across a creek. In one photograph, a huge crumple of grayish fabric plopped on grass and maybe used as a shelter has the imposing look of a sculptural boulder. There are no control-freak setups here. Rather, it seems that Mr. Johnson helps the camera make its own discoveries, often with poetic results. Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Feb. 25. (Glueck)

Sarah Pickering: 'Explosions' Winner of the 2005 Jerwood Photography Award, Ms. Pickering presents large and lush photographs of exploding bombs incongruously set off in pastoral settings as part of law enforcement training programs. Daniel Cooney, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 255-8158, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

ALEX SOTH: 'NIAGARA' Love and romance play tackily in these photographs of small town young people, while the nearby falls of Niagara provide a grand symphonic background. Mr. Soth's lens lingers on cheap motels that serve as wedding and honeymoon settings, people awkwardly dressed in celebration clothes, a purple-prose letter conveying declarations of the heart. On a grungy street an unglamorous mother stares unbeguilingly at the camera while cradling an infant. Mr. Soth, whose antecedents would seem to include the faux-vernacular photographs of William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, intersperses these shots with glorious scenics of the eternal Falls, doing their thing above and beyond local happenings. Ho, hum. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street (212) 741-1111, through Feb. 25. (Glueck)

* TRIFECTA This energetic curatorial face-off consists of three exhibitions devoted to young artists (nearly 20 in all) organized by the gallery's owner, Becky Smith, and her assistants, Esme Watanabe and Erica Samuels. The three groupings progress from minimal to hyper-real, with Ms. Watanabe's selection, which lands somewhere in the middle, edging out those of her colleagues. Sara VanderBeek's set-up photographs, which suggest a Surrealist's garret, are a find. Bellwether, 194 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Feb. 25. (Smith)

Johannes Wohnseifer: 'New Alphabet' Paintings and sculptures in several different styles by this brainy young German conceptualist obscurely explore semiotics relating to industrial, military, political and popular-entertainment spheres. He has a keen sense of design, and the sculptures made of pieces of shiny bent metal and thick felt are extremely elegant. But over all, his project looks like that of an academic theory wonk. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

* BEC STUPAK/HONEYGUN LABS: 'RADICAL EARTH MAGIC FLOWER' This ambitious gallery debut centers on a blind remake of Jack Smith's 1963 orgiastic ode to transvestism and Hollywood camp, ''Flaming Creatures,'' projected on a wall opposite the original, with Ms. Stupak's subtitlelike storyboards appearing in between. The contrast is mutually enhancing up to a point; the Stupak provides color and detail missing from the blurry, black-and-white Smith film, but the earlier effort still carries the day. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, through Feb. 25. (Smith)

* ZILVINAS KEMPINAS In contrasting works, the artist uses videotape to create one environment and record another. The resulting Op Art installation and the bike ride through Times Square conspire; sensory overload, both retinal and aural, ensues, as does a surprising application of the less-is-more principle. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through Feb. 25. (Smith)

Other Galleries

Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation of recent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

* 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter)

* 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. Granted that much of Downtown was throwaway stuff, too ephemeral and experimental to last; for better or for worse, it helped to change the definition of what art and artists might be. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck)

* Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson)

* HOME STORIES: AN INSIDE LOOK AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES IN AUSTRIA Departing from standard-issue architectural exhibitions with a slightly too clever design, this show of 21 recent houses includes portraits of their inhabitants and poster-size sheets free for the taking that function as both labels and catalog. The totality feels like a collaboration among Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the contemporary photographer of your choice, but it makes an excellent case for the vitality of Austrian architecture. Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Feb. 25. (Smith)

* 'Speak: Nine Cartoonists' Original drawings and studies by nine of the best comic book artists in the business, including R. Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778. Through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-7474; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400; closes Sunday. (Cotter)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639; closes Sunday.(Johnson)

HEADLINE: Welfare Agencies Seek Foster Children's Assets 

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: GREENSBORO, N.C. 

 BODY:
In 2004, at the age of 14 and at his own desperate request, John G. became a ward of North Carolina. 
 His mother abandoned him for crack when he was 3, and his adoptive father died of cancer a year later. A succession of guardians beat him, made him sell drugs and refused to buy him toys.
When he finally arrived at a county-financed group residence, he was wearing outgrown clothes. On the plus side, he was receiving Social Security survivor benefits and he held title to a modest house, willed to him by the adoptive father 10 years earlier and an asset that might give him traction, or at least a place to live, when he ''ages out'' of foster care at 18. 
 Now, the fate of the house -- and the insistence of Guilford County officials on taking all of John's Social Security benefits to help pay for his foster care -- are at the center of a legal battle with potential repercussions around the country. 
 The dispute is the latest in a continuing struggle between children's advocates and money-starved welfare agencies. They are wrestling over the proper use of more than $100 million in Social Security benefits that the states are taking on behalf of foster children with disabilities or a dead or disabled natural parent. 
 Determined to extract as much federal aid for social programs as the law will permit, some state welfare agencies even hire private companies, working for contingency fees, to help them reap more federal money by identifying foster children who are eligible for Social Security benefits. The money is then routinely used to help offset the cost of foster care. 
 Advocates for children question the wholesale takeover of money, accusing agencies of repaying themselves for care they are obligated to provide and of failing to use the windfall to meet children's individual needs, whether extra tutoring or counseling or, as in John's case, something more unusual. 
 Guilford County officials refused to release any of John's money, even when they learned that his last guardian had stopped making the $221 monthly mortgage payments on his house and that he faced its imminent loss. A local court has ordered the county to make payments for now, but the county has appealed and said it might appeal to the United States Supreme Court if necessary. 
 For John, who as a foster child may not be fully identified, it was clear as he visited the house recently that it represented not just money but also a precious link to his troubled past and an unknown future. 
 ''This is my childhood,'' John, now 15, said as he climbed through a broken window to explore the boarded-up structure for the first time since he fled it two years ago. On the floor of the bedroom, he found a brown teddy bear and clung to it, saying softly, ''My mother gave this to me before she left.'' 
 John has no idea how he will support himself, but he wants to live in the house he inherited, a property valued at $80,000. ''It will be a good place to be,'' he said.
 John's court-appointed volunteer protector found out about the threat to his house and enlisted a Legal Aid lawyer to help him fight for it. 
 ''For the state to pocket a child's money and allow his home to go into foreclosure just doesn't make sense,'' said his Legal Aid lawyer, Lewis Pitts. ''No one can say it's in the best interests of the child.'' 
 The benefits that states routinely take include both Supplemental Security Income, or S.S.I., and other Social Security money for children whose parents have died or are disabled. The payments are often close to $600 a month, and usually end when children reach 18 or 21. 
 ''The practice is not the result of deliberative policy discussions regarding how to best serve children in foster care,'' said Daniel L. Hatcher, a law professor at the University of Baltimore who is the author of an article on the subject that is to be published in The Cardozo Law Review. ''It is simply an ad hoc reaction by underfunded state agencies.'' 
 ''The Social Security benefits are treated as a funding stream,'' Mr. Hatcher said, rather than as an opportunity to provide any special services or to give children savings for the perilous months after they turn 18, when many fall into crime or homelessness. 
 A Supreme Court decision in 2003, overturning a decision by courts in Washington State, affirmed that states could legally use children's Social Security benefits to offset current ''maintenance costs.'' But it did not address a deeper question: does that always serve the child's ''best interests,'' as federal rules require, or the longer-term interests of the public for that matter? 
 In the case of John G., a Guilford County district court ruled last Dec. 29 that the state must pay up the mortgage and cover repairs so the house could be saved for the youth. Reviewing John's rough history and uncertain prospects, Judge Susan E. Bray declared that ''any reasonable person would see the fiscal wisdom'' of helping him keep the property. 
 The county has appealed to a higher state court, arguing that the state courts have no jurisdiction over the matter, that the county is legally entitled to use John's benefits to cover his care and that it has no responsibility to exhaust public resources so a child can own property. 
 ''The federal regulations say that the funds are to be used for current needs and expenses,'' said Lynne Shifton, an assistant county attorney. ''His house payments are not, in our opinion, to meet his current needs.'' 
 For now, the county must pay up the arrears on John's house and for needed repairs. A private group hopes to rent it as a transition home for foster children until John is able to move in. 
 State governments around the country stoutly defend their use of foster children's benefits. 
 Twenty-six states filed a supporting brief to the Supreme Court in the 2003 Washington case, noting that the practice had been approved by the Social Security Administration and arguing that barring it ''could leave the states in a position of economic peril.'' 
 If states cannot devote money to current care, the brief added, children will ultimately suffer because the states will not help eligible children sign up for benefits. 
 Many advocates for children agree with that point: preserving an incentive to enroll more children is good for them because the benefits will continue if the child is adopted or returns to his birth family. 
 ''If you tinker seriously with incentives of the child welfare agency, you can wind up doing a lot of harm,'' said Bruce Boyer, director of the child law clinic at Loyola University in Chicago.
 Mr. Boyer led a lawsuit that stopped Illinois from using benefits to cover, in addition to direct care expenses, the overhead costs of foster agencies. 
 Mr. Boyer said state governments had an inherent conflict of interest, serving as creditors trying to recoup the cost of their programs and also as trustees of children's money. As a first step, he said, agencies should try harder to find relatives or volunteers to serve as official recipients of benefits. 
 A new law in California, passed with the support of advocates for children, requires counties to evaluate each foster child for Social Security eligibility. But it also demands new scrutiny of how benefits are used and modest savings to help aging-out children become independent. 
 ''We are moving toward an individualized system, requiring counties to stop and think about the child at every stage of the process -- in choosing a payee, determining how to spend the money, and accounting for how the funds are spent,'' said Angie Schwartz, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law in Oakland, Calif.
 During John G.'s recent visit to his house, it became clear that the property may offer John more than shelter. 
 Its yard overgrown, its front plastered with a ''condemned'' poster because the utilities were cut off, the vacant house is an eyesore in a tidy cul-de-sac of similar homes, all built by Habitat for Humanity. 
 But neighbors poured forth with hugs and joy when John showed up unexpectedly and said that he hoped to move back. 
 ''He's had it real tough, but he's a good kid,'' said a mother from across the street. 
 As he left to return to his foster home -- he has recently moved from the group facility to a private home -- John vowed that he would return to the house in a few weeks, to mow the lawn.

HEADLINE: Mardi Gras Set for City Stripped of All but Pride

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
With a purplish dusk settling over the city, a few workers in a hurricane-damaged warehouse daub the final garish touches on an armada of Mardi Gras floats. Any day now, these grotesqueries on wheels will roll through city streets, reminding all who see them to seize the day, for tomorrow we fast.
 Across the rutted street from the warehouse, the workers can gaze at the railroad tracks and see an endless stretch of unspoiled white government trailers, sitting on flatcars like a broken string of oversize, colorless Mardi Gras beads. A different kind of grotesquerie on wheels, these trailers will be homes for the fortunate, reminding all who see them that six months after Hurricane Katrina, hard times, not good times, continue to roll in the great city of New Orleans.
 The first Mardi Gras parade of 2006 will strut and shout up Napoleon Avenue and then along St. Charles on Saturday, trumpeting a plaintive, post-traumatic theme: ''May God Bless New Orleans.'' This parade, and the more than two dozen to follow over the next 11 days, through Mardi Gras on Feb. 28, will wend through a city stripped of all but its pride in the wind and floodwaters. 
 The people on the floats will toss beads and plastic coins onto the New Orleans they love, but not quite the New Orleans they remember -- a city where the famous plea of the Mardi Gras spectator, ''Throw me something, mister,'' takes on a newer, more desperate meaning. 
 Fewer than half of the city's 465,000 residents have returned from the storm-induced diaspora -- but more are coming home every day, and faster than expected. Still, many black residents are absent, suggesting a demographic and cultural shift in the offing for a city that now has more whites than blacks for the first time in decades.
 The city government has no money, but chic restaurants hummed for Valentine's Day. About half the city's traffic lights remain out of order, but those working along Magazine Street control the growing traffic in Uptown. Garbage pickup is once a week, instead of twice, but the abandoned fetid refrigerators are long gone. Many homes have damaged electrical systems, but power is usually available once those homes are rewired. 
 In the French Quarter, you can have a cafe au lait and browse for antiques, and in Gentilly you can peer into the open windows and doors of deserted houses that look like rows of huge skulls. 
 This is New Orleans at Mardi Gras -- a place where the parade route of the future is still unclear. The end of summer, all of autumn, and most of the winter have passed, but Hurricane Katrina continues to define nearly every aspect of life. 
 The heart-pounding tales of survival, and the heartbreaking stories of loss, have lost their dramatic drive somehow. ''Let's get on with it,'' people here say.
 One who exemplifies this attitude stands outside that warehouse jammed with Mardi Gras giddiness: Louis Massett, president of Massett & Company, float maker. The hurricane destroyed about 35,000 square feet of his work space, after which looters paid a visit, taking tractors, generators and just about every hand tool.
 When he saw the devastation -- including an oversize jester's head, crushed, and an oversize hand, mangled -- Mr. Massett announced that he would not produce floats for the 2006 Mardi Gras. But he gradually changed his mind, he said, and now has to get out some 70 floats -- fewer than the 200 he usually produces, but he is still in business.
 Depending on where you wander, you can see businesses opening their doors, like flowers budding for a new spring. Near Tulane University, Yvonne LaFleur has been running the women's accessories shop that carries her name, while several neighboring stores remain shuttered. Broken glass dazzles the sidewalk near her palace of hats, gloves and gowns.
 Things are different, Ms. LaFleur said. Employees have not returned. The postman delivers letters maybe twice a week, but never any catalogs. The only coffee to be bought is at a gas station. And although about 80 percent of her business has returned, more of it is done online. Those who do visit the shop share storm stories that she cannot help but carry home. 
 Business for Mardi Gras hats, gowns, and the long kid gloves, selling for $289 a pair, has been good. But, she said softly, ''I have not seen any of my black debutante business.''
 Still, for every Yvonne LaFleur, there is a Rolando Duboue, owner of Royal Auto Parts in the Lower Ninth Ward, pointing to a water line nearly 10 feet high in his empty, echoing shop. For every Radio Shack open along Canal Street in the Central Business District, there is a closed Foot Locker.
 And for every Magazine Street, there is a South Claiborne Avenue: RiteAid, Popeye's, Hit 'n' Run Liquors, McDonald's, Pizza Hut (with a sign that reads ''izza ut''). Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, on a road pointed toward the Superdome.
 The sediment of unreality left in the hurricane's wake has yet to wash away. The city operates as if in a half-state between nightmare and full consciousness. It is a dreamy existence inconceivable to those living elsewhere, who believe that if the lights are on along Bourbon Street, then the city has returned to its unique state of normality.
 The city government remains in financial distress, despite laying off nearly half its work force last fall. Nearly $200 million in the red, it has yet to resume full property tax collection and is being kept afloat partly by loans from sympathetic bankers who have provided about $75 million.
 ''And we're going to them again,'' says Greg Meffert, the city's chief technology officer and a top aide to Mayor C. Ray Nagin. ''We're like, 'Dude, we're starving.' ''
 The criminal justice system, a part of the social contract normally taken for granted, sometimes seems to border on collapse. The courts building, the parish prison and the police headquarters have been unusable since the flood. At least 300 police officers, flooded from their homes, have been living on a couple of docked cruise ships that are set to sail in a couple of weeks. Parking meters are little more than curbside adornments, and jury trials are months away, awaiting courtrooms and a pool of jurors.
 For now, a prisoner's first appearance before a judge takes place in the grimy basement of the old city jail in Mid-City. The judge, in shirt-sleeves, walks to the back of the room to address prisoners who are lined up against a wall that still bears a five-foot-high waterline. The assistant district attorney, in a leather jacket and jeans, reads off the charges while chewing gum -- casual even by New Orleans standards.
 The public defender's office usually represents 80 percent of the defendants in this impoverished city, but only 7 of its 42 lawyers have returned. The system's inability to provide the constitutional right to counsel forced a Criminal Court judge last week to suspend all cases involving public defenders, and other judges may follow suit.
 ''It's a total breakdown of the state criminal justice system,'' says Arthur A. Lemann III, a defense lawyer here. ''It's incredible. I think they have better facilities in Afghanistan. It's a circus.''
 Other cornerstones of a normal society remain cracked. 
 Many school buildings, like the Louis Armstrong Elementary School in the Lower Ninth Ward, sit empty and mud-caked, like settings for teenage horror movies. Of the 117 schools in the city's scandal-plagued, underperforming system, only 19 will be open by Mardi Gras -- and most of those as charter schools, wrested from school officials by determined parents.
 Only three of the city's seven hospitals are open, and only a third of the area's doctors have returned, according to one recent survey. Before the storm, the metropolitan area had just over 5,000 hospital beds, but now that number is below 2,000.
 It seems that each new day presents another story of how government does wrong by New Orleans, from the failure to respond to Hurricane Katrina to the inability to get those trailers to people who need them. 
 In the poor St. Claude neighborhood, young men shooting a ball through a bent hoop joke about the flashes of white they see across the railroad tracks. ''Ain't stopping here,'' the men say, as they linger in the ghost town that was their childhood home.
 A damaged infrastructure, a flawed governmental response, an absence of some familiar faces, the pervading sense of loss -- all this might give the impression of a city in surrender. That impression would be false.
 Evidence of communal determination is reflected in the joggers in Audubon Park, the workers fixing a storm-damaged U-Haul sign, the ''WELCOME HOME'' messages adorning the Times-Picayune newspaper boxes. More telling, though, is that the determination is found in places hardest hit by the hurricane, including neighborhoods that one day might have to prove their ability to survive to city officials considering what to salvage and what to abandon.
 These days, Gentilly is mostly a neighborhood of absence, with rows of deserted houses that take on a haunted quality once night falls. But on Music Street, a light shines in the gutted home of Karry and Deanna Causey, a middle-class couple in their mid-40's who have become pioneers in their neighborhood of 14 years.
 Flooded out and scattered to faraway places, they returned to a corrupted home that posed the question: What now? They decided to gut and rebuild, while they and their three children lived in one of those white trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 Electricians and drywall workers drill and bang out a reconfigured Causey home that will include an extra 500 square feet for an upstairs den.
 They know they will not see any neighbors for another six months, but they also know that neighbors will return. 
 ''We don't like giving up,'' Mrs. Causey said. ''Everything has changed, nothing has changed. Does that make sense?'' 
 That sentiment is echoed in the Lakeview neighborhood, where the breach in the 17th Street Canal inundated this mostly white, mostly middle-class community with the waters of Lake Pontchartrain. Much of Lakeview remains deserted, although cropping up on lawns are little signs that say, ''We're Coming Home to Lakeview.''
 These words are meant to signal to those who are undecided about returning that this neighbor is coming back, and this neighbor, and this neighbor. 
 Among those returning is Charles Young, 63, a professional fund-raiser whose home of 31 years accepted seven feet of water that swallowed family heirlooms, family pictures, a family's way of life.
 As he stands in what had been the living room, in the house where he and his wife, Sandy, raised and married off three daughters, Mr. Young chokes up -- ''I'm getting a little emotional, I'm sorry'' -- but soon regains his composure and optimism. His plan, he says: bulldoze, rebuild, remain.
 Mr. Young says that, by the way, he is a lieutenant in the Hermes Krewe, a social club that is organizing a Mardi Gras parade for next Friday. Which makes him think: He has to remind a son-in-law to get a ''set of tails'' for next week's Hermes ball.
 The very thought of Mardi Gras -- of worrying about a set of tails -- in a city just emerging from a coma may seem odd, even inappropriate, to outsiders. But many people here say it will help the gasping economy, maintain a cherished tradition, and provide a welcome, if temporary, distraction. 
 This does not mean the event is free of awkwardness. Carl Henry, 42, is a member of the all-black Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, one of the oldest and liveliest organizations in the Mardi Gras pantheon. Like so many others, including some of his Zulu colleagues, he is also a hurricane victim cum survivor: nine feet of water in his East New Orleans home. He and his family know the confines of a trailer.
 For 20 years he has taken part in Zulu's Mardi Gras parade, tossing trinkets, called throws, from the floats, strutting, laughing. But this year he will not join the parade because, he says, ''It's not the right time.''
 ''I don't feel comfortable,'' Mr. Henry says. ''The money I would spend on trinkets I would put to better use for me and my family. That's just my situation.''
 Still, when Zulu conducts its post-parade march up Orleans Avenue, past the deserted shotgun houses, past the shuttered doors of the Dooky Chase restaurant, past the ''Now Open'' banner of the Busy Bee food store, Mr. Henry will be at the club, waiting to welcome his brothers home.

HEADLINE: Don't Dumb Down the Army

BYLINE: By Kelly M. Greenhill. 
Kelly M. Greenhill is an assistant professor of government at Wesleyan and a research fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
DESPITE claims to the contrary by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the Army is facing a manpower crisis. The evidence can be found in two separate reports released last month -- one commissioned by the Pentagon, the other by Congressional Democrats -- and in this simple fact: last year the Army accepted its least qualified pool in a decade. 
 The Army inducted both more recruits without high school diplomas and more youths scoring in the lowest category of the Army's aptitude test, so-called Category IV recruits. 
Welcoming more such recruits into the military has obvious appeal at a time when recruitment numbers are slipping, while manpower needs remain acute. But the adoption of lower standards to fill the ranks is shortsighted and imprudent. Moreover, continuing or expanding this policy would be a mistake for the Army and for the recruits themselves. Pentagon officials should know this better than anyone: their previous experiments with lower standards were clear failures.
 Four decades ago, during the Vietnam War, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara created Project 100,000, a program intended to help the approximately 300,000 men who annually failed the Armed Forces Qualification Test for reasons of aptitude. The idea behind Mr. McNamara's scheme was that the military would annually absorb 100,000 of the country's ''subterranean poor'' -- people who would otherwise be rejected. 
 Using a variety of ''educational and medical techniques,'' the Pentagon would ''salvage'' these Category IV recruits first for military careers and later for more productive roles in society. Project 100,000 recruits -- known as New Standards Men -- would then return to civilian life with new skills and aptitudes that would allow them to ''reverse the downward spiral of human decay.''
 Mr. McNamara further concluded that the best way to demonstrate that the induction of New Standards Men would prove beneficial was to keep their status hidden from their commanders. In other words, Project 100,000 was a blind experiment run on the military amid the escalation of hostilities in Southeast Asia. 
 Despite the skepticism of the military leadership and objections from some of Mr. McNamara's own advisers, the first New Standards Men began entering service in October 1966. By the time of the Tet offensive in 1968, approximately 150,000 had been inducted. 
 While standards were lowered for entry into the services, they were not lowered for acceptance to the military's technical schools. After basic training, only the most technically qualified moved onto advanced training. The rest ended up in ''soft skill'' areas, including supply, food service, clerical and, most significantly, the infantry. 
 In the program's first three years, nearly half of the Army's and well over 50 percent of the Marines' New Standards Men were assigned to combat specialties. The results were not surprising: a Project 100,000 recruit who entered the Marine Corps in 1968 was two and a half times more likely to die in combat than his higher-aptitude compatriots. After all, they tended to be the ones in the line of fire.
 But Project 100,000 recruits fared poorly outside combat as well. A tenet of the program was that participants would be held to the same performance standards as their higher-aptitude peers. If they fell short, their only options were reassignment or remedial training. 
 Research conducted in the late 1980's revealed that across the services Project 100,000 recruits were reassigned at rates up to 11 times greater than their peers. Likewise, 9 percent to 22 percent of these men required remedial training, as compared to only one to three percent of their higher-category counterparts in the Army, Air Force and Navy. 
 Depending on the task, New Standards Men required up to four times as much training time and up to six times as much prompting as did their higher-aptitude counterparts. Their skills training dropout rates -- and their arrest rates -- were higher, too. In short, Mr. McNamara's enterprise, which was abandoned in 1971, did not prove especially beneficial to the military from either a skills or a manpower perspective.
 But what about Project 100,000's effects on the Category IV recruits themselves? Did they reap the promised rewards of military service? If the program had been successful, the proof would have been higher rates of employment, earnings and education for New Standards Men as compared to their fellow low-aptitude, non-veteran peers. 
 Yet a 1991 study comparing Project 100,000 veterans and nonveterans with similar aptitude levels revealed that the former fared no better than their civilian counterparts and, in some respects, were worse off.
 For instance, non-veterans were employed at higher rates, earned more and were more likely to own their own businesses than Project 100,000 veterans. Moreover, low-aptitude non-veterans had marginally higher average levels of schooling than did New Standards Men, more than 27 percent of whom never completed high school. 
 If Project 100,000 represented a real opportunity for self-improvement, why weren't most if not all of these men better off economically, educationally and socially after their service? There's no clear answer to this question. One possibility is that Project 100,000 veterans fared worse than non-veterans of similar aptitude because they also had to contend with the psychological repercussions of prolonged combat; another is that these veterans were simply less well-equipped to readjust to civilian life.
 What is clear, though, is that Project 100,000 was a failed experiment. It proved to be a distraction for the military and of little benefit to the men it was created to help. Forty years later, amid new conflicts and a renewed manpower shortfall, we would do well not to make the same mistake again.

HEADLINE: Gold Mining Company to Pay Indonesia $30 Million 

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Newmont Mining Corporation agreed Thursday to pay $30 million to Indonesia in a settlement of a civil lawsuit in which the government argued that the company had polluted a bay with arsenic and mercury.
 The settlement will have no effect on a criminal trial of the company and its Indonesian director that is now under way in the province of Northern Sulawesi, Indonesian officials said.
 Under the terms of the ''good-will agreement,'' the government will drop a $135 million suit filed against Newmont last year after villagers near the mine at Buyat Bay, in Northern Sulawesi, complained of tumors, rashes and other illnesses that they said were caused by the waste from the company's gold mine. 
 The accord does not directly address the question of pollution and does not state whether the company's mine, which deposited mine waste through a pipe into equatorial waters, polluted the bay. The company denies the pollution charges. 
 The only reference to pollution in the accord says, ''Although Newmont maintains that its operations did not cause environmental pollution, both parties recognize that other parties have expressed different views.'' 
 Mahendra Siregar, deputy coordinating minister for economic affairs, said the pollution issue ''was not the focus'' of the agreement. 
 ''We would prefer the court proceed without any reference to what we have signed,'' he added in reference to the criminal proceedings. The government contends in the criminal case that Newmont polluted the bay and deposited its waste, laden with heavy metals, without a proper permit. 
 The importance of the agreement for Newmont -- one of the world's largest gold miners, with operations in the United States, Africa and Latin America -- was evident in the presence at the announcement on Thursday of the chief executive, Wayne Murdy, who flew in from company headquarters in Denver.
 The company operates a far larger and more valuable gold and copper mine on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa. The gold mine above Buyat Bay closed in 2004 after eight years of operation, and many of the villagers relocated last year, citing fears for their health.
 The Buyat Bay mine was the subject of an internal company audit in 2001 that showed tons of toxic mercury vapors were put into the air when a pollution-control device failed. The company did not dispute that the emissions occurred over four years but said they were not harmful to the environment or to the people. Neither the Indonesian government's civil suit nor the criminal suit addresses the mercury emissions. 
 Newmont's vice president for Indonesian and Australian operations, Robert Gallagher, said the accord called for a six-member scientific team to monitor the environment around the mine for the next 10 years. The $30 million, to be spent over the next decade, will be dedicated to the monitoring and to community development in Northern Sulawesi, he said. 
 Mr. Gallagher also described the accord as ''independent'' of the criminal proceedings. He said he believed that the company's scientific studies would ''exonerate us from the charges'' at the trial. 
 The question of whether arsenic and mercury contained in the mine waste polluted the sediment in the bay is highly contentious, as both the government and the company have marshaled evidence to buttress their arguments. Both sides agree that tests showed the water quality in the bay met Indonesian standards. 
 Indonesia's Ministry of Environment contends that the waste from the gold mine left high levels of arsenic and mercury in the sediment on the floor of the bay. The arsenic entered bottom-feeding organisms, known as benthos, which provide food for fish, the ministry said in a study in late 2004. 
 Newmont denies that the arsenic entered the food chain, saying it was a kind that would not dissolve in water. 
 A report commissioned by Newmont by the Australian government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization noted elevated levels of arsenic in the sediment near where the mine waste was deposited. But the company argues that the fish in the bay were not contaminated. 
 The arguments over pollution have focused on whether the system of waste disposal, known as submarine tailing disposal, worked as safely as the company says. The method is essentially banned in the United States.
 In the past, neither side has trusted the other's scientific results, largely because of questions about the independence of the scientists paid to do the studies. The accord stipulates that the new six-member team to monitor the bay will be chosen equally by Newmont and the government, with each side having a veto over nominations. 
 Over all, Mr. Mahendra, who helped negotiated the deal, said it was a victory for the local people. ''The people and the environment are the winners, nobody else,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Will Decline With Economy 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
TWO decades ago, at a street fair called the Flatbush Frolic, I met the young congressman who represented the Brooklyn district to which I had recently moved. Few others seemed interested in talking to him, and we chatted for a few minutes.
 One of the things he told me has stuck with me all these years. He said he had been the only congressman from New York City to vote against a union-backed piece of protectionist legislation aimed at stemming imports of cheap clothes. 
He figured, he said, that more of his constituents benefited from buying cheap clothes than would be helped by pushing up the price to save some textile jobs.
 Now, many politicians seem far less open to cheap imports. Expanding trade deficits ''indicate a slow bleeding at the wrists economically for the United States,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, after the government reported that the 2005 trade deficit hit $726 billion, more than a quarter of it coming from trade with China. ''The numbers indicate deep-seated, fundamental problems within the U.S. economy that the Bush administration has not shown the competence or willingness to fix,'' he added.
 Mr. Schumer has been among the most vocal on Capitol Hill in demanding that the government do something to force China to revalue its currency, a move that would instantly make purchases by his constituents more expensive.
 In other words, his position seems to be diametrically opposed to the message I heard that day from the young congressman who was, as it happens, the very same man.
 Mr. Schumer sees no inconsistency. The 1986 bill, he told me, was about textiles, where the United States was not going to be competitive. But China's refusal to revalue its currency ''puts in walls against everything, including places where we would be highly competitive.'' 
 And anyway, he added, ''To the person who has lost his job unfairly, it is small consolation that his neighbor can buy a shirt for 50 cents less.''
 Beyond trying to force China to revalue, Mr. Schumer does not have many ideas to fix the trade deficit. He talked of better education and cutting the budget deficit, but those are long-term solutions at best. 
 Higher long-term interest rates would help by reducing the ability of Americans to consume by borrowing against their homes. So would a recession. Those are not politically attractive. The Bush administration chooses to put on a happy face. The Economic Report of the President, released this week, has no chapter on the trade deficit. Instead it has one on the ''capital account surplus,'' reflecting the fact that investments must offset trade deficits. It concludes that, to the extent anything must be done about trade deficits, it is other countries that should act.
 Such benign neglect of trade issues is better than protectionism, but it is interesting that China has become the whipping boy. Trade with China accounted for 26 percent of the United States' trade deficit in 2005, a smaller share than in 1997, although the deficit was a lot smaller then.
 The real risk of protectionist legislation is likely to peak when the trade deficit is falling. ''When the economy is growing handsomely, so is the trade deficit,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of the brokerage firm ITG/Hoenig. ''But when the economy is weak and the trade deficit is shrinking, people get apoplectic about imports.''
 There is little the United States can do to force China to let its currency appreciate, but it will happen eventually. The decision on whether, or when, Mr. Schumer's constituents will pay more for imports will be made in Beijing, not Washington.

HEADLINE: Oil's a Means, Not an End, At Dubai Inc.

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, slim, soft-spoken and with a worldly air that is right at home here in an elegant drawing room of an old-money West End hotel, is the personification of what outsiders increasingly refer to as Dubai Inc.
 And he sees no reason that Dubai, where he serves as one of the royal family's most trusted financial advisers, should not be accepted as a full-fledged and legitimate player on the global business stage.
But that has not stopped the emirate's rapidly expanding business empire from coming under scrutiny, as a group of Washington lawmakers asked the White House on Thursday to re-examine Dubai's most recent deal, the $6.8 billion acquisition of Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation of Britain. 
 The deal, which sailed through the regulatory process before this week's complaints, places Mr. Sulayem, 51, at the helm of one of the world's largest port companies. It puts Dubai in control of several major ports in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere along the Atlantic Seaboard. 
 Lawmakers, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, argue that Dubai should not be considered a trustworthy operator, because of links between the United Arab Emirates and some of the 9/11 terrorists. 
 Dubai, surrounded by oil wealth, has already become the booming home of over-the-top hotels, condos, offices and tourist attractions that are attracting billions in investments from its neighbors. But as it ventures further abroad, it is attracting more attention, not all of it positive.
 Mr. Sulayem, who put the P.& O. deal together, has a simple explanation for the emirate's success in transforming what was just a sleepy local port two decades ago into a global titan.
 ''It's the product of 30 years of hard work,'' Mr. Sulayem said in a interview here at Duke's Hotel, near Buckingham Palace. ''We are reaping the benefits of taking chances in investment in our country.'' 
 Responding to questions raised earlier this week by Senator Schumer about the P.& O. deal, Mr. Sulayem said, ''We are working closely with the Americans.'' 
 Mr. Sulayem personally signed on to an American security initiative, he said, that allows Coast Guard officials to examine containers at its ports. Moreover, he noted, American aircraft carriers frequently dock safely in Dubai's own ports.
 ''We're very active with the States and they are very happy with our cooperation,'' he said.
 DP World, the Dubai port company, said in a statement Thursday that it had received all the necessary approvals from United States regulators, and that it planned to maintain or enhance security arrangements at American ports. 
 Dubai's economy is very different from that of its Mideast neighbors.
 While oil was found in Dubai in the 1970's, its rulers also found that they did not have very much of it. The Maktoum royal family decided to diversify immediately and use the oil profits to turn the state -- about the size of Rhode Island -- into a shipping, tourism and financial center for the region. Success has come from sticking to that plan, Mr. Sulayem said. 
 ''The region has been through many crises,'' he said. ''The one thing that we did that the rest of the region didn't is that we pressed on investing.'' Today oil revenue accounts for just 6 percent of Dubai's income.
 ''It was a very well-planned, thorough development strategy,'' said Simon Williams, a senior economist with the Economist Intelligence Unit in London who specializes in the Middle East.
 Dubai has ''grown rapidly in a sophisticated and coordinated way,'' Mr. Williams said.
 Deciphering how much Dubai has invested is difficult, because its privately run companies do not make figures available. Some analysts in London estimate that Dubai has invested $100 billion in new projects, but Mr. Sulayem said that may be a bit low. 
 Overall profit margins and revenue are also not available, but Mr. Sulayem said that every sector in the emirate was enjoying double-digit growth. 
 Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai who became emir when his brother died in January, has been the driving force behind the emirate's push to diversify, Mr. Sulayem said. 
 ''When I was a graduate student,'' he said of his time at Temple University in Philadelphia, ''I happened to be meeting with our ruler,'' who had decided to start an airline. It was in the early 1980's, and Mr. Sulayem said that ''I thought it was a very big mistake.''
 As it turned out, the sheik was right and Mr. Sulayem was wrong, he said. The Emirates Group of Dubai earned 2.6 billion United Arab Emirates dirham (about $708 million) in its 2004-5 fiscal year, up 48 percent from the year before. 
 But outsiders say that Mr. Sulayem has played a big role in Dubai's growth.
 Mr. Sulayem is one of ''three people in Dubai right now who are trusted without a doubt'' by the Maktoum family, according to one investment banker who has done deals in Dubai but said he did not want to be identified by name so as not to appear to be publicly flattering Mr. Sulayem. ''He's part businessman and part diplomat,'' the banker said. 
 Sheik Mohammed, he added, ''asks a lot of questions and these three guys go looking for the answers.'' 
 Joining Mr. Sulayem in that inner circle are Mohammad al-Abbar, chairman of the Emaar Group, a real estate business, and vice chairman of Dubai Bank; and Mohammad al-Gergawi, chief executive of Dubai Holding, the huge investment company responsible for developing real estate and media businesses in the region. 
 Like many who work at Dubai Inc., Mr. Sulayem wears many hats. He serves as chairman of DP World, the company that runs Dubai's port and which acquired P.& O. He also serves as executive chairman of Nakheel, the United Arab Emirates property developer that is building a giant palm-shaped man-made island off Dubai to house luxury vacation homes.
 And he is executive chairman of Istithmar (Arabic for investment), a private equity fund. In his (presumably scarce) free time, he relaxes by taking part in long-distance horse races and spends time with his eight children.
 Bankers and advisers from outside Dubai who have done business in the region say that they sometimes view the three men as competitors, who vie to top each other by doing more spectacular deals and creating bigger real estate projects. Mr. Sulayem acknowledges there is some competition. 
 ''Dubai is like someone who owns many horses,'' he said. ''He doesn't just put one horse in the race, he puts many with many chances of success.''
 Dubai's fans warn that its double-digit growth could be cut short by a drop in oil prices. ''Dubai presents itself as a nonoil economy, but it is very much riding the oil boom,'' said Mr. Williams of the Economist Intelligence Unit. 
 Whatever the future holds, Mr. Sulayem still has plenty of partners.
 ''Dubai has truly established itself,'' said Greg Norman, the Australian golfer turned entrepreneur, in an e-mailed response to questions. Mr. Norman is designing three golf courses for Nakheel, the real estate company that Mr. Sulayem runs. 
 ''The strategic future for Dubai,'' Mr. Norman said, ''is that of tourism and a destination for international business.''

HEADLINE: On Private Web Site, Wal-Mart Chief Talks Tough

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
In a confidential, internal Web site for Wal-Mart's managers, the company's chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., seemed to have a rare, unscripted moment when one manager asked him why ''the largest company on the planet cannot offer some type of medical retirement benefits?''
 Mr. Scott first argues that the cost of such benefits would leave Wal-Mart at a competitive disadvantage but then, clearly annoyed, he suggests that the store manager is disloyal and should consider quitting.
The Web site, which Mr. Scott uses to communicate his tough standards to thousands of far-flung managers, gives a rare glimpse into the concerns that are roiling Wal-Mart's retailing empire, from the company's sagging stock price to how it treats its workers. Judging by the managers' questions, Mr. Scott has an internal public relations challenge that in some ways mirrors the challenge he faces from outside critics. 
 And while Mr. Scott's postings are usually written in a careful, even guarded manner, they can often be revealing -- for example, showing a defensiveness and testiness with critics -- that Mr. Scott normally keeps under wraps.
 Copies of Mr. Scott's postings covering two years were made available to The New York Times by Wal-Mart Watch, a group backed by unions and foundations that is pressing Wal-Mart to improve its wages and benefits. Wal-Mart Watch said it received the postings from a disgruntled manager. While the existence of the Web site and Mr. Scott's participation in it have been known, transcripts have never been made public before.
 The Web site has a folksy name -- Lee's Garage, because Mr. Scott pumped gas at his father's Kansas service station while growing up.
 But its tone is at times biting. In his response to the store manager who asked about retiree health benefits, Mr. Scott wrote: ''Quite honestly, this environment isn't for everyone. There are people who would say, 'I'm sorry, but you should take the risk and take billions of dollars out of earnings and put this in retiree health benefits and let's see what happens to the company.' If you feel that way, then you as a manager should look for a company where you can do those kinds of things.''
 Mona Williams, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said Mr. Scott responded so sharply because of the manager's sarcastic tone. The question, she said, indicated the manager failed to understand how competitive retailing is and would not be able to convey that to his subordinates.
 ''At Wal-Mart, we communicate very candidly with one another,'' she said. She added that Mr. Scott's tone did not deter employees from asking questions, noting that 2,147 questions have been asked since last April.
 Commenting on a labor union that is fighting Wal-Mart's expansion plans in New York City and elsewhere, Mr. Scott wrote in the Web site, ''that way its members' employers'' -- meaning many Wal-Mart competitors -- ''can continue to charge extremely high prices for food and tolerate poor service.''
 Stung by the many news media reports about allegations of sex discrimination, off-the-clock work and child labor violations at Wal-Mart, Mr. Scott wrote, ''The press lives on things that are negative.''
 The Web site shows many sides of one of the nation's most powerful executives. He denounces managers who complain about the company or their subordinates. He frets about the success of his discount rival Target. He exhorts employees to act with integrity. He mocks General Motors for problems caused by its generous benefits. He rejects a manager's suggestion that Wal-Mart has created ''a culture of fear,'' and he hails Wal-Mart's performance in responding to Hurricane Katrina. 
 Mr. Scott has made some of these points before in public speeches, but in these confidential e-mail messages to managers, he delivers far blunter insights in much greater detail.
 In one posting, he urges managers to set an example by doing more to comply with the company's 10-foot rule, requiring employees to smile and ask ''Can I help you'' when a shopper is less than 10 feet away.
 In his postings, Mr. Scott tries to strike a chummy, ''in the trenches'' tone, reminding managers how frequently he visits stores -- at least once a week -- and pops into meetings unannounced ''to make sure there's not a filter keeping me from hearing what's really important.''
 But his responses often serve to remind managers of the gap between them and their chief executive, who earned more than $17 million last year, including stock options, who hops around the globe on Wal-Mart's fleet of jets and who lives in a gated community called Pinnacle. 
 ''I recently had dinner with the prime minister of the U.K., Tony Blair, and his wife; my wife and I had a meeting with Prince Charles to talk about sustainability; and I met with Steve Case, the founder of AOL, and talked about health care,'' Mr. Scott wrote in a two-week-old entry describing how he represents Wal-Mart around the world.
 Mr. Scott, 56, joined Wal-Mart in 1979 as its assistant trucking manager. Helped by his affable manner and his command of the company's vast distribution system, he was named chief executive in 2000. 
 Throughout the dozens of postings, Mr. Scott shows deep concern about the many attacks and allegations that Wal-Mart skirts environmental and labor laws. He acknowledges that Wal-Mart used to have a greater tolerance for managers who cut corners, but his postings insist that Wal-Mart's new focus is on total compliance with the law. In a posting last June, he quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., saying, ''The time is always right to do what is right.''
 Responding to a manager's question about attacks on Wal-Mart's image, Mr. Scott wrote in an April 2004 posting: ''Your value to Wal-Mart is outweighed by the damage you could do to our company when you do the wrong thing.''
 ''If you choose to do the wrong thing: if you choose to dispose of oil the wrong way, if you choose to take a shortcut on payroll, if you choose to take a shortcut on a raise for someone -- you hurt this company,'' he added. ''And it's not unlikely in today's environment that your shortcut is going to end up on the front page of the newspaper. It's not fair to the rest of us when you do that.''
 Lee's Garage was set up in January 2004, at Mr. Scott's suggestion, to improve communications with managers after a wave of particularly bad publicity, including a federal raid that rounded up 250 illegal immigrants who cleaned Wal-Mart stores and a class-action lawsuit charging sex discrimination, filed on behalf of 1.6 million current and former female employees. 
 Ms. Williams of Wal-Mart said a public relations assistant screened the questions and Mr. Scott dictated responses to an aide. At first the site was accessible only to salaried managers. Last October, it became available to all 1.3 million employees in the United States.
 The questions posted on the Web site range from the self-interested (when will managers receive a raise?) to the competitive (will the merger of Sears and Kmart hurt Wal-Mart?) to the academic (is Wal-Mart technically a monopoly that could be broken up?). 
 A recurring theme is the attacks on Wal-Mart's image and managers' worries that these attacks are undermining employee morale and the company's ability to grow. Asked if the negative publicity has slowed Wal-Mart's expansion, Mr. Scott responded: ''I think it probably has. You can't get letters that say, 'I read where you're doing this and therefore I'll never shop with you again,' and assume everyone who writes that is just some nut. Some of those are real people who don't know us and believe what they've read.'' 
 A manager of a Wal-Mart's store in Medford, N.Y., asked about Wal-Mart's repeated failure to gain zoning variances and other government permits to open its first store in New York City. ''We're going to have to be a lot more sophisticated about it than we have been,'' he said, saying that Wal-Mart brings good jobs and great prices. ''But I think you'll see us get the stores.''
 Though Wal-Mart is three times larger than its next biggest retail rival, Mr. Scott appears to be preoccupied with competitors whose individual store sales are growing faster than Wal-Mart's -- namely Target and Walgreens.
 Asked about Wal-Mart's stock price, which has fallen 11 percent in the last five years. Mr. Scott said: ''You cannot have Target or Walgreens beating you day after day after day.'' Mr. Scott wrote that one reason Wal-Mart's same-store sales were growing more slowly than Target's was that Wal-Mart's customers earn less and have been squeezed worse by soaring fuel prices. 
 ''Wal-Mart's focus has been on lower income and lower-middle income consumers,'' he wrote. ''In the last four years or so, with the price of fuel being what it is, that customer has had the most difficult time. The upper-end customer got a tremendous number of tax breaks about four years ago. They have been doing very well in this economy.''
 He said having to pay $50 to gas up a car did not change anything for rich customers, but did for those who didn't earn a lot. ''It changes whether or not you go to the movie, whether or not you buy new sheets, whether or not you go out to eat.''
 At several points, Mr. Scott addressed criticisms that Wal-Mart health plan was too stingy toward its employees. He said that Wal-Mart's health plan ''stacks up very, very competitively'' with other retailers. In a knock at companies that provide more generous benefits, Mr. Scott wrote: ''One of the things said about General Motors now is that General Motors is no longer an automotive company. General Motors is a benefit company that sells cars to fund those benefits.''
 In one posting, Mr. Scott talked about how proud he was about Wal-Mart's response to Hurricane Katrina, when it rushed urgent supplies to the Gulf Coast. ''The media coverage has been extremely positive and speaks to who we really are as individuals, and as a company.''
 When one manager asked how an associate -- Wal-Mart's term for an employee -- could become chief executive of the world's largest retailer, Mr. Scott wrote, ''The first thing you can do is make sure you treat your people well, and understand that your associates are what will make you a success.''

C1)Chart: ''Exchanges With the Chief''Following are excerpts from answers to employee questions posed to H. Lee Scott Jr., Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, from an internal company Web site called ''Lee's Garage.''On the lack of retiree medical benefits:''. . . I imagine everyone in here wishes we could answer 'Yes, tomorrow we will have retiree medical benefits.' One of the things said about General Motors now is that General Motors is no longer an automotive company. General Motors is a benefit company that sells cars to fund those benefits. Companies have made commitments to retirees that they're now struggling to understand how to fund. They're going to the government and saying 'Can you participate in the pensions?' For example, it is a terrible burden on the aviation industry that is not allowing them to get back on their feet. . . . '' APRIL 1, 2005On the recent Congressional focus on the employee health plan:''. . . In Wal-Mart's case, although our health care plan stacks up very, very competitively, there are people who are saying that as a large company, our health care plan should be better than the competition. The problem we have with that is if our health care plan is more costly than the competition, then how do we compete in the retail industry? You can't have it both ways. So we think government needs to be involved. . . . '' NOV. 11, 2005On concerns about the size and growth rate of Wal-Mart:''. . . Wal-Mart today is only somewhere around 8 or 9 percent of retail sales in the U.S. And that's retail sales, not including restaurants and automotive sales. It wouldn't be uncommon in a place like the U.K. for someone like Tesco to do 25 percent of total grocery sales. That would make our grocery sales 3 to 4 times larger if we had the same percentage in the U.S. . . . '' JAN. 27, 2004On the impact of negative publicity on growth:''. . . Because if we're selling tobacco 50 percent of the time to underage children, if we're selling alcohol 50 percent of the time to underage children, if we're selling our guns with a high error rate on our forms and having to settle lawsuits, if we find that there are in fact exceptions about working off the clock or something else, I can't go on TV and say, 'This is the company we are,' if that's not who we are. . . . '' APRIL 28, 2005On unions and Wal-Mart's image in the press:''. . . In the United Food and Commercial Workers, we have an adversary that would like to stop Wal-Mart from growing. ...And it is probably in its best interest that we don't grow. That way its members' employers can continue to charge extremely high prices for food and tolerate poor service. . . . '' APRIL 22, 2004(Source by Wal-Mart Watch)(pg. C4)

HEADLINE: A Growing Glut of Properties Causes a Price Decline 

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
When developers in Arlington, Va., threw a party 18 months ago to showcase plans for Clarendon 1021, a condominium development that had not yet been built, 3,600 prospective buyers stood in line just for the chance to book reservations to bid on the apartments.
 Now, less than a year after the building opened, speculators in this and other buildings are putting dozens of units on the market at the same time, causing asking prices and profits to slip.
Of 23 investors who sold since Clarendon 1021 opened last summer, the three most recent sellers actually lost money, after paying all fees, and average profits in the building have declined since August, said Frank Borges LLosa,) owner of FranklyRealty.com.
 The Great Condo Gold Rush is fading from memory and the Great Sell-Off has begun. ''Money Down! Motivated Seller, Want More? Just Ask!'' screamed an investor's online advertisement last week for a one-bedroom apartment in Clarendon 1021 that had never been lived in. 
 ''I hate it when people say prices can never go down,'' said Mr. LLosa, a resident of the building. ''The speculators make the profits more volatile.''
 Over the last few years, real estate speculators looking to make a quick gain also snapped up preconstruction condos in Chicago, Miami and San Diego. With prices rising by more than 20 percent a year, short-term buyers figured that by the time the condos were ready to occupy, they could sell them without ever moving in, clearing thousands of dollars in profits.
 But as more speculators look to cash out in recently hot condo markets around the country, some economists say they could put even more downward pressure on prices in those buildings where for-sale listings are swelling. In Miami, at the Jade Residences at Brickell Bay, more than 20 percent of the building's 352 units are on the market. In San Diego, about a third of the 96 units in the Alicante, a condominium that opened last fall, are listed for sale and sellers are already starting to cut asking prices.
 In Donald Trump's luxury condos at 120 Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan, owners of more than one-fifth of the building's 250 units are currently marketing their apartments. With so much inventory, said Ilan Bracha, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman in New York, ''the buyers are coming in, checking the best views and then they negotiate. This is the reality.''
 While investors made up only 9.5 percent of residential mortgages nationally in the 10 months through October, according to First American Corporation's LoanPerformance, a San Francisco mortgage data firm, the numbers are much higher in places like San Diego, where investors represented 13.5 percent of residential mortgages, and Miami, where they were 16 percent.
 Hans Nordby, research strategist at Property and Portfolio Research in Boston, said those numbers underreport the real level of speculation in those markets because many buyers disguise their intentions when they get their mortgages. As those speculators flood the market, he said, they will put pressure on other sellers to cut prices, too. ''A rising or sinking tide affects all boats,'' Mr. Nordby said.
 Still, a sell-off in speculative condos is unlikely to start a widespread housing crash, because condos were more overbuilt than single-family homes during the recent boom, said Joseph Gyourko, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. But weakness in the condo market, he said, ''is a consistent indicator that the great boom has really ended.''
 For those buyers who had dreamed of quick riches, the change in the market has come as a sobering lesson. A little over a year ago, Shabana Qureshi, a 26-year-old engineer, put deposits down on two condos in Arlington. ''My friends were making hundreds of thousands of dollars off of properties,'' Ms. Qureshi said. ''I just thought I'll take this risk now and not think about it too much, and once the time comes I can either sell it or use it depending on my needs.''
 She moved into a one-bedroom condo at Clarendon 1021 with hardwood floors, granite kitchen countertops and a heated pool on the roof. But having taken a pay cut with a new job, she can no longer afford the mortgage and maintenance fees, which are almost $3,000 a month.
 Last week, she put the condo, for which she paid $438,000, on the market for $470,000 and plans to move into the other condo she bought in Arlington. She is selling the Clarendon condo herself to save on the real estate commission. But even if she gets her asking price, she figures she will break even after closing costs.
 Having scrimped to buy at what she said she believed was the peak of the market, Ms. Qureshi said she regretted her investments. If she had to do it all over again, she said she would have spent more money on travel and a new car. ''I would have been more carefree and invested once I had a family,'' she said.
 In the last few years, speculators were drawn to real estate because of double-digit appreciation. Nationally, median condo prices increased by nearly 13 percent, to $218,200, in 2005, according to the National Association of Realtors. But earlier this month, the group, which is based in Washington, forecast a slowdown in the rate of appreciation, saying that median home prices for all housing types -- single family, townhouses, condominiums and co-ops -- would rise by only 5 percent this year.
 Already, the rate of appreciation in some of the hottest markets for speculators has slowed. In San Diego, the median home price (the exact middle of all prices) rose at an annual rate of just 2.5 percent in January, compared with 20 percent a year earlier, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a research firm.
 Last week, in a sign of a broader slowdown in the housing market, Toll Brothers, the luxury home builder, said orders for new homes fell by nearly 30 percent in the three months ended Jan. 31. On Monday, KB Homes also said that orders were down significantly and that more buyers were canceling contracts.
 At the same time, developers are still building condos in Miami, New York and Chicago, so speculators trying to sell will also have to compete with new units coming on the market.
 The slowdown will affect all sellers, of course, but speculators may be more acutely affected if they were expecting speedy profits or are paying mortgage and maintenance costs on empty apartments. In some cases, even if they rent them out, the rents will not cover their costs.
 This is not the first time that condo markets have been influenced by investors. In the late 1980's, developers converted thousands of condo units in the Northeast and many of them were bought by speculators, said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College. Many of those investors, he said, ended up losing money when they sold in the early 1990's. ''It was ugly,'' he said.
 More experienced investors take a philosophical view of what they see as inevitable setbacks. R. Dawn Stahl, a lawyer in San Diego who bought two apartments in the Alicante, is now trying to sell both of them.
 But in a city where there are about 6,200 condos for sale, up from about 3,100 this time last year, according to the San Diego Association of Realtors, it has been difficult to lure buyers. Ms. Stahl has yet to receive any offers, so she has already lowered her asking price on one of the listings from $650,000 to $599,000.
 She paid $499,000 for that two-bedroom apartment and said she believed she would make a small profit after paying commissions and capital gains taxes. But if she cannot sell within a few months, she will rent the apartments out instead.
 ''I knew thatwas a risk that I took,'' Ms. Stahl said.
 But a reason that a speculative sell-off is not likely to lead to a bursting bubble is that unlike stocks, where investors can panic and sell large volumes in a matter of hours, owners of real estate will only slash prices so far. ''People resist and don't sell,'' said Mr. Case. ''It tends to stabilize prices.''
 A year and a half ago, Erez Abkzer, who owns a window treatment business in New York, signed a contract for a one-bedroom condo facing the river in 120 Riverside for $850,000. ''The market was booming and I decided to jump on that wagon,'' he said.
 He closed on the apartment last month and immediately listed it for $1.1 million. He said he would rent the apartment rather than lower his price. ''Otherwise it would all be in vain,'' Mr. Abkzer said. ''I won't make money on it.''
 Some brokers say that speculators have unrealistic profit expectations. ''I think a lot of sellers are saying I should make X percent,'' said Eve Thompson, an agent with Long & Foster in Fairfax, Va. ''But your chances of being able to do that are as good as going to Oracle and telling them you want more for your stock.''
 In Miami, where there appears to be a large overhang of investor properties, sellers are still making profits, said Ron Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors. But with the inventory of available condos having jumped from about 5,400 listings at the end of December 2004 to about 12,750 now, he said, asking prices have come down in the last three or four months. Mr. Shuffield said he was confident that there would eventually be takers for most of those condos because of the influx of buyers from Latin America and Europe as well as baby boomers from the Northeast.
 But some real estate watchers say there is evidence that demand is starting to slacken in Miami. According to Michael Y. Cannon, managing director of Integra Realty Resources-South Florida, a market analyst, the volume of sales of existing condos declined by 9.6 percent in South Florida between 2004 and 2005.
 For now, the bumper crop of properties is a boon to buyers. In San Diego, Tom Hinks, a 21-year-old who is looking to buy a condo downtown, has realized he can take his time.
 His approach might scare some sellers. Since Mr. Hinks started looking four months ago, he has viewed 30 condos. ''I've actually liked quite a few of them,'' he said. ''But every day it seems like the prices are starting to trim down so I don't want to pay too much.''

 BODY:
VOLKSWAGEN may have retired its unwieldy ''Fahrvergnugen'' slogan, but a quirky new ad campaign for the struggling carmaker is once again invoking its German heritage.
 Along with faux-German catch phrases (''Straight outta da Autobahn'' and ''Fast as schnell''), the campaign introduces Helga, a blonde in white go-go boots who demonstrates the features of the redesigned Volkswagen GTI Mk V hatchback.
''We're going to celebrate our Germanness,'' said Kerri Martin, the director of brand innovation for Volkswagen of America in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
 Revisiting the national origin of a brand is a technique other car companies have used with significant success. Last year, Mitsubishi Motors played up Japanese pop culture in a campaign for its redesigned Eclipse sport coupe.
 The Volkswagen campaign also introduces a new slogan, ''Make friends with your fast,'' along with a brand icon called the ''fast,'' a gremlinesque character that issues commands to Volkswagen drivers in a deep, robotic voice.
 It is an effort by Volkswagen to increase slumping sales while testing the creative chops of its new agency, Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami, a unit of MDC Partners. 
 It is also a considerable test for Crispin, a midsize agency known for its innovative creative work for Burger King and Mini Cooper; the Volkswagen account is its largest to date. 
 Crispin acquired the estimated $350 million account in September, when Volkswagen dismissed its previous agency, Arnold Worldwide in Boston, without a review. Arnold, part of Havas, held the account for more than a decade and was responsible for creating the long-running theme ''Drivers wanted'' and successfully introducing the redesigned Beetle in 1998.
 Crispin has proved it can handle car campaigns. It introduced the BMW-owned Mini in the United States, but resigned the account last year to take on Volkswagen. 
 It has a significant challenge in Volkswagen, which is eager to revive its fading presence in the United States. Sales for the German carmaker have been slumping in the last few years, and Volkswagen announced last week that it would cut up to 20,000 jobs in the next three years in an effort to streamline the company. 
 The television ads for the campaign began running last week during the Olympics, and the print ads will be introduced in the May issues of magazines. Next week, the commercials will begin to run on cable channels like MTV, VH1 and the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. 
 The target audience for the GTI is undeniably male: Volkswagen chose to unveil the new campaign on Thursday by holding a news conference at the office of Playboy magazine in New York. Print ads for the GTI are scheduled to run in magazines like Maxim, Spin, ESPN, Wired and Autoweek.
 Beyond the leggy German-accented Helga in a skintight dress, the other women in the ads are typically portrayed as nagging girlfriends who interfere with the male drivers and their ''fasts.''
 In one television commercial that is running during the Olympics, a female passenger asks the male driver, presumably her boyfriend, to roll up the windows because her hair is getting tangled by the wind.
 He responds by saying, ''Sweetie, it's really hard for me to enjoy the sound of the engine with all that yakking.''
 Another commercial depicts a man refusing to let his girlfriend enter his car because he does not want to ''carry the extra weight.''
 It is a point that is not lost on Alex Bogusky, the chief creative officer for Crispin, who said he considered the car and its driving experience masculine.
 ''There are obviously women who will buy the GTI,'' he said Thursday, but the main emphasis of the ads was the car's performance. 
 Another theme of the campaign, ''Unpimp Mein Auto,'' encourages drivers to strip away excessive detailing on their cars, a phenomenon Mr. Bogusky attributed to Hollywood and movies like ''2 Fast 2 Furious.'' 
 Crispin also plans nontraditional elements, including a partnership with Google's maps unit that will let users share their favorite spots for driving in the United States.
 Crispin is scheduled to open a new office in Boulder, Colo., this summer, and will shift a large part of its creative operations to it.
 Mr. Bogusky, the agency's creative director, said he and Andrew Keller, the executive creative director of Crispin, would both move to the Boulder office.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts In January Hit 33-Year High

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Home construction jumped 14.5 percent to a 33-year high last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, a sign that builders may have taken advantage of unseasonably warm weather in January.
 The report surprised many analysts because home sales have slowed and the number of unsold homes has risen in many markets around the country in the last several months. Many home builders have also been saying that they are offering bigger incentives to lure buyers.
In January, builders began constructing homes -- known as housing starts -- at an annual pace of 2.28 million, the fastest level since 1973, after a drop of 6.9 percent in December. Permits for new construction increased 6.8 percent, to 2.22 million, after falling 4.1 percent in December. Compared with January 2005, housing starts were up 4 percent, the government reported. 
 Warmer weather tends to spur construction activity, and the average temperature in the United States in January, at 39 degrees, was the highest ever recorded by the government, an increase of 8.5 degrees over the historical average for the month. The unusual weather has also been cited for stronger retail sales and weaker industrial production, the latter because utilities produced less electricity.
 ''It is a time-tested pattern,'' said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, noting that builders may have started work on homes that they sold ahead of construction at the end of last year. ''February has essentially returned to normal conditions, suggesting to me that we will see a substantial decline in housing starts.''
 The effect of the weather could further be magnified because most economic data, including housing starts, is adjusted to account for seasonal weather and other patterns. Because January is usually one of the coldest months of the year, those adjustments would have bolstered the data that the Commerce Department reports for the month even if construction were flat. Before adjusting for seasonal factors, housing starts were up 11.3 percent from December.
 ''Builders were able to build and so they were out there doing it, and the seasonal adjustment process pumped it up,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR, a research firm in New York.
 Housing start data is also subject to a significant margin of error, plus or minus 9.9 percentage points in January, because it is based on a relatively small sampling of data.
 Just last week, two large home builders warned about slowing sales: Toll Brothers, the nation's largest luxury home builder, said orders fell 21 percent in the three months ended Jan. 31 compared with the same period a year ago, and KB Home said more buyers were canceling orders and fewer were signing contracts in the first two months of the year compared with 2005.
 But even as they acknowledge the slowdown, many housing industry officials are generally optimistic about the year to come, given that mortgage interest rates remain low and that the economy has been adding jobs at a stronger clip in recent months. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.15 percent in January, up from 5.71 percent a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac, but that is still low by historical standards. 
 ''Everybody would agree that 2006 won't be 2005,'' said William Emerson, chief executive of Quicken Loans, a mortgage lender based in Livonia, Mich. ''But it will be strong.''
 Home building activity was strongest in the Northeast, where starts jumped 29.2 percent; followed by the Midwest, up 23.7 percent; the West, 16.9 percent; and the South, 8.7 percent.
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance climbed by 19,000 last week, to 297,000 for the week ending Feb. 11. At 2.5 million, the total number of jobless claims at the end of Feb. 4 was down 7 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Unwelcome Advances

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Hostile takeover offers are expensive, attract public criticism and historically fail more than half of the time. 
 So why are they suddenly on the upswing in Europe?
In scenes more reminiscent of the heyday of corporate raiders in the United States, a number of European companies have been lobbing hostile offers against rivals in recent months, often setting off widespread public outcry. 
 The $23 billion unsolicited offer for Arcelor of Luxembourg by Mittal Steel, a company with headquarters in Rotterdam but run by the Indian-born Lakshmi N. Mittal, incensed European politicians. The move provoked a response from the chief executive of Arcelor, Guy Dolle, who referred to the offer in language that the Indian government and others considered racist. 
 A $50 billion unsolicited bid from Gas Natural of Spain goaded executives from Endesa to call their rivals everything from mistaken to liars. Executives at Endesa contended that after they turned the offer down, they were followed by private detectives. 
 The normally staid industry of plasterboard manufacturing was thrown into turmoil when Compagnie de Saint-Gobain of France bid $6.7 billion for BPB of Britain. After BPB mounted a defense that included reporting what it called ''stunning'' first-half results, Saint-Gobain management accused the company of ''exaggerating its prospects,'' and insinuated that the company would miss its growth goals.
 Deal makers, who generally leave most of the public trash-talking to the company executives, say that Europe's newfound aggression stems in part from a growing sense of shareholder unrest. 
 ''Shareholders are saying, 'We want more,' '' said Paul Gibbs, head of European merger research at J. P. Morgan. Many European companies reined themselves in after the spending boom of the late 1990's, but not all of them did so. 
 ''There are companies that haven't changed,'' Mr. Gibbs said, companies whose attitude toward investors is ''We're XYZ Corporation, we know what we're doing, we're giving you dividends, so what more do you want?'' 
 Those types of companies trade at a discount, Mr. Gibbs said, because they have not become more efficient or improved their corporate governance. 
 The growing number of hedge funds can be good friends during these deals -- they often bid up shares of a company, driving up the stock price and making it nearly impossible for the company to remain independent. 
 BPB ultimately fell to Saint-Gobain for $:3.89 billion ($6.8 billion), even though management wanted more, in part because hedge funds that wanted to see the deal go through had amassed as much as a quarter of BPB's stock.
 Of course, hedge funds can also be opponents of a takeover campaign. The hostile bid by the Deutsche Borse for the London Stock Exchange was scrapped last year because hedge funds that held shares of the German exchange thought it was too expensive. 
 Friendly merger opportunities are dwindling. Private equity funds, fat with cash, are also prowling Europe for takeovers and have already swept up some of the most likely targets. 
 ''Some people would be more comfortable on the sidelines, but they can't stay there,'' said a lawyer in London who declined to be identified because he is advising on several hostile deals. 
 And, to complete the picture, macroeconomic factors are playing a part. 
 ''There is just a lot of inefficiency in the European economy,'' said Eric Cafritz, a partner with the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Paris. ''The E.U. and the euro have created opportunities for consolidation that companies in Europe never dreamed of,'' he said. 
 This is not the first time that European companies have indulged in hostile takeover attempts. Indeed, Europe had $537 billion worth of unsolicited bids in 1999, according to research by J. P. Morgan. That was led by the biggest of all deals -- European, cross-border and otherwise -- Vodafone of Britain's ultimately friendly and ultimately successful $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann of Germany in early 2000. 
 Bloated companies, created in part by the merger mania of the late 1990's, and lagging stock prices had forced executives to curb their appetite for acquisitions. Hostile deal attempts in Europe fell as low as $14 billion in 2002, according to J. P. Morgan. 
 Now, after years of putting their houses back in order, European executives can look outside again for growth. 
 Some chief executives are doing these deals for ''good corporate strategy reasons, and some for slightly less good reasons,'' said Neil Austin, a partner with KPMG in London who specializes in mergers and acquisitions. Sometimes, Mr. Austin notes, after long years of reorganizing and cutting costs, company ''boards and C.E.O.'s get a bit bored,'' and turn to deal-making.
 The pace of these offers has accelerated this year. So far, Europe has seen $60.9 billion in hostile or unsolicited bids, compared with $92.3 billion in all of 2005 (which included the giant Endesa offer.) 
 The first few months of 2006 may pale in comparison to the rest of the year, some merger specialists say. 
 ''If Mittal succeeds, that will unleash a wave of hostile deals,'' Mr. Cafritz said. 
 Mittal's success would prove that ''total outsiders can make aggressive bids that everyone dislikes except shareholders, and get them done,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shelving of Panel on Mideast Roils School

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
When the principal of the elite Fieldston school notified parents by e-mail of an assembly that was to feature two Palestinian speakers, he said that it would further the school's ''progressive reputation'' and that the Palestinian viewpoint was one that ''few of us, students or faculty, are familiar with or can claim to understand.''
 Then came a flurry of e-mail messages and telephone calls from parents who objected to one of the speakers, who has advocated a boycott of Israel, as well as the fact that no Israelis were on the panel. On Tuesday, the high school's principal, John Love, sent another e-mail message canceling the event and explaining that the forum was ''not appropriate given the sensitivity and complexity of the issue.''
Now the controversy is roiling Fieldston, a private school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx with a mission to provide a ''rigorous and humanistic education'' and a long history of sending graduates to the Ivy League. It is the same sort of debate over Middle East politics that has engulfed universities in recent years. And in this case, both sides say they are speaking on behalf of the values of free expression and open-mindedness for which Fieldston prides itself. 
 Phone calls to Dr. Love were returned by Ginger Curwen, a school spokeswoman, who said the assembly was canceled ''because it really wasn't a balanced'' presentation. She added, ''I don't think there was that much reaction.'' 
 But David Swartwout, a dean and history teacher, said that when the assembly was announced, ''There are kids who were upset, there are parents who were upset.'' He said opinions remained divided.
 ''Some kids thought it needed to be canceled because there were issues we needed to explore more thoughtfully and carefully,'' he said. ''Other kids are looking at this as an issue of censorship and free speech.''
 Students said that news of the cancellation spread on Tuesday night, and that by Wednesday morning, someone had papered the school walls with fliers featuring the slogan ''Progressive Education + Censorship = Oxymoron,'' and quotations from Aristotle. A profanity and the word ''censor'' was scrawled on a plaque in a hallway, they said. 
 Yesterday, at Salvatores of Soho, a pizzeria near the school, a group of hyper-articulate sophomores on their lunch break dissected the controversy over slices and soda. 
 ''Every hallway, every corridor, this is the topic,'' said Jake Chaplin, 16. 
 Evan Krasner, 16, said that while he was a ''great believer in the First Amendment,'' he thought the panel was poorly planned. ''How can this be a diverse debate? It's two sides of one side.'' 
 At another table, Ali McMillen, 16, said she was curious to hear what the panelists had to say, adding that Fieldston educators ''always say they want to show us both sides of an argument and let us make our own decisions.'' 
 In some cases, the debate has moved into touchy territory. One flier featured a picture of a hand holding money and a slogan intended to imply that complaints from donors had shut the session down, students said. Ms. Curwen declined to respond to a question about any role donors might have had.
 The controversy started on Friday, when Dr. Love, principal of the Fieldston Upper School -- the 9th- through 12th-grade component of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School -- sent an e-mail message to parents about the assembly, planned for next Thursday. He said it would feature two 10-minute speeches followed by questions.
 Muhammad Muslih, a Long Island University professor, would speak in favor of a ''two-state solution'' to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he wrote, while Mazin Qumsiyeh, identified as an associate professor at Yale, would speak in favor of a ''one-state solution.'' (A two-state solution envisions Israeli and Palestinian states side-by-side; a one-state solution envisions a single state in which Jews and Palestinians live together, and there is no longer a country of Israel.) 
 The Israeli perspective, Dr. Love wrote, would be the subject of a future assembly. 
 But in a school with a substantial Jewish population, that did not sit right.
 Then Zach Tumin, a parent, sent an e-mail message to other parents, describing Dr. Qumsiyeh as an ''unfortunate choice.'' He included portions of an Anti-Defamation League press release describing Dr. Qumsiyeh as an ''extremist anti-Israel activist.'' The release was issued amid a controversy last month, in which the World Economic Forum published, then apologized for, a magazine with an article in which Dr. Qumsiyeh called for a boycott of Israel and compared Israel's policies toward Palestinians to apartheid. 
 In canceling the assembly, Dr. Love wrote to parents that he had received ''many thoughtful phone calls and e-mails.'' 
 ''Many of you who were most concerned about our plan framed your concerns in the most positive and constructive terms, and I deeply regret the unhappiness that my letter and support for this project has caused you,'' he wrote. 
 That note, however, generated even more unhappiness. 
 ''It may not have been the best planned event, but the symbolism of canceling it is terrible,'' said Kenneth Roth, a Fieldston parent who is executive director of Human Rights Watch but said he was speaking privately. ''It suggests that some parents who supposedly believe in progressive education and trust their kids to hear all sides of disputes don't extend that principle to disputes about Israel.'' 
 Renee Berliner Rush, a parent who opposed the assembly, was irate at the way in which it was canceled, saying school officials should have apologized for planning a one-sided forum in the first place. 
 ''It basically blamed a group of parents, which is not a reason to cancel an assembly,'' she said. ''This wasn't about Palestinians. This was about equality and bigotry and a fair, open forum.'' 
 She also pointed out that Dr. Qumsiyeh is no longer at Yale, saying school officials should also have apologized for inaccurately describing his credentials. In a telephone interview, Dr. Qumsiyeh said he left his position as an associate professor of genetics at the Yale School of Medicine more than a year ago and is running a clinical laboratory.
 Dr. Qumsiyeh said that Harrison Howard, a history teacher, had contacted him a few months ago about participating in the assembly, and that the teacher is one of thousands of people to whom he sends e-mail messages. Dr. Qumsiyeh said he was disappointed when Dr. Love told him the event had been canceled.
 Mr. Howard did not return two telephone calls seeking comment.
 At an assembly on gender roles held yesterday, and in yet another e-mail message to parents, Dr. Love announced that a special ''modified awareness day'' about the Middle East would take place in the spring. The longer format, he wrote, would enable ''the widest possible perspective on this complex issue.'' 
 Ms. Curwen, the school spokeswoman, explained: ''This is a volatile and complicated topic for the world, let alone for a school. And we decided it deserved more than a 40-minute assembly.''

HEADLINE: Gender Equity Is the Skeleton in Skeleton's Closet

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Cesana, Italy 

 BODY:
FIFTEEN competitors, two runs apiece on their bellies, down a track of about 4,700 feet, each taking roughly a minute to complete. Thank you for coming and please steer clear of the vast mud pools as you slide down the hill on the way out of the sleigh-riding site. 
 As a one-day Olympic event, women's skeleton at least is appropriately named. 
 ''It's unbelievable, we have women in the top 10 who are sitting home watching these Games,'' said Lea Ann Parsley, the silver medalist at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City and an assistant coach with the bad-luck-and-vibes United States team. ''Give us another five, another seven.''
 Or how about the International Olympic Committee leaping all the way into the 21st century and allowing women the same number of starters -- 30 -- that the men will get today?
 It turns out that skeleton, the little-known sport dogged and practically defined this winter by a nasty sexual harassment soap opera involving the American team, also has a gender-equity Olympic issue. Martha Burk, please pick up the Jacques Rogge hotline.
 ''They say it's because of track time,'' Parsley said after Maya Pedersen of Switzerland took the gold medal and the lone American, Katie Uhlaender, placed sixth in her Olympic debut. 
 ''What we were told after Salt Lake is that they would consider us getting more competitors. Then we found out nothing had changed.'' 
 E-mailers occasionally ask why there are no four-women bobsled teams in the Olympics, as there are for men, or female ski jumpers. Is the Olympics protecting women, or patronizing them? 
 Who knows how many female ski jumpers there are, but if it was made an Olympic sport, I'd guarantee there'd be more. As for the bobsled, you mean to tell me they can't find a few more athletic women who would be willing to take a ride in a sled for the privilege of being an Olympian?
 ''We have a starting list in our World Cup events of 30,'' Parsley said, while acknowledging that male skeleton competitors are also subjected to a start-list reduction from their World Cup norm, to 30 from 45. 
 Are there more male sliders than women? Let's go out on a limb and guess there are. But based on the same antiquated arguments about space, depth and quality control, the N.C.A.A. could probably halve the number of teams, 64, in the women's college basketball tournament. 
 Fortunately, American universities have evolved to a higher gender standard, especially when they realize there is money to be made.
 Granted, skeleton was reinstated four years ago -- after appearing in the Olympics in 1928 and 1948 in the place it was born, St. Moritz, Switzerland -- mainly to help justify the inflationary costs of track construction for future host cities. Attendance last night was, on scale, comparable to a MetroStars game at Giants Stadium. It is safe to say that skeleton will not be the sport that vanquishes ''American Idol'' in the television ratings for NBC but, as Parsley said, like a seasoned recruiter, ''If you like water sports or roller coasters, call us.''
 That number again in the United States, she said, ''1-800-BOBSLED.''
 Under an administrative umbrella with the bobsled people, skeleton surely had an identity problem in America even before this winter's public relations meltdown that began with the United States coach, Tim Nardiello, being accused of sexual harassment by some female team members and eventually getting fired. The Americans' gold-medal men's contender, Zach Lund, was barred from competing here for using an anti-baldness treatment he'd taken for six years, without knowing it had recently been added to the Olympics' banned drug list.
 The United States women were limited to one competitor because the team placed fourth in World Cup points and only the top three finishers get two Olympic positions. Tristan Gale, the gold medalist in Salt Lake City, had a bad year, and Noelle Pikus-Pace, the 2004-05 World Cup champion, broke her leg last October when she was run over by a bobsled -- leaving Uhlaender as the last American standing, or sledding.
 By tonight, the long and tortuously public Olympic year will be over for the Americans. ''We're always happy to get publicity,'' Parsley said, ''but we wanted it to be positive.''
 The Nardiello saga eliminated that possibility, though he had his defenders, including one who competed last night.
 ''It was a witch hunt, and every athlete suffered because of it,'' said Louise Corcoran, one of the New Zealanders who trained with the Americans this season in preparation for the Games, after finishing 12th. She confirmed that Nardiello had been here, ''as a tourist, not a coach,'' before shaking her head to a subsequent question, saying: ''It's all in the past. Time to move on.''
 Time to look ahead to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2010, when, as Corcoran said: ''I really hope we'll get 30 competitors. It's just not fair that we have women who are on the World Cup tour and they can't compete.''
 It was a good thought on which to conclude the women's competition here, a unifying battle cry for the skeleton people to take back into the closet after their winter of Olympic discontent.

HEADLINE: No Charges After Investigation Of Ex-Mayor's Online Scandal

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The Justice Department has ended a nine-month corruption investigation of former Mayor James E. West without bringing criminal charges, officials said Thursday.
 The investigation, which was limited to accusations of fraud, found insufficient evidence that Mr. West offered paid jobs or internships, in exchange for sex, to men he met in an online chat room, said Mark Bartlett, an assistant United States attorney from Seattle who served as special prosecutor. 
 ''I am announcing today that the Department of Justice will not be filing criminal charges against Jim West,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''In addition, we are ending our investigation as of today.''
 The investigation, which included interviews of more than two dozen people as well as forensic examination of the former mayor's city and personal computer contents, found no evidence that Mr. West ''specifically intended to defraud citizens of their intangible rights for honest service'' -- the standard for federal criminal charges, Mr. Bartlett said.
 ''We did not attempt to determine whether Jim West should be mayor of Spokane,'' he said. ''We did not attempt to judge whether his actions over the past several years were moral or correct.''
 Nor did the federal probe determine whether state laws were violated, he said.
 Mr. West later told a news conference that the F.B.I. investigation had upheld his contention that he committed no crimes and never offered jobs or perks to anyone in exchange for favors.
 ''I cooperated completely from the beginning,'' he said.
 Mr. West was recalled in December by 65 percent of the voters. The recall charge said he had abused his office in making an online job offer in anticipation of sex with someone he thought was an 18-year-old man. Mr. West acknowledged mistakes in judgment, but maintained he did not break state or federal laws.
 Mr. West said he understood why people voted to recall him, blaming ''a barrage'' of articles in The Spokesman-Review of Spokane.
 ''If I had done the things alleged by The Spokesman-Review, I would have voted against myself,'' he said.
 He called articles contending that he had molested children ''a lie'' and had several testy exchanges with Spokesman-Review reporters.
 ''I did not commit those acts,'' Mr. West said, adding that the accusations ''cut me to the quick and destroyed my reputation.''
 ''I think The Spokesman-Review owes me a personal apology,'' Mr. West said, repeating an earlier threat to sue the newspaper.
 Carla Savalli, the newspaper's senior editor for local news, said Mr. West would not receive an apology.
 ''The newspaper will absolutely not apologize for our coverage,'' Ms. Savalli said. ''We stand by our reporting. I don't think the F.B.I.'s decision today in any way diminishes our feeling about the work that we've done. It in no way reflects on the quality of our journalism.''
 Mr. West is unemployed and said he was looking for work in the Spokane area. He did not rule out another bid for public office, and said he was talking with a radio station about a talk show.

HEADLINE: Dell Reports Higher Profit, But Expects Less Growth

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
Dell reported revenue growth of 13 percent in its fourth quarter yesterday, but analysts warned that it was not performing like the growth company of the past.
 Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., reported profit of $1.01 billion, or 43 cents a share, a 51 percent increase over its $667 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue in the period, which ended Feb. 3, increased to $15.2 billion from $13.5 billion. However, the double-digit growth rate does not portend a return to high growth for the company, the world's largest seller of PC's. This year's quarter had one extra week, which Dell said added about $400 million, or 2 to 3 percentage points of revenue growth. ''The extra week gave us a little bit of a pop,'' the chief executive, Kevin B. Rollins, said. 
 He also said that he still expected revenue in the current quarter of $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion, an increase of 6 percent to 9 percent from the previous year. 
 The conservative forecast for revenue growth dimmed analysts' enthusiasm. ''It was really a mixed bag,'' said William Shope, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. ''Impressive revenue growth came with a degradation of margins.'' Dell's gross profit margin was 17.8 percent, the lowest since 2002, said Mr. Shope. ''The slowing growth and deteriorating margins could mean that 2006 will be a more challenging year than 2005 was,'' said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore. 
 Despite the slower revenue growth projections, the company predicts strong profit growth. Dell said it expected net income per share of 39 cents to 41 cents in its fiscal first quarter, up from 27 cents a year earlier. ''We don't see an economic slowdown,'' Mr. Rollins said.
 Mr. Rollins pointed to the company's growth in shipments of notebook computers, up 47 percent worldwide. ''We grew faster than the market and we took share,'' he said. Growth in the PC business grew in all areas of the world; Asia Pacific stood out with 21 percent growth. 
 Mr. Rollins said the company's success in China, where it sells computers in 2,000 cities, is proof that the direct-sales model works well overseas. It expects the same result in India, where it plans to begin manufacturing and add sales employees. 
 Mr. Rollins said he also expected that the introduction of Microsoft's new operating system, Vista, later this year would be a ''very powerful catalyst'' for sales of new computers as consumers and businesses upgrade. But it may not affect business customers until 2007, analysts said, as companies wait for Microsoft to work all the bugs out of the software. 
 Several analysts said the company's printer business was a disappointment despite a 17 percent growth in revenue because they suspect that shipments did not grow significantly. ''Dell's grand ambition in printing has been ratcheted back,'' said Mr. Shope. 
 Mr. Rollins told analysts that he expected the company would cut the prices of some of its printers and spend more on marketing to fight rivals. He also said it was focused on selling its more profitable laser printers.
 The earnings report, made after the markets closed, was 2 cents a share better than analysts had predicted. Nevertheless, in after-hours trading, Dell's stock declined 25 cents to $31.71 a share. 
 The company, with $11.7 billion in cash, said it planned to buy back $1.2 billion of its stock this quarter. It spent $2 billion to buy back shares in the fourth quarter and spent a total of $7.2 billion in fiscal 2005 buying back shares.

HEADLINE: U.S. Assets Safe in China, Fed Chief Says

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, testifying on Capitol Hill for a second day Thursday, played down fears that China held enough dollars to endanger the American economy. 
 Mr. Bernanke was pressed by Senate Banking Committee members about whether soaring American trade deficits, financed by foreign borrowing, made the economy and the dollar vulnerable.
 ''I don't think that the Chinese ownership of U.S. assets is so large as to put our country at risk economically,'' Mr. Bernanke said. He also minimized the possibility that China might suddenly dump some of its American debt. ''It would be very much against their own interest to do so,'' he said. 
 Congressional anger toward China has grown along with soaring American trade deficits that hit a record $725.8 billion in 2005 -- about 26 percent of that with China alone. 
 At the end of 2005, China held about $819 billion in American assets, mostly in Treasury debt. Only Japan held more, with $829 billion. 
 Mr. Bernanke said that if foreign governments announced they were going to buy less American debt or even sold some, this would not be destabilizing for the United States. 
 ''I am not aware of any significant changes in plans to hold U.S. dollar assets by foreign central banks,'' he said. ''My belief is moderate changes in the holding of dollar assets would not have significant impact on U.S. asset values.'' 
 Lawmakers and the Bush administration have grown increasingly frustrated with China, particularly over its reluctance to let its currency, the yuan, rise in value to reflect its growing market power. 
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow strongly hinted on Thursday that his department was considering designating China as a currency manipulator in a report scheduled for release in April -- a step that could open China to trade retaliation by the United States. 
 ''You always want to take market reaction into account when government makes a determination,'' Mr. Snow told reporters in Chicago when asked whether top officials were discussing the possibility privately with investors. 
 ''Prudent governments will always try and assess markets and try and prepare markets so markets aren't disrupted,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Surged 5.5% in 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Japanese economic growth surged 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the government said Friday, as the country's economic revival gained steam amid rising consumer spending and robust exports, particularly to neighboring China. 
 The unexpectedly strong growth figures showed Japan, the world's second-largest economy, to be roaring ahead at a time when the United States and Europe appear to be slowing. This was also the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, which economists said offered proof that Japan had finally shaken a more than decade-long slump and entered a new era of healthy growth rates.
''Japan's economy is back, and with a vengeance,'' said Stefan Worrall, an economist in the Tokyo office of Credit Suisse First Boston. ''This was a pretty fantastic year.''
 The strong showing in the three months ended in December pushed up the nation's growth rate in calendar 2005 to 2.8 percent, the Cabinet Office said. It said the economy was on track to beat the government's estimate of 2.7 percent growth for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31.
 The spike in growth beat the already optimistic forecasts of most economists, who had predicted a rise of about 5 percent. A sharp pickup had been expected from the previous quarter, when the growth rate slowed to 1 percent as a series of powerful typhoons dampened consumer sentiment.
 Japan's strong performance in the fourth quarter contrasts with the United States, where growth during the same period rose a disappointing 1.1 percent, its weakest rise in three years. The European Union said Tuesday that Europe's economy grew 1.3 percent in 2005.
 In Japan on Friday, economists took particular heart in a strong gain in consumer spending, which rose 0.8 percent. The Cabinet Office said that the biggest driver of growth in the fourth quarter was domestic demand, and not just exports as in previous, short-lived recoveries.
 Japan first showed signs of a domestic-led recovery in 2004, and economists have been eagerly watching to see if the revival in consumer spending would prove sustainable. They said Friday's numbers showed that consumers were showing no signs of shutting their pocket books.
 ''Before, growth was reliant on the life support of external demand,'' Mr. Worrall said. ''Japan is moving back to a more normal economy where domestic demand is the biggest driver.''
 Economists said the pickup in consumption was further evidence that Japan's recovery had entered a virtuous cycle. Consumers were spending more because wages were higher and jobs more plentiful. The stronger demand led to higher profits at companies, which in turn raised salaries even further and hired still more employees.
 This healthy domestic demand cycle was missing during Japan's long economic doldrums, which began with the early 1990's collapse of twin bubbles in the land and stock markets. The economy went into a deep funk as companies spent years cutting spending, shedding workers and reducing debt.
 Economists called Friday's growth figures strong new evidence that Japanese companies had finally eliminated the excess debt and factory capacity they had built up in the overheated 1980's. Now that this restructuring period is over, corporate Japan is starting to invest again in new factory lines and more workers. Companies are also much leaner and more competitive, economists say.

HEADLINE: U.S. Digs In on Withholding Aid to Hamas Government

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is struggling to maintain a united front with its European and Arab allies to stick to a warning to cut off financial aid to the Palestinian Authority if Hamas does not renounce its anti-Israel positions, American officials said Thursday. 
 A trip to the Middle East next week by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is intended in part to make sure that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations do not try to make up the difference if the West cuts off its portion of the $1 billion a year of outside assistance that has kept the Palestinian Authority afloat. 
 American officials said the United States had conveyed similar concerns to the Europeans, who fear turmoil in Gaza and the West Bank if aid is cut off and tens of thousands of Palestinians, including armed security forces, are thrown out of work.
 The next step for the administration, a senior State Department official said, is to ''convince everyone that now that we've set the goal, we have to apply pressure and see it through. But we're going through a period of uncertainty and we're going to have to learn to live with it.''
 The Hamas-dominated Palestinian Legislative Council is to be installed Saturday in Ramallah, but American and European officials say the decision on aid will not be made until an actual government is formed and its manifesto becomes clear. That could be weeks or months away, some officials said. 
 The American and European diplomats said there was no open break over the demands being made of Hamas. Rather, they said, what has emerged is an underlying difference in approach. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the record about the difficulties of maintaining unity on this issue. 
 A call for Hamas to renounce its past positions came last month from the United States and its partners in the so-called Quartet -- Russia, the United Nations and the European Union -- which has overseen Middle East negotiations since 2002.
 But there was no explicit vow in their statement to cut off aid, only a suggestion that individual donors would ''review'' their assistance if Hamas did not renounce violence, recognize Israel and accept existing agreements with Israel, including the pledge to negotiate establishment of a Palestinian state living at peace with Israel.
 Where the American administration is issuing warnings, the European Union hopes for a solution that would avert a confrontation with the West. On Thursday, for example, Javier Solana, the top foreign policy envoy of the European Union, said in Ramallah, the provisional Palestinian capital: ''I wish to underline that the European Union will not abandon the Palestinian people. We have never done so and we never will.''
 Once a Hamas-led government takes power, he added, ''we will see what is its composition and program. Further decisions will be taken accordingly, on means and ways that allow the E.U. to continue supporting the people.''
 But in an interview last week the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, when asked what the Europeans should do about the issue, said it was first up to the Israelis to decide how to deal with a Hamas-led government. 
 Israel has said that it will cut off the delivery of vital tax and customs payments that it now collects for the Palestinian Authority, though it let one payment go through earlier this month.
 What this kind of talk means, European and American officials say, is that many European donors would be likely to send the Palestinian Authority money through programs of the United Nations or nongovernment organizations, or perhaps to ministries like water or sanitation if they were run by technocrats not affiliated with Hamas.
 The United States, on the other hand, has if anything hardened its position, partly because of growing pressure in Congress. Not only has the administration warned that it would cut off aid; it has demanded that the Palestinians return $50 million in American aid for reconstruction projects run by Palestinian ministries this year, if Hamas takes power and does not change its ways.
 Secretary Rice repeated this week that the Bush administration did not wish to damage the welfare of Palestinians and would continue food and subsistence aid, presumably including aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, which gets about $85 million a year from the United States.
 According to the latest World Bank figures, international contributions to the Palestinian Authority amount to a little more than $1 billion a year. Most of this goes to relief for the poor and to reconstruction projects. If Europeans continue making payments to the Palestinians, they are likely to be in these areas.
 But the Palestinian Authority operating budget is about $1.9 billion a year, and it is $750 million in the red. Currently Europeans make up about half of that deficit; the rest is covered by deferral of payments, bank loans and sales of assets.
 The Palestinian Authority employs about 140,000 people, including 58,000 security personnel. Some Europeans say throwing them out of work would be analogous to dismantling the Iraqi Army after the invasion in 2003, sending into the street armed men who might then join radical militias.
 ''For us, it's going to be very difficult to sit by and not to do anything if the Palestinian people seem to be suffering from a blockade,'' said a European official. ''Unless this situation is managed, we're going to have a problem. It's clear that Europeans don't want chaos in the Palestinian territories.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rally on Fed Comments and Jump in New Homes 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks posted moderate gains yesterday, buoyed by earnings from Hewlett-Packard, a surprising jump in home construction and more positive comments from the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones industrial average posted a new 4.5-year high on a late surge in trading.
 Hewlett-Packard's earnings improvement encouraged buying in the technology sector and helped the Dow reach its highest level since June 5, 2001, furthering Wall Street's confidence in large-cap stocks. 
 The economic worries of investors were assuaged by news of a 14.5 percent jump in home construction last month and a bullish economic outlook from the new Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
 ''Clearly, the market has turned for the better here,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company. ''You're seeing today some of the ebb and flow that's to be expected in a market like this, but with Bernanke saying the economy is still powering ahead, this is not a bad environment to be in.''
 However, with the major indexes posting substantial gains for the week, yesterday's trading was lackluster until the last half-hour of the session, when the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, William Poole, said the Fed was close to stopping interest rate increases.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.71 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,120.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.38 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,289.38, and the Nasdaq composite index added 18.20 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,294.63.
 A jump in oil prices muted the stock market's gains. The March contract settled at $58.46 a barrel, up 81 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The recent drop in oil below $60 a barrel, combined with strong earnings and Mr. Bernanke's testimony, spurred this week's rally. But some analysts question whether future uncertainties, like slower economic growth or a reverse in oil prices, could keep stocks from building on their gains.
 ''Nobody wants to get ahead of things,'' said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for the PNC Financial Services Group in Philadelphia. ''The stuff that could happen later in the year could be creeping into things now, which is keeping us flatter than I would've liked.''
 Hewlett-Packard rose $2.35, or 7.4 percent, to $34.02 after beating Wall Street's earnings estimates by 4 cents a share on strong notebook computer sales and success in cost-cutting initiatives. Credit Suisse analysts subsequently raised the company's stock rating to outperform from market perform.
 The effect of Hewlett-Packard on the technology sector may have been limited as investors waited to see Dell's quarterly earnings, which were announced after the regular trading session. Dell added 19 cents, to $31.96, in regular trading.
 Target said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 14 percent, helped by a number of new stores as well as better sales at existing locations. The retailer beat Wall Street's earnings forecasts by a penny a share. Target nonetheless lost $1.21, to $54.59, as investors worried about the company's expenses.
 The department store operator J. C. Penney gained $1.22, to $57.85, after the company reported a 65 percent surge in fourth-quarter profit and issued a bullish earnings forecast for 2006. The company's earnings beat analysts' expectations by 8 cents a share.
 XM Satellite Radio Holdings tumbled $1.27, or 5 percent, to $23.98 after it posted a wider-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter, and one of its directors quit the board and warned of an impending crisis.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 4/32, to a price of 99 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.58 percent from 4.6 percent on Wednesday.

Starr Tech, an insurance agency, is a subsidiary of C. V. Starr & Company, a closely held concern controlled by Maurice R. Greenberg, left, who was forced out as chairman and chief executive of A.I.G. last March after the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, began an investigation into accounting practices at the insurer. American International, which is based in New York, said that it ''terminated the agency relationship'' with Starr Tech. There was no immediate comment from Starr Tech. (AP) 


Merrill Agrees to Settle Internet Research Suits
Merrill Lynch & Company will pay $164 million to settle 23 class-action lawsuits related to its analysts' activities and research coverage of Internet companies during the dot-com era, the company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company, which is based in New York, said terms and conditions were subject to further negotiations and required court approval. The settlements leave only two class-action suits remaining against Merrill Lynch, and the company said it planned to defend itself against those suits. Merrill Lynch will amend its fourth-quarter results to include a $170 million charge for the cost of the settlements, which will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by 10 cents a share and full-year 2005 earnings by 11 cents a share.

Campbell Soup Posts 8% Increase in Profit
Campbell Soup, the world's biggest soup maker, reported that second-quarter earnings were up 8 percent over the period a year earlier because of stronger sales and lower taxes. For the second consecutive year, Campbell announced price increases. This year, soup, sauce and beverage prices will be up by an average of 2.3 percent, the company said. Earnings increased to $254 million, or 61 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 29, up from $235 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 3 percent, to $2.28 billion, from $2.22 billion. (AP)

Gillette and Schick Settle Most of Their Razor Dispute
Gillette and Schick Wilkinson-Sword have settled most of a trade dispute over their competing razors, the companies said yesterday. The companies have been waging a legal battle since Schick introduced its Quattro four-blade razor in August 2003, with one more blade than Gillette's three-bladed Mach3 razor. Gillette filed a suit in Boston, claiming any razor with three or more blades violated its patent. Schick later filed a suit in Connecticut challenging Gillette's advertising claims. Details of the agreement reached last week were not disclosed. Gillette was acquired last year by Procter & Gamble of Cincinnati; Schick is a unit of Energizer Holdings of St. Louis. (AP)

PG&E's Profit Falls but Tops Analysts' Forecast
PG&E, owner of California's largest utility, said fourth-quarter profit fell 79 percent from a year ago, when the company had a gain related to a bankrupt unit. Net income fell to $180 million, or 49 cents a share, from $871 million, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue climbed to $3.73 billion, from $2.99 billion. Excluding one-time items, profit rose to 49 cents a share, from 44 cents a year ago and topped the 43 cents expected by analysts. PG&E, based in San Francisco, owns Pacific Gas & Electric.

Modest Rise in Wholesale Prices Last Month
Prices at the wholesale level rose moderately in January as a big drop in gasoline costs helped to offset price increases in other areas, a government report said yesterday. The Labor Department reported that wholesale inflation rose by 0.3 percent in January, just half of the 0.6 percent surge in December, reflecting a calming of energy prices. But core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, rose by 0.4 percent in January, the biggest one-month rise in a year. The 0.4 percent rise in core prices was the biggest increase since a 0.6 percent increase last January and followed 0.1 percent increases in November and December. (AP)

French Media Group Expands in Pay TV
The French defense and media conglomerate Lagardere said it reached a deal to acquire a 20 percent stake in Vivendi Universal's pay-TV arm, Canal Plus, with an option to increase its holding to 34 percent in three years. Lagardere will use its share of CanalSatellite, its joint venture with Canal Plus, and make a cash payment of 525 million euros ($624 million) to buy the 20 percent stake in a newly created company, Canal Plus France.

HEADLINE: Hamas Leader Faults Israeli Sanction Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Moscow for this article.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
The man many expect to become the new Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya of the militant Islamic group Hamas, on Friday criticized Israeli proposals to restrict the movement of money, people and goods into and out of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under a Hamas-run Palestinian Authority.
 ''These Israeli decisions are part of the policy of repression, terrorism and collective punishment against our people,'' Mr. Haniya said after leaving Friday Prayer in Gaza City. ''Hamas reflects the choice of our people, who will not be broken by a few measures taken by the Israeli occupiers.'' 
 A new, Hamas-dominated parliament will be sworn in on Saturday at simultaneous, videoconferenced sessions in Gaza and the West Bank, and afterward, Israeli officials say, relations with the Palestinians will change.
 The Israeli cabinet, led by the acting prime minister, Ehud Olmert, decided to wait until after the swearing in to approve measures aimed at isolating and destabilizing a Hamas government -- measures coordinated with the United States, officials of both countries say.
 The effort is intended to force Hamas to satisfy the three conditions imposed by Israel and other countries: to recognize Israel's permanent right to exist, to forswear violence and to accept the validity of previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements, which are based on the concept of a two-state solution as the foundation stone for a peace treaty.
 Otherwise, Hamas will face international isolation and a form of economic siege, with a sharp cut in direct budget support needed to pay 140,000 Palestinian workers, even as most so-called humanitarian aid, through the United Nations and private organizations, continues at lower levels. All American and European aid projects are currently under review, officials say.
 Dov Weissglas, an adviser to the prime minister, was quoted by the Israeli news media as telling an official meeting: ''It's like a meeting with a dietitian. We need to make the Palestinians lose weight, but not to starve to death.'' Mr. Weissglas was quoted in the past as saying that Israel would be ready to make peace with the Palestinians when they became as responsible as the citizens of Finland.
 Israel is in conflict with Washington and the Europeans over timing, with its allies choosing to wait until a new government is formed, which could take another two weeks or even much longer, before restricting relations with and financing to the Palestinian Authority. 
 The United States and the European Union -- which along with Russia and the United Nations make up the so-called Quartet that has been trying to foster peace negotiations -- want to preserve their ties to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. They consider him the leader of an interim government until a new prime minister, presumably Mr. Haniya, can form a new government.
 The Israeli cabinet will meet as usual on Sunday and is expected to approve the sanctions, drawn up by the security services and the Defense Ministry. Israel is in the midst of an election campaign. If it takes its measures now, the cabinet will not have to approve the payment of February's customs duties and taxes that Israel collects for the Palestinian Authority, about $50 million a month.
 The recommendations also include separation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by closing the Erez crossing between Gaza and Israel to Palestinians lacking a permit. Use of the Karni crossing between Gaza and Israel would be limited to the passage of basic goods, fuel, water and relief aid.
 Russia angered Israel by inviting Hamas leaders to Moscow for a meeting next month. On Friday the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said the talks were intended ''to move toward a situation in which Hamas is a legitimate and useful part of the Middle East peace process.'' 
 He said Russia would be guided by the ''coordinated position'' of the Quartet and ''many leaders'' in the Middle East who have contacts with Hamas.

HEADLINE: Report on Impact of Federal Benefits on Curbing Poverty Reignites a Debate 

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
A brief report this week from the Census Bureau, highlighting how welfare programs and tax credits affect incomes among the poor, has fanned the politically charged debate on poverty in the United States and how best to measure it, with conservatives offering praise and liberals saying it underplays the extent of deprivation. 
 The report, ''The Effects of Government Taxes and Transfers on Income and Poverty: 2004,'' found that when noncash benefits like food stamps and housing subsidies were considered, as well as tax credits given to low-income workers, the share of Americans living under the poverty line last year was 8.3 percent. 
This is well below the 12.7 percent of Americans that the government officially says lived below the poverty line in 2004, using the conventional methodology that only counts a family's cash income. 
 Conservatives have long maintained that poverty levels are overstated, and the new report was hailed by Douglas Besharov, an expert on social policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, as a much needed corrective. Mr. Besharov issued a news release saying, ''The new data show that real progress against poverty has been made in the last 40 years.'' 
 But liberal scholars said the report presented a misleading and partial picture, highlighting uncounted resources available to many poor people but ignoring, on the other side, many new expenses and hardships they face in a changing economy. 
 ''Yes, the E.I.T.C. means a family has more money, and that's good,'' said Timothy Smeeding, an economist at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, referring to the Earned-Income Tax Credit, which can pay thousands of dollars to a low-income worker. ''But going to work can also mean high new expenses for travel and child care, for example, and these aren't included.'' 
 ''They've added in the extra benefits people get, but not the extra costs,'' Mr. Smeeding said of the Census Bureau, adding that the report gave an overly optimistic figure of living conditions on the bottom. 
 All sides agree that the current official methods for calculating incomes, and the poverty line itself, are outdated. Over the last decade, a host of technical studies by the National Academy of Sciences, academic scholars and the Census Bureau have analyzed incomes and needs under varying assumptions. 
 In a news release this week, the bureau called the report ''part of an ongoing Census Bureau effort to understand economic well-being and poverty in America,'' adding that the bureau ''has been working to streamline and simplify the many ways to consider the poverty rate.''
 Bureau officials did not respond to requests yesterday by telephone and e-mail for further comment on the report and its critics. For Mr. Besharov, a merit of the report was that it ''streamlined'' the complex data offered by previous studies. ''This makes it a lot easier for people to look at the numbers and draw their own conclusions,'' he said in an interview. 
 Mr. Besharov said that if additional factors were to be included in income calculations, like the imputed rental savings for people who live together, the value of home equity and unreported public benefits, the share of Americans living below the poverty line would fall below 6 percent. 
 ''I think the real story is that 40 years of benefits haven't eradicated poverty, but we've made some real progress,'' Mr. Besharov said. 
 But other scholars counter that many studies, which tried to paint a picture of needs and of uncounted benefits, have often placed more people below the poverty line rather than fewer. That line, many also say, is unrealistically low. 
 The official poverty line was developed in 1960 and based on the simplest of calculations: the cost of feeding a family, multiplied by three. Since then, the original income cutoff has been adjusted for inflation but not for the radical changes in society and household expenses. 
 But even as scholars and officials experiment with new data and seek new insights, most agree that the official methods for calculating incomes and the poverty line are unlikely to be changed. This is because eligibility for many major public programs, like food stamps and Medicaid, is tied to the official poverty rate, and any change would have wide repercussions. 
 The official poverty line, from almost any viewpoint, represents a meager life at best. Currently a family of four including two adults and two children is declared poor with an annual income of $19,157 or less, regardless of location.

HEADLINE: At the Birthplace of Nascar, Dim Hope of Daytona Glory

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., Feb. 16 

 BODY:
It doesn't get much better here than Speedweeks, when some 300,000 race fans pour into town for the white-knuckle Daytona 500, adrenaline rules and the soundtrack goes something like zoom, roar, ka-ching, ka-ching. 
 But for those who live and work here, something big is missing this year: an assurance or even a hint that Daytona Beach -- birthplace of Nascar, home of its prosperous founding family and its most cherished annual race -- will land the coveted Nascar Hall of Fame.
In a heated Southern rivalry that has already cost the contenders millions in purely speculative planning, Daytona is vying with the much larger cities of Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., for what all three promise will be a flashier version of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Nascar is the nation's fastest-growing sport, after all, with 75 million fans and an eager flock of Fortune 500 sponsors. 
 The competition has been intense and the pitches for elaborate halls of fame costing $92 million to $137 million breathlessly seductive. Charlotte's building would have banked curves resembling a racetrack, while Atlanta's stainless steel and glass design includes an outdoor deck for induction ceremonies, shielded by something resembling a car hood. Daytona, which already has a sprawling racing exhibit at its track, has proposed a ''sensation of speed'' stock car thrill ride and a tower that would look out on Daytona International Speedway.
 But to the shrewdly run National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, it all comes down to numbers: which city can guarantee the best financing and the most visitors for decades to come. 
 ''What we want to know is which place will have the sustainability 15, 20, 35, 30 years down the road,'' said Kerry Tharp, a spokesman, adding that Nascar would probably choose a winner by late March.
 That might sound bad for Daytona, which, with 64,000 residents and a tourism-dependent economy, is no suave metropolis. But it has emphasized its proximity to Disney World -- Daytona is 65 miles northeast of Orlando -- and says many of the 50 million tourists who visit Central Florida annually could be lured to the hall of fame. 
 ''People in Albany, N.Y., don't say, 'Let's pack up the kids and go to Atlanta or Charlotte,' '' said George Mirabal, president of the Daytona Beach Chamber of Commerce. ''They're going to come to Florida.'' 
 But Florida has promised only about $1.5 million a year toward the hall of fame, all proceeds from a new Nascar license plate. Daytona would pay for most of its $105 million project with privately financed bonds. 
 Much of Charlotte's $137 million proposal, on the other hand, would be paid for with public funds, mostly from an increase in the county hotel tax.
 Atlanta has cobbled together $32 million in public money for its $92 million proposal, but state legislative leaders are working to increase the public portion at the last minute. 
 At Daytona International Speedway, where thousands pitched tents and parked R.V.'s this week to await the Daytona 500 on Sunday, Doug Mutsch said he was rooting for Daytona but was not optimistic, given the deep corporate pockets in Charlotte and Atlanta. 
 ''This is where the greatest race is, where the season starts, where everybody gets excited for the year,'' said Mr. Mutsch, of Crittenden, Ky. ''But it's all about the money, honey.'' 
 Most fans interviewed at the speedway said they were rooting for Charlotte, home to most Nascar drivers and race shops. Though William France Sr. founded Nascar in Daytona in 1948, and promoted races on the hard-packed sand of its beaches even earlier, stock car racing was born near Charlotte, with bootleggers who had souped up cars to outrun the police at the wheel.
 ''Ground zero is Charlotte,'' said John Conway, of Albany, N.H., who paid $1,300 to park his camper at the speedway for the week. ''With all the garages, all the drivers, it's, like, natural.'' 
 At a neighboring campsite, Andy Medlin of Raleigh, N.C., who trekked here with seven friends in a 38-foot R.V., also endorsed Charlotte. ''It'd be nice because everyone in Charlotte loves Nascar,'' he said, clambering down from his perch on the R.V.'s roof. ''But for money reasons, which is what they're out for, they'll put it in Atlanta.'' 
 Atlanta is not a racing center, but according to its bid, more people watch Nascar races in the city's media market than any other in the country. Atlanta claims its more than four million area residents and hopping convention business will ensure at least one million visitors a year. That compares with estimates of 400,000 annual visitors in Charlotte and Daytona Beach, though both cities call those numbers conservative.
 Atlanta would build its hall of fame downtown, near the newly opened Georgia Aquarium, which is already packing in visitors, and a new World of Coca-Cola museum, set to open next year. The city has enlisted local corporations -- many of which are already Nascar sponsors -- to lobby on its behalf, with Bernard Marcus, the billionaire founder of Home Depot and builder of the aquarium, its chief cheerleader.
 Mr. Marcus took Brian France, Nascar's chief executive, on a tour of the aquarium last week, then told reporters that Mr. France had called Atlanta ideal for the hall of fame. Mr. France discussed the merits of Atlanta and Charlotte in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article but made no mention of Daytona Beach, sending shudders through the community. 
 ''I was hoping he would say something nice about Daytona Beach as well,'' said Mr. Mirabal, the chamber's president. ''But it is what it is.'' 
 Michael Pitts, an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who helps teach a class on the business of Nascar, said he thought Atlanta was best positioned to help broaden Nascar's fan base.
 ''It's a chance to further legitimatize the sport as a real sport,'' he said, ''to break away from the old stereotypes that the only people who watch it are a bunch of hillbillies and rednecks and show that this cuts across all varieties of America.''
 But time after time in interviews, fans at Daytona's bustling speedway named Charlotte as their choice. The organizers of Charlotte's bid have kept quiet recently, referring all questions to Nascar. Aaron Mutter of Richmond, Va., who visits Charlotte twice a year to see the race shops and look for famous drivers, said it had no need to press its case. 
 ''I think they already made up their minds a long time ago and just bid it out for promotional purposes,'' Mr. Mutter said. ''Charlotte is Nascar. There's no contest.'' 
 Frank Leveille, a fan from Massachusetts who said he spent $4,000 a year attending Nascar events, questioned why the France family would not finance the hall of fame itself. Fed up with Nascar's high prices, he said he planned to call its corporate sponsors in protest.
 ''They're basically telling the small guy, 'Thanks a lot for the push, we're going elsewhere where there's more money,' '' Mr. Leveille said. 
 Like many at the Daytona track, Jerry O'Mara, a retired New York City firefighter, was keener to watch races than talk about a future hall of fame. With headphones to muffle the noise, Mr. O'Mara stood atop his R.V. and surveyed the famously high-banked speedway, getting a charge from the thunderous herd of cars. 
 ''It sucks you in,'' he said, comparing the experience to entering a burning building. 
 Still, Mr. O'Mara had a preference for the hall of fame: Daytona Beach, he said, adding words that might hearten the city's leaders, at least for now. ''It'sFebruary and I'm in Florida,'' he said. ''What's better than that?''

HEADLINE: A Contrarian Says of G.M.: Buy Low

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
THE decision by General Motors to halve its dividend has left many investors unconvinced of the company's ability to solve the chronic problems that threaten its position as the world's largest carmaker.
 The rush by analysts to renew sell recommendations show how poorly the company is regarded. Yet a brave few dissenters see a glimmer of hope in its recovery efforts. And with the stock clinging to the low $20's after trading above $50 two years ago, they contend, that hope comes cheaply enough to warrant buying the shares.
But it is easier to enumerate the impediments that G.M. faces in rebuilding its reputation, sales and share price than the signs that might suggest the company's efforts will succeed. 
 Employment costs, for current workers and for retirees drawing generous pensions, make it hard for the company to compete with foreign carmakers, and relations with the United Automobile Workers are precarious as G.M. tries to pare those costs. Moreover, the company has few models that are hits with drivers or critics.
 Efraim Levy, who follows the stock for Standard & Poor's, applauded the dividend cut and other steps announced by the company Feb. 7, like reducing pension and health benefits for some retired employees and trimming the pay for senior executives. But they are not enough to change his opinion that shareholders should sell.
 ''Together these actions should reduce G.M.'s cash burn rate and better position the company to ask for concessions from the U.A.W. during the 2007 contract negotiations,'' Mr. Levy said in a note to investors. Nevertheless, he said, ''the near-term cash impact appears to us to be minimal.''
 A fair value for the stock, he said, is $20, and he advised selling it above that price. It closed Friday at $21.92.
 Jon Rogers, an analyst at Citigroup, reiterated his sell recommendation. ''We remain focused on cash savings, which is modest through 2007 as a result of these and other actions,'' he said in a report to Citigroup clients that echoed Mr. Levy's sentiments. ''With a lower dividend,'' he said, ''the costs of investing in this longer-term restructuring story have increased dramatically'' because shareholders will be able to recoup less of their investment with each quarterly dividend check.
 Mr. Rogers has an even lower target for the stock, $17, and he places it in the speculative category, typically the repository of fledgling tech stocks, not an icon of 20th-century American industry.
 When John Buckingham, president of Al Frank Asset Management, heard how hard it was to find an investment adviser willing to make the case for buying General Motors, he said that that fact alone was reason to consider a purchase.
 ''The sentiment itself shows that the bad news is in the stock price,'' he said. ''Anyone with half a brain is out of it. That says to me that the downside risk is limited.''
 Mr. Buckingham counts himself among G.M.'s cerebrally challenged shareholders and offered several factors, apart from the dearth of fellow bulls, for being one.
 Even after the dividend cut, the stock carries a healthy 4.5 percent yield, he said, and it trades at a substantial discount to its book value, or the net worth of the company's assets. The total value of its stock is just 6 percent of annual sales, he pointed out, and its price-earnings ratio, based on an average of analysts' estimates of next year's earnings, is just eight.
 ''Throw all that into the mix,'' Mr. Buckingham advised investors, ''and, more important, throw history into the mix.''
 The historical event he had in mind was the near-collapse of Chrysler in the late 1970's. Investors gave that carmaker up for dead, with few exceptions -- one being the founder of Mr. Buckingham's company.
 ''Al Frank owned Chrysler and made a fortune,'' he recalled.
 Owners of G.M. shares may be rewarded for their faith and patience as well, he predicted, although he acknowledged that the company would first have to sort out problems on both sides of its balance sheet by continuing to cut costs and by making cars that people want to drive.
 Mr. Buckingham said that he could not guess how or when that would happen, only that there was a good chance that it would, based on the experience of Chrysler and other once-great businesses that fell on hard times.
 ''We're of a mindset that this is a cyclical company and that the time to buy them is when things look awful,'' he said. ''We've been rewarded for buying companies like this, and we're not going to throw them out just because things look awful for the moment.''

HEADLINE: Enough Shame To Go Around On China

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
I have a few simple questions,'' the congressman said, scowling at the four witnesses before him. ''Can you say, in plain English, that you are ashamed of what you and the other companies have done?''
 The witnesses -- sacrificial lambs, really -- were representing four of the glory names in high technology: Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Yahoo and Google. They were appearing last Wednesday before a House subcommittee investigating their role in helping the Chinese government suppress free speech on the Internet, censor political content and even turn over data about suspected dissidents. The congressman, Tom Lantos, the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee and the only Holocaust survivor in Congress, had earlier been comparing the companies' activities in China to the odious work certain companies once did to aid the Nazis. 
''Are you ashamed?'' he thundered again in his thick Hungarian accent. Was Cisco ashamed of selling networking equipment to the Chinese police? Was Microsoft ashamed of taking down a blog because the government disapproved of its content? Was Yahoo ashamed of turning over data that led to the arrest and imprisonment of Shi Tao, a journalist who had used an anonymous Yahoo e-mail account to leak a government memo to the foreign media? Was Google -- yes, ''don't be evil'' Google -- ashamed of setting up a Chinese search engine that filtered out Web sites that the government wanted blocked, sites that used such forbidden words as ''democracy?''
 Every time the companies tried to mouth the party line -- that the Chinese people were better off for them being there than not; that under the terms of their license, they had no choice but to comply with Chinese law; that banned information had a way of leaking through the filters -- Mr. Lantos cut them off. ''Yes or no. Are you proud of it or ashamed of it?'' he asked. There was, of course, no good answer to the question, so the four witnesses were left stumbling and stuttering their way through the humiliation. 
 Then, his time elapsed, Representative Lantos ceded the floor. I was watching the hearing on a Webcast, and as the cameras pulled back, I saw Mr. Lantos get up from his seat and leave the room. And why not? Mission accomplished. 
 WHAT, though, was the mission? If the point of the hearing was simply to get the attention of the companies involved, it worked. They know they are on the hot seat, and that these issues -- how to protect the privacy of users and the free flow of information in the face of a powerful government that has no patience for either -- aren't going away. They also know they won't be able to spin their way out of trouble. Mr. Lantos's insistent, repeated question reminded me of the famous question Representative Henry A. Waxman asked a decade ago of the nation's tobacco executives, one by one: Did they believe cigarettes were addictive? The tobacco industry never lived down the denials. 
 But if the purpose of the hearing was to shine some light on a potential solution, it was next to useless. The companies' chief lament -- that they lacked the leverage to stand up to the Chinese government, and needed the United States to stand with them -- fell largely on deaf ears. (The State Department did announce it was setting up a task force, but the history of government task forces does not elicit high expectations.) 
 There were calls for the establishment of ''best practices'' covering privacy and free speech, but few suggestions as to what such practices might entail. Several legislators implied that the only moral course for the companies was to leave China, which is hardly a solution. Christopher Smith, the New Jersey Republican who presided over the hearing, introduced a bill on Thursday that would prevent companies from, among other things, cooperating with censorship. But its chances of passage are slim to none.
 Indeed, even companies that should be receiving credit for taking a few steps in the right direction instead got a slap in the face. In entering the Chinese market, for instance, Google decided not to set up either a blogging or an e-mail service, because it didn't want to be in the position Yahoo found itself in: forced to turn over data identifying a dissident. And its new Chinese search engine tells a user whenever a search result yields censored information -- a step most free speech advocates have been calling for. Yet James A. Leach, Republican of Iowa, accused Google of serving as ''a functionary of the Chinese government.'' He added, ''If we want to learn how to censor, we'll go to you.''
 (Just as an aside, don't you think they're starting to regret their self-righteous motto over there at Google? At the hearing, the words ''Don't be evil'' were hurled back at the company at least a half-dozen times. Get used to it, fellas.)
 Putting aside all the money to be made in China -- which of course is their prime motive for being there -- the companies make two fundamental arguments. First, they say, no matter how hard China tries to block information, it can't block everything; clever hackers will find ways around government filters and censors. Thus American technology, even with the restrictions, is helping make China a freer place. And second, they say, they have to abide by the laws of the countries they operate in, even if those laws sometimes violate Western standards. 
 These are not particularly strong arguments, however. Yes, there is a school of thought that says the Internet is, by its very nature, a tool for freedom. But Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor who has just co-authored a book entitled ''Who Controls the Internet?'', says he believes that this is wildly overstated. ''China is subsidizing bandwidth, and making it very easy for people to use the Internet,'' he said. But, he added, ''the government is using the Internet as a tool for nationalistic propaganda. China is not perfect at keeping stuff out, but they don't have to be. The vast majority of people aren't going to try to avoid the censorship.''
 China, said Orville Schell, the dean of the journalism school at the University of California, Berkeley, and a recognized China expert, ''is the great petri dish experiment as to whether the Internet can be brought to heel.'' 
 As for the second argument, listen to Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, the senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. '' 'When in Rome' is not a justifiable term for doing business,'' he said. There are core Western values that American companies need to uphold no matter what local law dictates. The best parallel, he suggested, was the eventual refusal of many American companies to work with the apartheid regime in South Africa.
 Starting in the mid-1970's, a number of American companies doing business in South Africa began adhering to voluntary antidiscrimination guidelines called the Sullivan Principles, named after their creator, Leon Sullivan, a minister and a member of the General Motors board. Then, a decade later, many of them pulled out of the country altogether, after Congress imposed economic sanctions on South Africa. The principle became more important than the money.
 Mr. Schell argues that technology companies should have seen these problems coming in China. Activist groups tried to talk to them, he told me, but in their race to dive into the huge Chinese market, the companies weren't much interested in listening. ''There was this overweening pride,'' he said. ''They couldn't imagine themselves getting bogged down in China. They should have listened to the people telling them that they needed to have some minimalstandards of practices.'' Now, he added, people in China are calling Google ''the eunuch. It is a neutered search engine.''
 Belatedly, the companies have begun talking to the activist community, and to each other as well, as they try to figure out whether -- and how -- they can put together standards along the lines of the Sullivan Principles for free speech and privacy. Mr. Schell says he believes that the companies have more leverage than they think with China, especially if they act in concert. ''If they all said, 'We don't turn over data,' China would have a bit of a dilemma,'' he said. For all their tough talk, China's leaders don't want to be in the position of throwing such high-profile companies as Microsoft and Google out of the country.
 Still, the technology industry can't do it without help. When I asked Representative Smith whether he thought the Sullivan Principles offered a good road map for technology companies doing business in China, he demurred. The Sullivan Principles were helpful, he said, ''but what changed South Africa more than anything were the sanctions.''
 And thus the great irony of Wednesday's hearing. Congress could certainly pass a law forbidding technology companies from doing business in China just as it once prohibited trade with South Africa, and still bans commerce with countries like Cuba and Burma. But it won't. China is too important. Ever since the Nixon administration, the government has consistently believed that engaging with China was better than not, precisely the argument now being made by the technology industry. Even Mr. Lantos talked about the importance of working with China on a variety of issues.
 After which he excoriated the four witnesses for, well, engaging with China. Caught between a rock and a hard place, American companies need Congress to help them push back in the name of free speech and privacy, just as they once needed Congress to help them push back against apartheid. If all they are going to get instead is angry rhetoric, then you have to wonder: who really should be ashamed?

HEADLINE: More Enter Race to Offer Space Tours

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Now it's a space race.
 The space tourism industry, its millionaire would-be passengers impatiently tapping on their platinum credit cards, just got a little more crowded, with the announcements of a new rocket development company and of plans to build a $265 million spaceport in the United Arab Emirates.
Three telecommunications entrepreneurs from Texas have joined with Space Adventures Ltd., the company that sent the first paying passengers to the International Space Station, to develop passenger spacecraft for suborbital flights. 
 The vehicles would be designed by a Russian company, and the first ships could be ready before 2008, said one of the entrepreneurs, Hamid Ansari, who with his wife, Anousheh, and brother, Amir, helped finance the Ansari X Prize competition -- the one that resulted in the first privately funded human flight to the edge of space, in 2004. 
 Space Adventures announced yesterday that it would build the spaceport in the emirate of Ras al Khaimah with an initial $30 million investment from its government. Eric C. Anderson, president and chief executive of Space Adventures, said Singapore would soon announce spaceport plans of its own.
 These and other recent developments increase the likelihood that within a few years, nonastronauts who can afford a six-figure ticket will have the chance at a few minutes of weightlessness and black sky. 
 ''It seems like there are a lot of people with discretionary money for whom this is an attractive prospect,'' said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''There are people who want cutting-edge experiences not readily available and are willing to pay for them.''
 He compared the experience to an ''upside-down bungee jump.'' 
 Mr. Anderson, of Space Adventures, said the announcements were a big moment for the industry.
 Drawing a parallel to the commercial aircraft industry, Mr. Anderson said, ''We're setting up the 'Boeing' to build and manufacture these spaceships.'' The 2008 delivery date, if met, could put the Ansari company, Prodea, ahead of Sir Richard Branson's much-publicized efforts to send paying passengers to space through his company, Virgin Galactic, on ships created by Burt Rutan, the designer of SpaceShipOne, the little craft that won the $10 million X Prize.
 The new venture is being announced at a busy time for the fledgling space tourism industry. This week, New Mexico's legislature authorized $100 million over the next three years to build a spaceport near Las Cruces. The state will become world headquarters for Virgin Galactic, as well as the home of the annual X Prize Cup, an annual rocket event that is to begin this October, featuring races by rocket-powered aircraft in what has been called the Rocket Racing League.
 A rivalry between Virgin and the new effort will be a healthy one, Mr. Ansari said, because ''the No. 1 reason for success is competition.'' 
 The Russian designers, he said, are known for design that is simple, reliable and economical: ''They know the more stuff you have in there, the more potential you have for things to go wrong.''
 A suborbital flight, like the first United States Mercury space flights in the 1960's, would shoot more than 65 miles above the earth and return along a parabolic route. The energies required to reach orbit, and the risks of re-entering the atmosphere, involve far greater technical challenges.
 Mr. Branson commissioned Mr. Rutan to develop a new vehicle, SpaceShipTwo, for Virgin Galactic.
 Federal technology export restrictions, however, could keep the spacecraft designed by Mr. Rutan from being used outside of the United States. And that creates an opportunity for the Russian-designed craft, said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis, a founder of the X Prize Foundation and a creator of several space-related businesses. 
 He said the competition was the sign of a real industry aborning. ''I think we are entering a new era of personal space flight,'' he said. ''Competition drives reliability up and price down.''
 Will Whitehorn, the president of Virgin Galactic, said that 157 people had put down deposits totaling $12.2 million to fly in Mr. Rutan's craft, which should be in test flights by the end of next year and could be flying commercially by late 2008.
 He said that he was confident that his company's efforts would be successful despite the new entrants and any possible restrictions on selling the vehicles outside the United States.
 ''The best place to start a business like this is the United States because that's where three-quarters of the customers are at the moment,'' he said.
 Of his new competitors, he said, ''I wish them luck.''

HEADLINE: The Welcome Mat Is Out 

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
A large poster outside the Washington office of Fannie Mae's new chief executive lists the promises all senior managers were recently instructed to make to reshape the company's culture.
 Among the mortgage giant's new house rules: Demonstrate humility. Communicate openly. Make the company a no-spin zone. Respect the views of others. Minimize internal politics. Apologize and quickly fix mistakes.
The principles stand in stark contrast to how Fannie Mae long operated. Under Franklin D. Raines and his predecessors, the company was criticized by investors and lawmakers for making arrogance an art form. It relied on an army of professional lobbyists and powerful strategic alliances in the housing and finance industries to silence critics. And when federal investigators found almost $11 billion worth of accounting errors in 2004, Fannie denied it had any problems, choosing to attack its regulator instead.
 Now, Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie's chief executive, is trying to change the company's old ways. But even he acknowledges that it will take far more than a new mission statement to prepare the company for the political and business challenges ahead. First up is a highly critical report by investigators led by former Senator Warren B. Rudman, which is expected to be released as early as next week. 
 Mr. Mudd said that he did not expect the report to be ''a flattering piece of prose.''
 ''We have a long way to go,'' he said in an interview this week at the company's headquarters. ''Of all the things, the one with the longest tail is the culture.''
 But taking a hard look at itself is crucial to repairing a company that lies at the heart of the American housing market, Mr. Mudd maintained. ''I'd be spinning you if I said it hasn't been disruptive, but it needs to be part of the process, to dig things up, and to deal with them,'' he said. ''It's painful, but it has been healthy.''
 On top of the Rudman report, a flurry of federal regulators -- including the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight -- are continuing to look under Fannie's hood. 
 They are examining how executives violated accounting rules to smooth its earnings, leading Fannie Mae's board to force out Mr. Raines and most of his senior management team beginning in December 2004. 
 About 2,000 outside accountants and consultants have swarmed through its offices, taking over parts of the cafeteria and Mr. Raines's former wood-paneled office, to help clean up the accounting mess.
 On Wall Street, where the company's share price and dividend have been almost halved, investors are hearing from Fannie more often but can glean few details. Until the company completes its accounting restatement -- a job that analysts suggest will take at least another year -- it is limited in what it can say. 
 At the same time, Fannie is not quite the mortgage behemoth it once was. Today, the market is flooded with more nontraditional mortgages, like interest-only and ARM loans, that the company largely eschewed. And Fannie is now facing intense competition from companies like Countrywide Financial, Lehman Brothers and Wells Fargo, which have become huge packagers of mortgages in the secondary market.
 More ominously, legislation that threatens the very core of its business looms in Congress. Among the options the Senate is considering are creating a new, stronger regulator and imposing sharp limits on the size of its highly profitable portfolio.
 For all the discussion of a humbler, gentler Fannie Mae, critics say little has changed. ''All the talk of the new Fannie Mae -- we are warm and fuzzy now, everybody loves us -- means nothing unless you put the proper oversight structure in place,'' said Mike House, executive director of FM Policy Focus, a lobbyist group backed by the company's mortgage industry rivals. Besides, he added, ''the only reason that Fannie changed their way of doing business is because they were caught.''
 Created by Congress during the Great Depression, Fannie Mae and its smaller sibling, Freddie Mac, have become twin titans of the American housing market. Instead of lending directly to consumers, they buy bundles of mortgages and then either resell them as securities or hold them in their portfolios. 
 Supporters argue that this greater liquidity has helped lower housing costs and keep interest rates low, and the perceived stability has allowed homebuyers to lock in rates for as long as 30 years.
 But critics say that Fannie Mae's status as a quasi-public enterprise has simply subsidized rich investors instead of homebuyers and led to a heavy-handed approach in dealing with critics and regulators. 
 This week, Ben S. Bernanke, in his first appearance before Congress as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, called for requirements that would cause Fannie to shrink its mortgage portfolio, saying the holdings were ''much larger than can be justified'' by its affordable housing mission, and represented a financial stability risk. Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate banking committee, has advanced legislation that he expects to bring to the floor this year to impose a tougher regulatory regime and curtail the company's portfolio.
 Last October, the House adopted a measure over the objections of the Bush administration that imposed few new limits and was largely to the liking of the company. 
 The legislation sponsored by Mr. Shelby goes further, but in the process has alienated many Democrats, who say that reining in Fannie could result in higher housing costs for those in lower income levels.
 Mr. Mudd said he did not see legislation as a necessity to put the scandal to rest, a comment that Mr. Shelby said was ''self-serving'' as well as incorrect.
 Since becoming Fannie's chief executive a little more than a year ago, Mr. Mudd, 47, has been on a mission to reshape the company's culture and distance himself from its previous management team. (He was the chief operating officer under Mr. Raines but was not involved in the accounting scandal.) 
 The new tone of outreach and humility acknowledges that Fannie's old insular and arrogant stance was not working. Yet, it also reflects the leadership style of Mr. Mudd, a confident but approachable former Marine captain who is a son of Roger Mudd, the former TV newsman. 
 On Capitol Hill, Mr. Mudd has tried hard to repair relationships with Fannie Mae's main regulators, lawmakers and critics. When Mr. Raines testified in front of Congress in October 2004, he denied that the company's accounting was improper. When Mr. Mudd returned in his place a few months later, he opened his remarks with an apology. 
 He has made contrition a central theme. Last fall, he invited Richard H. Baker, a longtime critic who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees Fannie Mae, to address the company's advisory council. In a speech before the National Association of Home Builders last month, Mr. Mudd referenced the old parable: pride goes before the fall.
 ''It was very frustrating to deal with Fannie Mae in the past -- you weren't asked for your opinions but were told what to do,'' said Jerry Howard, the head of the homebuilders' industry group. ''They are now a partner where you can conduct conversation and dialogue.''
 Mr. Mudd has also ratcheted down Fannie's well-oiled lobbying machine. The company cut its external lobbying 24 percent in 2005, to $3.7 million, by letting go about six out of several dozen lobbying firms and eliminating advocacy spots on television. Mr. Mudd said he had also refocused the mission of its 52 community offices on business issues rather than ribbon-cutting ceremonies. 
 But tactically, Fannie seems to have simply lowered the volume of its approach instead of scaling it back. In public filings yesterday, the company reported its overall lobbying budget actually rose about 15 percent, to $10.1 million, which it attributed to an increase in administrative costs and internal lobbying efforts. And when the House bill was being considered last fall, Fannie still pressed hard. 
 ''They had their own people,'' Mr. House of FM Policy Focus said. ''Plus, they had the homebuilders and Realtors lobby for them.'' 
 With three groups of federal investigators routinely banging on its doors, Fannie may have little choice but to keep a lower profile. 
 At the same time, profits from its core business of buying and holding mortgages are under pressure. Until the accounting problems surfaced, Fannie snapped up bundles of mortgages, expanding its portfolio to $905 billion in 2004. 
 Shortly after its chief regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, required Fannie to increase substantially its capital reserves because of the accounting troubles, the company began selling off parts of its portfolio. It shrank by about 20 percent by the end of 2005. Only in the last few months has Fannie again become a buyer.
 Although Mr. Mudd expects to continue increasing the portfolio, Fannie no longer wields the buying clout it had just a few years ago. Whereas Fannie once packaged about 40 percent of all new mortgage loans, its share fell to less than 20 percent in 2005, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry newsletter.
 ''The markets are getting more competitive and the protection afforded by their implicit subsidy is getting eroded,'' said Dwight M. Jaffee, a professor of real estate finance at the University of California, Berkeley. And hedging against home price inflation and interest rate risk could eat into profits even more. 
 The accounting issues, meanwhile, have done little to help. ''Fannie is so involved in the massive accounting restatement that they don't have time to focus on new products, marketing to new customers, or just building the businesses,'' added Guy Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.
 Mr. Mudd plans to change that, too. Even as its critics try to limit Fannie's activities, the company is trying to grow its nascent business of financing apartment projects. He also has plans to enter the construction lending business and subprime mortgage market, among others to be announced this summer. 
 But with release of the Rudman report next week, there may be another crisis to manage. When asked if he had spoken to Mr. Raines, Mr. Mudd took an uncharacteristically long pause to choose his words. 
 ''I have,'' Mr. Mudd said. ''I obviously would have liked to have gotten the job under a different set of circumstances.'' 
 ''I hope things work out positively for Frank,'' he added.

HEADLINE: A Shift Based on Science and Politics

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
As a naval officer, Jimmy Carter helped design nuclear reactors for submarines. But as president, Mr. Carter banned the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to extract material that would be useful in reactors and bombs. Thirty years later, President Bush has proposed a new version of reprocessing. 
 The reversal can be traced mainly to uneven progress in technology over the last three decades, and to a lesser extent to political and economic factors. 
 Today, it is much less expensive to manufacture uranium for nuclear weapons, reducing the likelihood that a country with weapons ambitions would reprocess spent fuel for that purpose. And the failure to find an acceptable way to dispose of the fuel after use -- including burying it -- has made reprocessing look better by comparison. 
 Recently the Energy Department admitted that it no longer had any schedule or cost estimate for the planned spent-fuel repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, and that without reprocessing, it would soon have to find a second repository site.
 In one way, it seems counterintuitive that the United States is considering reprocessing now, when the number of reactors has been growing slowly, compared with the Carter era, when experts expected hundreds of reactors to be built. Back then, uranium was expensive and thought to be scarce, and demand was growing. Mr. Carter's suspension precluded the production of potentially cheaper fuel. 
 On the other hand, by reintroducing reprocessing, President Bush is trying to develop a different source of fuel for reactors when the uranium they use is plentiful. 
 Nuclear advocates say, though, that hundreds of new reactors will eventually be built, and that there is no reason to deny the world the value of resources that are locked in spent fuel for fear of weapons proliferation, since reprocessed fuel is no longer the easiest route to a bomb.
 ''A key part of the logic behind the U.S. decision to forgo reprocessing is now perversely incorrect,'' said Per F. Peterson, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 It is still possible to make a bomb from reprocessed material from civilian power plants -- the United States did it on an experimental basis decades ago. But as the current argument with Iran shows, the preferred route is to make bomb material from virgin uranium, because the technology that enriches the uranium for use in a bomb has advanced so much faster than the technology for disposing of spent fuel.
 There are other reasons for the shift, too, including ideology. President Carter, who had been an engineering officer in Adm. Hyman G. Rickover's nuclear submarine program, had a decidedly modest view of what nuclear technology could accomplish. But President Bush's approach to energy, ranging from fuel cells to ethanol to a new generation of nuclear reactors and reprocessing factories, is highly optimistic. 
 The energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, told a Senate committee last week that the administration's solution to energy problems was ''transformational technologies.'' 
 There are also political problems that favor radical approaches like a new reprocessing plan. While the Bush administration has slogged toward preparing to ask for a license to open a waste repository at Yucca Mountain, the 20-year-old law under which it is looking to open a site has a far more onerous task. 
 The administration will soon be required to tell Congress what it is doing about finding a site for the next repository, which must go in the eastern United States. If there is no other solution, like reprocessing, the administration could find itself at the beginning of the next presidential primary season scouting out the granite formations of New Hampshire as waste burial sites. (The Energy Department actually looked there in the 1980's.) 
 Hence the move to the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, announced as part of the administration's budget. Under the program, countries that already have enrichment technology would lease reactor fuel to countries that lack production means. The producing country would take back the fuel after it was used.
 This would mean that countries like Iran could have reactors without fuel technology. Countries that already have nuclear weapons or, like Japan, do not want them would reuse the plutonium and other nuclear fuels for civilian purposes and reduce the volume of waste. 
 That is not to say the plan is feasible. Turning ideas about nuclear physics into commercially viable technology is notoriously difficult.
 When the Bush budget was released, Clay Sell, the deputy energy secretary, was asked what price uranium would have to reach before a recycled product could compete. He had no answer except to say that the value of reducing the waste's volume and toxicity should be figured in.
 The commercial industry applauds the Bush administration's support for new reactors that are modifications of the current designs, but is silent on new reprocessing plants and a new generation of reactors that would use reprocessed material. Congress has not embraced reprocessing, either. 
 ''If the raw material is still cheaper, nobody buys the recycled product,'' said a federal energy official, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to hurt his ties with the White House. ''Why would you want to pay more for fuel?''
 The global partnership, the official said, is not impossible, but ''it's not something that is going to be driven by the industry.''
 It is also opposed by some experts in nuclear proliferation, who say America's 30-year pledge not to take bomb-usable plutonium out of spent fuel has made it harder for other countries to do that. 
 But the plan still appeals to people who put faith in technology. Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, spoke warmly of the idea. He said it would help the United States regain leadership in the nuclear field.
 President Carter, he said, had stopped reprocessing on the theory that others would follow, but Britain and France still reprocess, and Japan wants to. ''We stopped, and the world didn't,'' Mr. Domenici said.

HEADLINE: A Week to Make Wall St. and Shoppers Happy

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
WHILE Vice President Dick Cheney's hunting accident dominated public discourse this week, many people still found time to buy and sell everything from toasters to the generating stations needed to power them.

WIN-WIN-WOW -- Merrill Lynch transformed its underperforming asset management business into a crown jewel by shipping it to BlackRock, a firm that specializes in asset management, in exchange for 49.8 percent of the combined company.
The swap more than doubled the money BlackRock manages, to nearly $1 trillion, instantly making the bulked-up firm the largest publicly traded fund company by assets. Investors welcomed the news, pushing up BlackRock's stock and pumping up the value of Merrill's stake to about $9 billion. 
 Last year, Citigroup sold its fund division to Legg Mason, and Morgan Stanley came close to reaching a similar deal with BlackRock this year before talks collapsed over the issue of which firm would control the combined business.
 Executives of BlackRock, including its chairman and chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, will remain in top positions after the transaction is completed later this year.

CHRISTMAS ECHO -- Loaded with holiday gift cards and lured out by unseasonably warm weather, consumers hit stores with a vengeance last month, sending retail sales soaring by 2.3 percent compared with December, traditionally the busiest month of the year. Compared with January a year ago, sales were up 8.8 percent.
 Economists said sales would probably slow as gasoline prices rose and temperatures fell, but they said the robust sales figure showed how healthy the economy was. The jobless rate dropped to 4.7 percent, its lowest level in four and a half years.
 Strong sales and lower unemployment will encourage the Federal Reserve to continue increasing its benchmark short-term interest rate when its policy makers meet in March, some economists said.

SPEAKING OF THE FED -- One economist -- arguably the most important one in the country -- affirmed the optimistic outlook. The economist, Ben S. Bernanke, who also happens to be the new Federal Reserve chairman, also suggested that short-term interest rates might be headed higher soon.
 In his first appearance before Congress since succeeding Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke said the ''economic expansion remains on track,'' citing recent data showing strong retail sales, job gains, wage increases and industrial production.
 Some economists and investors think the Fed may raise interest rates twice more before stopping.

UH, NEVER MIND -- Unable to move the stock price or recruit enough support among other shareholders, the financier Carl C. Icahn backed away from a proxy fight for control of Time Warner, settling instead for the company's promise to expand its share repurchase program, add two independent directors to its 14-member board and try harder to cut costs.
 Mr. Icahn abandoned his campaign to divide Time Warner into four smaller companies, which he asserted would be more profitable on their own. 
 But the company said it would consider ''a different capital and corporate structure'' for Time Warner Cable, suggesting a spinoff had not been ruled out.
 Under the agreement, Time Warner will repurchase $20 billion worth of its stock -- $15 billion this year and the rest in 2007.

POWER PLAY -- KeySpan, the fifth-largest distributor of natural gas in the United States and the largest generator of electricity in New York State, joined the list of utilities being stalked as potential takeover targets. Consolidated Edison and National Grid are interested in buying.
 Analysts said they expected additional utility takeovers as companies flush with cash from rising prices seek to expand across the country.

FREE OIL -- YOURS -- Regulations written when crude oil sold for less than $25 a barrel may lead the federal government to waive up to $7 billion in royalty payments from energy companies even as they post record profits and Washington struggles with record deficits.
 The Interior Department estimates it will let energy companies take about $65 billion worth of oil and natural gas from federal lands without paying any royalties to the government.
 Energy companies are suing to block parts of the law that reintroduce royalty payments for leases awarded from 1996 through 2000 when oil prices exceed certain levels. They plan to argue that Congress wanted royalty relief to be automatic, regardless of how high prices climb.

ASBESTOS STANDOFF -- Congress failed to find a legislative solution to the asbestos liability problem. A bill to create a $140 billion fund to compensate victims all but died in the face of opposition from senators who thought it was too generous or not generous enough.
 About 10,000 people die each year from asbestos exposure. Many companies have sought bankruptcy protection to protect themselves from asbestos-related legal costs. Hundreds of thousands of people exposed to the material have filed lawsuits and claims, racking up millions of dollars in legal expenses.
 Supporters of the measure said they plan to work to revive the bill.

HEADLINE: San Diego

BYLINE: By SALLY HORCHOW

 BODY:

WHY GO NOW -- Despite the recent sudden abandonment of its ''America's finest city'' motto, San Diego is nonetheless a thriving destination thanks to the ever-idyllic weather and a recent influx of billions of dollars toward downtown development, a mature crop of boutiques and nightclubs and a suddenly hot restaurant scene. Local restaurateurs are gaining notice outside their once-insular community, and acclaimed chefs are foregoing high-profile jobs in San Francisco and New York for the opportunity to become big fish in this smaller -- but growing -- pond, making San Diego worth a pilgrimage for fine dining.

WHERE TO STAY -- San Diego County spans 4,261 square miles (nearly the size of Connecticut) and any thorough visit will require some travel time (''about 20 minutes'' is the oft-repeated estimate) between its distinct communities. The city itself is spread over an area slightly bigger than New York's five boroughs. Base your hotel choice on your interests -- surf or city, for example -- and plan day trips outward. 
 The modern, steel-and-glass-framed Tower 23 (4551 Ocean Boulevard, Pacific Beach, 866-869-3723, www.t23hotel.com) is the newest beachside option, bringing a cosmopolitan vibe to an otherwise stereotypically laid-back surfer community north of downtown (it's named after a lifeguard tower). In fact, a scruffily good-looking staff member delivering an appletini ($10) at the guests-only rooftop lounge and fire pit is more likely to volunteer tomorrow's surf report than any other tips for your visit. The 44 rooms have sleek bare-bones interiors, with a muted color scheme and flat-screen TV's. Its indoor-outdoor restaurant and bar, JRDN, serves steak and seafood with flawless sea-level views. Standard rooms run $199 to $439, with suites starting at $379.
For the most dramatic coastline views and luxurious accommodations in the area, book a Palisade room (starting at $575) facing the Torrey Pines Golf Course at the Lodge at Torrey Pines (11480 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, 858-453-4420, www.lodgetorreypines.com). This hotel, on six and a half acres, is steeped in the post-and-beam construction, stained glass and Stickley-style furniture of the early 20th-century California Craftsman movement. Twenty minutes from downtown San Diego, the Lodge is nonetheless close to some of the city's best restaurants, including its own A. R. Valentien, whose menu changes daily depending on what's available from local farmers' markets and artisan producers. Double rooms are $375 to $825; suites $1,200 to $3,750. 
 Hotel Solamar (435 Sixth Avenue, 877-230-0300, www.hotelsolamar.com) opened downtown last year, replacing the nearby W Hotel for the hip set. No one seems to mind that night noise wafts to the upper six of the 10 stories, which overlook the 13,000-square-foot pool deck and Jbar lounge, a nightly scene packed with young, stylish locals and travelers. The 235 rooms start at $209, with suites from $259. 

WHERE TO EAT -- Perhaps most emblematic of San Diego's shift toward the foodie big time was the August opening of Jack's La Jolla (7863 Girard Avenue, La Jolla, 858-456-8111, www.jackslajolla.com), a multilevel restaurant that lured Tony DiSalvo, former chef de cuisine of Jean-Georges in New York, to be its chef and co-owner. In addition to the Wine Bar, which stays open until 2 a.m. (an anomaly in sleepy La Jolla), Jack's offers the Sidewalk Cafe, Jack's Grille and the more formal Dining Room at Jack's, with seven- ($85 a person) or nine-course ($110) tasting menus. Such options as sauteed Sonoma foie gras with passion fruit, red wine and baby bok choy, and poached Maine lobster with risotto, Sonoma apple and kaffir lime broth have quickly attracted a following.
 Financing dictates that the most inventive high-end restaurants in this town are mainly relegated to hotels, which explains why Arterra (11966 El Camino Real, 858-369-6032, www.arterrarestaurant.com), which is co-owned by Bradley Ogden, the San Francisco chef, is a success despite its unlikely location in a Marriott in Carmel Valley, a suburb 17 miles north of downtown. Undeterred, diners book tables adjacent to the exhibition kitchen to watch Carl Shroeder prepare ''contemporary farm-fresh American cuisine'' (for two without drinks, $30 for breakfast, $45 for lunch or $85 for dinner).
 El Bizcocho (17550 Bernardo Oaks Drive, 858-675-8550, www.ranchobernardoinn.com) is another worth-the-trip hotel restaurant. Its young star chef, Gavin Kaysen, has attracted attention near and far for his inventive take on classical French fare like lamb loin en sous vide with wilted arrowleaf spinach, porcini puree, baby turnips and black truffle jus ($36). There is also a plentiful Sunday brunch buffet ($36; $20 ages 4 to 14).
 Back in San Diego proper, a few restaurants not in hotels have developed the requisite design-to-food ratio to meet the masses of sophisticated urbanites living in new loft developments. Cafe Chloe (721 Ninth Avenue, 619-232-3242, www.cafechloe.com) is a charming corner restaurant that serves enormous bowls of cappuccino and small-producer wines by the glass alongside bistro fare to East Village creative types. Dinner for two with a glass of wine, $80. 
 Near Balboa Park is Laurel (505 Laurel Street, 619-239-2222, www.sdurbankitchen.com/laurelrestaurant.html), a recently reinvented San Diego favorite with a bold black, white and lipstick red look that may be a few swinging paces ahead of its still-transitional older crowd. The food is just as rich and inventive as the decor. Case in point: beef tenderloin with foie gras and orzo pasta creme caramel ($33). 
 Plan to forgo at least one fancy meal to sample the area's signature dish, the fish taco, a beer-battered and deep-fried fish filet with shredded cabbage, salsa and white cream sauce folded in a soft corn tortilla. The classic (and probably the best) version can be found at the original location of Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill (4504 East Mission Bay Drive, 858-272-2801), the walk-up taco stand that grew into a 150-location chain ($1.59 a taco).

WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- If you still have the energy after fine dining and drive time on Friday or Saturday, dance it off with the young and beautiful at Stingaree (454 Sixth Avenue, 619-544-0867), a trendy Gaslamp Quarter club that best represents the city's Los Angeles or Las Vegas aspirations. Don't miss the third level, the Oasis rooftop lounge, replete with private cabanas, bars and fire pits. Cover is $20.

WHERE TO SHOP -- Skip the malls and pick a neighborhood, as the shopping is easily categorized by each area's distinct demographic. To wit: on Prospect Street and Girard Avenue in affluent La Jolla, pick up high-end designer basics at Nicole Miller (1275 Prospect Street, 858-454-3434) and Polo Ralph Lauren (7830 Girard Avenue, 858-459-0554), browse expensive antiques stores and galleries, and attend book signings at Warwicks (7812 Girard Avenue, 858-454-0347, www.warwicks.com).
 Once home to a real immigrant community and now a trendy area for young professional couples, Little Italy has seen its mom and pop storefronts more or less replaced by an alliance of modern furniture shops and galleries called the Art & Design District (www.taddsd.com). India Street and Kettner Boulevard are the two main streets for such home design stores as Zazou Home (2136 Kettner Boulevard, 619-234-3841, www.zazouhome.com), which sells custom furniture and woodwork by Tabla, and Boomerang for Modern, (2040 India Street, 619-239-2040, www.boomerangformodern.com), with vintage pieces by Charles and Ray Eames and Herman Miller. 
 There are also stores that pay homage to the area's roots by specializing in imported Italian products -- like the Murano glassware at Simply Italian (1646 India Street, 619-702-7777, www.simply-italian.com), or Tuscan ceramics at Bella Stanza (1501 India Street, 619-239-2929, www.bellastanzagifts.com). And yes, some originals remain, like Mona Lisa Italian Delicatessen (2601 India Street, 619-239-5367), a specialty food market where you will still hear more Italian than English spoken.
 In the East Village, downtown's growing cultural center, the few stores beginning to pepper the loft-laden residential streets are edgy one-of-a-kind boutiques. The sneaker-obsessed go crazy for the rare Nike and special edition Adidas models at Blends (726 Market Street, 619-233-6126), a sleek white temple of footwear near Petco Park. 
 Nearby, at 5 & A Dime (828 G Street, 619-236-0364, www.5andadime.com), the owner, Jay Dread, sells art zines, Pez dispensers and designer toys, and puts on periodic art shows. 
 And Hessian Global Goods (675 G Street, 619-239-7891) is an eclectic emporium, where you can find Mexican Day of the Dead figures ($18.50), a Japanese tea pot ($88) or unusual organic coffees from Australia, Africa and Indonesia ($1.50 for a 16-ounce cup).

WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- Get sandwiches (about $7) from the go-to bread source for all the notable area restaurants, Bread & Cie (350 University Avenue, 619-683-9322), and then pick a spot beneath Balboa Park's landmark tree, the 91-year-old Moreton Bay fig tree, which is over 60 feet tall and provides ample shade for a picnic. Then take a short walk north and spend the afternoon at the fantastic San Diego Zoo (619-234-3153, www.sandiegozoo.org; admission starts at $22; $14.50 for ages 3 to 11).

YOUR FIRST TIME OR YOUR 10TH -- With good timing, you can forgo Sea World in lieu of a more up-close-and-personal ocean experience: whale watching. From mid-December to mid-March, when thousands of California gray whales pass by San Diego on their annual southern migration to the warm breeding grounds of Baja California, trained naturalists lead half-day cruises five to seven miles off shore, and almost always spot not only the spectacular whales, but also dolphins, harbor seals and sea lions. San Diego Harbor Excursions (619-234-4111 or www.sdhe.com), is one of several companies that run tours; it offers two a day, lasting three and a half hours ($27 to $30, and $15 for ages 4 through 12.)

YES, FREE -- There's 70 miles of coastline, near-perfect weather year round, and free public access and parking, so you'd be crazy not to head to one of San Diego's beaches. For a picture-perfect treat at high tide, snap a shot of the sunning seals awash inside the break wall at the Children's Pool beach in La Jolla (850 Coast Boulevard), with the dramatic cliffs of the La Jolla Cove in the background.

GETTING THERE -- Both JetBlue and American Airlines have two daily nonstop flights (starting at around $250 round trip)from Kennedy airport in New York into San Diego International Airport, which is minutes from downtown. A rental car is essential to make a thorough tour of the area; roads and highways are well-marked, and valet parking is available at most of the hotels and restaurants mentioned.

HEADLINE: In Search of the Great American Hockey Novel

BYLINE: By Keith Gessen. 
Keith Gessen is co-editor of the magazine n + 1.

 BODY:
What accounts for the marginal place of hockey in the world of American professional sports? Might it not, in the end, have something to do with its marginal place in the world of American letters? While the literatures of boxing and baseball are vast, and basketball (John McPhee's ''Sense of Where You Are'') and football (Don DeLillo's ''End Zone,'' H. G. Bissinger's ''Friday Night Lights'') also have their classic texts, hockey remains comparatively undocumented. Will historians of the future even know that at the beginning of the 21st century, rugged men from many nations gathered in artificially chilled arenas in Buffalo, Ottawa, St. Paul and Philadelphia to contest Lord Stanley's Cup? To paraphrase Saul Bellow: Where is the Chekhov of the Chicago Blackhawks? Who is the Stendhal of the stick to the groin? 
As a subject for literary and intellectual scrutiny, it's true, hockey has its handicaps. For one thing, it can be gruesomely violent. For another, the sport is very white. It does not look like America. It hardly even looks like Canada. ''You don't have a black or Hispanic element,'' says a character in DeLillo's ''Amazons,'' the closest thing we have to a great American hockey novel (though, typically for poor hockey, DeLillo published it under a pseudonym). ''Who wants to see two white guys hit each other? The violence has no bite to it. It's not relevant.'' Most damning, from an American perspective, hockey is an import from Canada. Even the crazy academic writing it spawns is not all that crazy: ''While some have suggested that hockey does not produce the caliber of Canadian writing that baseball does in the United States, such a clumsy comparison misses the point,'' the anthropologist Philip Moore wrote a few years ago in an article titled ''Practical Nostalgia and the Critique of Commodification: On the 'Death of Hockey' and the National Hockey League.'' ''Hockey is not baseball and Canada is not the United States.'' Yes, well, right.
 But hockey's time has finally come. The other sports have ceased to fire the imagination. Players are absurdly wealthy and artificially enhanced -- ''the dream of intimacy,'' as Roger Angell recently wrote in The New Yorker, ''is gone.'' Books on football and basketball increasingly focus on a sociology of fandom, and the fine tradition of baseball writing could be said to have come to an end a few years ago with the publication of Michael Lewis's riveting ''Moneyball,'' which was ostensibly about the Oakland A's but was actually about statistics and economic inefficiencies. This represents a modern life lesson, of course -- but it does not need baseball.
 Hockey still has something to give. The last great hockey book is over 20 years old, but that book, ''The Game,'' by Ken Dryden (1983), is intelligent and moving, and was actually written by its author. Dryden, a standout goalie at Cornell and a Hall of Famer for the Montreal Canadiens during the glory years of the 1970's, describes his last season for the team before he retires to practice law. The Canadiens have won three straight championships, but the pressure of perfection is taking its toll -- as is age. Standing in net, watching the game, Dryden keenly analyzes each player on the team -- no other position in professional sports is filled with so much downtime interspersed with so much danger. He sees the underutilized Pierre Larouche, the inchoate Larry Robinson and the great Guy Lafleur: ''Helmetless, he starts with a suddenness that sends his hair flipping up in back, in three or four strides pulling away at his temples, streaming behind him like a flag in the breeze.''
 Really what one wants from a hockey memoir is some consolation for the fact that one did not become a professional hockey player. Dryden provides some of this, describing the melancholy that overtakes players traveling from one city to the next, with hours of empty time before games, shuffled from place to place like children. But mostly he refuses. He is a better hockey player than you, and he likes describing the game he plays. ''It starts with speed,'' he writes. ''It is the essence of the Canadiens' game -- 'firewagon hockey,' someone once called it -- and Bowman'' -- the Canadiens' head coach, Scotty Bowman -- ''understands speed. He knows that speed is disorienting; that like an old man in a 30-year-old's world, it robs an opponent of coordination and control, stripping away skills, breaking down systems, making even the simplest tasks seem difficult.'' The slow erosion of that speed in the last year of the dynasty gives the book its peculiar but unsentimental poignancy -- and in the final pages the New York Islanders appear, like the Snopeses, ready to take over when the Canadiens disband.
 DeLillo's novel, the other monument of hockey literature thus far, is far more peculiar. Published in 1980, ''Amazons'' purports to be ''An Intimate Memoir of the First Woman Ever to Play in the National Hockey League,'' by the New York Rangers center Cleo Birdwell. But of course there has never yet been a woman player in the N.H.L., and certainly not one named Cleo Birdwell. While DeLillo has never allowed the novel to be reprinted or even formally acknowledged writing it, his authorship is no secret, nor would it have remained one if he had tried. The book features the sportswriter Murray Jay Siskind, who resurfaces as a cultural critic in ''White Noise,'' and the writing is unmistakably DeLillo's: ''Murray was one of the new breed of adult sportswriters. He hated hockey, basketball, football, track and soccer, all of which he covered. He liked boxing because it was animal, but his paper wouldn't let him cover it.'' 
 DeLillo's subject has always been America, in the broad sense -- his first novel, ''Americana,'' featured a long cross-country trip -- and here, via hockey, he gets close to what Cleo calls ''the schizy, dark heart'' of it. The book is essentially a travelogue, interspersed with descriptions of hockey games and Cleo's sexual adventures. (Yes, hockey fans.) As the Rangers travel from city to city, we learn about them all. There is New York -- ''this crazy city which will eat us up alive,'' in 
 the words of the Rangers' mournful French-Canadian head coach, Jean-Paul LeMarque, known as Jeep. But things are no better outside New York. There is Buffalo, with its blizzards and its low-rent porno theater; and Dallas, with its sprawling Metroplex; and Philadelphia, with its bloodthirsty fans. Not to mention Canadian cities. In each of these places, Coach Jeep climbs into the stands to fight people.
 What DeLillo and Dryden both seem to feel is the particular loneliness and pathos of a sport that isn't quite making it. And that pathos has hardly dissipated in the two decades since their books came out. Where the other pro sports go from strength to strength, with more lucrative contracts, more national exposure, hockey stumbles, trips, holds itself up -- against its will, perhaps; but nonetheless it fails to be incorporated into the seamless web of late commodity capitalism. It is played in cities that are too cold or in cities that have no place for it in their hearts. It is a doomed, crazy game.
 In fact, the position hockey occupies within the sports world resembles nothing so much as the position literature occupies within the world of media. So what is needed now, for the sake of both hockey and literature, is more hockey literature. Not just books about hockey, like ''The Game,'' but also books not about hockey, like ''Amazons'' -- which is not about hockey in just the right way. It is like my favorite of the new hockey blogs, Goonblog, which purports to cover fighting in the N.H.L. but is, inadvertently, all about the inability of the site's chief writer, who seems to live near Lowell, Mass., to actually catch a fight on TV. He drinks a little too much, for one thing, and sometimes his girlfriend makes him watch a Bernie Mac movie, but even when he does make it through a whole Bruins game, no one seems to be fighting. ''Where is all the emotion?'' he demanded earlier in the season. ''I realize the fighting will be down because of the rules, but where are the scrums after the whistle? I have seen one good face wash, and I am not happy about it.'' 
 Recently Goonblog acquired a digital video recorder, allowing him to record games and fast-forward to the fights later. He's happy. And yet, knowing Goonblog, one suspects something will soon go awry. That, too, is a lesson hockey teaches you, as you carry the puck up ice, carelessly, effortlessly, your head down, oblivious to the 220-pound Slovak coming up the boards.

HEADLINE: A World of Affordable Choices

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- sung about by Frank Sinatra, chronicled by Carrie Bradshaw and trampled by King Kong -- has long had mythic status. Even the real estate is legendary. 
 Rents have always seemed exorbitant compared with those in other big cities, and now buying in Manhattan costs a record-setting $1,002 a square foot, on average. Still, there are plenty of properties for less than $500,000, and some dynamic neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens have rentals for below $1,000 a month.
New York, though, is not the only city capable of captivating the unencumbered and adventurous. The world is dappled with electric and storied cities -- and real estate is staggeringly affordable in many of them. 
 ''There is so much value in a lot of foreign countries,'' said Nigel Leck, an international property expert on the BBC program ''Uncharted Territory.'' ''The capital growth will be very, very good.'' 
 Entrepreneurial types should seize the moment in Eastern Europe, where cities like Budapest, Prague and Krakow, Poland, are in need of basic services and programs to propel them into the future. Those who want the privileges of home -- a democratic government, a transparent market, the protection of property rights -- but want more bang for their buck, should consider Toronto, Montreal and Quebec. 
 Sun-seekers looking to live and invest in a more tropical climate may want to migrate to one of the many flourishing cities in Latin America. Young executives who want to position themselves for the next decade can get deals in Shanghai, while romantics can embrace a piece of Paris for less than they may have thought.
 Jeff Hornberger, manager of international market development for the National Association of Realtors, said that many European and Latin American countries welcome foreign buyers. 
 But that does not mean the process is devoid of red tape. Information about ownership laws in 24 countries can be found on WorldProperties.com. Click on ''Country Info,'' then ''Business Practices.'' Select a country from the drop-down menu. Where it reads ''Select Business Practice,'' choose ''Foreign Ownership.'' That will note any restrictions. In Mexico, for example, Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 prohibits foreigners from owning residential real estate within 30 miles of any coastline or 60 miles of either border.
 ''As a rule of thumb, countries that were former British colonies have few, if any, restrictions, whereas many other countries restrict and require you to get a special permit to buy,'' David M. Michonski, chief executive of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy and an international real estate specialist, wrote in an e-mail message. ''But in resort markets, the countries often make exceptions.''
 Renting is a more informal process. ''It is always easier to rent in a foreign country than to buy and I know of no restrictions on renting anywhere,'' Mr. Michonski wrote. 
 By and large renting is an agreement solely between the property owner and the renter. ''If you're going to Italy and you're renting from a mother whose kids have left the home, she probably just wants a down payment,'' Mr. Hornberger said. 
 Some property experts say the most challenging part of relocating is finding a job. Yet it can sometimes be easier than buying property. ''Many countries welcome American know-how and since Americans rarely compete for the low-paying local jobs, restrictions are often far more lax than to purchase,'' Mr. Michonski wrote. 
 At WorkAbroad.Monster.com there are job listings for nearly 200 countries. The site has tips about working papers, corporate relocation and private-sector jobs like teaching English. It also makes mention of risk-takers who, without any business connections, travel abroad to study, work freelance or start their own business and end up making valuable local contacts and securing work for themselves. 
 Of course, to learn about a country's visa and residency requirements, you will have to contact its embassy or visit its Web site.
 Latin American cities are among the most exciting and affordable, especially Buenos Aires, the sultry, party-until-the-wee-hours city known as the Paris of South America. In 2002, the Argentine peso was devalued by the government, resulting in a currency crash. But four years later the city is getting back on its tango-dancing feet. 
 ''This is a city that is getting more expensive because the economy is on the recovery,'' Mr. Hornberger said, ''but it's still at a fraction of the cost.'' 
 Dinner for two with a good bottle of wine and dessert is $15 a person in a nice restaurant, said Maria Reynolds, who is an owner of Reynolds Propiedades & Relocation (argentinahomes.com) in Buenos Aires. ''If we ever go out and pay more than $18 a person it's like 'wow, that's expensive,' '' she said. (In Manhattan it costs $16.95 for a fajita at Senor Swanky's, a Mexican chain.) 
 The enclave of the moment is San Telmo, a ''young, hip urban scene with a thriving arts community and a strong ex-pat community,'' as Mr. Hornberger put it. The neighborhood is dotted with fine restaurants, bars, boutiques and colonial houses. Property costs between $56 and $93 a square foot, Ms. Reynolds said. Renting is also affordable. There are furnished studios with weekly maid service for $450 a month at www.buenosaireshousing.com.ar. (That is less than the $497 it costs to keep a car in the garage near New York's Museum of Modern Art.)
 Real estate is more costly though still reasonable in Recoleta, an elegant downtown tourist magnet. Prices are about $180 to $300 a square foot, Ms. Reynolds said. 
 Lief Simon, the editor of Global Real Estate Investor, a newsletter published by International Living, likes Panama City with its high-rise buildings, restaurants and some 80 banks. ''It's a first-world city,'' he said, and yet two-bedroom apartments can be had for $60,000 to $80,000. 
 Mexico City, recommended by some property experts, makes others cringe with its crowded streets and polluted air. Still, ''there are a lot of young Americans living down there and they're finding employment,'' said Mr. Hornberger, who suggested living in Condesa, a chic area that has been likened to New York's East Village. There are two- and three-bedroom apartments in Condesa for about $1,200 to $1,500 a month. Some one-bedrooms in downtown Mexico City are less than $700 a month. 
 Those who are partial to cooler temperatures but wish to remain on this side of the Atlantic could head north to Canada. ''It's a great opportunity for kids today,'' Mr. Michonski said.
 Toronto is the financial headquarters of the country and three of its trendiest neighborhoods are among the most affordable. 
 ''It's a mini-Manhattan, but we're decades and decades behind in terms of where you are with your price points,'' said Michael Kalles, president of Harvey Kalles Real Estate (harveykalles.com) in Toronto. 
 The Beaches neighborhood has a lively beachfront boardwalk, volleyball courts and an outdoor swimming pool, yet is close to the city's downtown. Buying at the low end of the market in the Beaches is about $260 to $300 a square foot, said Michael Manley, a director of the Toronto Real Estate Board. 
 Rent is $690 to $1,210 a month, said Ryan Schwerdtner, managing director of a Canadian rental Web site, Viewit.ca. Rents vary significantly, he said, because properties range from beachfront homes to basement apartments. 
 Two of the trendiest downtown areas are West Queen West (known for its galleries, dance clubs and shopping) and King West Village (its myriad pubs make it ideal for night owls). New condos in Queen are going for $220 to $330 a square foot and are being snapped up by young people, Mr. Kalles said. Loft and one-bedroom rents in both areas are about $870 to $1,130, Mr. Schwerdtner said.
 In Montreal, the ''place to be and to be seen'' is Plateau Mont-Royal, said Bertin Jacques, a spokesman for Tourisme Montreal. Property in this area -- which is popular with young Canadians because of its cafes, restaurants and nightclubs -- is about $220 to $240 a square foot and rentals are about $650 to $1,470 a month, he said. 
 The Gay Village enclave, which can be likened to New York's Chelsea neighborhood, also draws a number of straight people because of its dynamic night life and affordability, Mr. Jacques said. Real estate is about $190 a square foot and rentals are about $780 to $1,210, he said. 
 If Buenos Aires is the Paris of South America, Quebec City is the Paris of North America. It is divided into Haute-Ville (the upper town) and Basse-Ville (lower town). Haute-Ville is more expensive than Basse-Ville, which, like New York's South Street Seaport, is distinguished by a port (Old Port) along the St. Lawrence River. Warehouses converted into 750- to 2,000-square-foot apartments are about $170,000 to $390,000, said Richard Seguin, a spokesman for Quebec City Tourism. 
 Speaking of Paris, the city of Renoir and haute couture is far less expensive than New York and San Francisco, a fact that has escaped many would-be expatriates. 
 ''There's a lot that is still way underpriced because it needs renovation and gentrification,'' said Adrian Leeds, who moved from Los Angeles to Paris in 1994 and is the editor of www.parlerparis.com, a newsletter about Paris, as well as other Web sites about France, including French Property Insider (www.frenchpropertyinsider.com). 
 Those looking for a deal should skip the Sixth and Seventh Arrondissements, home to the Luxembourg Gardens, Eiffel Tower and Musee D'Orsay. Instead, they might consider buying in developing arrondissements where the city's bohemians and ''bobos'' (bourgeois bohemians) flock: the 10th, 18th and 19th. 
 Just be wary of the 10th Arrondissement (one of the city's up-and-coming areas), advised Yolanda Robins, a property manager for French Property Insider who moved from Philadelphia to Paris two years ago. The areas along the tree-lined Canal St.-Martin are beautiful, she said, but those near the train station ''can be horrible.'' The average price per square foot in the arrondissement is about $530 to $670, she said. 
 The artsy 18th Arrondissement, known as Montmartre, is perched on a hilltop, and the Eiffel Tower can be glimpsed from some of its apartments. Property costs about $670 a square foot on the west side of the arrondissement and about $440 a square foot on the east side, which is undergoing gentrification, Ms. Robins said. Property in the 19th is about $440 to $610 a square foot, she said. 
 Long-term furnished rentals in those arrondissements are about $320 to $430 a month, according to Ms. Leeds. ''It doesn't even come close to London,'' she said. 
 As Mr. Hornberger put it: ''London is out of reach unless you've got a really good trust fund.'' 
 Yet some Anglophiles and English majors remain undeterred. Ryan Benson, director of Dream Properties London, suggested renting in St. John's Wood. But even there, a 270-square-foot studio on the famous Abbey Road is on the market for about $1,470 a month (at www.foxtons.co.uk). Other areas to search are Maida Vale, West Hampstead and Little Venice, though the pickings are slim. Suburbs like Stanwall and Radlett are less expensive but what is saved in rent is paid for in gasoline or commuting time. 
 Those doing business in China (Mr. Michonski calls it ''the land of the future'') may want to work and buy in Shanghai. Adrienne Farrelly, general manager of Shanghai Properties (shanghaiprops.com) suggested looking in People's Square, nestled among two of the city's major commercial and retail streets. Nearby is Top of the City, an apartment complex where property is about $350 a square foot and rentals start at around $700 for a 689-square-foot one-bedroom, Ms. Farrelly wrote in an e-mail message. ''It's probably the best value in town given that it's at People's Square,'' she wrote. 
 Property experts agree, however, that the best values are really in Eastern Europe. There are ''huge swaths of land'' available for ''knockdown prices,'' said Mr. Leck of ''Uncharted Territory.'' 
 ''That's where the opportunities lie,'' Mr. Simon said, ''and that's where the young person who's entrepreneurial could make some money.'' It costs about a $110 a square foot to buy in Bucharest, Romania, he said.
 ''I think the biggie there in Eastern Europe is Bulgaria,'' said Mr. Michonski, adding that it has magnificent beaches as well as mountains for skiing and that ''you can live like a king on $10,000 a year.''
 But, alas, if the siren song of New York is too mighty to ignore, you can find rentals for about $1,000 a month. Manhattan Apartments (www.manhattanapartments.com) and Mark David & Company (www.markdavidny.com) have some in Harlem and Washington Heights. In Brooklyn, there are a few studios in Park Slope and Kensington for less than $1,000 and in Williamsburg and Greenpoint for about $1,200 on the Craigslist Web site. In Queens, some studios and one-bedrooms in Astoria are less than $1,000. 
 Those who are cash-strapped but still want to live in Manhattan can rent a room (or a corner of a room) for about $500 to $800 a month. They may lack space and privacy. But they provide a sliver of the Big Apple. And more than one dream in this city began with less than that.

HEADLINE: Expanding New York City Into Yonkers

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
IF it is approved by local officials, a $3.1 billion proposal unveiled earlier this month to revive major areas throughout this gritty city with new residences, a ballpark and stores would be the largest municipal revitalization effort in Westchester County, far outstripping even the construction that is transforming downtown White Plains.
 Indeed, the cost of the proposal here is almost as large as the plan for the Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn, which has been described as the biggest project in the borough's history and the third-biggest ever in New York City. 
Parts of the Yonkers plan have been unsuccessfully proposed before. The catalyst for the latest version is Louis R. Cappelli, the Valhalla-based developer who is behind $2 billion in residential and commercial projects in White Plains and New Rochelle.
 For Yonkers, Mr. Cappelli has joined forces with Struever Brothers Eccles & Rouse of Baltimore and Fidelco Group of Millburn, N.J. The two companies last year outlined a proposal for a 6,500-seat ballpark that would be home to an expansion franchise in the independent Atlantic League. Proposals for a minor league ballpark here have stalled under two different developers since first being put forth in 2002.
 Mr. Cappelli said he was trying, in effect, to expand the northern residential boundaries of New York City by building high-rise apartments in economically depressed cities in the southern tier of Westchester, just beyond the upper reaches of the Bronx.
 One dispassionate expert endorsed the notion that Yonkers is a good candidate for significant renewal. Christopher Jones, vice president for research at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning group in Manhattan, said, ''If you look at places where you'd like to see intensive redevelopment, Yonkers is one of them.'' 
 ''The region needs more housing, Mr. Jones said. ''New York City can't accommodate all the demand.'' In particular, he said, the region needs residences for moderate- and middle-income people. Whether such projects would be created in Yonkers is not clear; the developers have not yet worked out those details, according to Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for the three.
 Apartments in Mr. Cappelli's new high-rise condominiums in White Plains and New Rochelle are marketed as being in the luxury category, but they cost less than comparable residences in Manhattan. 
 Like White Plains and New Rochelle, both within a 35-minute commute of Manhattan, the city of Yonkers is along major transportation routes, and its downtown has deteriorated in recent decades as suburban shopping malls expanded.
 ''The idea is to also create a mix of offices, hotels, retail shops and entertainment to complement the residential development, including a nightlife and things to do on weekends,'' Mr. Cappelli said. ''It makes a complete package.''
 In Yonkers, the development being proposed would fall in an area a mile north and a mile south of the Getty Square neighborhood, in the heart of downtown from the Hudson River to the Saw Mill River Parkway.
 Most of the property affected is privately owned, and the developers may have to invoke the city's power of condemnation to acquire them, although, according to Yonkers Mayor Philip A. Amicone, they will try to buy them first.
 The new development team, called Struever Fidelco Cappelli, will begin a six-month planning process, which will include public meetings.
 Alfred DelBello, a former mayor of Yonkers and currently a White Plains lawyer, who represents all three developers, informally brought them together some months ago, Mr. Cappelli said. ''We're better attacking this as an army than as individuals,'' he explained. ''When we got together, we discovered that there was a chemistry between us, and that we have the same priorities.'' 
 According to their agreement with Yonkers, the new developers could build the downtown projects themselves or form partnerships with other developers. After the study in coming months, the partners will submit a comprehensive redevelopment plan to the City Council.
 The plan would be carried out in three stages. The first would encompass the ballpark and surrounding area in the heart of the downtown. It would also uncover the Saw Mill River, which now runs under a 2,000-foot stretch of city streets before it empties into the Hudson, and create a riverfront promenade along it 
 Preliminary plans for the first stage call for 750,000 square feet of mixed-use buildings; stores would be on the ground floors and offices and up to 800 units of housing above. The tenants might include a major retailer, movie theaters and possibly a hotel. This phase would include development of two riverfront parcels south of the Yonkers train station that have already been zoned for new residential construction. 
 The second phase calls for new waterfront residences on industrial properties north of the Yonkers train station, between the Hudson River and the Metro-North tracks, and mixed-use redevelopment -- including commuter parking and office, residential and retail space -- for an area surrounding the post office between Main Street and Larkin Plaza, near the waterfront.
 The third phase would redevelop a residential area near the Ludlow station, another Metro-North Railroad stop in Yonkers, and in the Nepperhan Valley, an economically distressed industrial area. The area encompassed by the three phases could reach 526 acres, said David Simpson, a city spokesman. 
 But no timetable has been set for the new development, and in past years, Yonkers has had a poor track record with developers. ''There was too much bad politics and a lot of haggling,'' Mayor Amicone conceded. ''It turned off the private sector. But that's changed in the last eight or nine years.''
 Indeed, several new apartment projects have been completed on or near the waterfront in the last decade, along with other commercial development downtown.
 Residents, meanwhile, want more say in how development moves ahead, ''especially now that there's a feeding frenzy of developers in Yonkers,'' said Robert M. Walters, a long-time activist and Hudson River environmentalist here.
 He wants to ensure that developers listen to the concerns of existing residents. With that in mind, a dormant neighborhood group, the Hudson River Community Association, was reactivated a few years ago ''to create more of a dialogue'' with government officials, he said.

HEADLINE: Robert Altman's Long Goodbye

BYLINE: By TERRENCE RAFFERTY

 BODY:
ROBERT Altman, who turns 81 tomorrow, will receive his very first Oscar in a couple of weeks: an honorary one, of the sort the academy so often employs to ease the bitterness of a veteran nonwinner's declining years. (And, of course, to square historical accounts and deflect the outrage of future generations of movie lovers, who might feel that the failure to honor an important filmmaker reflects sort of poorly on the awards' credibility.) Like King Vidor, who had to hang in for 85 years to cop a thanks-for-the memories statuette, Mr. Altman has five best-director nominations and zero Oscars to show for a long and prolific career, so he pretty emphatically qualifies as overdue. He has been overdue for 30 years. 
 Hollywood has in fact never known quite what to make of Mr. Altman, who seemed to come out of nowhere with ''M*A*S*H'' in 1970 and, despite the industry's best efforts to send him back there, wouldn't go away. With the kind of weird, inexplicable gambler's instinct he would explore, hilariously, in ''California Split'' (1974), Mr. Altman parlayed his winnings from ''M*A*S*H'' -- which remains by far the biggest hit of his career -- into an exhilarating half-decade run of high-stakes moviemaking: seven pictures in the next five years, of which five are, like ''M*A*S*H,'' at least arguably masterpieces.
 Those great films -- ''M*A*S*H,'' ''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'' (1971), ''The Long Goodbye'' (1973), ''Thieves Like Us'' (1974), ''California Split'' and ''Nashville'' (1975) -- still look like the core of his achievement: to paraphrase Raymond Carver (whose work Mr. Altman adapted in his 1992 film ''Short Cuts''), they are what we talk about when we talk about Robert Altman. That's not to say that the two dozen feature films he has managed to direct in the last 30 years are negligible (though there isn't a power on earth, or beyond, that could persuade me to sit through ''Quintet,'' ''Health,'' ''Pret-a-Porter'' or ''The Company'' again), or that Mr. Altman's skill has in any way diminished with age: the silky command of ''Gosford Park'' (2001) is ample proof that it hasn't.
 It's just that in the early 70's the conditions were right for Mr. Altman's loose-jointed, intuitive, risk-courting approach to making movies, and the planets over Hollywood haven't aligned themselves in that way since. The wondrous opportunity those years afforded adventurous filmmakers like him was that studio executives, for once in their ignoble history, actually knew that they had no idea what they were doing: a man who could deliver the elusive, mysterious (to them) youth market, as the 45-year-old director of ''M*A*S*H'' somehow did, became a mighty valuable commodity.
 Mr. Altman, who had spent the previous couple of decades directing industrial films, episodic television (''Bonanza,'' ''Combat'') and the odd low-budget picture, seized his moment and set about the task of reimagining, with a little help from his friends, how American movies should look and sound and feel. The anti-authoritarian spirit, the caught-on-the-fly dialogue and the invigoratingly original blend of slapstick and casual naturalism that had made ''M*A*S*H'' seem so new mutated into something even stranger and headier in ''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'' a year later. 
 That film, a western of an unusually lyrical kind, puts the controlled-chaos techniques of ''M*A*S*H'' to entirely different use: in ''McCabe,'' the buzzing vitality of the frontier mining settlement called Presbyterian Church serves as counterpoint to an eccentric American tragedy. It's the only movie I know of in which you can watch a community come into existence, changing and growing before your eyes, and Mr. Altman's camera, seeming to catch the whole complex process unawares, is miraculously alert to both the pleasures and the melancholy ironies of growth.
 It's among the greatest movies of its time, up there with Sam Peckinpah's ''Wild Bunch'' (1969) and the first two ''Godfather'' pictures (1972 and 1974). And like them it's the product of an era in which the nature of the American democratic experiment was being questioned constantly and, in the best of our films, unconventionally celebrated -- celebrated, that is, not for our collective military and economic power but for our individual vigor and orneriness and goofy optimism. This was a cultural moment made for Mr. Altman, whose hopeful approach to making movies has always been to get a bunch of lively, interesting-looking actors together and watch what happens, see if they can make something grow.
 Mr. Altman had, in the early 70's, assembled an unofficial repertory company around him, a group of performers he trusted to supply the quick jolts of energy -- the funky humor and the wayward poignance -- his lightning-in-a-bottle moviemaking required. Elliott Gould, Shelley Duvall, Keith Carradine, Bert Remsen, John Schuck, Gwen Welles, Michael Murphy and Henry Gibson were, in shifting combinations, the faces of an Altman movie, people who seemed to exist (or, in the case of Mr. Gould, to exist vividly) only in his fictional world. And he gathered them all, along with a few more of their unpredictable ilk, for his epic ''Nashville,'' a movie whose multiple threads of stray narrative are held together by nothing more than a spirit, a sensibility: the weird buoyancy of Mr. Altman's take-it-as-it-comes fatalism.
 What strikes you, in fact, when you watch ''Nashville'' or its three immediate predecessors, ''The Long Goodbye,'' ''Thieves Like Us'' and ''California Split,'' is how fundamentally grim Mr. Altman's vision of American life is -- and how little that persistent, deep-seated, unshakable disillusion actually affects the tone of the movies. All the characters in those pictures are in one way or another disappointed, but disappointment doesn't appear to be a big deal for Mr. Altman. Maybe because he had to wait so long to fulfill his artistic ambitions, because he arrived so late to the Hollywood party, he seems to know (every one of his movies says it) that disappointment never killed anybody. ''It's O.K. with me'' is the dopey mantra of Mr. Gould's Phillip Marlowe in ''The Long Goodbye''; the crowd at the end of ''Nashville,'' shocked by an act of sudden violence, gets over its horror by singing along to a tune called ''It Don't Worry Me.'' And although in both pictures the effect is ironic, in neither case is it wholly ironic. On some level, Mr. Altman shrugs along with his characters.
 He would need, as it turned out, every bit of that world-weary insouciance in the years that followed ''Nashville,'' when it gradually became clear that the moment for his sort of exploratory filmmaking was passing, and then simply past. His stock company slowly dispersed, his college-age audience grew up and entered the so-called real world (which proved to be rather like the prosperous, company-run town that in the end no longer needs beautiful dreamers like John McCabe), and the studios became, I think it's fair to say, less tolerant of box-office failure. 
 You could almost feel the air leaking out of Mr. Altman's balloon in the late 70's. And by the 80's this profoundly American filmmaker had moved to Europe and largely reinvented himself as a less ambitious sort of artist: a master craftsman and a miniaturist, not a fresco painter dangling perilously from cathedral ceilings. He found work directing operas, plays and, television dramas, and for the big screen contented himself with a series of filmed theater pieces, most of which involved just one set and a limited number of characters. (The most memorable of them, 1984's ''Secret Honor,'' is a one-man show about Nixon.)
 In a way, the Robert Altman of this period is like one of the aging outlaws of ''The Wild Bunch'': ''It ain't like it used to be, but it'll do.'' And although his 80's movies are less exciting, their very smallness allows you to appreciate the beauty and resourcefulness of Mr. Altman's technique: the slow zooms, the fluid tracking shots, the elegantly timed cuts (usually on movement), the extraordinary assurance with which he explores the confined spaces and controls the dramatic rhythm, are immensely satisfying even when his material is second-rate.
 He kept his instrument in tune, and when a terrific script finally came his way -- Julian Mitchell's ''Vincent & Theo,'' about the van Gogh brothers -- he was more than ready. The movie he made, which was released in 1990 as an art-house picture (and is now available, in a gorgeous transfer, on DVD), seems to me the best of his post-''Nashville'' films: moving, powerful, scary and in love with light. Mr. Altman's direction is somber and almost classical, which may partly explain why the picture is so good: he's often at his sharpest when he's doing something he hasn't done before.
 The movie that put him, briefly, back on the Hollywood map, though, was familiar territory -- the darkly comic ensemble piece ''The Player'' (1992), whose setting is Hollywood itself and whose rampaging energy seems to derive from the glee of consummating a long-nursed revenge fantasy. ''The Player'' is his funniest movie, and, in the end, a prime example of the O.K.-with-me attitude that has enabled Mr. Altman to get by, and occasionally thrive, in the funhouse-mirror culture of studio filmmaking.
 He seized that moment, too, to try to recapture a bit of the early-70's exuberance. But he couldn't quite locate it, either in ''Short Cuts'' (which is brilliant but sour-spirited) or in the 1996 ''Kansas City'' (in which the cast let him down). What got his juices flowing again, peculiarly enough, was the elaborate English murder-mystery trifle ''Gosford Park,'' which revealed, to his evident delight, that there was a whole new world of Altman actors waiting for him in the old world.
 If honorary Oscars are to some degree awards for longevity and brute persistence, then Mr. Altman qualifies on that score, too: he's the unlikeliest imaginable survivor of the Hollywood system. When he steps onto the stage of the Kodak Theater on March 5 as this year's distinguished geezer, he might feel a twinge of is-this-all-there-is? disappointment, but his movies tell us that he'll get over it. He might even reflect that Sam Peckinpah -- his junior by one day, and 20 years dead -- blew out his heart fighting the studios, and never got his vindication. And Robert Altman, I expect, will accept his statuette with (perhaps slightly mordant) good grace, because it'll do.

HEADLINE: The Case for Fewer but Stronger Currencies

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
OUTSOURCING isn't just a one-way street on which rich countries shift jobs overseas. In recent years, some developing countries have contracted out the work of setting monetary policy to the United States. Ecuador and El Salvador, in 2000 and 2001, respectively, abandoned their own currencies, adopted the dollar and placed their monetary policy in the capable hands of Alan Greenspan, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 When outsourcing involves manufacturing and software programming it is often endorsed by economists and condemned by populist political leaders. So, too, is the tactic of outsourcing of monetary policy -- known as dollarization, or euro-ization. After all, noted Robert E. Litan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, ''currencies are symbols of national sovereignty, and countries are reluctant to give them up.'' 
And yet nations can impose enormous costs on their citizens when they take extraordinary efforts to maintain independent currencies. ''Devaluations of currencies cost people their savings and bring on rapid inflation,'' said Benn Steil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and co-author with Mr. Litan of ''Financial Statecraft'' (Yale University Press, 2006). The two argue that the globe's melange of 200-plus currencies, backed only by the faith of investors, is inefficient and dangerous. Many emerging economies, they say, would be well advised to swap their currencies for strong, stable, widely used ones like the dollar or euro.
 Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, has examined economic development in 32 countries that adopted foreign currencies from 1950 and 1993. He found that they had faster rates of G.D.P. growth, lower inflation and greater fiscal discipline than their counterparts who hung onto their sovereign currencies. Professor Hanke has been an adviser to Ecuador, which in 2004 was among the best-performing economies in Latin America, growing at a 6.6 percent rate with inflation at 2.7 percent. 
 ''Dollarization tends to deliver low inflation, and relatively low and stable interest rates,'' said Ricardo Hausman, a former chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank who now teaches at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
 So what's not to like? ''It's not like dollarization is a magic drug,'' Mr. Steil said. It certainly doesn't end the risk that countries will default on dollar-denominated debt. Panama has been using the dollar since 1904 and has repeatedly run into difficulties. And El Salvador's economic performance hasn't outpaced those of its Central American neighbors. 
 Some Latin American countries, notably Mexico, have tamed inflation without abandoning their own currencies. ''If you have sound economic policies in a country, you don't need dollarization,'' said Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business. ''And if you follow poor policies, I don't think dollarization will solve your problems.''
 But economists say that smaller countries can encourage investment by lashing their monetary fortunes to larger regional powers. In Latin America, companies that need to make long-term investments -- like utilities -- are forced to borrow in dollars while they operate in local currencies, leaving them exposed to currency risk. Now that El Salvador has adopted the dollar, companies there can borrow or engage in hedging transactions in dollars with relative ease. 
 And when small monetary boats tie themselves together or link themselves to larger ones, it encourages stability. ''European financial markets were able to navigate problems of 9/11 and the Madrid and London bombings without too much instability, because they didn't have the extra layer of exchange-rate problems,'' said Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley.
 But one economist's reassuring stability can be another's troubling rigidity. If the price of coffee plummets or the price for textiles falls because of competition from China, a Latin American country that has dollarized won't have the option of cutting interest rates to stimulate growth. ''Dollarization takes away the option of depreciation,'' Professor Hausman said. 
 Dollarization advocates say that this is all to the good. Mr. Steil notes that the Dominican Republic, where a currency crisis in 2004 wiped out the savings of a significant chunk of the population, conducts about 85 percent of its trade with the United States. ''Why on earth would they need their own currency?'' he asks.
 Large countries like the United States have to tread lightly in advocating that small countries give up their currencies. In 2000, Congress considered -- but did not pass -- the International Monetary Stability Act, which would have provided financial assistance to countries that adopted the dollar.
 WHAT'S more, moving to unite monetary policies without integrating political and labor systems is problematic. The 12 member nations of the euro zone have solved the political problems created by common currencies by adopting a transnational institution--the European Central Bank -- and giving every country a seat at the table, Professor Eichengreen said. ''Where is Ecuador's seat on the Federal Reserve Board?'' he asked. 
 Advocates of dollarization recognize that the trend is also at odds with the prevailing political winds in the Western Hemisphere. ''There is a mini-anti-American revolt going on in Latin America as we speak,'' Mr. Litan said. ''Countries that would otherwise be interested, like Bolivia and Venezuela, have elected leftist governments'' that are ardently opposed to dollarization.
 But Mr. Litan says he believes that time may be on the side of the dollar: ''History has marched toward the euro, and it is slowly marching toward the dollar.''

BREAKING THE SPELL
 Religion as a Natural Phenomenon.
 By Daniel C. Dennett.
 448 pp. Viking. $25.95.
THE question of the place of science in human life is not a scientific question. It is a philosophical question. Scientism, the view that science can explain all human conditions and expressions, mental as well as physical, is a superstition, one of the dominant superstitions of our day; and it is not an insult to science to say so. For a sorry instance of present-day scientism, it would be hard to improve on Daniel C. Dennett's book. ''Breaking the Spell'' is a work of considerable historical interest, because it is a merry anthology of contemporary superstitions. 
 The orthodoxies of evolutionary psychology are all here, its tiresome way of roaming widely but never leaving its house, its legendary curiosity that somehow always discovers the same thing. The excited materialism of American society -- I refer not to the American creed of shopping, according to which a person's qualities may be known by a person's brands, but more ominously to the adoption by American culture of biological, economic and technological ways of describing the purposes of human existence -- abounds in Dennett's usefully uninhibited pages. And Dennett's book is also a document of the intellectual havoc of our infamous polarization, with its widespread and deeply damaging assumption that the most extreme statement of an idea is its most genuine statement. Dennett lives in a world in which you must believe in the grossest biologism or in the grossest theism, in a purely naturalistic understanding of religion or in intelligent design, in the omniscience of a white man with a long beard in 19th-century England or in the omniscience of a white man with a long beard in the sky. 
 In his own opinion, Dennett is a hero. He is in the business of emancipation, and he reveres himself for it. ''By asking for an accounting of the pros and cons of religion, I risk getting poked in the nose or worse,'' he declares, ''and yet I persist.'' Giordano Bruno, with tenure at Tufts! He wonders whether religious people ''will have the intellectual honesty and courage to read this book through.'' If you disagree with what Dennett says, it is because you fear what he says. Any opposition to his scientistic deflation of religion he triumphantly dismisses as ''protectionism.'' But people who share Dennett's view of the world he calls ''brights.'' Brights are not only intellectually better, they are also ethically better. Did you know that ''brights have the lowest divorce rate in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest''? Dennett's own ''sacred values'' are ''democracy, justice, life, love and truth.'' This rigs things nicely. If you refuse his ''impeccably hardheaded and rational ontology,'' then your sacred values must be tyranny, injustice, death, hatred and falsehood. Dennett is the sort of rationalist who gives reason a bad name; and in a new era of American obscurantism, this is not helpful. 
 Dennett flatters himself that he is Hume's heir. Hume began ''The Natural History of Religion,'' a short incendiary work that was published in 1757, with this remark: ''As every enquiry which regards religion is of the utmost importance, there are two questions in particular which challenge our attention, to wit, that concerning its foundation in reason, and that concerning its origin in human nature.'' These words serve as the epigraph to Dennett's introduction to his own conception of ''religion as a natural phenomenon.'' ''Breaking the Spell'' proposes to answer Hume's second question, not least as a way of circumventing Hume's first question. Unfortunately, Dennett gives a misleading impression of Hume's reflections on religion. He chooses not to reproduce the words that immediately follow those in which he has just basked: ''Happily, the first question, which is the most important, admits of the most obvious, at least, the clearest, solution. The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author; and no rational enquirer can, after serious reflection, suspend his belief a moment with regard to the primary principles of genuine Theism and Religion.'' 
 So was Hume not a bright? I do not mean to be pedantic. Hume deplored religion as a source of illusions and crimes, and renounced its consolations even as he was dying. His God was a very wan god. But his God was still a god; and so his theism is as true or false as any other theism. The truth of religion cannot be proved by showing that a skeptic was in his way a believer, or by any other appeal to authority. There is no intellectually honorable surrogate for rational argument. Dennett's misrepresentation of Hume (and his similar misrepresentation of William James and Thomas Nagel) is noteworthy, therefore, because it illustrates his complacent refusal to acknowledge the dense and vital relations between religion and reason, not only historically but also philosophically.
 For Dennett, thinking historically absolves one of thinking philosophically. Is the theistic account of the cosmos true or false? Dennett, amazingly, does not care. ''The goal of either proving or disproving God's existence,'' he concludes, is ''not very important.'' It is history, not philosophy, that will break religion's spell. The story of religion's development will extirpate it. ''In order to explain the hold that various religious ideas and practices have on people,'' he writes, ''we need to understand the evolution of the human mind.'' What follows is, in brief, Dennett's natural history of religion. It begins with the elementary assertion that ''everything that moves needs something like a mind, to keep it out of harm's way and help it find the good things.'' To this end, there arose in very ancient times the evolutionary adaptation that one researcher has called a ''hyperactive agent detection device, or HADD.'' This cognitive skill taught us, or a very early version of us, that we live in a world of other minds -- and taught us too well, because it instilled ''the urge to treat things -- especially frustrating things -- as agents with beliefs and desires.'' This urge is ''deeply rooted in human biology,'' and it results in a ''fantasy-generation process'' that left us ''finding agency wherever anything puzzles or frightens us.'' 
 Eventually this animism issued in deities, who were simply the ''agents who had access to all the strategic information'' that we desperately lacked. ''But what good to us is the gods' knowledge if we can't get it from them?'' So eventually shamans arose who told us what we wanted to hear from the gods, and did so by means of hypnosis. (Our notion of God is the product of this ''hypnotizability-enabler'' in our brains, and it may even be that theism is owed to a ''gene for heightened hypnotizability,'' which would be an acceptable version of a ''God gene.'') To secure these primitive constructs and comforts against oblivion, ritual was invented; and they were further secured by ''acts of deceit'' that propounded their ''systematic invulnerability to disproof.'' Folk religions became organized religions. The ''trade secrets'' of the shamans were transmitted to ''every priest and minister, every imam and rabbi.'' Slowly and steadily, these ''trade secrets'' were given the more comprehensive protection of ''belief in belief,'' the idea that certain convictions are so significant that they must be insulated from the pressures of reason. ''The belief that belief in God is so important that it must not be subjected to the risks of disconfirmation or serious criticism,'' Dennett instructs, ''has led the devout to 'save' their beliefs by making them incomprehensible even to themselves.'' In sum, we were HADD. Here endeth the lesson.
 There are a number of things that must be said about this story. The first is that it is only a story. It is not based, in any strict sense, on empirical research. Dennett is ''extrapolating back to human prehistory with the aid of biological thinking,'' nothing more. ''Breaking the Spell'' is a fairy tale told by evolutionary biology. There is no scientific foundation for its scientistic narrative. Even Dennett admits as much: ''I am not at all claiming that this is what science has established about religion. . . . We don't yet know.'' So all of Dennett's splashy allegiance to evidence and experiment and ''generating further testable hypotheses'' notwithstanding, what he has written is just an extravagant speculation based upon his hope for what is the case, a pious account of his own atheistic longing. 
 And why is Dennett so certain that the origins of a thing are the most illuminating features of a thing, or that a thing is forever as primitive as its origins? Has Dennett never seen a flower grow from the dust? Or is it the dust that he sees in a flower? ''Breaking the Spell'' is a long, hectoring exercise in unexamined originalism. In perhaps the most flattening passage in the book, Dennett surmises that ''all our 'intrinsic' values started out as instrumental values,'' and that this conviction about the primacy of the instrumental is a solemn requirement of science. He remarks that the question cui bono? -- who benefits? -- ''is even more central in evolutionary biology than in the law,'' and so we must seek the biological utilities of what might otherwise seem like ''a gratuitous outlay.'' An anxiety about the reality of nonbiological meanings troubles Dennett's every page. But it is very hard to envisage the biological utilities of such gratuitous outlays as ''The Embarkation for Cythera'' and Fermat's theorem and the ''Missa Solemnis.''
 It will be plain that Dennett's approach to religion is contrived to evade religion's substance. He thinks that an inquiry into belief is made superfluous by an inquiry into the belief in belief. This is a very revealing mistake. You cannot disprove a belief unless you disprove its content. If you believe that you can disprove it any other way, by describing its origins or by describing its consequences, then you do not believe in reason. In this profound sense, Dennett does not believe in reason. He will be outraged to hear this, since he regards himself as a giant of rationalism. But the reason he imputes to the human creatures depicted in his book is merely a creaturely reason. Dennett's natural history does not deny reason, it animalizes reason. It portrays reason in service to natural selection, and as a product of natural selection. But if reason is a product of natural selection, then how much confidence can we have in a rational argument for natural selection? The power of reason is owed to the independence of reason, and to nothing else. (In this respect, rationalism is closer to mysticism than it is to materialism.) Evolutionary biology cannot invoke the power of reason even as it destroys it. 
 Like many biological reductionists, Dennett is sure that he is not a biological reductionist. But the charge is proved as early as the fourth page of his book. Watch closely. ''Like other animals,'' the confused passage begins, ''we have built-in desires to reproduce and to do pretty much whatever it takes to achieve this goal.'' No confusion there, and no offense. It is incontrovertible that we are animals. The sentence continues: ''But we also have creeds, and the ability to transcend our genetic imperatives.'' A sterling observation, and the beginning of humanism. And then more, in the same fine antideterministic vein: ''This fact does make us different.'' 
 Then suddenly there is this: ''But it is itself a biological fact, visible to natural science, and something that requires an explanation from natural science.'' As the ancient rabbis used to say, have your ears heard what your mouth has spoken? Dennett does not see that he has taken his humanism back. Why is our independence from biology a fact of biology? And if it is a fact of biology, then we are not independent of biology. If our creeds are an expression of our animality, if they require an explanation from natural science, then we have not transcended our genetic imperatives. The human difference, in Dennett's telling, is a difference in degree, not a difference in kind -- a doctrine that may quite plausibly be called biological reductionism.
 Dennett is unable to imagine a fact about us that is not a biological fact. His book is riddled with translations of emotions and ideas into evo-psychobabble. ''It is in the genetic interests of parents . . . to inform -- not misinform -- their young, so it is efficient (and relatively safe) to trust one's parents.'' Grief for the death of a loved one is ''a major task of cognitive updating: revising all our habits of thought to fit a world with one less familiar intentional system in it.'' ''Marriage rituals and taboos against adultery, clothing and hairstyles, breath fresheners and pornography and condoms and H.I.V. and all the rest'' have their ''ancient but ongoing source'' in the organism's need to thwart parasites. ''The phenomenon of romantic love'' may be adequately understood by reference to ''the unruly marketplace of human mate-finding.'' And finally, the general rule: ''Everything we value -- from sugar and sex and money to music and love and religion -- we value for reasons. Lying behind, and distinct from, our reasons are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection.'' Never mind the merits of materialism as an analysis of the world. As an attitude to life, it represents a collapse of wisdom. So steer clear of ''we materialists'' in your dark hours. They cannot fortify you, say, after the funeral of a familiar intentional system.
 BEFORE there were naturalist superstitions, there were supernaturalist superstitions. The crudities of religious myth are plentiful, and a sickening amount of savagery has been perpetrated in their name. Yet the excesses of naturalism cannot hide behind the excesses of supernaturalism. Or more to the point, the excesses of naturalism cannot live without the excesses of supernaturalism. Dennett actually prefers folk religion to intellectual religion, because it is nearer to the instinctual mire that enchants him. The move ''away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts,'' or the increasing philosophical sophistication of religion over the centuries, he views only as ''strategic belief-maintenance.'' He cannot conceive of a thoughtful believer. He writes often, and with great indignation, of religion's strictures against doubts and criticisms, when in fact the religious traditions are replete with doubts and criticisms. Dennett is unacquainted with the distinction between fideism and faith. Like many of the fundamentalists whom he despises, he is a literalist in matters of religion. 
 But why must we read literally in the realm of religion, when in so many other realms of human expression we read metaphorically, allegorically, symbolically, figuratively, analogically? We see kernels and husks everywhere. There are concepts in many of the fables of faith, philosophical propositions about the nature of the universe. They may be right or they may be wrong, but they are there. Dennett recognizes the uses of faith, but not its reasons. In the end, his repudiation of religion is a repudiation of philosophy, which is also an affair of belief in belief. What this shallow and self-congratulatory book establishes most conclusively is that there are many spells that need to be broken.

HEADLINE: After Neoconservatism

BYLINE: By Francis Fukuyama. 
Francis Fukuyama teaches at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. This essay is adapted from his book ''America at the Crossroads,'' which will be published this month by Yale University Press.

 BODY:
As we approach the third anniversary of the onset of the Iraq war, it seems very unlikely that history will judge either the intervention itself or the ideas animating it kindly. By invading Iraq, the Bush administration created a self-fulfilling prophecy: Iraq has now replaced Afghanistan as a magnet, a training ground and an operational base for jihadist terrorists, with plenty of American targets to shoot at. The United States still has a chance of creating a Shiite-dominated democratic Iraq, but the new government will be very weak for years to come; the resulting power vacuum will invite outside influence from all of Iraq's neighbors, including Iran. There are clear benefits to the Iraqi people from the removal of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, and perhaps some positive spillover effects in Lebanon and Syria. But it is very hard to see how these developments in themselves justify the blood and treasure that the United States has spent on the project to this point. 
The so-called Bush Doctrine that set the framework for the administration's first term is now in shambles. The doctrine (elaborated, among other places, in the 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States) argued that, in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, America would have to launch periodic preventive wars to defend itself against rouge states and terrorists with weapons of mass destruction; that it would do this alone, if necessary; and that it would work to democratize the greater Middle East as a long-term solution to the terrorist problem. But successful pre-emption depends on the ability to predict the future accurately and on good intelligence, which was not forthcoming, while America's perceived unilateralism has isolated it as never before. It is not surprising that in its second term, the administration has been distancing itself from these policies and is in the process of rewriting the National Security Strategy document.
 But it is the idealistic effort to use American power to promote democracy and human rights abroad that may suffer the greatest setback. Perceived failure in Iraq has restored the authority of foreign policy ''realists'' in the tradition of Henry Kissinger. Already there is a host of books and articles decrying America's naive Wilsonianism and attacking the notion of trying to democratize the world. The administration's second-term efforts to push for greater Middle Eastern democracy, introduced with the soaring rhetoric of Bush's second Inaugural Address, have borne very problematic fruits. The Islamist Muslim Brotherhood made a strong showing in Egypt's parliamentary elections in November and December. While the holding of elections in Iraq this past December was an achievement in itself, the vote led to the ascendance of a Shiite bloc with close ties to Iran (following on the election of the conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president of Iran in June). But the clincher was the decisive Hamas victory in the Palestinian election last month, which brought to power a movement overtly dedicated to the destruction of Israel. In his second inaugural, Bush said that ''America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one,'' but the charge will be made with increasing frequency that the Bush administration made a big mistake when it stirred the pot, and that the United States would have done better to stick by its traditional authoritarian friends in the Middle East. Indeed, the effort to promote democracy around the world has been attacked as an illegitimate activity both by people on the left like Jeffrey Sachs and by traditional conservatives like Pat Buchanan. 
 The reaction against democracy promotion and an activist foreign policy may not end there. Those whom Walter Russell Mead labels Jacksonian conservatives -- red-state Americans whose sons and daughters are fighting and dying in the Middle East -- supported the Iraq war because they believed that their children were fighting to defend the United States against nuclear terrorism, not to promote democracy. They don't want to abandon the president in the middle of a vicious war, but down the road the perceived failure of the Iraq intervention may push them to favor a more isolationist foreign policy, which is a more natural political position for them. A recent Pew poll indicates a swing in public opinion toward isolationism; the percentage of Americans saying that the United States ''should mind its own business'' has never been higher since the end of the Vietnam War. 
 More than any other group, it was the neoconservatives both inside and outside the Bush administration who pushed for democratizing Iraq and the broader Middle East. They are widely credited (or blamed) for being the decisive voices promoting regime change in Iraq, and yet it is their idealistic agenda that in the coming months and years will be the most directly threatened. Were the United States to retreat from the world stage, following a drawdown in Iraq, it would in my view be a huge tragedy, because American power and influence have been critical to the maintenance of an open and increasingly democratic order around the world. The problem with neoconservatism's agenda lies not in its ends, which are as American as apple pie, but rather in the overmilitarized means by which it has sought to accomplish them. What American foreign policy needs is not a return to a narrow and cynical realism, but rather the formulation of a ''realistic Wilsonianism'' that better matches means to ends. 

The Neoconservative Legacy
 How did the neoconservatives end up overreaching to such an extent that they risk undermining their own goals? The Bush administration's first-term foreign policy did not flow ineluctably from the views of earlier generations of people who considered themselves neoconservatives, since those views were themselves complex and subject to differing interpretations. Four common principles or threads ran through much of this thought up through the end of the cold war: a concern with democracy, human rights and, more generally, the internal politics of states; a belief that American power can be used for moral purposes; a skepticism about the ability of international law and institutions to solve serious security problems; and finally, a view that ambitious social engineering often leads to unexpected consequences and thereby undermines its own ends.
 The problem was that two of these principles were in potential collision. The skeptical stance toward ambitious social engineering -- which in earlier years had been applied mostly to domestic policies like affirmative action, busing and welfare -- suggested a cautious approach toward remaking the world and an awareness that ambitious initiatives always have unanticipated consequences. The belief in the potential moral uses of American power, on the other hand, implied that American activism could reshape the structure of global politics. By the time of the Iraq war, the belief in the transformational uses of power had prevailed over the doubts about social engineering. 
 In retrospect, things did not have to develop this way. The roots of neoconservatism lie in a remarkable group of largely Jewish intellectuals who attended City College of New York (C.C.N.Y.) in the mid- to late 1930's and early 1940's, a group that included Irving Kristol, Daniel Bell, Irving Howe, Nathan Glazer and, a bit later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The story of this group has been told in a number of places, most notably in a documentary film by Joseph Dorman called ''Arguing the World.'' The most important inheritance from the C.C.N.Y. group was an idealistic belief in social progress and the universality of rights, coupled with intense anti-Communism.
 It is not an accident that many in the C.C.N.Y. group started out as Trotskyites. Leon Trotsky was, of course, himself a Communist, but his supporters came to understand better than most people the utter cynicism and brutality of the Stalinist regime. The anti-Communist left, in contrast to the traditional American right, sympathized with the social and economic aims of Communism, but in the course of the 1930's and 1940's came to realize that ''real existing socialism'' had become a monstrosity of unintended consequences that completely undermined the idealistic goals it espoused. While not all of the C.C.N.Y. thinkers became neoconservatives, the danger of good intentions carried to extremes was a theme that would underlie the life work of many members of this group.
 If there was a single overarching theme to the domestic social policy critiques issued by those who wrote for the neoconservative journal The Public Interest, founded by Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer and Daniel Bell in 1965, it was the limits of social engineering. Writers like Glazer, Moynihan and, later, Glenn Loury argued that ambitious efforts to seek social justice often left societies worse off than before because they either required massive state intervention that disrupted pre-existing social relations (for example, forced busing) or else produced unanticipated consequences (like an increase in single-parent families as a result of welfare). A major theme running through James Q. Wilson's extensive writings on crime was the idea that you could not lower crime rates by trying to solve deep underlying problems like poverty and racism; effective policies needed to focus on shorter-term measures that went after symptoms of social distress (like subway graffiti or panhandling) rather than root causes. 
 How, then, did a group with such a pedigree come to decide that the ''root cause'' of terrorism lay in the Middle East's lack of democracy, that the United States had both the wisdom and the ability to fix this problem and that democracy would come quickly and painlessly to Iraq? Neoconservatives would not have taken this turn but for the peculiar way that the cold war ended.
 Ronald Reagan was ridiculed by sophisticated people on the American left and in Europe for labeling the Soviet Union and its allies an ''evil empire'' and for challenging Mikhail Gorbachev not just to reform his system but also to ''tear down this wall.'' His assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, Richard Perle, was denounced as the ''prince of darkness'' for this uncompromising, hard-line position; his proposal for a double-zero in the intermediate-range nuclear arms negotiations (that is, the complete elimination of medium-range missiles) was attacked as hopelessly out of touch by the bien-pensant centrist foreign-policy experts at places like the Council on Foreign Relations and the State Department. That community felt that the Reaganites were dangerously utopian in their hopes for actually winning, as opposed to managing, the cold war.
 And yet total victory in the cold war is exactly what happened in 1989-91. Gorbachev accepted not only the double zero but also deep cuts in conventional forces, and then failed to stop the Polish, Hungarian and East German defections from the empire. Communism collapsed within a couple of years because of its internal moral weaknesses and contradictions, and with regime change in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact threat to the West evaporated.
 The way the cold war ended shaped the thinking of supporters of the Iraq war, including younger neoconservatives like William Kristol and Robert Kagan, in two ways. First, it seems to have created an expectation that all totalitarian regimes were hollow at the core and would crumble with a small push from outside. The model for this was Romania under the Ceausescus: once the wicked witch was dead, the munchkins would rise up and start singing joyously about their liberation. As Kristol and Kagan put it in their 2000 book ''Present Dangers'': ''To many the idea of America using its power to promote changes of regime in nations ruled by dictators rings of utopianism. But in fact, it is eminently realistic. There is something perverse in declaring the impossibility of promoting democratic change abroad in light of the record of the past three decades.'' 
 This overoptimism about postwar transitions to democracy helps explain the Bush administration's incomprehensible failure to plan adequately for the insurgency that subsequently emerged in Iraq. The war's supporters seemed to think that democracy was a kind of default condition to which societies reverted once the heavy lifting of coercive regime change occurred, rather than a long-term process of institution-building and reform. While they now assert that they knew all along that the democratic transformation of Iraq would be long and hard, they were clearly taken by surprise. According to George Packer's recent book on Iraq, ''The Assassins' Gate,'' the Pentagon planned a drawdown of American forces to some 25,000 troops by the end of the summer following the invasion. 
 By the 1990's, neoconservatism had been fed by several other intellectual streams. One came from the students of the German Jewish political theorist Leo Strauss, who, contrary to much of the nonsense written about him by people like Anne Norton and Shadia Drury, was a serious reader of philosophical texts who did not express opinions on contemporary politics or policy issues. Rather, he was concerned with the ''crisis of modernity'' brought on by the relativism of Nietzsche and Heidegger, as well as the fact that neither the claims of religion nor deeply-held opinions about the nature of the good life could be banished from politics, as the thinkers of the European Enlightenment had hoped. Another stream came from Albert Wohlstetter, a Rand Corporation strategist who was the teacher of Richard Perle, Zalmay Khalilzad (the current American ambassador to Iraq) and Paul Wolfowitz (the former deputy secretary of defense), among other people. Wohlstetter was intensely concerned with the problem of nuclear proliferation and the way that the 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty left loopholes, in its support for ''peaceful'' nuclear energy, large enough for countries like Iraq and Iran to walk through.
 I have numerous affiliations with the different strands of the neoconservative movement. I was a student of Strauss's protege Allan Bloom, who wrote the bestseller ''The Closing of the American Mind''; worked at Rand and with Wohlstetter on Persian Gulf issues; and worked also on two occasions for Wolfowitz. Many people have also interpreted my book ''The End of History and the Last Man'' (1992) as a neoconservative tract, one that argued in favor of the view that there is a universal hunger for liberty in all people that will inevitably lead them to liberal democracy, and that we are living in the midst of an accelerating, transnational movement in favor of that liberal democracy. This is a misreading of the argument. ''The End of History'' is in the end an argument about modernization. What is initially universal is not the desire for liberal democracy but rather the desire to live in a modern -- that is, technologically advanced and prosperous -- society, which, if satisfied, tends to drive demands for political participation. Liberal democracy is one of the byproducts of this modernization process, something that becomes a universal aspiration only in the course of historical time.
 ''The End of History,'' in other words, presented a kind of Marxist argument for the existence of a long-term process of social evolution, but one that terminates in liberal democracy rather than communism. In the formulation of the scholar Ken Jowitt, the neoconservative position articulated by people like Kristol and Kagan was, by contrast, Leninist; they believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will. Leninism was a tragedy in its Bolshevik version, and it has returned as farce when practiced by the United States. Neoconservatism, as both a political symbol and a body of thought, has evolved into something I can no longer support. 

The Failure of Benevolent Hegemony
 The Bush administration and its neoconservative supporters did not simply underestimate the difficulty of bringing about congenial political outcomes in places like Iraq; they also misunderstood the way the world would react to the use of American power. Of course, the cold war was replete with instances of what the foreign policy analyst Stephen Sestanovich calls American maximalism, wherein Washington acted first and sought legitimacy and support from its allies only after the fact. But in the post-cold-war period, the structural situation of world politics changed in ways that made this kind of exercise of power much more problematic in the eyes of even close allies. After the fall of the Soviet Union, various neoconservative authors like Charles Krauthammer, William Kristol and Robert Kagan suggested that the United States would use its margin of power to exert a kind of ''benevolent hegemony'' over the rest of the world, fixing problems like rogue states with W.M.D., human rights abuses and terrorist threats as they came up. Writing before the Iraq war, Kristol and Kagan considered whether this posture would provoke resistance from the rest of the world, and concluded, ''It is precisely because American foreign policy is infused with an unusually high degree of morality that other nations find they have less to fear from its otherwise daunting power.'' (Italics added.)
 It is hard to read these lines without irony in the wake of the global reaction to the Iraq war, which succeeded in uniting much of the world in a frenzy of anti-Americanism. The idea that the United States is a hegemon more benevolent than most is not an absurd one, but there were warning signs that things had changed in America's relationship to the world long before the start of the Iraq war. The structural imbalance in global power had grown enormous. America surpassed the rest of the world in every dimension of power by an unprecedented margin, with its defense spending nearly equal to that of the rest of the world combined. Already during the Clinton years, American economic hegemony had generated enormous hostility to an American-dominated process of globalization, frequently on the part of close democratic allies who thought the United States was seeking to impose its antistatist social model on them. 
 There were other reasons as well why the world did not accept American benevolent hegemony. In the first place, it was premised on American exceptionalism, the idea that America could use its power in instances where others could not because it was more virtuous than other countries. The doctrine of pre-emption against terrorist threats contained in the 2002 National Security Strategy was one that could not safely be generalized through the international system; America would be the first country to object if Russia, China, India or France declared a similar right of unilateral action. The United States was seeking to pass judgment on others while being unwilling to have its own conduct questioned in places like the International Criminal Court. 
 Another problem with benevolent hegemony was domestic. There are sharp limits to the American people's attention to foreign affairs and willingness to finance projects overseas that do not have clear benefits to American interests. Sept. 11 changed that calculus in many ways, providing popular support for two wars in the Middle East and large increases in defense spending. But the durability of the support is uncertain: although most Americans want to do what is necessary to make the project of rebuilding Iraq succeed, the aftermath of the invasion did not increase the public appetite for further costly interventions. Americans are not, at heart, an imperial people. Even benevolent hegemons sometimes have to act ruthlessly, and they need a staying power that does not come easily to people who are reasonably content with their own lives and society.
 Finally, benevolent hegemony presumed that the hegemon was not only well intentioned but competent as well. Much of the criticism of the Iraq intervention from Europeans and others was not based on a normative case that the United States was not getting authorization from the United Nations Security Council, but rather on the belief that it had not made an adequate case for invading Iraq in the first place and didn't know what it was doing in trying to democratize Iraq. In this, the critics were unfortunately quite prescient. 
 The most basic misjudgment was an overestimation of the threat facing the United States from radical Islamism. Although the new and ominous possibility of undeterrable terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction did indeed present itself, advocates of the war wrongly conflated this with the threat presented by Iraq and with the rogue state/proliferation problem more generally. The misjudgment was based in part on the massive failure of the American intelligence community to correctly assess the state of Iraq's W.M.D. programs before the war. But the intelligence community never took nearly as alarmist a view of the terrorist/W.M.D. threat as the war's supporters did. Overestimation of this threat was then used to justify the elevation of preventive war to the centerpiece of a new security strategy, as well as a whole series of measures that infringed on civil liberties, from detention policy to domestic eavesdropping. 

What to Do
 Now that the neoconservative moment appears to have passed, the United States needs to reconceptualize its foreign policy in several fundamental ways. In the first instance, we need to demilitarize what we have been calling the global war on terrorism and shift to other types of policy instruments. We are fighting hot counterinsurgency wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and against the international jihadist movement, wars in which we need to prevail. But ''war'' is the wrong metaphor for the broader struggle, since wars are fought at full intensity and have clear beginnings and endings. Meeting the jihadist challenge is more of a ''long, twilight struggle'' whose core is not a military campaign but a political contest for the hearts and minds of ordinary Muslims around the world. As recent events in France and Denmark suggest, Europe will be a central battleground in this fight. 
 The United States needs to come up with something better than ''coalitions of the willing'' to legitimate its dealings with other countries. The world today lacks effective international institutions that can confer legitimacy on collective action; creating new organizations that will better balance the dual requirements of legitimacy and effectiveness will be the primary task for the coming generation. As a result of more than 200 years of political evolution, we have a relatively good understanding of how to create institutions that are rulebound, accountable and reasonably effective in the vertical silos we call states. What we do not have are adequate mechanisms of horizontal accountability among states.
 The conservative critique of the United Nations is all too cogent: while useful for certain peacekeeping and nation-building operations, the United Nations lacks both democratic legitimacy and effectiveness in dealing with serious security issues. The solution is not to strengthen a single global body, but rather to promote what has been emerging in any event, a ''multi-multilateral world'' of overlapping and occasionally competing international institutions that are organized on regional or functional lines. Kosovo in 1999 was a model: when the Russian veto prevented the Security Council from acting, the United States and its NATO allies simply shifted the venue to NATO, where the Russians could not block action. 
 The final area that needs rethinking, and the one that will be the most contested in the coming months and years, is the place of democracy promotion in American foreign policy. The worst legacy that could come from the Iraq war would be an anti-neoconservative backlash that coupled a sharp turn toward isolation with a cynical realist policy aligning the United States with friendly authoritarians. Good governance, which involves not just democracy but also the rule of law and economic development, is critical to a host of outcomes we desire, from alleviating poverty to dealing with pandemics to controlling violent conflicts. A Wilsonian policy that pays attention to how rulers treat their citizens is therefore right, but it needs to be informed by a certain realism that was missing from the thinking of the Bush administration in its first term and of its neoconservative allies.
 We need in the first instance to understand that promoting democracy and modernization in the Middle East is not a solution to the problem of jihadist terrorism; in all likelihood it will make the short-term problem worse, as we have seen in the case of the Palestinian election bringing Hamas to power. Radical Islamism is a byproduct of modernization itself, arising from the loss of identity that accompanies the transition to a modern, pluralist society. It is no accident that so many recent terrorists, from Sept. 11's Mohamed Atta to the murderer of the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh to the London subway bombers, were radicalized in democratic Europe and intimately familiar with all of democracy's blessings. More democracy will mean more alienation, radicalization and -- yes, unfortunately -- terrorism.
 But greater political participation by Islamist groups is very likely to occur whatever we do, and it will be the only way that the poison of radical Islamism can ultimately work its way through the body politic of Muslim communities around the world. The age is long since gone when friendly authoritarians could rule over passive populations and produce stability indefinitely. New social actors are mobilizing everywhere, from Bolivia and Venezuela to South Africa and the Persian Gulf. A durable Israeli-Palestinian peace could not be built upon a corrupt, illegitimate Fatah that constantly had to worry about Hamas challenging its authority. Peace might emerge, sometime down the road, from a Palestine run by a formerly radical terrorist group that had been forced to deal with the realities of governing. 
 If we are serious about the good governance agenda, we have to shift our focus to the reform, reorganization and proper financing of those institutions of the United States government that actually promote democracy, development and the rule of law around the world, organizations like the State Department, U.S.A.I.D., the National Endowment for Democracy and the like. The United States has played an often decisive role in helping along many recent democratic transitions, including in the Philippines in 1986; South Korea and Taiwan in 1987; Chile in 1988; Poland and Hungary in 1989; Serbia in 2000; Georgia in 2003; and Ukraine in 2004-5. But the overarching lesson that emerges from these cases is that the United States does not get to decide when and where democracy comes about. By definition, outsiders can't ''impose'' democracy on a country that doesn't want it; demand for democracy and reform must be domestic. Democracy promotion is therefore a long-term and opportunistic process that has to await the gradual ripening of political and economic conditions to be effective. 
 The Bush administration has been walking -- indeed, sprinting -- away from the legacy of its first term, as evidenced by the cautious multilateral approach it has taken toward the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea. Condoleezza Rice gave a serious speech in January about ''transformational diplomacy'' and has begun an effort to reorganize the nonmilitary side of the foreign-policy establishment, and the National Security Strategy document is being rewritten. All of these are welcome changes, but the legacy of the Bush first-term foreign policy and its neoconservative supporters has been so polarizing that it is going to be hard to have a reasoned debate about how to appropriately balance American ideals and interests in the coming years. The reaction against a flawed policy can be as damaging as the policy itself, and such a reaction is an indulgence we cannot afford, given the critical moment we have arrived at in global politics. 
 Neoconservatism, whatever its complex roots, has become indelibly associated with concepts like coercive regime change, unilateralism and American hegemony. What is needed now are new ideas, neither neoconservative nor realist, for how America is to relate to the rest of the world -- ideas that retain the neoconservative belief in the universality of human rights, but without its illusions about the efficacy of American power and hegemony to bring these ends about.

Calculating a Driver's Risk
 Five years ago this weekend, Dale Earnhardt crashed into a wall during the final lap of the Daytona 500 and was instantly killed. One of the most successful, beloved and intimidating drivers in Nascar history, Earnhardt is still actively mourned. (If you watch today's Daytona 500, the first and most prominent race of the Nascar season, you will surely see his No. 3 everywhere.) Earnhardt's death was to Nascar as 9/11 was to the federal government: a wake-up call leading to a radical overhaul of safety measures. ''There were three or four bad accidents in a row there over two or three years,'' says Matt Kenseth, an elite Nascar driver. ''Nascar was always working hard on safety, but that'' -- Earnhardt's death -- ''really sped things up.''
Driving a race car is an obviously hazardous pursuit. When Earnhardt died, he was the seventh driver within Nascar's three major divisions -- the Craftsman Truck Series, the Busch Series and the premier circuit now known as the Nextel Cup Series -- to die within a period of seven years. 
 And how many drivers have been killed since his death in 2001? 
 Zero. In more than six million miles of racing -- and many, many miles in practice and qualifying laps, which are plenty dangerous -- not a single driver in Nascar's three top divisions has died. 
 On U.S. roads, meanwhile, roughly 185,000 drivers, passengers and motorcyclists have been killed during this same time frame. Those 185,000 deaths, though, came over the course of nearly 15 trillion miles driven. This translates into one fatality for every 81 million miles driven. Although traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for Americans from ages 3 to 33, this would seem to be a pretty low death rate (especially since it includes motorcycles, which are far more dangerous than cars or trucks). How long might it take one person to drive 81 million miles? Let's say that for a solid year you did nothing but drive, 24 hours a day, at 60 miles per hour. In one year, you'd cover 525,600 miles; to reach 81 million miles, you'd have to drive around the clock for 154 years. In other words, a lot of people die on U.S. roads each year not because driving is so dangerous, but because an awful lot of people are driving an awful lot of miles.
 So Nascar's record of zero deaths in five years over six million miles is perhaps not as remarkable as it first sounded. Still, driving a race car would seem to be substantially more dangerous than taking a trip to the supermarket. What has Nascar done to produce its zero-fatality record?
 It's a long list. Well before Earnhardt was killed, each driver was already wearing a helmet, fireproof suit and shoes and a five-point safety harness. Months after Earnhardt's death, Nascar began requiring the use of a head-and-neck restraint that is tethered to a driver's helmet and prevents his head from flying forward or sideways in a crash. (Like many race-car drivers who are killed, Earnhardt suffered a fracture to the base of the skull.) It erected safer walls on its race tracks. And it began to zealously collect crash data. This Incident Database (which Nascar politely declined to let us examine) is gleaned from two main sources: a black box now mounted on every vehicle and the work of a new Field Investigation unit. These field investigators meticulously take key measurements on every car before every race, and then if a car is involved in a crash, they retake those measurements.
 ''In the past, a car would be in an accident, the driver would have no injuries and the team would load up the car and go home,'' says Gary Nelson, who runs Nascar's research and development center. ''But now they measure every car in certain areas, and we make a log of that. Like the width of the seat -- it seems simple, the width of the headrest from left to right. But in an accident, those things can bend, and the amount they bend can help us understand the energy involved. When we began, we thought our seats were adequately strong, but we found these things to be bending more than we thought. So we've come back since and rewritten the regulations.''
 Although it is wildly reductive to put it this way, a Nascar driver has two main goals: to win a race and to not be killed. Nascar's recent safety measures seem to have considerably reduced the likelihood of being killed. So could it be that drivers are now willing to be more reckless? When crashing is made less costly, an economist would fully expect drivers to be crashing like crazy; could it be that Nascar's safety measures have led to fewer deaths but more crashes?
 A quick look at the data seems to suggest so. In last year's Nextel Cup races, there were 345 cars involved in crashes, an all-time high. But, as Matt Kenseth points out, the two cup races held during 2005 at Lowe's Motor Speedway near Charlotte, N.C., were unusually brutal -- the track had a new surface that caused numerous flat tires -- and may have aberrationally affected the crash count. ''In Charlotte, pretty much everybody wrecked in both races,'' he says. ''It was the fault of the track and the tires -- but if you take those races out of it, crashes are probably about even.'' And there were actually fewer crashes in 2004 than there were in 2003. While the number of overall crashes are up a bit since Earnhardt's death (Nascar will not release annual crash counts, but one official did confirm this trend), they haven't increased nearly as much as an economist might have predicted based on how Nascar's safety measures would seem to have shifted a driver's incentives.
 Maybe that's because there are other, perhaps stronger, incentives at play. The first is that Nascar has increased its penalties for reckless driving, not only fining drivers but also subtracting points in their race for the cup championship. The other lies in how the cup championship itself has been restructured. Two years ago, Nascar gave its 36-race season a playoff format. In order to qualify for the playoffs -- and have a chance at winning the $6 million-plus cup championship -- a driver must be among the points leaders after the first 26 races of the season. While a couple of 20th-place finishes during those first 26 races won't necessary ruin your championship hopes (each race fields a slate of 43 cars), a few bad crashes might.
 So Nascar has reduced a danger incentive but imposed a financial incentive, thus maintaining the delicate and masterful balance it has cultivated: it has enough crashes to satisfy its fans but not too many to destroy the sport -- or its drivers. (Nascar fans love crashes the way hockey fans love fights; when you watch the Speed Channel's edited replays of Nascar races, the plot is always the same: green flag, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, checkered flag.) 
 And here lies the most startling statistic concerning Nascar and driver safety. In the past five years, more than 3,000 vehicles have crashed in Nascar's three top divisions, with zero fatalities. How does this compare with crashes on American highways? For interstate travel, there are 5.2 driver deaths per 1,000 crashes. At this rate, it would seem likely that those 3,000 Nascar crashes would have produced at least 15 deaths -- and yet there have been none. To be sure, there are significant differences between Interstate driving and Nascar driving. A driver on the Interstate has to contend with poor weather, drunken drivers and cars coming at him in the opposite direction. On the other hand, a driver in the Daytona 500 is often traveling at 180 miles per hour in bumper-to-bumper traffic.
 With more than 37,000 Americans dying in traffic accidents each year, it might be tempting to impose some of Nascar's safety regulations on the average driver. But considering how relatively safe it is to drive in this country, the added costs, measured in both dollars and comfort, would be steep. You might be willing to wear a five-point safety harness instead of the typical three-point lap-and-shoulder belt, and you would almost certainly be safer if you did. But are you ready to put on a helmet and fireproof suit every time you drive to the supermarket?
