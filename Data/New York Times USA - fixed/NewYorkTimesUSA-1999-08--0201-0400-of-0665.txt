HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: The Outlook for Cable Access;
An AT&T-AOL Deal Would Rain On Excite@Home's Parade

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
As the AT&T Corporation, the nation's biggest telephone company, has marched into the cable television business, it has found itself locked in a battle of legal briefs, lobbying salvos and public relations campaigns against America Online Inc.
The fight over "open access" to AT&T's cable systems has raged in local communities from Broward County, Fla., to Portland, Ore., and America Online, the nation's largest gateway to cyberspace, has consistently argued that AT&T must let Internet carriers link directly to AT&T's cable systems. Such connections would bypass communications systems and Web services developed by Excite@Home, an Internet-over-cable company that is backed by many big cable television players -- including AT&T. 
 All along this battlefront, AT&T has taken an adamant stance: Because it is investing billions of dollars to upgrade its cable networks to carry Internet data, AT&T has argued that it should have exclusive right to determine how those systems are used for Internet access.
But behind the scenes, a side deal may now be in the works -- one that could eventually undermine Excite@Home's business model. According to executives close to the companies, AT&T and America Online are considering an arrangement that would diminish the role of Excite@Home by giving America Online and perhaps other Internet providers enhanced access to AT&T's systems.
Such a deal could be more than politically expedient; it would enable AT&T and America Online each to tap the technical and marketing strengths of the other.
AT&T and America Online declined to comment.
The competitive dynamics of the marketplace and the industry's strategic landscape make a compelling case for America Online and AT&T to approach the digital future as partners rather than foes. After all, America Online already has 18 million Internet subscribers, and AT&T owns or has agreements to acquire cable systems with 16 million customers, though it plans to sell some systems.
For Excite@Home, the potentially unsettling implications of such an arrangement became evident about two weeks ago, when its board convened just before the company staged its first conference for financial analysts since the merger in May of the At Home Corporation and Excite Inc.
C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chairman and an Excite@Home director, voiced concern that At Home's use of cable modems to link consumers to the Internet might not be a great strategic fit with Excite's Web portal service, according to a person at the meeting. Mr. Armstrong, arguing from the strength of AT&T's 58 percent voting stake in Excite@Home, said that it might make more sense for At Home to focus on delivering high-speed communications links, while exploring a sale or spin-off of Excite's Web content business, according to this person.
Mr. Armstrong's view is anathema to the Excite@Home management team and to the venture capitalists from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers who helped build the former At Home. They contend that the company cannot thrive as simply a "dumb pipe." Instead, they want to leverage the communications system built by At Home to provide a rich information and entertainment package offered by the combined Excite@Home that would directly compete with America Online -- from the customer's mouse to the farthest reaches of the Web.
"Our job is to execute, so we have as many users as possible and have built as strong as possible a brand relationship with them so that those people are loyal Excite@Home customers," Thomas A. Jermoluk, Excite@Home's chairman, said.
But AT&T has said it does not want to be in the so-called content business. And even though Excite@Home has built an extensive network and has signed up more than 600,000 cable modem customers across the country, in the grand scheme of the communications business, AT&T does not really need Excite@Home.
The former At Home's early cable partners -- which included Tele-Communications Inc., the cable giant now owned by AT&T -- invested shortly after At Home was founded in 1995 to develop systems for delivering Internet data at high speed over cable wires.
In exchange for At Home's developing the technology and related Web content, the cable companies contributed money and granted At Home exclusive deals for the Internet-access rights to their systems, generally for seven years.
At AT&T, it was only after Mr. Armstrong created management stability by taking over as chairman in 1997 that the company seemed to develop a coherent long-term plan, one meant to reassert its primacy in the communications business, especially with residential consumers. Stymied in its attempts to merge with the regional Bell company SBC Communications Inc. and unsatisfied with leasing local telephone access from phone companies, AT&T began unspooling its cable strategy.
Last summer AT&T announced its $31.8 billion deal to acquire TCI and later agreed to acquire Mediaone Group Inc. for another $58 billion. By acquiring TCI, AT&T inherited not only the largest stake in At Home but also the agreement to give At Home exclusive Internet use of its cable systems into the next decade.
By the time AT&T completed its acquisition of TCI this year, At Home had already agreed to acquire Excite, the big Web portal service. From At Home's perspective, adding Excite's Web content would let the company offer a full package of services to compete against America Online.
But from AT&T's perspective, the Excite acquisition, coupled with the existing At Home exclusivity arrangement, seemed to pose yet another strategic restraint, according to people close to the company.
For AT&T, the main enemy is not America Online -- as it is for Excite@Home. Instead, AT&T's main competition is posed by the Baby Bell local phone giants.
A prime motive for AT&T's entering the cable business was that the Bells are intent on getting into the long-distance phone business and eviscerating AT&T. At the same time, the Bells are belatedly deploying a high-speed Internet technology for telephone networks called digital subscriber line, or D.S.L. As a counter force, AT&T wants to use its cable lines to deliver local phone service, as well as long-distance, digital TV and high-speed Internet access.
That is where America Online comes in. Its 18 million customers give the company a far bigger market share than any other Internet provider and a clientele that is presumably in a better position to appreciate the benefits of a high-speed service than people who have not yet ventured on line.
To AT&T, therefore, a deal with America Online might seem a good way to increase penetration of cable modem service. And once customers took AT&T cable television service and some sort of AT&T cable modem service, that might make them a much easier prospect for the big-money local and long-distance phone services that will travel over those same cables.
For its part, Excite@Home contends that greater market penetration is not an issue because the pent-up demand for cable Internet service already exceeds the supply of Internet-ready cable systems. "We're a long way from being a demand-limited system," Mr. Jermoluk said. "We have 38 million registered Excite users. You think we have any problem generating demand?"
In any case, from America Online's perspective, it may make sense to cut a deal with AT&T, rather than to continue waging a political war that might drive AT&T into a wholehearted commitment to the full-service concept of Excite@Home.
Analysts say it is highly unlikely that AT&T and American Online could strike a major deal until Excite@Home's exclusivity pact expires. And unless that exclusive arrangement is overturned by the courts before then, AT&T cable customers will probably still have to pay $9.95 a month if they want cable-modem access to America Online -- on top of the $40 cable-modem customers generally pay for Excite@Home, 65 percent of which goes to the cable partner.
For America Online to work cooperatively with AT&T while it is still under obligation to Excite@Home, all parties would probably have to accept less money from each customer.
And after Excite@Home's exclusivity pact with AT&T runs out? It would be foolish for AT&T to totally turn its back on the national Internet network that At Home developed and to forswear use of At Home's technology for managing local networks. And for America Online, it might make economic sense to lease access to that technology, rather than spend money duplicating it all.
The issue, in the end, is content -- whether AT&T cable-modem customers will get America Online's gateway to chat rooms, E-mail, E-commerce, news and information or use the Excite@Home-brand portal to many of the same kinds of offerings out on the Web.
It is the portal piece of the network where the Excite content business could end up perhaps the biggest loser in this battle for cable access. In the end, even Mr. Jermoluk of Excite@Home may have little choice but to go along with whatever course the AT&T chairman, Michael Armstrong, sets.
"Mike's goal is to maximize the total number of subscribers on his system by whatever means at his disposal," Mr. Jermoluk said. "The only way we have to win is to make AT&T successful doing what it is that they're doing."

GRAPHIC: Charts: "Piecing Together a Network"
Customers who want cable-modem Internet access on AT&T's cable systems must now take a package of services from AT&T and Excite@Home, in which AT&T is a shareholder. But America Online argues that it should have direct access to AT&T's cable customers, bypassing the other pieces of the AT&T-Excite@Home system. (pg. C1)
 
"Drawing the Line"
AT&T and America Online are fighting over where and how America Online will get access to AT&T's cable systems. On the surface, each company has very different ideas about what should be done. But, the companies may settle their differences and come up with a compromise suitable to both.
 
AT&T's VIEW
America Online wants to plug into AT&T's cable systems directly, without having to use the routing and management services provided by Excite@Home. America Online argues that because it already is an Internet service provider, it does not need Excite@Home and that forcing it to use Excite@Home is anticompetitive.
 
AMERICA ONLINE'S VIEW
As the owner of the cable systems and with its sizable stake in Excite@Home, a company that provides high-speed Internet connections as well as Internet content, AT&T argues that America Online should have the same access to its customers as any other Internet content provider.
 
POSSIBLE COMPROMISE
In the end, AT&T may not cave in to America Online's demand for direct access to cable customers. But, America Online's unmatched brand power on the Internet, and its universe of 18 million subscribers, may entice AT&T to offer America Online the right to serve as the portal through which cable customers connect to the Internet, instead of the Excite@Home portal.

HEADLINE: Ambassador Nominations Seen as 'Demolition Derby'

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The long-drawn-out approval of Richard C. Holbrooke as the chief American delegate to the United Nations has focused fresh attention on a process of picking ambassadors that is increasingly mired in bureaucratic delays and political infighting.
The delays of a year or more that often attend the filling of important diplomatic posts are threatening to drive away some of the nation's most talented diplomats, Administration and Congressional officials as well as outside experts say. 
 It is a process that has come to pit career diplomats against political donors for posts abroad, and one that holds nominees hostage to the Senate in exchange for demands on the White House that often have nothing to do with the qualifications of the envoys themselves.
"The nominating process is becoming a demolition derby," said Marshall P. Adair, a diplomat of 27 years' experience who is president of the American Foreign Service Association, which represents the Government's 15,000 Foreign Service officers. "If you create a perpetual system that subjects people to abuse, you'll lower their incentive to stay."
Battles over judicial nominations have seized attention in recent years, but the long fight over the nomination of Mr. Holbrooke, who was approved on Thursday, is the latest in a string of contested diplomatic postings.
William F. Weld, the former Governor of Massachusetts, withdrew his nomination as ambassador to Mexico two years ago after a fight with fellow Republicans in the Senate, including Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the strong-willed chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
J. Brian Atwood, the departing director of the Agency for International Development, pulled the plug on his nomination to be ambassador to Brazil in May after clashing with Mr. Helms over the Senator's plan to merge the agency into the State Department.
In June, President Clinton resorted to a rarely used executive privilege when he appointed James Hormel as Ambassador to Luxembourg, making him the country's first gay envoy. Senate conservatives, led by the majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, had blocked a vote in the Senate.
The White House and the Republican-controlled Senate blame each other for the diplomatic mire. But career diplomats and scholars say both are at fault, in part because most ambassador nominations are no longer treated very seriously.
"In this post-cold-war period, most ambassador nominations are just not a high priority to Congress, so they can fall victim to other agendas," said Marshall Wittman, director of Congressional affairs for the Heritage Foundation.
The vote on Mr. Holbrooke's nomination was made possible only after the last of four Senate Republicans exercising a senatorial privilege relinquished a "hold" on the nomination. But that Senator, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, simply shifted his hold to three other pending ambassador nominees: A. Peter Burleigh to the Philippines, Carl Spielvogel to Slovakia and J. Richard Fredericks to Switzerland.
Senator Grassley has said he is holding up the nominations over the State Department's transfer of an employee he regards as whistle-blower who exposed mismanagement. The State Department denies that the employee, Linda Shenwick, is being punished.
"We have lost our sense of proportion," an exasperated Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, declared on the Senate floor this week.
Mr. Burleigh is a career diplomat who has been filling in for Mr. Holbrooke at the United Nations. Mr. Spielvogel and Mr. Fredericks are both large donors to the Democratic Party.
Democrats are quick to blame Mr. Helms as the root of most nomination problems. But from 1997 to 1998, the panel approved 90 percent of the 209 nominations referred by the Administration.
Mr. Holbrooke and Mr. Hormel won approval from the Helms committee. On the other hand, Mr. Atwood and Mr. Weld openly antagonized Mr. Helms, sealing their fate.
"The vast majority of nominations go through, but occasionally we make a strategic decision to hold one up if the Administration is not enforcing the law or up to some other kind of mischief," said Marc A. Thiessen, a spokesman for the Foreign Relations Committee.
The committee, for instance, has told the State Department that its ambassador nominations will move along quicker if it applies sanctions against a Spanish hotel chain, Sol Melia, for doing business in Cuba with American property expropriated by the Government of President Fidel Castro, in violation of the Helms-Burton law.
But career diplomats say the Administration, perhaps anticipating more grueling fights with the Senate, is now deliberating, some say cowering, over nominations.
Ambassadorships in Brazil, Argentina and China are all vacant now, although all are likely to go to political appointees, people who have typically served or donated heavily to the Democratic Party. Roughly one-third of the 150 ambassador and chiefs-of-mission posts are now held by political appointees as opposed to career diplomats, higher than the ratio in the Bush Administration but down from the Reagan Administration, Mr. Adair said.
Problems have cropped up with some of these political appointees, suggesting a lack of proper vetting, Senate Republican aides say. Before leaving for the summer recess this week, the Foreign Relations Committee sent back to the White House Mr. Clinton's choice as ambassador to Argentina, Hassan Nemazee, a New York investor and large donor to the Democratic Party.
Republicans and even many Democrats on the committee challenged the qualifications of Mr. Nemazee, who has succeeded as an entrepreneur but has no diplomatic experience. A top Democratic aide said the procedural move was a polite way of telling the White House he did not have a chance of being approved.
In another apparent stumble, the National Security Council let it be known in May that Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, a retired commander of American forces in the Pacific, was Mr. Clinton's choice to be ambassador to China. But the council leaked this information before asking Beijing if it would accept the admiral. The White House has not yet formally nominated him.

HEADLINE: The New Affirmative Action Fight

 BODY:
Three years ago California voters approved Proposition 209, a retrograde measure that ended affirmative action programs in public college admissions and in government hiring and contracts. The rationale was that minorities should not be given any special preferences but should instead compete on an equal footing with others. But now a new lawsuit has made it clear how badly that stacks the deck against outstanding minority students in California. Worse yet, a renewed political drive against racial preferences in California could make it virtually impossible even to inform minorities of the opportunities available to them.
The lawsuit, brought against the state by the American Civil Liberties Union, charges that students at black and Hispanic high schools have little or no chance to take the challenging courses that would help get them admitted to California's first-tier public universities. The suit focuses on the advanced-placement courses that are designed to give students exposure to college-level work while still in high school. These courses end with an examination administered by the College Board, which costs about $75 per student. Many states view the exams as so important that they waive the fees for the poorest students. 
 The examinations are especially crucial in California, where the elite universities figure the scores into the admissions formula. As noted in the A.C.L.U. suit, black and Hispanic students often attend schools where the courses are few or nonexistent or where no one bothers to tell them that they can take the examinations at little or no cost.
The suit was filed on behalf of four black and Hispanic students at Inglewood High School, which offers only three advanced-placement courses. Inglewood is 97 percent black. Beverly Hills High, which is 91 percent white, offers 14 advanced-placement courses. Rasheda Daniel, a 17-year-old straight-A student at Inglewood, said: "I feel cheated. There are a lot of bright students at my school who will work hard and succeed, if only they had the A.P. courses to prove it."
Meanwhile, the anti-affirmative action camp in California is trying to twist the meaning of Proposition 209 to ban outreach and recruitment efforts that merely encourage minorities and women to compete for jobs, contracts and college slots. This pernicious attack, if successful, would take away a crucial remaining tool to remedy the lingering effects of racial and gender discrimination.
Legal cases challenging the constitutionality of outreach programs are working their way through the California courts. Gov. Gray Davis, who was an opponent of Proposition 209, recently vetoed a bill passed by the California Legislature declaring that focused outreach to underrepresented groups is legal. To the anger of civil rights groups, he has also refused to revoke a policy, initiated by former Gov. Pete Wilson, that ended state data collection on whether minority contractors are getting any share of the billions of dollars of government contracts that are given annually. Without good data, the state cannot know whether its agencies are discriminating against minority and women-owned companies.
The challenge to outreach programs is an ominous sign of where the race debate is headed. Until now, opponents of affirmative action have tended to attack quotas and set-asides, not outreach efforts. Efforts such as community campaigns to increase awareness of college or job opportunities do not give minorities any advantage in the final selection process or in any way lower objective standards. They only aim to broaden the applicant pools.
Mr. Davis apparently believes that diversity in the workplace and on college campuses can be achieved solely through outreach programs based on nonracial characteristics like economic status or geographic residence. But the legacy of racial discrimination is not fully accounted for by measuring qualities like economic status. The anti-affirmative action forces sold their position to California voters as simple fairness for all. But the attack on outreach programs looks like an attempt to deny minorities and women the very information they need to compete fairly.

HEADLINE: Muzzling Dissent in Iran

 BODY:
Iran's conservative mullahs have silenced the student protest movement that surged through the streets of Teheran last month and are now moving against its leaders with arrests and threats of long imprisonment. By using the clerically controlled courts and police to intimidate supporters of Iran's reform-minded President, Mohammad Khatami, religious conservatives hope to strengthen their own authority within Iran's divided power structure and undermine reform candidates in parliamentary elections early next year.
The mullahs should remember that Mr. Khatami and his allies speak for tens of millions of Iranians impatient to see less oppressive, more accountable government. That was the platform they voted for when they overwhelmingly elected Mr. Khatami two years ago over a candidate favored by the clerical establishment. That was also the demand of last month's student protests, which drew broad public support. 
 Adding to the pressures for change, Iran's economy is badly hurting. Depressed international oil prices, skittish foreign investors and years of economic mismanagement have brought hardship to poor and middle-class Iranians and sharpened criticism of clerical rule.
More than 200 students are still in jail as a result of the July demonstrations. Officials have denounced four student leaders for counterrevolutionary activities and collaboration with Israel and the United States. Those charges could carry a death penalty. Three of the four have been shown making televised confessions, almost certainly under duress. Non-student activists have also been seized, reform newspapers shut down and top editors arrested.
Under Iran's Constitution, President Khatami's power is limited. The religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, holds supreme authority. But if next year's parliamentary elections produce a majority supporting reform, Mr. Khatami will exercise greater authority over Government ministries and have more scope to expand the rule of law and revive the economy. If Ayatollah Khamenei is wise, he will support such a course, recognizing that Iran's Islamic republic must modernize to survive.
But to keep this path to peaceful reform open, clerical leaders must allow Iranians to choose freely and without fear in the coming elections, informed by an unshackled press. With Iran's economy sinking, its voters demanding reform and its young people clamoring for increased personal freedom, inflexible clerical resistance to change could provoke social and political upheaval.

HEADLINE: At Camp for Migrants, The Living Isn't Easy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WESTOVER, Md., Aug. 3

 BODY:
They call it Camp Somerset, and each July it springs to life, filling with 700 people. But despite the pickup soccer game each evening, it should not be mistaken for a summer camp.
Far from it. Camp Somerset, a former prisoner-of-war camp, is now a camp for migrant workers. The long corrugated steel buildings from the 1940's, when hundreds of German soldiers were detained here, are now packed with migrants, who squeeze in two's, three's and four's into cramped, sweltering rooms. 
 Every summer, hundreds of Mexicans and Guatemalans make a 20-hour bus trip from their home base in Florida to Camp Somerset, where they stay for a month in the harvest season to pick tomatoes -- some days for more than the minimum wage, some days for less. The camp, 30 miles inland from the luxury beach communities on the Maryland shore, is one of the biggest labor camps on the Eastern Seaboard.
Some migrants, many of them illegal immigrants who come here to work and then travel to other parts of the country, put together a few hundred dollars in extra cash each month to send back home. Others come to take their chances in the United States and, if lucky, save enough to buy a 10-year-old pickup truck, a symbol of success in the migrant pecking order.
Like most of the workers, Alfonso Ortega, a 20-year-old from Veracruz, Mexico, is not enthusiastic about the camp, although he loves one aspect of life here: it is rent free.
"We don't like all the trash that's around -- it stinks," Mr. Ortega said as a breeze wafted a most unwelcome odor from the overflowing Dumpster some 25 yards from his room. Large garbage bins dot the camp, a collection of 20 buildings hidden from the main road by hundreds of trees.
The odor aside, Mr. Ortega is not bitter about his life in the United States. "You know, in Mexico we're needy," he said. "The wages are much worse. We're trying to make a better future. I'm very thankful for the two years here because I've been able to earn money and take care of my mother and brother."
He tries to telegraph money home every three weeks, he said. His biggest complaint was that he had paid a smuggler $500 to take him to the United States, but the smuggler deceived him and dumped him just south of the border.
"So I was a wetback," Mr. Ortega said with an awkward grin, describing his trip across the Rio Grande.
By 9 in the evening his roommate was asleep, tired from a long day (the work days are sometimes as long as 12 hours) and from having woken at 5 A.M. to make tortillas, the staple of Mexican meals. Their room, a 10- by 11-foot square, has two beds, a cast-iron hot plate, two beat-up fans, an aging green Hotpoint refrigerator, several comic-book novels and a picture of the Virgin Mary. As in many rooms in the camp, a plastic mattress cover -- required to help keep the mattresses sanitary -- is being used as a curtain to keep out the sun.
Despite its temporary nature, Camp Somerset has a distinct social pyramid. On top are the crew leaders, who herd 30 or so workers to the fields each morning. They drive gleaming, new, oversized wide-body pickup trucks, almost twice as long as regular pickups.
Below the crew leaders is a small group of swaggering pickers who are not here to send money home so much as to patch together a life style of fancy boots, silver belts and expensive beer. Next comes the largest stratum: the hard workers like Mr. Ortega, who keep their heads down and send home as much money as they can.
At the bottom are aging workers, often in their 50's, often somewhat broken after years of hard manual labor. They are usually unable to save money to send home, and they sometimes bury their problems in drink.
Mr. Ortega, who dreams of becoming a construction worker in Florida, is known as a hard worker, sometimes picking 160 buckets of tomatoes in eight hours in the field. At the piece rate of 45 cents a bucket, that comes to $72 before taxes, an excellent daily haul for a migrant. But some days, when the fields are stingy, the pickers end up picking just 80 buckets and earning just $36.
Several workers complained that on some days there is no work and on other days there is just three hours of picking. One day Mr. Ortega worked only three hours laying black plastic sheeting to protect the tomatoes.
"We just got paid $10, $15 that day," Mr. Ortega said, less than the $5.15 an hour minimum wage. Several workers also grumbled that they were not paid for the three or four hours spent each day being shuttled to the tomato fields by their crew leaders.
Dennett Butler, president of the Somerset Country Growers Association, said the tomato companies made sure to raise each worker's wages to $5.15 an hour when the piece rate left their pay below the minimum wage.
Camp Somerset's residents give the camp mixed reviews, although many acknowledge that the conditions are often better than in the trailers they rent in Florida. While leaning on his scratched, rusting Dodge Ram truck, Alberto Lara, a sleek, muscular tomato picker, said: "Look, the camp is good. It's free. We're here only a short time. And there are a lot of nice people."
But Orbelio Martinez, a pencil-thin 49-year-old, said there was little to rave about. "It's bad here -- the bed, the stove, the water," he said of his freshly painted, stultifyingly hot room. "It's not good when you get to the shower. The hot water is cold."
Mr. Martinez also complained about being squeezed four to a room. "They drink, they get up early, it's hard to sleep," he said.
Mr. Butler, the growers' leader, said the camp was much better than it was in the days when it housed German prisoners. "It's adequate for the time that we use it," he said, "which is four to six weeks a year. We provide all the necessary things that are required by Federal, state and local standards: shower rooms, dishwashing rooms, smoke detectors, trash removal."
In the 1980's the growers who own and run Camp Somerset renovated much of it, enlarging the windows. More recently, new shower rooms were added and the number of water heaters was tripled. But Mr. Butler acknowledged that it was hard to provide enough hot water for 700 workers who return from work at the same time, adding that the workers had made it even harder by removing the water-conserving shower nozzles.
"We try to supply everything necessary, and we do it free of charge," Mr. Butler said. "I recognize it's not like year-round housing. It wasn't designed for that."
David Roberts, who helps oversee migrant housing for the Maryland Department of Health, said the camp was inspected before and during each season. The department tells the growers the maximum number of people who can live in each room, he said, but he acknowledged that workers sometimes squeezed in an extra friend.
After weeks of picking tomatoes, some workers grow frustrated about saving so little, about sweltering in rooms without air conditioning and about never swimming at the beaches they pass on the way to the fields.
"We just want to live and be treated like Americans," said Jumaro Zarate, 50, a worker from Guerrero State in Mexico. "We have brains like Americans. We have skins like Americans, maybe a little darker. But we don't want to be treated like dogs."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Nassau G.O.P. Unruffled Despite All the Red Ink

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., Aug. 6

 BODY:
Nassau County's financial problems get deeper every day. But somehow the Republicans who run the county government do not seem to be all that troubled.
They ran up a staggering $300 million deficit on the current budget of $2.1 billion, then reasoned that a surplus would have been worse because it would have meant that residents had been overtaxed. The rich and economically booming county's bond rating sank to near junk level, and they noted that Nassau could still borrow plenty of money, albeit at a much stiffer price. 
 During the drive to pass a new state budget in Albany this week, Nassau's Republican leaders persuaded the tax-cut-minded Governor and State Senate to force a new countywide property-transfer tax through the State Assembly, costing anyone selling property $1,000 for every $100,000 in the price. Nassau Democrats got none of the fiscal oversight measures they had demanded in return.
Yet anyone expecting Republicans here to be on the defensive would be mistaken.
The County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, spent an hour this afternoon discussing the county's financial predicament in an interview, but never acknowledged any responsibility for having created it.
He attributed the deficit to a series of one-shot measures that he had counted on to produce enough revenue to avert property-tax increases -- but by happenstance, he said, the revenue was late in materializing.
Without exactly saying that his reliance on those revenues had been unwise, he promised to "restore structural integrity" to the county's finances as soon as he issued his budget for 2000 this fall, and to see that recurring expenditures (like salaries and supplies) were paid for with recurring revenues (like taxes and fees) -- a step that bond-rating agencies have demanded for years.
But in the same breath, Mr. Gulotta raised doubt about how much he was promising to fix, and how soon. "We may be talking about a budget that laps over into a two-year fiscal plan," he said. And then, he added: "For the most part -- I can't say to you without any exception, because I don't want to mislead anybody -- but for the most part, recurring expenditures are going to be offset by recurring revenues."
Mr. Gulotta need not hurry. It became clear this week that, despite signs that Nassau Democrats were becoming more aggressive under the new county Democratic leader, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, Republicans still could easily outmaneuver the Nassau Democrats, at least in Albany, where financial rescues come from.
Mr. DiNapoli had demanded strict oversight as a price for the new Nassau transfer tax. He hoped the state would create some entity with the power to force Mr. Gulotta to revise his budget proposals, which have frequently overestimated revenues and underestimated expenses. But the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, wound up accepting a Republican proposal for a three-member panel of state and county officials that could issue unpleasant reports about Mr. Gulotta's budgets, but do little more.
Knowing that the same three state and county officials, independently, had repeatedly issued unpleasant reports that Mr. Gulotta had not heeded, Mr. DiNapoli was unenthusiastic. He insisted that the Republican advisory panel accepted by Mr. Silver be dropped from the legislation, and then, along with other Nassau Democrats, voted against the budget package anyway.
Back on Long Island today, Mr. DiNapoli was left to look on encouragingly at a news conference as the four Democrats in the County Legislature proposed a strong fiscal oversight board, then called on the Legislature's 15 Republicans to do the unthinkable and approve it. As if gaining Republican support were not enough of an obstacle, the Democrats pointed out, almost as an afterthought, that this latest oversight proposal would also require a countywide referendum.
Not that Republicans were going to let the Democrats' futile exercise go unnoticed. Bruce A. Blakeman, the presiding officer of the Legislature, called the Democratic proposals "a political cover-up for DiNapoli's inability to get state legislation which would improve the budgetary process in Nassau County."
Was he saying that Mr. DiNapoli's proposals would have been good for the county? "Legislation which could have been done on a bipartisan basis," Mr. Blakeman added, making it clear that he simply meant Mr. DiNapoli should have acceded to the weaker Republican proposal.
Mr. Blakeman, too, is proposing changes to improve the county's budgetary process. But his ideas only go so far as requiring the County Executive's budgets to look three years ahead instead of just one, and creating a blue-ribbon panel that would be able only to recommend changes in Mr. Gulotta's budgets.
Mr. DiNapoli said such a panel would be worthless, but he acknowledged that Democrats were powerless to achieve anything stronger. Still, he maintained, without strict oversight, Mr. Gulotta would only make the county's financial problems worse.
And eventually, Mr. DiNapoli said, that will catch up with the Republicans, or at least with Mr. Gulotta -- if not in November, when all 19 seats in the County Legislature are up for election, then perhaps in 2001. "That's when the new transfer tax expires," he said. "And that's when the County Executive is up for re-election. I don't think he's even going to be able to get the nomination without a fight this time. We're going to have the highest sales tax in the region. And this new transfer tax is going to hit the little guys, who are the backbone of the county. And it's going to hit the big guys, the developers and corporations, who are the backbone of the Republican Party.
"My hope is that people are not going to be asleep anymore," he said, "that they'll recognize that the current system rips off taxpayers."

HEADLINE: Unusual Mix of Political Methods Shapes Mrs. Clinton's Tour

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
With her fifth "listening tour" in New York State set to begin this morning in a Baptist church in Brooklyn, Hillary Rodham Clinton's all-but-announced bid for the United States Senate has evolved into a curious hybrid of pure politics and unorthodox campaign techniques.
The contrasts are remarkable. Mrs. Clinton's trips through the state resemble a full-throttle, high-stakes campaign tour in the final weeks of a frenzied campaign, though the election is more than a year away. As she travels through towns large and small, she tows along a press corps of more than 50 journalists, some from far outside the state, as she pulls out throngs of ordinary citizens along the routes of her motorcade who wait just to get a glimpse of the First Lady. 
 Her travels through the state have also produced many less-visible but still critical stops for any candidate hoping to win a statewide election. For example, her trip last week through western New York, as in her previous tours, included private meetings with scores of local elected officials, party leaders and influential citizens.
She met on Friday with B. Thomas Golisano, a Rochester businessman and leader of the Ross Perot-inspired Independence Party in New York, to seek his support. At private receptions in Buffalo, she met with local ministers, Democratic City Council members and party foot soldiers.
On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton's trips are anything but politics as usual. Her most public appearances -- the listening sessions themselves -- are carefully choreographed events whose participants are handpicked, with name cards on the chairs they are supposed to sit in.
Each session is held at a distinct venue -- an aerospace component plant in Binghamton, a school for performing arts in Rochester -- and centers on one theme, from school violence to economic concerns.
The sessions typically feature a panel of five or six speakers seated in front of the audience, with Mrs. Clinton holding forth in the center, like a talk-show host.
Often the audience consists of notable citizens of the city -- top officials of the Rochester school system were invited to a session last week, for example. But there are also ordinary citizens, like plant workers, ministers, students and teachers.
Mrs. Clinton prods the program along, asking questions of panelists and then asking audience members for their thoughts. The events are utterly without discord, with no one asking confrontational questions.
Mrs. Clinton's aides maintain that the First Lady's exploratory committee has little to no involvement in selecting the participants. In fact, they contend, a combination of local civic leaders, political officials, business and educational leaders and the hosts of the meeting site select the audience.
The sessions, presenting Mrs. Clinton as an eager listener, are structured in a way that she can comfortably avoid discussing any topic she chooses. And in some cases, she will simply tell the questioner of her appreciation for any opinion expressed. At one session, for example, a questioner asked why the western part of the state lagged behind the rest of the country in economic performance. Mrs. Clinton's reply contained far more sympathy than specificity.
"If I were you, I would be frustrated, too," she said. "If you look at upstate New York and compare it to the upper Midwest and New England, you have comparable climates, comparable work forces and industrial base that went through a very difficult transition in the 1980's. But those parts of the country are doing better than upstate New York is. So I have to ask myself, what is not happening here that should happen and what should be done in government?"
At a comparable period in the 1998 Senate race, the candidates were scrambling to get media attention, seeking one-on-one interviews with reporters. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton's interaction with the news media is still distant and occasional: she invited reporters' questions only twice during last week's three-day swing through western New York.
In this respect, Mrs. Clinton freely expounds on whatever themes she likes, like the need for expanded arts programs for students. Twice last week, Mrs. Clinton condemned the tax-cut package passed by Congress, specifically assailing its impact on education funds for New York State.
At the same time, Mrs. Clinton is displaying her increased knowledge of local issues along the route of her tour, rattling off, for example, the names of local roads that have become interstate highways and the impact of high electric rates on western New York businesses.
"We've got all the resources that are needed," she said, opening a session in Jamestown last week on the difficulties facing the economy upstate.
"But we've got some obstacles and problems and challenges, and I want to hear all about those. I have heard so much in the last week about air fare costs. I am pleased that Route 17 is about to become an interstate. But we have to be very sure that the funding is there to make it absolutely a reality and not just a change in designation. The state and local tax burden is among the highest in the country," she added, before entering into a critique of the amount New York State pays in Federal taxes.
"It's clear that she has really done her homework and is listening hard," said Sandra L. Frankel, the supervisor of the town of Brighton, N.Y., just outside Rochester. "She speaks with a great deal of knowledge about the issues affecting our part of the state, such as the fact that we have some of the highest air fares in the country and the impact that has on our business community."
What is also clear in nearly every stop along the "listening tour" is that Mrs. Clinton evokes strong passions from admirers and detractors alike. At a community center in Buffalo, for example, Mrs. Clinton was the object of competing camps of protesters and supporters, each with about a dozen people standing along the sidewalk. Some yelled, "Hillary go home," with others chanting, "Leave Hillary alone."
In one event last week, at a furniture manufacturing plant in Jamestown, Mrs. Clinton faced her harshest question of the week, from a woman who criticized the Clinton Administration's championing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. After hearing criticism of how the agreement had taken jobs away from western New York, Mrs. Clinton offered only a quick "thank you very much."
Philip A. Klinkner, associate professor of government and director of the Arthur Levitt Public Affairs Center at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., said: "Most of the people who attend these things are generally fellow believers and, regardless of what they think about Hillary Clinton, are inclined to be extremely polite. The last thing she wants is someone grilling her about Whitewater or something that would be embarrassing."
Mr. Klinkner, who attended a recent listening session in central New York, said Mrs. Clinton seemed to be focused on "raising the comfort level of people in different parts of the state with the idea of her candidacy, particularly in upstate New York."
There are people, he added, who are "going to be bothered by the carpetbagger issue, and she is trying to minimize the number of people who would be bothered by that."
It is uncertain how many more listening tours Mrs. Clinton will undertake, and she shed little light on the subject when asked about it in Rochester on Friday.
"I'm having a really good time doing this," she said. "I intend to continue it for some time. There will be different formats, different settings. I've gotten a lot of very good ideas that I will be exploring. So, I hope that I can continue it for the foreseeable future."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Giving More, Getting Less In Tax Game

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON has stopped listening long enough to address one of New York State's most expensive problems: the Federal Government. In a typical year, it collects $15 billion more in taxes from New Yorkers than it sends back to the state.
"We sure ought to get more than we're getting now," Mrs. Clinton said in Jamestown last week, adopting a liberal interpretation of the word "we." Strictly speaking, she is a resident of Arkansas, which gets more back from Washington than it pays in taxes. But as a prospective New Yorker, she vowed to redress the imbalance. 
 "Were I in the Senate," she said, "I would try to create a coalition of the big states to stand up for our interests."
Mrs. Clinton, though, was not interested in working with a coalition in Congress that is already standing up for New Yorkers' financial interests. It is called the Republican Party. The nearly $800 billion in tax cuts just passed by the Republicans can be criticized on many grounds -- as giveaways to the rich, as payoffs for campaign contributions -- but there is no question that the cuts would be a boon to New York.
The New York metropolitan area would benefit more than any other region because so many of the city's residents and commuters are in high tax brackets. The Commerce Department reports that Connecticut has the highest per-capita income of any state, $37,598; New Jersey ($33,937) is second and New York ($31,734) is fourth (just behind Massachusetts, $32,797).
Some local taxpayers are comfortably rich, but many are struggling with an inequity in the system. Because the Internal Revenue Service sets tax brackets without adjusting for local variations in living costs, middle-class New Yorkers get stuck in upper-class tax brackets.
A family in the New York metropolitan area making $100,000 per year is no richer than a family in Little Rock making $40,000, according to the cost of living index. But that New York family typically pays about $15,000 to the I.R.S., while the Little Rock family pays only $4,000.
And then Congress redirects some of the New Yorkers' money to farmers, defense contractors, bureaucrats and assorted beneficiaries in other states. Studies by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan have shown the New York region and the Midwest have been the big losers in the redistribution of taxes.
Over the last two decades, the researchers found, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have together sent Washington $500 billion more than they've got back; a similar combined deficit has been incurred by Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. Last year's study found that Connecticut's annual tax deficit was $2,272 per person, the highest in the country. New Jersey ranked second with a per-capita deficit of $1,946, and New York ranked ninth with a per-capita deficit of $785.
THOSE deficits would be reduced if the Republicans' tax cuts took effect, but most local Democrats oppose them -- even Senator Moynihan, who has so meticulously documented New York's tax deficit.
"It's true that New York would get a larger share of the tax cuts," Mr. Moynihan said, "because we have more people in the higher tax brackets. But I'm afraid the tax cuts would drive the Federal Government back into deficit spending. If we can keep reducing the national debt, the economy will be much better off, and that just has to be good for New York."
That's a plausible argument if you believe that the choice is between a tax cut and debt reduction. But there are those, like Martin Feldstein, the former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who argue that the choice is between cutting taxes and spending the money on new programs.
Mrs. Clinton has said that the Republican tax cuts would "damage most New Yorkers" because the money is needed to provide new benefits for the elderly and aid for schools. But if the past is any guide, the money would go disproportionately to people and schools in other states. No matter what kind of big-state coalition Mrs. Clinton creates, she will be outnumbered by the Senators from the many small states that profit from our tax dollars.
It is possible, of course, that Mrs. Clinton possesses such special skills at this game that she can throw our tax dollars into the pot and come out even. Maybe she will even return from Washington with a profit. And maybe then she can show New Yorkers how to win at three-card monte.

HEADLINE: Teddy Roosevelt Betrayed

BYLINE: By Susan Dunn; Susan Dunn is the co-author, with James MacGregor Burns, of the forthcoming "Three Roosevelts: Class Betrayal and Moral Leadership."

DATELINE: WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass.

 BODY:
When Theodore Roosevelt demanded that Congress pass a steeply graduated inheritance tax in 1906, he was proposing the one bill that members of his own patrician class feared most. In attacking what they cherished -- not just their money but also their sense of entitlement and superiority -- he was challenging the class system, not the capitalist system, turning the upper-class world upside down. As far as these plutocrats were concerned, T. R. had betrayed his own class to the point of no return.
As Republicans today seek an end to the inheritance tax, they are betraying the legacy of their great Republican President. 
 Roosevelt, the Oyster Bay patrician who used his inheritance to lead a life of public service rather than a life of leisure, always believed that the transmission of enormous wealth to young men "does not do them any real service and is of great and genuine detriment to the community at large."
What really mattered, he felt, was to have a national community based on citizens' political equality, relative economic equality and interdependence. Thus for Roosevelt, the inheritance tax was a moral issue as well as an economic one.
"If ever our people become so sordid as to feel that all that counts is moneyed prosperity, ignoble well-being, effortless ease and comfort," he warned, "then this nation shall perish, as it will deserve to perish, from the earth." Wealth, he declared, should only be "the foundation on which to build the real life, the life of spiritual and moral effort and achievement."
T. R.'s proposals met with no immediate success. But in hammering out his message in sermonizing speech after speech, he provoked a debate on inherited wealth and power and helped create a climate in which reform would eventually become possible. An inheritance tax became law in 1916, eight years after Roosevelt left office.
In 1935, Franklin Roosevelt took up the same crusade, striking out at great fortunes, again for moral as well as economic reasons. "The transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes by will, inheritance or gift," declared F. D. R., "is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people.
"Inherited economic power," he continued, "is as inconsistent with the ideals of this generation as inherited political power was inconsistent with the ideals of the generation which established our Government."
At the end of the century, we seem to be returning to the Gilded Age. And as Republicans in Congress seek to abolish the inheritance tax as well as weaken the progressive income tax, Americans are hearing no meaningful debate on taxing vast fortunes, no voices of moral outrage, no passionate reminders of the American ideal of equality.
Are there any politicians who can now honestly claim to follow the Roosevelt brand of leadership?

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
New England as Soothing Myth For a Nation That Wanted One

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Think of American beginnings, and what comes to mind? New England, probably, and with it a flood of associations. Pious Pilgrims and feisty Minutemen. Yankee farmers and Transcendentalist poets. Whaling ships and white-steepled churches with "their air of sparse, sincere rebellion," as the Boston-born poet Robert Lowell put it.
The trouble is, this New England never quite existed. For generations, its history has been imaginatively enhanced and sugar-coated by a nation in search of a foundation, by Americans anxious to trade a chaotic present for a reassuring past and by a tourist industry in the business of selling dreams. 
 That, at least, is the idea put forth by "Picturing Old New England: Image and Memory," a revisionist think piece of an exhibition, very 1990's in style, at the National Museum of American Art through Aug. 22. Part art history and part sociology, it proposes that Old New England was a fiction and that art helped to invent it, turning a chunk of surveyable American soil into a political symbol and a spiritual state of mind.
The show has problems. It squeezes complex artists and expansive ideas into a narrow thematic groove. And it is, on the whole, more stimulating to read about than to look at. But many of its insights are on target, and its topsy-turvy mix of highbrow and popular culture -- Winslow Homer seascapes and ski resort posters, John Singer Sargent portraits and faux-Colonial doilies -- is prickly and smart.
The period covered, from the end of the Civil War through World War II, was one of traumatic change. An agrarian past gave way to an industrial present. Science and religion came to mortal blows. An Anglo-Saxon ruling elite was confronted by waves of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and by a population of former slaves stranded by the failed Reconstruction.
Toward the end of the 19th century, the economy grew shaky. Labor unrest spread fears of class war. The suicide rate shot up; most cases were in the Northeast. George Miller Beard's "American Nervousness, Its Causes and Consequences," an 1881 study, attributed the plague of mental breakdowns to social change. The philosopher Charles Peirce referred to the Gilded Age as an "Age of Pain."
Where to turn for comfort and stability, for solid social ground (including ethnic homogeneity) and intact moral values? The exhibition's curators, William R. Truettner and Roger B. Stein, suggest that many Americans, artists included, looked to a never-never-land vision of Colonial New England, where the national saga began.
The show opens with an early episode from that saga in the form of George Henry Boughton's kitsch classic "Pilgrims Going to Church" (1867). The painting depicts a party of plainly dressed settlers filing through a woodland clearing in midwinter. Vulnerable to Indian attack but armed with prayer books and guns, they are emblems of courage and piety, imperiled but steadfast.
Puritan probity heats up to don't-tread-on-me Yankee belligerence in costume-drama illustrations of the Revolutionary War. "The Boston Boys and General Gage" (1875), by Henry Bacon, is one. Here, epicene redcoats (tight breeches, funny bouffant helmets) are confronted by a delegation of local ragamuffins who demand their right to play where they want, when they want, in this case on the Boston Common.
Boston may have been the Cradle of Liberty, but it was also an intensely Anglophiliac town. (It still is.) In his portraits of Back Bay blue bloods, Sargent emulated the 18th-century American style of John Singleton Copley. But he added a dash of Continental suavity and luxe to signal that his sitters were New World nobility, republican in practice, Loyalists at heart, with unbroken British cultural ties.
Gentility mixed with native vigor is the recipe for much of the work in the show. One finds it in Childe Hassam's Impressionist-style paintings of Colonial doorways. It's there in Daniel Chester French's dashing bronze "Concord Minute Man" (1875), modeled on the Apollo Belvedere. And it takes a particularly daffy form in an 1890's armchair made from spinning wheels, a nostalgic tribute to a craft that the New England textile industry had rendered obsolete.
With time, both the region and its image changed. As Massachusetts grew urban and crowded, artists looked north. Winslow Homer paved the way with his retreat to Maine, where he painted the sea and speculated in real estate. George Bellows worked on Monhegan Island; Rockwell Kent toughed out several winters there. Marsden Hartley, a Maine native and a hectic, restless soul, returned to the state repeatedly.
During the Depression, painters took the hard-pressed lives of farmers and fishermen as subjects, as in N. C. Wyeth's "Island Funeral" (1939), with its omniscient, fisheye-lens Emersonian view of life and death, sea and sky. Yet even Social Realism, a "people's" art, was scrupulously edited: little trace of a racially mixed, technologically advanced, ideologically dynamic American society -- the one that actually existed -- finds mention here.
Even the more adventurous modern artists seem in thrall to the New England spell. The factories in Charles Sheeler's paintings are color-coordinated and immaculate. Stuart Davis puts gas pumps in his views of Gloucester, but they are just part of a cheerily decorative nautical scheme. Hartley, who had deeply ambivalent feelings about his home state, painted still lifes of lobsters and gulls that might have been lifted from tourist brochures.
In the hands of certain immigrant painters, though, the picture darkens. Italian-born O. Louis Guglielmi gives a New Hampshire village a surreal, purgatorial cast: far from being quaint, it looks ominous, shut down, its buildings as stark as tombs.
The American black artist Jacob Lawrence touches on the region's real history in his Frederick Douglass series. It is one that included Abolitionism and racism, civic freedom and economic want: a contradictory assortment of goods and evils that no body of scholarship, never mind a single art exhibition, can hope to parse or explain.
Yet if one can ever really talk about "American" character traits, the compulsion to explain -- to make the world neat, to shave off what doesn't fit, to draw straight lines from here to there -- must be counted among them. It's a trait that generates a certain energy and gets things done, but often in oddly blinkered ways, as this exhibition demonstrates.
Because of its didactic theme, and despite its critical stance, "Picturing Old New England" is ultimately as dependent on a historical canon of mainstream art as many a more conservative show. During the period covered, a staggering amount of art of all kinds was produced by immigrants in New England, for their homes, churches and public buildings. But such material, still badly in need of research, gets little attention here.
The show's reductive approach also leads to some questionable conclusions. One wonders if New England, actual or invented, ever really held the central, formative role in the national consciousness that the show claims, or is that yet another myth? And one winces at occasionally myopic glosses on individual works.
To say, as the catalogue does, for example, that Frank W. Benson's "Summer" (1909), a bland painting of the artist's four daughters relaxing by the sea, "equates class with racial purity, with Anglo-Saxon bloodlines in danger of being thinned by waves of immigration" is to base a heavy (and fundamentally legitimate) argument on an example far too slender to support it. Suddenly, the whole theoretical basis of the show looks suspect.
But even with flaws, the exhibition works, and on the whole works extremely well. Its curatorial choices are sharp and often witty. There are hard truths at its conceptual core. It may not be the museum event you will want to mull over this summer as you try to power-down on a Cape Cod beach or bliss out in the Maine woods. But that's part of its point. America, it insists, is no vacation, no matter where you go.

HEADLINE: Plan for Holocaust-Era Insurance Claims

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
European insurance companies would pay about 10 times the face value of Holocaust-era insurance policies to the families of Jewish victims of Nazi Germany under a formula devised by Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the former Secretary of State and the chairman of a commission set up to help determine how the claims will be paid.
The decision takes into account requests for changes by the German insurance group Allianz and other companies after Mr. Eagleburger reached a tentative decision a week earlier. 
 It could clear the way for payment of claims beginning in October. Mr. Eagleburger settled on the formula as a way to assign "real value" to the policies by taking inflation and interest into account.
But Allianz, in a statement, said differences remained and that "we look forward to the coming meetings" of the commission in late August "to sort out the differences and move forward in a constructive and timely manner."
Mr. Eagleburger stepped in when the commission could not agree on a formula to determine current values for the policies.
Glenn Pomeroy, the North Dakota insurance commissioner who was involved for 16 months in seeking a consensus among insurance companies, Jewish groups and American state regulators, cautioned the companies not to pull out.
In a memorandum, Mr. Pomeroy said he had heard "speculation that some parties may consider leaving the commission" if they disagree with the decision. If they did, he said, state insurance commissioners might take actions against them.
The five insurance companies involved with the commission have set aside $100 million to pay claims.
Neal M. Sher, vice chairman of the commission, who was the chief prosecutor of ex-Nazis in the Justice Department, said, "The expectation now is that we will move forward and launch our worldwide effort to attract claimants and to pay legitimate claims." The commission will meet in London Sept. 22 and 23 to complete a program to locate victims and their families and arrange payments.
Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress and a member of the commission, said, "We accept the good faith judgment of Chairman Eagleburger and we will move forward to rapid payout of these policies."
But Nicholas Tewes, a spokesman for Allianz, said the compromise falls short. "What we are looking for must be acceptable to the public and also give other companies not on the commission the opportunity to join the arrangement," he said in a telephone interview from Munich. "I am not sure we have this."
Mr. Tewes said last week that all five European insurers were asking Mr. Eagleburger for revisions. "It would be a misunderstanding that the companies are only trying to save some money," he said. "The companies want to find a process that works and makes sense to the people who are waiting for the money."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Yields Near 2-Year Highs With Big Auctions Due

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond yields continued to move higher yesterday, approaching two-year highs.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 23/32, to 86 28/32, sending its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 6.23 percent, from 6.17 percent. Yesterday's yield was the highest since Nov. 4, 1997, when it was 6.24 percent. 
 Part of what is driving prices is rising anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its policy meeting on Aug. 24.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Burlingame, Calif., said yesterday that to avert an Aug. 24 tightening of rates, "we need to see quite a few things go the market's way."
Many people active in the bond market fear, however, that this week's economic reports on retail sales and producer prices will show stronger economic activity, adding to the Fed's incentive to raise rates.
Prices are also responding to fears of a glut on the market from the planned sale this week of $37 billion in the Government's quarterly sale and $3 billion in corporate debt.
Securities firms that have to bid on Treasuries at auction to maintain their primary-dealer status often sell Treasuries from their inventory to make room for the new issue, which can drive yields higher.
And underwriters of large corporate deals often sell Treasuries ahead of their sales as a hedge against rising rates. This week DaimlerChrysler is readying a $3 billion issue and Cox Communications is expected to do a $1.85 billion five-part deal.
Some bond traders say this week's events are likely to keep the pressure on the bond market and push the yield on the 30-year benchmark bond to more than 6.30 percent.
At yesterday's weekly bill auction, the three-month Treasury issue was awarded at an average rate of 4.790 percent, up from 4.695 percent last week. The six-month maturity was awarded at 4.915 percent, up from 4.75 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.776	97.515	High Rate	4.79%	4.91%	Coupon Yield	4.93%	5.12%	Low Rate	4.67%	4.81%	Median Rate	4.76%	4.88%	Total applied for	$26,195,839	$27,021,563	Accepted	$11,804,839	$12,289,063	Noncompetitive	$1,366,442	$1,235,708	

Both issues are dated Aug. 12, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 11, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 10, 2000.

HEADLINE: Sales by Wholesalers Rise 19%, Outpacing Growth in Inventory

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Sales rose faster for the nation's wholesalers in June than at any time in more than two years, outpacing a buildup in inventories, Government figures showed today.
Wholesale sales grew 1.9 percent, to $228.12 billion, in June -- the fifth consecutive increase and the greatest gain since January 1997, according to a report from the Commerce Department. 
 Wholesale inventories rose three-tenths of a percent, to $290.98 billion.
The report suggested that manufacturers "might have to pick up the pace" because demand "looks like it's going to stay strong," said Richard Yamarone, a senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York.
The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures the time that goods remain with wholesalers, fell in June, to 1.28 months from 1.3 months in May. The ratio was the lowest in June since July 1997, when it was also 1.28 months.
In May, sales rose 1.8 percent and inventories rose a revised two-tenths of a percent.
With incomes rising, consumer confidence near a three-decade high and unemployment at its lowest in 29 years, Americans are spending heavily. Retail sales grew 6.9 percent in July, giving retailers their strongest stretch of sales gains in at least a decade.
At Circuit City Group, the second-largest consumer electronics chain, sales at stores open at least a year rose 15 percent in July. At Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, sales increased 9.6 percent.
The wholesale trade data are the second part of Government reporting on June business inventories. Last week, the Commerce Department said factory inventories had fallen one-tenth of a percent in June. The department will report on retail stockpiles when it issues business inventory and sales data on Friday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
In Europe's Big Economies, New Signs of Brisk Growth

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 9

 BODY:
After a half-year of economic inertia, Continental Europe's three largest economies have begun to show clear signs of recovery, a result not just of a gradual strengthening in the emerging-market nations of Asia and Latin America, but of tentative changes aimed at making European economies more nimble.
Germany, France and, to a lesser degree, Italy have been reporting increased demand from abroad for goods and services for the first time since late 1998. In France and Germany, consumer spending is reinforcing a recovery. In Italy, the first fruits of Government fiscal austerity are evident, promising to help the country catch up with its northern neighbors. 
 The Continent's big nations had in recent months all but abdicated the role of economic engines to smaller, faster-growing economies on the European fringes like Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Lately, though, growth has been so vigorous throughout the region that Wim Duisenberg, the head of the European Central Bank, cautioned last month that an anti-inflationary bias was entering the monetary considerations of the bank.
Defending the new single currency, the euro, for which Mr. Duisenberg and his central bank colleagues are responsible, became an unexpected consideration through much of this year. The dismal performance of these core European economies, by comparison with that of the United States, caused the value of the euro to plummet by mid-July to a low of $1.0136 to the dollar from a starting value of $1.17, before beginning a modest recovery. The euro settled in New York today at $1.0712.
In size, the three European core economies easily outstrip those of neighboring nations. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany's gross domestic product in 1998 was equivalent to $2.14 trillion; France's totaled $1.43 trillion, and Italy's $1.17 trillion. (By comparison, Britain's output last year was $1.36 trillion. The United States economy, the world's largest by far, totaled $8.23 trillion.)
If there are risks to the new spurt of European growth, they are perhaps most evident in Italy, said J. Paul Horne, European equity market economist for Salomon Smith Barney. But even here, larger-than-expected Government surpluses in July prompted many economists to reduce their estimates of how big a percentage of economic output the budget deficit would be for 1999. In May, the Italian Government's upward revision of that estimate, to 2.4 percent from 2 percent, was a contributing factor in sending the euro's value down.
In Germany, manufacturers reported rising orders in June for a third consecutive month. Last month, a strong increase in a survey of retailers amounted to a confirmation of growing consumer confidence.
"The turnaround is definitely here," said Ralph Solveen, senior economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
Buoyed by such signs, Commerzbank has confirmed its forecast of 1.6 percent German economic growth this year, even as the International Monetary Fund recently lowered its estimate to 1.4 percent. The data prompted Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, to increase its estimate for next year to 3 percent, ahead of the I.M.F.'s and its own previous estimate of 2.7 percent.
"Until now, the recovery was domestic-driven," said Ulrich Beckmann, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Research. "Now, overseas growth is kicking in."
That growth is expected to benefit Italy, as well. Like Germany, it relies strongly on such export-driven industries as machine building and automobiles.
In recent months, orders to Italian industry have been inching up, measured month to month -- 1.1 percent in July -- though they continue to decline when compared with last year's figures. Yet the growth surge in Germany, where Italy ships 55 percent of its exports, makes an Italian revival seem to many here all but a matter of time. Italian business confidence has been strong, and the purchases of certain durable goods, like cars, is rising. Italy's leading economic daily, Il Sole 24 Ore, recently compared the economy to a column of stalled cars. The lead vehicles were already moving, it said, and it was only a matter of time before those in the middle and at the end were set in motion, too.
For all three countries, Mr. Horne said, growth depends more on the performance of neighbors than of emerging-market economies.
The 11 European countries embracing the euro -- of which Germany, France and Italy are the largest -- conduct about 40 percent of their trade with two partners: the United States and Britain. The United States economy remains strong, and Britain, which has not yet adopted the euro, is showing signs of strong improvement. In July, British retail sales were the strongest in 18 months and services expanded more robustly than at any time since early in 1998, as well.
In hope of extracting a long-term benefit from the current economic upswing, the German and Italian Governments have committed themselves to cutbacks in public spending and changes in taxation.
Last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany laid out plans to reduce spending, freeze pensions and cut the Government's share of the national economy over the next several years, to about 40 percent from nearly half today.
In Italy, the change has already begun. Part of the greatly improved fiscal condition reported in July was a result of an overhaul of tax-collection methods. In September, Government and labor union representatives will begin discussing a radical change in the pension system, hoping to cut the share of total compensation represented by payments into various social security programs.
To be sure, all three big economies continue to be slowed by levels of unemployment that are double or more that in the United States.
Yet in France, where consumer spending has rivaled export growth in bearing the economy aloft, consumer confidence has benefited somewhat from job creation in a more flexible labor market.
Eric Barthalon, chief economist at Paribas in Paris, said legislative changes permitting temporary employment, notably of young people, had contributed this year to a 2 percent increase in private employment. Moreover, he said, while economists once assumed that 3 percent growth was required before the French economy began creating jobs, that threshold now appears to be only 2 percent.
But he noted that the strength of the financial markets had also buoyed French consumer confidence. "Wealthy people are obviously feeling wealthier," he said, adding that anecdotal evidence suggested a trickle-down effect to middle-class families.
Paribas, he said, had not raised its growth forecast for France, which is 2.3 percent this year and 2.5 percent for 2000. "We were less pessimistic at the turn of the year," he said. "We didn't believe that the emerging-markets crisis would spread to the larger Western economies."

HEADLINE: 4 Companies Gain Accord In Labor Suit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Four major retailers yesterday settled claims brought against them in a class-action suit that amounted to the biggest legal challenge ever posed against sweatshops on American soil.
The retailers -- Nordstrom, Gymboree, Cutter & Buck and J. Crew, a subsidiary of the Texas Pacific Group -- agreed to require independent monitoring for compliance with basic minimum labor standards at the factories they use in the Northern Marianas Islands, a United States commonwealth in the Pacific. 
 The four companies were among 18 American retailers and apparel manufacturers accused in the lawsuit of conspiring with Marianas factory owners to deprive 15,000 apparel workers of their basic rights and to keep many of them in involuntary servitude, all with the aim of holding down production costs.
In addition to those four, a total of four retailers that Albert Meyerhoff, the chief lawyer for the plaintiffs, had threatened to add as defendants said yesterday that they had agreed in principle to settle as well. Like the first four, these retailers -- Polo/ Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan International, Phillips-Van Heusen and Chadwick's of Boston -- pledged to require independent monitoring of Marianas factories and to help finance such monitoring.
The lawsuit, seeking more than $1 billion in damages, was filed in January on behalf of a potential class of 50,000 workers and former workers, most of them on the Marianas' largest island, Saipan, a booming site for garment manufacturers who ship to the United States.
Among the remaining defendantsare the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and Wal-Mart, all of which deny wrongdoing and say they already have strict codes of conduct for their contractors.
Under the accord reached yesterday, which requires the approval of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles, the four settling retailers pledged to pay a total of $1.25 million for monitoring Marianas factories and to require that those factories honor basic rights like overtime pay and safe food and water.
"This agreement establishes a monitoring program with teeth," said Lora Jo Foo, president of Sweatshop Watch, a labor rights group. "It will make a difference in the lives of thousands of Saipan garment workers."
The lawsuit charged that many of the workers, for the most part citizens of China, had promised recruiters up to $10,000 each to transport them to Saipan, where, the suit maintained, they worked in indentured servitude to pay those fees. In the settlement, the four companies pledged not to use factories that employ workers who have paid recruitment fees.
"The settlement uses the economic leverage of these prestigious American retailers to influence the labor practices of these foreign-owned factories," Mr. Meyerhoff said. "We must ask ourselves, 'If this agreement is good enough for Ralph Lauren and Nordstrom, why isn't it good enough for Tommy Hilfiger or Wal-Mart?' "
The settlement calls for a respected nonprofit monitoring organization, Verite, based in Amherst, Mass., to inspect the Marianas factories. This monitoring will include unannounced factory visits and investigation of complaints by workers.
"A long, drawn-out battle didn't make good sense to us even though we remain confident about our ability to successfully defend ourselves," said Erik Nordstrom, Nordstrom's co-president. "We feel these resources are better spent elsewhere and could be used toward making a good-faith effort to furthering our commitment to using vendors who comply with the law."
Cutter & Buck also issued a statement, saying that it was confident it would have prevailed in the lawsuit but that it thought it should put the matter behind it in a way that would help improve the working environment at the factories it uses.

HEADLINE: Surplus Dreams;
A Debate Over Dividing Tax Dollars Yet to Be Collected

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The heated battle over how to use projected Federal budget surpluses has exposed deep rifts between the two parties, both in political and economic terms.
It has divided Democrats and Republicans over such basic issues as whether there really is a Federal budget surplus. It has forced the two parties to articulate their cases for and against tax cuts and Government spending as ways of improving the country's long-term prospects. It has set the stage for a potential debate over an issue of real substance in next year's election for control of the White House and Congress. Finally, it has raised the prospect of actually reducing the national debt, a problem Washington has not had the luxury of addressing for decades. 
 Round One in the battle ended last week, when Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut plan through Congress in the face of President Clinton's veto threat. Round Two will start after Labor Day, when official Washington returns from its summer vacation and the two parties decide whether to seek compromise or to leave the issue for the campaign trail.
The starting point for any discussion is getting a handle on how much money is available.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total Federal budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion. Of that, $1.9 trillion is generated by payroll tax revenues that are earmarked for Social Security. The two parties have more or less agreed to take that $1.9 trillion off the table, allowing it to be used only to reduce the national debt or to help finance an overhaul of the retirement system.
Most of the fight is over the remaining portion of nearly $1 trillion, which represents the surplus generated by general tax revenues.
Republicans say the figure is so big that the country can afford a $792 billion tax cut and still find plenty of money for needs like adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and increasing spending on the military.
Democrats point out that the surplus projections are based on a series of questionable premises: that the economy will avoid a protracted downturn; that unexplained surges in revenue will continue and that the forecasting ability of budget analysts will prove far more accurate than it has in the past.
Further, the projections assume what many say is an unrealistically low level of Government spending. The Congressional Budget Office surplus estimate is based on Congress's remaining within strict spending limits requiring cuts through 2002, and then increasing spending at no more than the rate of inflation.
Yet based on the appropriations bills moving through the House and Senate under the control of the Republican majority, Congress is on a path to shatter the spending caps next year, and indeed to use up all of next year's projected non-Social Security surplus of $14 billion.
If that pattern of rising spending were to continue, the non-Social Security portion of the surplus would all but disappear before it became available for tax cuts. "These surplus numbers give pie in the sky a good name," said Thomas S. Kahn, the Democratic staff director of the House Budget Committee.
Mr. Kahn helped produce a recent report for House Democrats that looked at what would happen if spending were to increase in line with historical trends and political realities. If spending were to increase just enough to keep up with inflation from now through 2009, the report concluded, it would use $595 billion of the $996 billion surplus.
The Democrats then looked at emergency spending, money that Congress appropriates each year to deal with unanticipated needs ranging from hurricanes to aid for farmers. From 1991 through 1998, emergency spending averaged $9 billion a year, not including the costs of the Persian Gulf war. The committee then assumed that emergency spending would remain at that average level, and subtracted an additional $90 billion from the surplus, leaving just $311 billion.
But there's more. The surplus estimate also assumed that all of the excess revenue would go to reducing the national debt, bringing down the Government's interest costs. To the degree that the surplus goes to spending -- or tax cuts -- those interest savings would not be realized. The committee calculated that the increased interest costs from maintaining inflation-adjusted levels of spending and accounting for emergency spending would be $179 billion.
After accounting for an additional $30 billion needed to pay for Social Security's operations over the next decade, the Democratic analysis concluded that the surplus over the next 10 years under its assumptions would be only $100 billion.
So far, however, that Democratic argument has not swayed Republicans. And even the White House is still assuming that it has nearly $1 trillion to divide up, allocating a third of the non-Social Security surplus to additional spending.
So for the most part the debate has not been over the availability of the surplus but over the relative merits of cutting taxes, increasing spending and reducing the national debt.
The Republican position is that tax cuts are the best way to insure continued prosperity -- and that they have the added benefit of blocking Democrats from spending the money, a course that Republicans said would be wasteful and economically inefficient. Reducing income tax rates, Republicans say, would motivate taxpayers to work harder, since they would keep more of their pay. Reducing capital gains taxes and expanding the individual retirement account program would encourage more savings and investment, helping the economy to retain its technological edge and become more productive. Scaling back taxes on business would encourage the creation of new jobs.
"My preference is that the surpluses be returned as tax cuts so the Government share of the economy will shrink and the private share of the economy will expand," said Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan Administration economist who is now with American Skandia, an investment firm. "The private sector is governed by market discipline and the profit motive. Those two factors will generate more efficiency and more productivity, and hence more economic growth."
Democrats say they are not against tax cuts, and have offered to go as high as $300 billion over 10 years. That suggests that they are not overly worried about their worst-case outlook of a mere $100 billion surplus. But they say any tax reductions should go to people who need them most, lower- and middle-income families, and that they should be used for specific purposes like making college more affordable or encouraging retirement savings.
The economy is doing just fine already, Democrats say. They warn that the additional stimulus of a tax cut could even lead the economy to overheat, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
The main Democratic argument against tax cuts, though, is that there are better things to do with whatever surpluses do materialize.
One is reducing the national debt. The two parties are not far apart on the benefits of paying down the debt incurred in the decades in which the Federal Government was running huge annual deficits. Democrats, Republicans and most economists agree that reducing the debt would leave interest rates lower, stimulating more economic growth, and would make it easier to address long-term problems like the solvency of Social Security by easing the financial burden on future generations.
"The best thing we can do for the economy is to increase savings, and the best way the Government has of increasing savings is paying down the debt," said Robert Bixby, the policy director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal monitoring group. "Reducing the debt will increase capital investment and productivity, which helps keep economic growth going."
The main source of debt reduction is the anticipated $1.9 trillion surplus over the next decade from excess Social Security payroll taxes. That money is ultimately intended to help pay retirement benefits for today's workers, but the only way the Government can "save" it is to reduce the amount of Federal debt held by the public, now about $3.6 trillion.
Republicans are generally committed to using the $1.9 trillion for debt reduction, although they have left open the option of using some of it to help transform Social Security into a system of private investment accounts. Although he initially proposed spending some of the Social Security surplus over the next decade, Mr. Clinton is now more firmly committed to using the entire amount for debt reduction.
Republicans are talking about finding additional money for debt reduction by holding down spending increases after 2002. Mr. Clinton wants to take $374 billion over 10 years from the non-Social Security surplus for additional debt reduction, although his plan would in essence just leave the Government owing the money to the Medicare system rather than to the public.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is one of the most influential advocates of debt reduction as the best use of the surplus. Despite his long record of advocating lower taxes -- he continues to press his case for elimination of the capital gains tax -- he bluntly warned Republicans last month that the time is not right for a tax cut.
Mr. Greenspan said a tax cut would be better suited for a time when the economy was in a downturn. And he asserted that the benefits of consistent debt reduction, in the form of lower-cost capital and greater investment in productivity-enhancing technology and machinery, would be the best way of keeping the long economic expansion going.
Mr. Greenspan offered one caveat that Republicans seized on -- that if the only choice was between tax cuts and additional spending, then his clear preference would be tax cuts.
Indeed, despite the bipartisan commitments to improving the Government's financial condition, some conservatives are uncomfortable with too much emphasis on debt reduction, saying it should not become a fixation that outweighs tax cuts as a priority for Republicans.
Many liberals also bemoan the emphasis on the debt and what they see as a lack of focus on spending for critical areas like education, basic technology, medical research and transportation. They say that the continual assault on Government spending by Republicans has led voters to believe that all Federal expenditures are wasteful and to lose sight of the fact that there is a substantial return on many types of public investment, from the development of the Internet to new drugs and better-trained workers.
"In 1992, Bill Clinton ran on the notion of public investment, the idea that there were the twin deficits -- the budget deficit and a deficit in investment in education, health care and research," said Robert B. Reich, who was Labor Secretary in Mr. Clinton's first term.
"That language seems to have vanished from American politics," Mr. Reich said. "It's ironic because the nation is in a far better position to afford those kinds of investments today than in 1992."

Chart: "Many a Slip Betwixt Cup and Lip"
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the non-Social Security budget surplus will accumulate to nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years. But the projection rests on several assumptions that may not prove accurate.
 
BEFORE ADJUSTMENTS -- $1 trillion
 
AFTER ADJUSTMENTS
 
Spending
If Federal spending simply keeps pace with projected inflation -- -$595 billion
 
Emergencies
Typically, $9 billion a year is spent on unexpected events like disaster relief -- -$90 billion
 
Additional interest
If spending exceeds estimates, interest costs on the remaining debt will be highter -- -$179 billion
 
Social Security
Extra cost of administering the program for 10 years -- -$30 billion
 
Remaining surplus -- +$100 billion

HEADLINE: U.S. Drops Charges of Crude Oil Dumping

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The Department of Commerce in Washington dismissed accusations of unfair trade practices against Mexico and three other oil-exporting countries today, heading off a potential economic and political crisis for Mexico and the United States, its biggest trading partner.
The charges had come from 12 independent oil producers in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, asserting that Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, as well as Iraq -- which the United Nations has recently permitted to increase oil exports -- had been selling crude oil in the United States at prices below production costs, a violation of anti-dumping laws. 
 All four countries denied the dumping charge, but Mexico, which ships 75 percent of its oil exports to the United States, was the most outspoken. Shortly after the complaint was filed in late June, Mexico retaliated by suspending plans to eliminate a tariff on natural gas imported from the United States.
The independent oil companies, which had banded together as a group calling themselves Save Domestic Oil, had asked the Clinton Administration to impose duties on Mexico and the other countries that would have forced them out of the United States market. Save Domestic Oil said it planned an appeal.
Luis Tellez, Mexico's Secretary of Energy, said in an interview that he was "very happy" with the Commerce Department's decision. "It was a very wise and just decision," he said. "We are not dumping oil on any international market."
Mr. Tellez said he expected that Mexico would put an end to its tariff on imports of natural gas from the United States in "a matter of days."
George Baker, an energy consultant in Houston, said the Commerce decision averted "a deterioration in U.S.-Mexico relations and some major economic shocks in both countries."
"Gasoline prices would have probably gone up in the U.S.," he said. "A big chunk of Mexican Government revenue comes from petroleum sales to the U.S. They would have had to scramble to find other customers and would have had to cut back production as well."
In Washington, Commerce Department officials said they had decided not to pursue the dumping charges after surveying more than 800 American oil producers, large and small, and finding that more than half the companies felt that no dumping was taking place. By law, at least half the industry must support a claim of dumping before the Commerce Department can start a formal investigation.
The independent producers had told officials that small oil companies in the United States had lost $15 billion in expected revenues between late 1997 and June, when the complaint was filed. Oil prices dropped to as low as $10 a barrel in late 1998, but a barrel has gone back up to $15, the low end of the range where it mostly traded since 1986.
The independent producers attribute the slump to pricing by Mexico and the other three countries. The countries provided about half of the eight million barrels of oil that were imported in 1998 into the states other than Alaska, Hawaii, California and four other Western states. Those seven use little oil from abroad.
Opponents of the dumping charges, including the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington trade group that represents most major American oil companies as well as some independents, said the drop in oil prices had come not from dumping but from market pressures.
"It was a worldwide phenomenon brought about by some fairly significant surprises," said Edward Porter, a senior economist at the American Petroleum Institute, citing the economic turmoil in Asia and Russia as well as unusually warm weather in the United States, as well as the United Nations decision permitting increased exports by Iraq.
Charles O. Verrill, Jr., the lead lawyer for Save Domestic Oil, said the major American oil companies opposed the complaint because they are the main customers of Mexico and the other countries and want the lowest possible prices.
"They have steadily reduced their exploration and production in the United States," Mr. Verrill said. "They have sold much of that production to the independents and increased their refining capacity, making them dependent on imported oil."

State Securities Regulators Urge Day-Trading Changes
Many day-trading firms use deceptive marketing practices to lure customers into a stock trading strategy that will probably cause them to lose money, and then they help to keep them trading by arranging what could be illegal loans, according to the North American Securities Administrators Association, a group of state regulators.
In a report, the regulators urged the firms to do a better job of screening potential customers and to disclose more fully the risks. The group also asked national regulators to step up their enforcement of trading rules and to ban some of the day-trading industry's most common lending practices. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Gore Pursues Black Voters in a Texas Foray

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore continued his efforts to woo black voters today as he again ventured into Texas, seeking to position himself for what he hopes will be an eventual Presidential race against the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush.
Though he never mentioned the Texas Governor by name, Mr. Gore repeatedly contrasted himself with Mr. Bush by raising issues like gun control, hate-crimes legislation, school vouchers and affirmative action. Mr. Gore also criticized the $792 billion tax-cut legislation recently passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, and endorsed by Mr. Bush, as "some of the worst handiwork of the Republican right." 
 He said the legislation would undermine Social Security and Medicare. "It takes courage and conscience to cross those conservatives who have no compassion," Mr. Gore told members of the National Urban League, who are holding their annual convention in Houston this week.
The scripted line, which Mr. Gore repeated several times in his speech, was a deliberate rebuke to the "compassionate conservatism" line that has become the early slogan of Mr. Bush's campaign. On Sunday night, when he addressed the group in a short welcoming speech, Mr. Bush promoted educational reforms in Texas and talked about the need to help people who have not benefited from the recent era of prosperity. In front of a group traditionally sympathetic to Democrats, Mr. Bush mentioned "compassionate" far more often than he did "conservatism."
But Mr. Gore, who is seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination, made certain to raise issues of particular concern to his predominantly African-American audience. He called on the House to pass a pending Federal hate-crimes bill and criticized the Texas Legislature for failing to pass a similar bill named after a black man who was tied to a truck and dragged to his death. Mr. Gore said he met with the family of the man, James Byrd Jr., earlier in the day. Though Mr. Bush never took a position on the politically sensitive bill, Democrats blamed his legislative allies for killing it.
With the process for conducting the 2000 census about to begin, Mr. Gore criticized elected officials in both parties who opposed changing the counting method. Minorities, in particular, have said that the census vastly underestimates the numbers of black and Hispanic Americans, and Mr. Gore agreed, saying that Texas had missed out on $1 billion in Federal benefits because of an undercount of its minority population.
Mr. Gore also called for background checks of people who buy weapons at gun shows. Mr. Bush has also publicly supported such checks, but gun-control advocates in Texas blamed his allies in the State Legislature for killing a bill this year that would have required them. Mr. Bush did sign into law a measure that prohibits Texas cities from filing liability lawsuits against gun makers. Several cities in other states are suing gun makers, seeking reimbursement for health care and public safety costs for gun violence.
 Mr. Gore, who recently spoke in Houston at the convention of the Hispanic advocacy organization the National Council of La Raza, also ticked off a laundry list of unfavorable statistics about Texas to an audience of people mostly from other states.
"For example, here in Texas, can we be satisfied when African-Americans are twice as likely to drop out of school, when on a national basis the black and white high school graduation rates are just about equal?" he asked. "Here in Texas, can we be satisfied when this state has one of the most regressive tax systems in the nation? Can we possibly be satisfied when Texas has the second-highest percentage of uninsured children in America?"
The criticism is in direct contrast to Mr. Bush's standard stump speech in which he paints Texas not only as an economic dynamo but also as a state where conservative policies have improved reading scores, particularly for minority children, and where diversity is embraced.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Teachers' Union Lobbies for Gore
ALBANY, Aug. 9 (AP) -- New York's largest teachers' union called today for its parent union, the American Federation of Teachers, to endorse Vice President Gore's bid for the White House.
Alan Lubin, executive vice president of the 420,000-member New York State United Teachers union, said such backing would allow the New York affiliate to throw its considerable muscle behind Mr. Gore's campaign and to help union members compete for delegate slots at the Democratic National Convention.

HEADLINE: Culture Resists Top-Down Policy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re Alice Goldfarb Marquis's criticisms of the new effort by the Pew Charitable Trusts to create an "infrastructure" for American culture (Op-Ed, Aug. 9): Increasingly, rather than support what is already going on, the big foundations make high-handed internal decisions about what is important and then select or create nonprofit institutions to carry out their wishes. 
 Even in these flush times, life remains tough for many nonprofit groups whose activities respond to the needs of citizens at large, not those of foundation staff and board members. Our country's myriad community-based arts organizations, many operating on shoestrings, contribute far more to American culture than the Pew-financed Rand Corporation ever will.

HEADLINE: Trenton Will Offer 2 Free Meals a Day to All Children in Elementary Schools

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
The Trenton School District will offer free lunch and breakfast to all children -- regardless of their family's income -- in its elementary schools this fall, under a Federal program meant for districts with a large number of needy students.
"It will help us give children at least two nutritious meals a day," said Dedra Wood, the director of food services for the Trenton district. "We know that a hungry child cannot learn." And it may not cost very much more to feed all the district's students, she said. 
 Trenton is joining a number of other districts, in New Jersey and elsewhere in the country, that are taking advantage of the program, which cuts the paperwork involved in getting families to sign up for free and reduced meals. The plan was first reported yesterday in The Times of Trenton.
Last year, about 85 percent of Trenton's 8,000 elementary school children got meals free or at a reduced cost, Mrs. Wood said.
But, she said that more children are eligible for the meals, and that including all the children would remove a stigma that some parents fear marks their children as needy. It will also make it easier for the parents whose children participated in the program because they will no longer have to fill out annual questionnaires determining their eligibility.
While feeding more children is the primary goal of the program, Mrs. Wood said the district will also economize, a primary concern when food costs are rising for hard-pressed districts.
Mrs. Wood said the district collected $70,000 in meal payments from the paying students last year, but officials believe they can make up most of that lost revenue through savings even when they offer free meals for all elementary students.
For example, she said, the district will save $42,000 that it pays to an armored car service to go to each of the 18 elementary schools to pick up lunch proceeds. It will also save $15,000 in the cost of printing meal tickets for all students.
She said the district was working to make its food services more cost efficient in other ways. Four years ago, she said, the district laid off 40 food service workers, and now instead of making its own food for elementary students, it buys prepackaged meals from an Illinois company that produces them in New York City.
The district is also trying to earn revenue by providing meals to outside agencies like the city's six charter schools and to smaller suburban districts.
"Most school districts now are trying to run their food services as a business," Mrs. Wood said. "It's very important for a district, especially the large urban ones, be as innovative as possible."
Kathy F. Kuser, the director for the Bureau of Child Nutrition Programs for the State Department of Agriculture, which administers the free meal program for the Government, said that the program to help districts with large numbers of poor children has been around for 15 years.
Other New Jersey cities whose school systems already take part in the program, or have applied for it, include Jersey City, Newark, Elizabeth, Camden, Atlantic City and Hoboken. Ms. Kuser said that 364,279 of New Jersey's 1.2 million schoolchildren qualified for free meals or meals at reduced costs.

HEADLINE: 22 Are Charged With Insurance Fraud in Stolen-Car Sting

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
After a 17-month undercover investigation into insurance fraud that included setting up a fake automobile resale shop, the New York City police arrested 22 people yesterday, including two government employees, on charges of selling their cars and then falsely reporting them stolen, officials said.
The Bronx District Attorney's office set up the shop in the Soundview section in March 1998. 
 The 22 were charged with grand larceny, attempted grand larceny and insurance fraud, and the police had the names of 22 more suspects. In addition, police officials said, four men accused of being middlemen in the transactions were arrested last week.
Insurers paid more than $750,000 in false claims, said Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx District Attorney. Officials expect the investigation to lead to even more suspects.
"This action should put all citizens on notice that fraud will not be condoned as a solution to their financial difficulties," Mr. Johnson said during a news conference at a Yankee Stadium parking lot, where the police displayed dozens of vehicles seized in the sting, including two cabs for tractor-trailer rigs, trucks, sports cars and four-door sedans.
Altogether, the authorities were able to recover 47 automobiles -- 40 that had been turned in to the fake company through middlemen and then reported stolen and 7 that had actually been stolen. The District Attorney's office paid no more than $2,500 for any of the vehicles, including the two tractor-trailer cabs, from Connecticut and Vermont.
Law enforcement officials said the vast majority of the suspects had no prior criminal records, and Mr. Johnson said most of them were "otherwise honest people."
William F. Zelenka, an assistant district attorney and deputy chief of the Arson, Auto and Economic Fraud Bureau, said the two government employees who were arrested were a court officer in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, Cheryl Pendola, and an engineer in the State Department of Transportation, Rasheed Balogun.
The defendants now face a maximum sentence of seven years in prison if they are convicted on the most serious charges.
Typically in such cases, the people trying to unload their cars contact middlemen, who the police say are often tied to organized crime. Those middlemen then sell the cars -- knowing they will be reported stolen -- to a shop that cuts them up for parts, or to a dealer who ships them overseas, said Howard Safir, the Police Commissioner.
Officials said they began the investigation because of the high rate of auto insurance fraud based on false theft reports in the New York metropolitan area, especially in the Bronx.
"We obtained vehicles from Connecticut, Massachusetts and Florida, and they all come down here to Bronx County," Mr. Zelenka said.
Ten percent of auto thefts reported in the country are false, but in the metropolitan area the rate is 20 percent, Mr. Zelenka said.
Thomas J. Sullivan, the regional security manager in the Woodbury, N.Y., field office of GEICO, the insurance company, said such fraud forced companies to increase premiums for all consumers.

HEADLINE: For That Bowl of Cherries, a Hard Life

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

DATELINE: WENATCHEE, Wash.

 BODY:
At the height of cherry-picking season, 12 men were making a patch of woods on Stemilt Hill into a home. Plastic grocery bags hung from nails in the Ponderosa pine bark: the pantry. A shard of mirror was wedged into the trunk of another pine: the bathroom. The kitchen was a Sunbeam propane grill, the bushes served as toilets, and six cheap tents formed the bedroom.
"The meat we have to buy every day, because it spoils," said Nereo Sanchez, who like the others came from Pachuca, Mexico. 
 Last year they stayed in an orchard, but this year the owner stopped the practice. They said they had looked for campgrounds, but found no room. They stayed here on public land, until forest rangers moved them along.
"We feel bad," said another worker, Juan Sanchez. "When we go pick, we don't know if our tents will still be here" at the end of the day.
Of the state's 16,000 cherry pickers, said an adviser to Gov. Gary Locke, 10,000 have not had adequate housing in the brief but profitable couple of weeks in which the fruit ripens. And in a recent crackdown, the Federal Department of Labor displaced 2,000 more, said the adviser, Rich Nafziger, after it threatened to close camps run by fruit growers that did not meet Federal health and safety standards.
Faced with fines, many growers simply stopped letting workers camp in the orchards.
Five years ago the state health department created a temporary licensing program for camps in the orchards while the growers worked on meeting more stringent standards for them. Workers were allowed to stay in tents they bought themselves, which often leaked and did not provide protection from insects and heat. Growers had to provide water and toilets but not refrigerators. Workers used ice-filled coolers to store their food.
"In hot weather the food ends up floating in water in the ice chest," said Richard Terrill, northwest regional administrator for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. "You have a lot of people in close quarters, with the danger of communicable diseases. Some of the camps didn't have an adequate number of toilets and showers."
The licensing provisions were intended to allow growers time to supply better, more plentiful shelter for workers, but they served only to justify the status quo instead of encouraging growers to meet Federal standards, Mr. Terrill said. Those standards include making living quarters at least seven feet high, with adequate ventilation and permanent floors to keep out vermin and moisture. The camps also have to have water and refrigeration.
With growers showing little progress in meeting the tougher Federal standards, the Government stepped in.
"This year when we made our objections known, there were probably a few farmers who decided they wouldn't even provide what they had provided before, and that probably meant -- I'll be honest with you -- that several hundred more workers didn't have a place to camp," Mr. Terrill said. "Hopefully the outcome will be good, so next year and in the years after, there will be more housing and better housing."
Growers are not legally required to provide housing, said Dan Kelly, assistant manager of the Washington Growers Clearing House Association, a group of 2,800 tree fruit growers. Most growers say they cannot afford to build permanent housing for pickers in a two-week harvest.
Nick Fox, owner of C & S Orchard in Wenatchee, had a camp three years ago, but closed it. He employs 150 to 600 workers, depending on the size of his harvest.
"If it was economically feasible, I'd love to have the camp," Mr. Fox said. But he said meeting licensing standards would cost up to $500,000.
"Talk to any banker," he said "and a banker will laugh you out of the bank." He said workers were better off in a grower's camp than on the roadside. "It's safer, better, healthier, for everyone concerned."
But Guadalupe Gamboa, the state director for the United Farm Workers of America, is optimistic that the crackdown will result in improved conditions. He said establishing state standards that were lower than Federal requirements was "a huge subsidy to the industry."
If growers want to rely on migrant workers, he said, "they've got to find a place for migrants to stay."
Advocates for farm workers point out that growers are willing to make other large investments in a quick crop, like orchard warming machines that cost $26,000 just to transport, while showers for workers are more likely to be called a luxury.
"The whole issue about short seasons kind of bothers me," Mr. Terrill said. "If you're a grower and you grow a short-season crop, you still invest in chemicals, tractors, and other equipment."
Cherry picking requires special timing and skills; the fruit must be picked just as soon as it is ripe, and workers must be careful not to separate the stems from the fruit or damage the branches where next year's buds will form.
Working from 4 A.M. until noon, when heat can damage the fruit, pickers can make $4 for filling a 40-pound box, or up to $80 a day. Many travel for weeks at a time following the ripening from California to Oregon, then from Washington to Montana. The cherry harvest runs from mid-June through July in most of Washington. It begins a month earlier in California and ends up in Montana in August. Workers say living conditions in other states are better.
A few solutions are being tried in Washington. About 300 people found shelter this season through the state's Rent-a-Tent program, which leased 26 six-person tents for $200 per tent a month to 8 growers, with the hope that if enough growers participated statewide, the tents could move with the workers along the trail of ripening cherries. And in Mattawa, a town on the Columbia River, the state has developed the Esperanza migrant center, a village of 25 temporary shelters created out of shipping containers. Each sleeps up to six and has windows, air-conditioning and a bathroom with shower.
But such accommodations reach only a few workers. Many make do in the woods outside town.
Maria Padilla, 36, of Yakima, Wash., was camping with seven other people, including three of her six children. Their dinner was frying on a propane stove. They drank untreated water from a nearby creek and had no access to indoor plumbing.
"We would like a house or a cabin so we could wash dishes and shower," she said. "It is not very good," her husband, Lupe, 39, agreed. "But what can we do?"

HEADLINE: HUGE TAX PAYMENT ORDERED FOR U.P.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
A judge has ruled that United Parcel Service took inflated tax deductions in 1984 and must pay taxes, penalties and interest that the company said might total nearly $300 million for that year.
But its ultimate liability could be much larger -- perhaps growing into one of the biggest corporate tax cases ever -- because the Tax Court decision, issued Monday, covers only the first year of a business practice that has continued ever since. 
 The 114-page decision, and its withering dissection of testimony by U.P.S. executives, was a rare victory for the Internal Revenue Service in its efforts to prevent companies from taking tax deductions when they move money to subsidiaries overseas for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.
Yesterday, United Parcel Service would not estimate its potential liability. But previously, the company had disclosed that it could owe $259 million in taxes alone for its returns covering the years 1985 through 1990, which have been challenged by the I.R.S.
Since 1990, U.P.S. has continued to claim these deductions on the same theory that the Tax Court denied, said Kenneth B. Sternad, the chief spokesman for the company. It expects the agency to contest its tax payments for the subsequent years. Based on the company's past estimates of tax liability, its total in taxes, interest and penalties could easily surpass a billion dollars.
U.P.S. may appeal Monday's decision, Mr. Sternad said. The case would move to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, where U.P.S. is based.
The decision will not affect plans, announced by the company last month, to sell shares to the public for the first time, Mr. Sternad said.
At issue in the civil case were deductions that U.P.S. took for the costs of insuring each parcel worth more than $100 against damage or loss.
The I.R.S. claimed that U.P.S. charged customers three times the competitive market price for the insurance in a scheme to funnel money to an insurance company it created in 1984 in Bermuda, thereby inflating its tax deductions. U.P.S. charged customers 25 cents per $100 for "extra value coverage" in 1984. It then paid the money over to National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh and took a deduction for the expense.
But the transaction was a sham, Judge Robert P. Ruwe wrote in his ruling. National Union was merely acting as a front, he said, because after taking a small fee, it sent the money on to Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda insurance company owned and controlled by U.P.S.
United Parcel argued that its insurance fees were reasonable, but the judge held that the rates were as much as three times what U.P.S. would have paid for the insurance in the open market.
Overseas Partners counted at least 63 cents of each dollar it received as profit, Judge Ruwe wrote -- in some years as much as 78 cents on the dollar.
The finding that the customers paid three times the market price for insurance is sure to draw attention from major shippers who may see an opportunity to seek refunds.
In funneling business to the Bermuda insurer, the judge ruled, U.P.S. was motivated only to reduce its income taxes in the United States, and not by any legitimate business purpose. It is legal to organize business activities in ways that reduce taxes -- but it is illegal to engage in transactions whose sole purpose is to avoid taxes, Judge Ruwe noted.
He quoted at length the testimony of Neil A. Doherty, an expert witness hired by the company. At trial, an I.R.S. lawyer asked Mr. Doherty if the fee of 25 cents per $100 would have made sense for U.P.S. if the money were not being paid to an insurer it controlled.
"It would be a rather strange business decision to basically give off that profit to an outsider," testified Mr. Doherty, a professor of insurance and risk management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
The insurance charges allowed U.P.S. to take nearly $65 million in improper deductions, the judge held, while inflating the profits of Overseas Partners, which is not required to pay United States income taxes.
The judge upheld the I.R.S.'s finding that U.P.S. owed $64.9 million in taxes, $14.5 million in penalties for negligence and underpayment of taxes and interest that would bring the total to about $300 million.
Before 1984, the judge wrote, U.P.S. collected fees to cover damage or loss to packages worth more than $100 and treated that money as part of its regular revenue stream, paying taxes on its profits.
The company argued that it had created the Bermuda insurance company not to avoid taxes, but to avoid running afoul of state insurance regulators, some of whom had questioned car rental companies about charges they added to customer bills to cover potential damage to vehicles.
Kenneth Johnson, at the time the company's chief insurance official, acknowledged in his testimony in the case that no state insurance official had challenged U.P.S. and that he had never asked any state or Federal official if the company was acting improperly in charging the fees.
The judge also noted that U.P.S. had letters from each state authorizing its earlier practice of adding charges for high-value packages.
As a major company, Judge Ruwe wrote, he would have expected U.P.S. to investigate any such risks and to produce documents showing its legal and economic analysis of the issue. But during the period it was considering setting up the Bermuda insurer, he added, U.P.S. "produced no documentation, such as corporate minutes" indicating that it "had motives other than tax reduction."
Mr. Sternad, the company spokesman, said U.P.S. believed the judge was wrong and that its insurance charges were reasonable. He said the company was not considering making refunds to customers.
The I.R.S. has fought an uphill battle against a range of corporate practices intended to reduce income taxes in the United States by taking profits in countries with small or no corporate income tax, like Bermuda, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands.
There are many legitimate reasons for companies to move funds overseas, tax experts note, so the I.R.S. must prove that the sole motive for the transaction was tax avoidance.
In insurance arrangements like that set up by U.P.S., it has been nearly impossible for the I.R.S. "to draw a bright line around which payments to captive insurance companies are proper and which are not," said Andrew D. Pike, a former Treasury Department official who teaches tax law at American University in Washington.
The I.R.S. has lost cases involving captive insurance companies owned by Gulf Oil; Sears, Roebuck; U-Haul; Humana and others, according to Lee A. Sheppard, a New York lawyer who writes for Tax Notes magazine.
Just last month the I.R.S. lost a $180 million case against National Westminster Bank P.L.C, a big British bank, over how it allocated interest expenses between its American and overseas operations.

HEADLINE: Raise Water Taxes to Combat Drought

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "It's Time We Got Smart About Drought" (Op-Ed, Aug. 5): 
 The best solution to droughts is to give water users the proper economic incentive. This can be done by increasing water taxes by, say, $200 a year and by using the increased revenue to reduce property or other taxes by a similar amount.
We would not pay a dime more in net tax revenue. But we would all use less water because wasting water would be expensive. As a result, reservoir levels would be significantly higher in times of rain failure.
This has the additional advantage of preserving liberty: during droughts it would be less necessary to punish citizens for specific water uses.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
Why That Bottle Costs $50 in a Restaurant

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the so-so cabernet you shelled out $50 for in that restaurant last week? And how you felt you'd been taken? Well, if it makes you feel any better, the winemaker didn't do too well on the deal, either. He or she probably made about $2.
In the wine trade, that's actually not bad money. Take Ravenswood, a well-known winery in Sonoma, Calif. Ravenswood has been making superior wines, mostly zinfandels, for almost 20 years. Last year the winery, which is publicly traded, posted a net profit of about $1.5 million on sales of $17 million. With some 131,000 cases of wine sold, that translates into a profit of about 95 cents a bottle. 
 The Robert Mondavi Winery, also a public company, netted $29 million, selling just under 6.8 million cases, or some 81.2 million bottles of wine. Net profit per bottle: 36 cents. Beringer Wine Estates did a little better, making $29.5 million on about 6 million cases, or 41 cents a bottle.
No need to send any of these people CARE packages. Volume clearly makes up for any shortcomings in the per-bottle profits. Even so, it should be evident that no one, at least no one at the publicly owned wineries, is making a killing in the wine business. Privately owned wineries do not release their profit figures.
So where did your $50 go? (Closer to $60 with tax and tip.) Mostly to the restaurant. The winery would have sold it to a wholesaler -- called a distributor in the liquor business -- for about $12.50. The distributor then would have marked it up about a third, selling it to a retailer or to a restaurant for about $16.50, plus freight and state taxes. The retailer then would sell it for about $25, and the restaurant for double that, charging you around $50.
This is called the three-tiered system. Antiquated and costly, it's part of the liquor laws of almost every state. And there can be a fourth tier as well. Many larger wine producers hire marketing companies to augment the efforts of the distributors. Typically, a marketer will take a five-figure fee for selling a predetermined number of cases.
It cost the maker of our $50 bottle about $10.50 to produce it. Wine making costs are not difficult to understand. First, there are the grapes. Some wineries use only grapes they have grown themselves. Big wineries like Mondavi and Beringer own vineyards and also buy grapes from other growers. Many smaller wineries, like Ravenswood, buy all their grapes, currently paying $2,000 and more a ton for the best cabernet sauvignon. Estate-grown or purchased, grapes can account for up to 25 percent of production costs.
The bottle, cork, label and the capsule around the bottle's neck would ordinarily account for little more than $1, except at the E.& J. Gallo Winery, which makes its own bottles and prints its own labels. Accounting for the rest of the wine production costs: barrels, which can cost $600 each, storage costs while the wine is aging, taxes, marketing and promotion.
Of course, prices, markups and fees are flexible. If a highly regarded small-production wine, say a Bruno Giacosa barbera from Italy or a Silver Oak cabernet from California, is much in demand and only one distributor carries it in a state or a city, he may increase his markup from a third to 40 percent or more. Retailers and restaurants will pass this increase on to their customers.
Once, restaurants simply added 50 percent to the retail price of a bottle of wine. More commonly now, they double or triple the retail price. It's no longer surprising to find wines that sell for $10 in New York wine shops on restaurant lists for $25 to $35. Most restaurateurs defend high wine prices as a way to hold down the cost of food and general overhead. But there are restaurants -- Harry's Hanover Square, Sparks Steakhouse and Union Square Cafe, to cite three in New York -- that consistently offer wine prices lower than their competitors'.
Some price increases are unavoidable. Like many serious restaurateurs, John Foy at the Sonoma Grill in East Rutherford, N.J., holds his best Bordeaux and California cabernets for three or four years before selling them. Since he uses bank loans to buy the wine, he adjusts his prices periodically to cover his interest payments.
"I won't be selling my 1994's for another two years, my 1995's for three," he said. "I've got to finance my inventory."
Even with periodic adjustments, Mr. Foy said, he hews as closely to the 50-percent-over-retail principle as he can.
"When I see some of the prices in New York restaurants, I feel like saying, 'If you want to hold me up, why don't you just take a gun and ask for my wallet?' " he said. "It would be less hypocritical."
Mr. Foy's concerns are not necessarily those of all restaurantgoers, especially in these good economic times. According to the most recent restaurant poll conducted by Wine & Spirits, a consumer magazine, the average price paid in United States restaurants last year for cabernet sauvignon was $56 a bottle; for pinot noir, about $47, and for chardonnay and merlot, about $40.
Noting that the average price of the most popular wines in 1998 was $43.59, a 24 percent jump in three years, Wine & Spirits' editors said: "It's beyond inflation and beyond most people's ability to comprehend."
So be grateful you got that bottle for $50. At the rate we're going, next year it may be $75.

Tastings
Classic Chianti
 
Cetamura Chianti, Badia a Coltibuono 1997, Tuscany, Italy. About $10.
 
SO many good wines are coming out of Italy these days that it's hard to keep up with them. Unfortunately, many have only two of the three basic requirements for relatively little-known wines: quality and a reasonable price. The third leg of the stool is availability. Fortunately, Cetamura, from Badia a Coltibuono, a prominent Chianti producer, is quite widely distributed. Less impressive than Coltibuono's better Chiantis, Cetamura is nevertheless a delightfully rounded everyday red wine with an array of rich flavors, good concentration and lots of fruit. It's a classic Chianti, composed of sangiovese and canaiolo, the essential Chianti grapes. An easygoing, uncomplicated red for late summer and fall.

HEADLINE: NATURAL ORIGINS: Chesapeake Bay;
The Glorious Summer Of the Soft-Shell Crab

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: Urbanna, VA.

 BODY:
THE sun was a blood-orange disk pinned to the horizon as Thomas Lee Walton eased his 24-foot Carolina Skiffcq into the creek and headed toward the Rappahannock River. An osprey was perched in a dead tree on the far shore. It was 6:05 A.M. We were going crabbing.
 Our quarry was the Atlantic blue crab -- Callinectes sapidus to marine biologists, which means "savory beautiful swimmer" in Latin. But not the run-of-the-mill fellows you boil up with plenty of Old Bay seasoning, then crack with a hammer before pulling out the sweet, delicate white meat. Mr. Walton fishes for "busters" or "peelers," which are crabs that have already begun to shed their shells, or are about to, before growing new ones. 
 "Watching them shed," Mr. Walton said with a tender reverence suprising in a rugged outdoorsman, "it's like they're reborn."
 If you catch them at the right moment and pull them from the water, the process of growth stops and you have a soft-shell crab, one of summer's most prized treats, not only here on the rim of the Chesapeake Bay, but also, increasingly, in cities across the United States.
 They seem to be on every menu in New York this summer, prepared in more or less the same way: you eat the whole thing, claws, legs and all, sauteed or grilled, maybe seasoned with a squeeze of lemon juice. Before you try one, it sounds decidedly dubious, like tripe or seaweed. But a single taste makes a convert.
 Years ago, I served a soft-shell, grilled in my garden, to Paul Bocuse, who formed a wildly inflated view of my cooking skills as a result. Soft-shells can be deep fried, too, which makes them crunchier, and good ol' boys like to stick them between two slices of white bread to make sandwiches. Me, I prefer my soft-shells sauteed, because I think the crust masks the flavor.
 All crabs molt, up to 20 times during their lives; they must do so to grow. But the soft-shell form of the Dungeness crab on the Pacific Coast or king crab in Alaska is seldom eaten, if ever, and Europeans use soft-shell crabs mostly for bait. In this as in so many things gastronomic, the Venetians are an exception. They consider Mediterranean shore crabs that have shed their carapaces, which they call moleche, a great delicacy.
 Even here, where soft-shells have been savored for more than a century, putting them on gourmands' tables is a dicey proposition, requiring luck, hard physical labor and painstaking attention to detail, in roughly equal proportions. Nobody has found a way yet to farm crabs. Mr. Walton and his fellow watermen, as they call themselves, must catch peelers in wire-mesh traps, take them ashore, transfer them into shallow sea water tanks and check each one carefully every six hours around the clock, waiting for them to shed their shells.
The crabs, elusive and pugnacious, don't make it easy.
In William W. Warner's fine book about crabs, "Beautiful Swimmers" (Little, Brown, 1994), he quotes a splendid triple-negative aphorism he heard from a waterman on Maryland's Eastern Shore: "Ain't nobody knows nothing about crabs." Mr. Walton agrees, steeped though he is in crustacean legend and lore. "Catching crabs is mostly instinct," he said.
"Every time you think you've got them figured they change on you," he added, standing at the tiller of his boat, bronzed from a summer's work. "We try to outthink them, but they don't think. They just react to changes in the water, little changes in chemistry that we don't understand."
He put in a fresh wad of Red Man chewing tobacco and squinted into the sun, looking for the buoys that marked one of his lines of traps.
MR. WALTON'S family has lived and worked on the water for generations -- how many, he could not say. They moved to Urbanna from remote Tangier Island, out in the bay, after a terrible hurricane in 1933. They have been here ever since. He, his brothers, his uncle, his aunt and his son, Lee, are all crabbers, all true Tidewater folks who pronounce "about" not at all like the rest of us, but about halfway between uh-BOAT and uh-BOOT.
Jimmy Sneed is what the Walton family and their neighbors call a come-here -- someone from somewhere else. But after almost a decade he has won their confidence, and they have taught him most of what they know about soft-shells, which is one reason his restaurant in Richmond, the Frog and the Redneck, may serve the most delectable soft-shells anywhere.
Bearded, ribald, shod day and night in one of his 14 pairs of Lucche se boots, Mr. Sneed is (and is not) the redneck in his restaurant's name. It comes from a moment of comic conflict more than a decade ago, when he was working for the French chef Jean-Louis Palladin, then the proprietor of Jean-Louis in Washington and now installed at Palladin in Manhattan.
As Mr. Sneed tells the story, Mr. Palladin was shouting at him, not for the first time, and Mr. Sneed snapped. "Shut up, you stupid frog," Mr. Sneed shouted back. Mr. Palladin whirled, glared, slammed his knife on the counter and demanded, "What did you call me?" When Mr. Sneed repeated the epithet, Mr. Palladin yelled, "Then you must be a . . . a redneck!"
He isn't, of course, though he sometimes relishes the role; the son of a Veterans' Administration administrator, he grew up in a dozen towns and cities, including Charleston, S.C., and Peekskill, N.Y. Of course, Mr. Sneed and Mr. Palladin became close friends. And of course, when Mr. Sneed decided to move to Richmond after five years of running a restaurant in Urbanna, he could not resist naming his new place in honor of his mentor.
Crab has become Mr. Sneed's metier. Every night of the year, he serves a rich red pepper cream soup garnished with crab, as well as ethereal crab cakes, made of prime backfin lump crab meat, bound together with little more than a dab of mayonnaise and the chef's prayers. He serves them even when crab is so scarce, as it is right now, that he has to charge $32.50 for them to make a profit. When soft-shells are in season hereabouts, from May until mid-October, he serves them as well.
Mr. Sneed buys mostly from Thomas Lee Walton, who saves the softest of soft-shells for him. These are the ones that have been culled from the tanks within a half-hour of molting. (The tanks are called floats by the watermen because in the early days of the industry they were slatted boxes floating in the creeks.)
The new crab shells begin to form at once, and because the watermen can't hover over the tanks, they get only a fraction of the soft-shells at the optimum moment. These are called "velvets" in the colorful terminology of the crabbers. Plump and bursting with salty-sweet flavor, they are also very fragile, so Mr. Sneed, his wife or his daughter drives to Urbanna every other day, a two-and-a-half-hour round trip, to fetch them at the source.
"Soft-shells are very important to us," Mr. Sneed told me in a rare outburst of understatement. "And you have to try for the premium raw materials, no matter how much trouble it is. Product is king."
A self-described culinary minimalist, Mr. Sneed cooks the crabs in the simplest way imaginable. He pulls them from the refrigerator, dusts them with Wondra flour, which is milled extra fine so that it doesn't clump, and slides them, shell side down, into a heavy cast-iron frying pan filled to a depth of a quarter of an inch with a 50-50 mix of canola oil and drawn butter. After 60 seconds, he turns them and cooks them 30 seconds on the other side.
"Careful," Mr. Sneed warned. "When soft-shells are really fresh, they're full of salty water, so they tend to pop and burn you."
And don't serve them with tartar sauce, not unless you want to make the nonredneck see red.
IT took the watermen many years to make the discovery that put the soft-shell trade on a sound commercial footing. Finding a buster in a pot or along the shore is a relatively rare occurrence. They needed some means of forecasting when other crabs were about to molt, so they could take it ashore and wait for it to do its thing. Finally, some unstoried hero noticed that on the next-to-last section of the articulated swimming leg, the most translucent part of the crab, a white line that later turns pink, and finally an intense dark red can be detected when a crab is about to shed its shell.
It can be detected, that is, by an experienced waterman like Mr. Walton. I could just barely make out the line at its cherry reddest, when the crab was an hour, maybe minutes, from molting, but the rest of the time I couldn't break the code, no matter how closely I looked.
The crabs with white lines, known for some reason as "greens," shed in two weeks, those with pink lines, sometimes called "ripe," will molt within a week, and the red liners, termed "rank," will need a day.
In fact, the telltale lines are the edges of new shells, or exoskeletons, forming inside old ones in anticipation of molting.
I marveled at Mr. Walton's skills. When we arrived at the traps, or pots, that he had set out along the northern shore of the Rappahannock estuary, he chugged up to the first, set the tiller so it kept the boat tracing a circle around the pot and put on an oilcloth apron and two pairs of gloves. Then, with practiced grace, he snagged the buoy with a boathook and pulled up the line attached to it, hand over hand, heaving the pot into the boat until it broke water.
The pot is a cube-shape contraption with three conical entrances, which crabs can swim into but not out of. In the first one were a half-dozen crabs, as well as a croaker and an alewife, as menhaden are called hereabouts. Mr. Walton undid the latch and dumped the catch onto a sorting table, then quickly pitched the fish and the hard-shells back into the water, closed the latch and lowered the pot.
Only five or six times all morning did he expend more than a passing glance in "reading" which crabs were peelers and which not. Most of the time, he instantly tossed the greens into one bushel basket at his feet, the ripes and ranks into another and the few busters into a blue plastic basin filled with river water so that they could continue to molt there. When he was unsure, he held the crab in question up to the sun, its claws a beautiful powder blue, studied it and pitched it in the appropriate direction.
On picking the right crabs on such slim evidence rests his livelihood. He makes few mistakes.
But if the crabs aren't there, no crabber can catch them. Mr. Walton pulled about 70 good peelers and busters from his first line of 50 traps, but from the second and third, he got only about 10, and then he quit for the day. August is never the best month for soft-shells. That comes each May, when he usually takes five or six bushels of crabs off his boat at day's end -- about 1,000 to 2,000 crabs. The May catch is almost as big as those of all the other months put together.
At $1.50 each, the morning's work grossed about $120. But out of that Mr. Walton has to pay for gas and the upkeep of his boat, his pickup truck, his pots (which cost $12 each) and his two dozen shedding tanks, which look like shallow plastic bathtubs. No formula for instant riches.
Is the overall crab catch in the bay and its tributaries shrinking, as the harvests of striped bass and oysters did in recent years, with disastrous economic consequences? Many watermen, and Mr. Sneed, think it is, and they blame winter crabbing with dredges, which pull hibernating crabs from the mud, along with laws permitting crabbers in Virginia to keep female crabs carrying a spongelike mass of eggs.
Not so, said Mike Osterling, the top crab expert at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at Gloucester Point, near Hampton.
"I've seen no records indicating a long-term decline in soft-shells," he said. "Soft-shell fishing has its good days and bad, like anything else. But more people are going into the soft-shell business every day, all the way from here to Texas, and that's no sign of a fishery in decline."
Tradition says that the Chesapeake produces the best soft-shells, and I'm a great respecter of food traditions. But the season lasts a little longer farther South because of the warmer water, and I've eaten some pretty good soft-shells taken by fisherman in Louisiana and North Carolina, mostly small operators like the watermen on the bay.
As for Mr. Walton, he sells all the velvets he has to Mr. Sneed, and those with a slightly firmer shell, called "shippers," he ships. Every so often, a refrigerated truck stops here, picks up trays of crabs covered with wet paper or eel-grass and heads north toward the big fish market at Jessup, Md., near Baltimore.
Sorted by size -- whales are the biggest, spiders the smallest, with jumbos, primes, hotels and mediums in between -- they go to a wholesaler named Louis Foehrkolb, whom Mr. Walton has never met. He keeps track of the shipments and sends Mr. Walton a check at month's end.
I asked whether he ever worries about being shortchanged.
"Nah," said Mr. Walton, whose smile is as roguish as ever at 52. "I figure if he stops sending me money, I'll stop sending him crabs."
 
TEMPURA OF SOFT-SHELL CRABS
Adapted from the Frog and the Redneck, Richmond
Time: 20 minutes
 
8 cleaned soft-shell crabs
1 cup flour
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 ice cubes
Peanut oil for deep frying
Sea salt to taste.
 1. Lay crabs backside down on a cutting board, and cut in half lengthwise, so that each half has a claw.
2. Stir about 1 1/4 cups water into the flour to make a smooth, thick batter. Add baking soda and ice cubes.
3. Pour enough oil into a deep pot to fill it halfway, and heat to 375 degrees. (To test, carefully sprinkle a drop or two of water into the pot. If the oil rumbles, it's not hot enough. If it crackles, it is.)
4. Dip crab pieces, four at a time, into batter, and immediately drop into hot oil. Stir after several seconds to separate the pieces, then cook until golden brown, 30 to 45 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining crab pieces. Salt to taste, and serve immediately.
Yield: 4 servings.

HEADLINE: Milosevic Meets His Backers As Opponents Seek to Unite

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Aug. 10

 BODY:
President Slobodan Milosevic attended a rare strategy meeting of his Socialist Party this afternoon, apparently in response to the growing opposition movement against him.
Mr. Milosevic has found himself under increasing pressure as opposition parties have begun to show a new will to unite to remove him from power. The Serbian Orthodox church has added its weight, bringing key opposition leaders together on Monday and backing their plans for democratic change in Serbia. 
 The Holy Synod, the highest body of the church, convened today to discuss its role in political developments. Pushed by outspoken members of the church in Kosovo, who have denounced President Milosevic's disastrous policies in the province, the church is poised to take a prominent role in the move for change. The synod is expected to issue a statement on Wednesday on the results of its meeting.
State news media have been quick to criticize the opposition's attempts to win the backing of the church. The state news agency, Tanjug, and the main Government newspaper, Politika, denounced the political meeting, saying the opposition leaders "are practically inducing the church to violate the Constitution," which they said bars the Church from engaging in politics.
The Socialist Party today repeated its standard criticism of opposition leaders, calling them "NATO's lackeys" who are trying to bring down the Government and thus achieve what NATO failed with its bombing campaign, Radio Television Serbia reported.
Yet the party apparently plans business as usual; it appointed two members to its executive council but otherwise announced no changes in its tactics or its program.
Opposition groups announced after Monday's meeting that they would join forces for a rally planned on Aug. 19 in Belgrade, and they pressed Patriarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, to take part.
The Holy Synod is considering whether the patriarch should attend the rally and also another request, to mediate between the Government and the opposition to find a political settlement, the Beta news agency said, quoting opposition members.
The rally next week is being organized by two independent economists, Mladjan Dinkic and Predrag Markovic, the founder of the Stability Pact for Serbia.
Patriarch Pavle led the meeting on Monday of the opposition forces, including the Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement. It will be the first time in two years that the men will share a platform; their bitter personal rivalry was blamed for the collapse of the democratic movement in 1997.
The two politicians are united in calling for a transition Government, but remain divided on how to bring it about and on the form of Government. The authors of the Stability Pact for Serbia and others, in a plan that has Washington's backing, insist that President Milosevic must go first, before any transition Government can take over.
Mr. Djindjic is hoping the rally will build a momentum of its own, describing it as "a kind of a referendum where people will have a chance to say whether they are for changes." He warned that no compromise was possible with Mr. Milosevic. "After the 19th, Milosevic will have to realize that he is out of time," he told reporters. "It is the day when the countdown begins."
But Mr. Draskovic questions how Mr. Milosevic's removal will come about. He is arguing for a transitional Government that includes power-sharing with Mr. Milosevic.
"I told Patriarch Pavle I oppose a government which would be formed on the streets," he told reporters. "We will not support such a government because it would deepen the agony and the divisions among the Serbian people."
The Patriarch also met separately on Monday with the former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff, Momcilo Perisic, who has founded his own party, the Movement for Democratic Serbia. Mr. Perisic, who was dismissed from his post eight months ago, has called for democratic change and for Mr. Milosevic to step down.
The general has been criticized for not joining one of the many existing democratic parties, but he could prove a potent figure in the swelling ranks of the opposition movement.
Opposition rallies have continued daily around the country although the crowds are sometimes small. The Aug. 19 rally will be watched as a measure of public discontent.

Signs of strain between agencies and their customers persist for a second year.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
RELATIONS between agencies and advertisers are showing signs of strain for a second consecutive year, according to an annual survey.
The results of the survey, which asked executives at agencies and client companies to assess the nature of their dealings with each other, indicate that efforts to narrow the gap between them have fallen short, as they did last year. The two years of deterioration follow surveys in 1996 and 1997 that had indicated improvement in relationships. 
 "As an industry, we're not doing great," said Nancy L. Salz, president of Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who offered a preview of the findings of the 1999 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations. "Our numbers are absolutely confirming what the A.A.F. found."
Ms. Salz's reference was to a much-publicized survey released in June by the American Advertising Federation. That study showed surprising skepticism among top corporate executives about the effectiveness of advertising in helping their companies grow as well as a reluctance to declare themselves more than merely satisfied with advertising on behalf of their businesses.
Advertisers who responded to the Salz Consulting survey also judged advertising to be less important to their sales growth than before.
For instance, when asked how much sales could improve if their agencies were always able to do the best possible work, the mean figure the respondents gave was 21.4 percent. That was the lowest since a mean of 21.1 percent in the recession year of 1991 and a sharp decline from 31.4 percent as recently as 1996.
And when asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 highest, the mean rating from advertisers for 1999 was 7.0. That was the lowest since the same rating in 1992 and 1993 and a significant decrease from 7.5 as recently as 1996.
"This is all about accountability," Ms. Salz said. "Advertising as a tool has got to be accountable."
"It isn't 'Show me the money,' " she added. "It's 'Show me the results.' "
As it turns out, this year's answers to the survey, which has been conducted for the last 14 years, point to a results-oriented way to dissipate tensions between Madison Avenue and clients: the practice known as performance-based compensation. That's when clients switch from traditional methods of paying their agencies, like a 15 percent commission or a flat fee, to basing payments on predetermined, measurable goals like increases in sales of products. Among the well-known marketers using or experimenting with performance-based compensation is the Procter & Gamble Company.
"Performance-based compensation has an effect for the good," Ms. Salz said, reviewing survey tables showing that advertisers using it reported smoother relationships with their agencies than those that did not: more teamwork, more respect, more focus on the work.
Performance-based compensation is no cure-all, Ms. Salz acknowledged; otherwise "you'd see more people using it" than the 39 percent of advertisers who reported they did. Agency executives who responded said that 22.9 percent of their clients were compensating them based on performance.
Still, Ms. Salz said, performance-based compensation "offers a foundation for better advertising," primarily because it encourages agencies and clients to collaborate more, by "focusing on common goals."
"It's putting agencies in the same boat as clients," she added. "They are rowing or not rowing together."
For agencies, the survey indicated a potential bump in the road to more performance-based compensation: clients using it said they were likely to go beyond their agency rosters in assigning tasks in realms like strategy and marketing. Of course, the struggle to keep clients from seeking advice elsewhere has been one of the most pressing recent concerns among agency leaders.
The three reasons most often cited by advertisers for delegating tasks were expertise, wanting a new perspective and cost.
"With more on the line under performance-based compensation," Ms. Salz said, "advertisers are paying a lot more attention to how they're spending their money."
The survey was conducted in March and May for Salz Consulting by Thurm Marketing and Consulting Inc. in Princeton, N.J. Salz Consulting sponsors training seminars in agency relations and advertising development for marketers like Clorox, GTE and Hewlett-Packard.

HEADLINE: 13 Needless Deaths

 BODY:
The deaths of 13 farm workers in a vehicle crash in Five Points, Calif., underscores the need for better enforcement of the laws that protect farm laborers. The circumstances of Monday's accident are shocking but not uncommon -- an unlicensed driver ferrying 15 people home just before dawn in an overloaded van. It defies common sense that vans used for the express purpose of transporting such laborers are not required to have seat belts. Farm workers often have no alternative means of transportation to and from the fields.
These accidents are yet another mark of a callous system that exploits the migrant laborer, allowing growers to shirk accountability by using farm labor contractors as middlemen to hire and manage the workers. Although California has relatively tough laws protecting farm laborers, there are loopholes that place them at risk. The law requires that drivers of these vans be specially licensed, but in practice many are not. California already assigns officers to patrol the highway in the early morning hours to stop vehicles that violate occupancy and licensing laws. But these and other efforts to prevent violations need to be increased. 
 Steps must also be taken to force growers to take more responsibility for the general safety of their workers. Their political muscle has allowed them to abuse the system for too long.

HEADLINE: The Other Surplus Option

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, former Secretary of Labor, is a professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University and national editor of The American Prospect.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The way a debate is framed and choices are posed is often more important than which option is chosen. That's because the framing of the debate sends a powerful message to the public about what's at stake. It sets the boundaries of discourse. For politicians to stray beyond requires too much explaining and runs the risk of appearing irrelevant or radical.
The debate over what to do with the Federal budget surplus offers a case in point. Congressional Republicans want to use almost all of it for a tax cut. President Clinton argues that it should be used to pay off present and future obligations. "Save Social Security. Save Medicare. . . . And get America out of debt for the first time since 1835," he said last week in response to the Republican proposal. 
 Both alternatives -- cutting taxes and paying off obligations -- are attractive, if done equitably. Once the posturing is over, any final compromise is likely to feature some of each. But a third option -- to apply some of the surplus to public investments in our future -- is left out almost entirely.
By public investments I mean things that will make the nation more productive in the future but that individuals or businesses have little incentive to do on their own. Such public investments complement private investments. Without them, the private sector cannot sustain high returns over the long term.
Politicians once talked about public investment. This was a central theme of the President's 1992 campaign. Bill Clinton came to Washington stressing the urgency of dealing with "twin deficits" -- the budget deficit and America's failure to invest adequately in our people. We are far better able to afford public investment today than in 1992, when the deficit loomed large. Yet we're investing less, as a percentage of gross domestic product.
Basic research and development, for example, is the foundation for applied research by the private sector. The Internet emerged from basic research financed by the Government, and similar efforts cry out to be made in fields like physics and environmental remediation. Yet basic research hasn't kept up. In 1992, Federal investment in R & D was 0.43 percent of the gross domestic product. This year, it's 0.39 percent.
Likewise, an educated work force is essential if we are to reap the benefits of new technologies. Companies have been investing considerable sums in computers and digital gadgets, but chief executives complain that they can't find enough skilled people to use them.
Yet the problem goes much deeper than a chronic shortage of software engineers. One out of six Americans is functionally illiterate. Our classrooms are overcrowded and understaffed, some literally falling apart. In 1992, Federal investment in education and training made up 0.61 percent of G.D.P. This year -- as record numbers of students swell schools and colleges -- it's 0.58 percent.
The health of our nation's children, important for its own sake, is also important to our future prosperity. Yet 1 of every 4 children under 6 years of age is growing up in poverty. And although progress has been made in getting these children access to doctors, too many lack good nutrition and adequate care. In 1992, food and nutrition assistance (including school lunches and infant health) made up 0.53 percent of G.D.P. Now it's 0.40 percent.
The return from public investments in R & D, education, children's health and other essentials like highways and mass transit is often decades away. But our failure to invest adequately will also show up decades from now.
Because the Federal budget fails to distinguish between investing for tomorrow and spending on today (the normal distinction made by families and businesses in their own budgets), the concept of public investment has been debased by both sides. Either every favored budget item -- from farm programs to prescription drug benefits for the elderly -- is called an "investment," or everything the Government does is assumed to be spending that crowds out private investment.
But many other nations have figured out how to draw the distinction. There's a common-sense test. If it's likely to make us more productive in the future, it's an investment. If not, it's spending.
Granted, there are hard cases. Spending on national parks and environmental protection might be seen as investments, to the extent they make the future more livable. Yet spending on health care for the middle aged (like me), although desirable on other grounds, is probably not. But hard cases should not distract us from making the principled distinction.
Private investment is critical, of course. The best argument for cutting taxes and paying off financial obligations is that both free up money for the private sector, some of which will be invested. But the other portion will be consumed. And it is this distinction -- between investment and consumption -- that should be the focus, rather than the distinction between private and public.
Our future prosperity depends on the amount and wisdom of our private and public investments and on the restraint we show in our private and public consumption. Therein lies our real choice.

HEADLINE: William Slayton, 82, Official Who Aided Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
William L. Slayton, who moved against racial discrimination as Commissioner of Urban Renewal in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died on Saturday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was 82 and lived in Washington.
Mr. Slayton, a Kansas-born Democrat, worked for the Housing and Home Finance Agency and as an urban renewal expert for the Ford Foundation before President John F. Kennedy chose him in 1961 to be Commissioner of the Urban Renewal Administration. It was part of the Housing and Home Finance Agency, which was succeeded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Slayton held the post until 1966. 
 Early in 1962 he issued a policy letter notifying 539 local public agencies involved in urban renewal that all contracts with private developers had to specifically include this clause:
"The redeveloper will comply with all state and local laws, in effect from time to time, prohibiting discrimination or segregation by reason of race, religion, color, or national origin in the sale, lease, or occupancy of the property."
By then, 17 states and numerous cities had enacted measures against discrimination in housing. But until then, local public agencies had been required only to notify developers of the existence of such laws and to warn them that violators would be prohibited from further participation in urban renewal.
Charles Abrams, president of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing, pointed out that the new policy did not prevent discrimination by redevelopers in the South, where no anti-discrimination laws existed, as long as no restrictive covenants were employed. Mr. Slayton subsequently announced further steps to combat racial discrimination.
In mid-1962 the Urban Renewal Administration announced stiffer rules to insure that families displaced by urban-renewal projects were not left without decent housing. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had asserted that, in eight communities outside New York City, blacks had been displaced by urban-renewal projects and had not been relocated satisfactorily.
Mr. Slayton was something of a champion of the big cities. He said in a 1964 speech that they might continue to lose people and manufacturing to the suburbs, but they could still survive as major cultural and entertainment areas, financial centers and special marketing outlets.
In 1964 the Urban Renewal Administration announced that more than 100,000 acres in 177 communities had been set aside for recreational and scenic uses under the Federal-state-local open-space land program. Mr. Slayton said then that almost half of the grants being issued had gone to metropolitan areas with populations of more than one million.
In the same year, The New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote that recent urban-renewal and other government-aided construction included "some handsome buildings and some well-planned projects, and the Urban Renewal Administration, under its design-conscious head, William L. Slayton, can point to some obvious, if occasionally partial, successes."
As Commissioner, Mr. Slayton was popular and widely regarded as an able official. But he resigned in 1966, after being passed over for two assistant secretary posts in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, after it succeeded the Housing and Home Finance Agency.
He went on to become president of Urban America Inc., a nonprofit organization in Washington concerned with the crisis in the cities. The other posts he held in his later years included Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Buildings.
A native of Topeka, Kan., he received degrees in municipal government and in public administration from the University of Chicago.
His survivors include his wife of 58 years, the former Mary Pritchard; two daughters, Betsy Slayton Campbell of Salt Lake City and Barbara Jean Slayton Shelton of East Quogue, N.Y.; a brother, Clarence H. Slayton Jr. of Mount Airy, Va., and four grandchildren.

3 Big Makers Of Aluminum Seek a Merger

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney of France and the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland confirmed today that they are in merger talks that could create the biggest company in the aluminum industry, a business plagued for nearly a decade by oversupply and depressed prices.
The potential combination may be a signal of other big cross-border deals and could lead to stable or higher prices for aluminum, a basic industrial metal. 
 Although executives of the companies said they were still in discussions and an agreement was not certain, their talks were a vivid illustration of how corporate consolidation is achieving global scale.
The three-way combination under consideration would create an aluminum and packaging giant with more than $26 billion in annual revenue, easily eclipsing the $15.5 billion in revenue of the current No. 1, Alcoa of the United States.
The three companies make aluminum used in products ranging from aircraft bodies to cooking foil, as well as packaging for drugs and food. In addition, the Swiss company, informally known as Algroup, has a profitable specialty chemicals division, which would probably be sold if the merger talks succeed.
The aluminum business has been badly depressed since the early 90's, when the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the biggest producers of aluminum, led to undisciplined selling by Russian exporters in a quest for foreign currency. Aluminum supplies surged and prices fell. The supply glut was aggravated in the last two years by the severe economic problems in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
In addition, mergers in the automotive and aircraft industries have created huge global customers with the buying power to keep prices low.
Thus, world aluminum prices have fallen about 30 percent since the late 80's and touched a five-year low in March, hurting the earnings of big producers and raising pressure on them to find partners.
In brief identical statements, Alcan Aluminium, Pechiney and Algroup would say only that they were in discussions regarding a "potential business combination." News of their discussions was reported today in The Wall Street Journal.
"There are talks, there have been talks, but there's no deal yet," said Marcel Barthe, a spokesman for Alcan Aluminium, at the company's headquarters in Montreal. The talks were conducted against a background of mergers in other metals industries, all of which have been hurt to varying degrees by low prices. In June, British Steel agreed to acquire the Dutch steelmaker Royal Hoogovens for $2.3 billion, and last year two huge German steelmakers joined to form Thyssen Krupp A.G.
But deals have unraveled, too. Indeed, Algroup last year announced an $8.7 billion merger with Viag, the German utility and aluminum maker, but the deal collapsed. Earlier, two big Swiss chemical producers, Ciba Specialty Chemicals A.G. and Clariant A.G., canceled a stock swap.
In some cases, the deals that succeeded reflect new-found attention to shareholder value at European corporations, many of which number among their major shareholders large American and British pension funds eager for returns. But many deals simply reflect the volatility of commodity prices and the need to gain scale and reduce costs to inject some stability into the business.
"They see the potential to unlock value, so that everyone comes away a winner," said Peter Davey, an analyst with Societe Generale Securities. Through the companies' mixture of primary aluminum production, packaging and other activities varied, he said, there was sufficient overlapping to justify consolidation.
Rene Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, agreed. "Pechiney and Alusuisse have food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic packaging operations that overlap, and both Alusuisse and Alcan have aluminum plants in eastern Switzerland," he said.
In the United States, officials for both Alcoa and the Aluminum Association, a trade group, declined to comment on such a merger's impact.
But many investors seemed to think that a deal represented good news, with the creation of a huge global manufacturer that would not necessarily have to cut prices to thrive.
"This is a very big positive for the entire aluminum industry," said Daniel A. Roling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities.
In Paris, shares of Pechiney rose intraday to a 52-week high of 54.20 euros before falling back to close at 51.05 euros, or $54.63, down 1.3 percent. Algroup's shares rose 3.8 percent in Zurich to 1,810 Swiss francs, or $1,210. And in Toronto, Alcan Aluminium turned in the best performance of the would-be partners, gaining 6.2 percent to $50.50 (Canadian), or $33.68 (United States). Alcoa gained 81.25 cents, closing at $66.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Though a deal could face formidable obstacles, including possible monopoly challenges by European Union regulators, who said today that they had been informed of the talks last week, it is expected to set off a scramble for partners among smaller aluminum producers, like Norsk Hydro of Norway and the VAW Aluminum subsidiary of Viag.
Under the terms of the deal that the companies are looking at, Pechiney and Algroup stockholders are expected to receive shares of Alcan in exchange for their shares. The planned combination would have its headquarters in Montreal and would be led by Alcan's president and chief executive, Jacques Bougie. Jean-Pierre Rodier, Pechiney's chairman, is expected to be named chief operating officer.
All three companies have similar activities, producing primary aluminum from basic raw materials and turning it into such products as rolled aluminum and ingots from which aluminum products are made.
But Alcan Aluminium, which hired Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as adviser in the discussions, is by far the most profitable of the three, yielding pretax profit equivalent to 10.5 percent of revenue, compared with 9.6 percent at Algroup and 6.6 percent at Pechiney.
Pechiney has been using Credit Suisse First Boston while Algroup has been using Goldman, Sachs as adviser.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA;
A 'Brave Thing,' Writing Verse, Especially at Poetry Camp

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: IDYLLWILD, Calif.

 BODY:
The poet, famously quiet in the face of the noise of life, is used to finding sustenance, even inspiration, in silence, but as I discovered on my first day of poetry camp, there is poetic silence, and then there is the other kind.
We were just getting acquainted, my poet classmates and I, on a brilliant morning in this mountain resort a mile above the desert near Los Angeles, gingerly offering supportive comments as each participant read aloud the first in-class assignment, a sort of free-association piece about our early memories of speech. 
 I was happy not to go first, and delighted when an elementary school teacher who read a poem unrelated to the theme still drew smiling responses. But all the hesitation I'd brought to this experiment in personal reinvention returned when an older woman, a children's book author, read a touching, well-shaped poem about helping her grandmother with a crossword puzzle as a child. It was thoughtful and, worst of all, confident.
When my turn arrived, I steeled myself and was reminded why middle-aged journalists so rarely attempt this sort of psychic bungee jumping. For years I have written newspaper articles read by a million people a day, but I had never felt so, well, naked, holding a legal pad and preparing to read a few lines of verse about, of all things, myself.
I declaimed what I imagined to be a rhapsodic if rambling poem, composed in 10 minutes or so, comparing my earliest search for words with recollections of my daughter's first utterances. Not exactly the T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound I had studied in graduate school, I thought, but not an unworthy notion. Then I looked up and met the stares, and silence, of my 11 classmates.
"Anyone want to comment?" the teacher, Cecilia Woloch, a nimble, gentle poet, eventually asked. She has taught everywhere, from a prison to elementary schools. After a painful pause, she filled the vacuum with a few words, noting how novel were my descriptions of smearing peanut butter across my face as a toddler and of using the knob of a toy cabinet as a telephone receiver. More silence.
It was both humbling and, once the shock wore off, invigorating.
"I thought this was really, really hard," one of my classmates, an author of adventure books for children, said a couple of days later after reading an unflinchingly personal poem in which she artfully wrote about her mother as a glacier.
Ms. Woloch replied, "It's supposed to be."
We were, in fact, part of a quietly expanding trend in the country, ordinary people seizing the notion that they have something important to say through prose or poetry and paying good money to shape their voices. My colleagues included a middle-aged physician who had never done serious writing, a handwriting analyst, a Silicon Valley computer engineer, a real estate broker, a water utility worker and a music editor.
(The Idyllwild program cost $295 for three days of workshops, lectures and readings and an additional $175 for a private room in the dormitories and meals in the cafeteria, relatively cheap by workshop standards.)
The program avoided any deep exploration of traditional meter or poetic forms, although one section used haiku and tanka in its exercises, but neither did it merely encourage undisciplined and emotive doodlings. There were both in-class and overnight writing exercises, based on specific sets of random words or ideas. Our poems grew increasingly personal and careful in their use of language as the week progressed, and we analyzed the writing closely for both content and style.
David Fenza, the executive director of a trade organization called Associated Writing Programs, said that the number of degree-granting programs in creative writing had grown from 13 three decades ago to slightly more than 300 today. And he said the number of qualified summer writing workshops has leaped from a minuscule few to almost 100 registered with his group.
Another source, "The Guide to Writers' Conferences," by Shaw Guides, lists 359 conferences, seminars and workshops of various kinds, many for established writers who must submit manuscripts to get in, but plenty for rank amateurs. They range from the old and well-known Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in Vermont, operated by Middlebury College, to the Squaw Valley Community of Writers in Nevada City, Calif.
The conferences are often in resort communities, like Key West, Fla.; Provincetown, Mass.; Sun Valley, Idaho, and Taos, N.M., which can make them seem little more than slightly cerebral vacations. But the deeply emotional character of the writing and the pithy quality of the poems written by the Idyllwild group suggested that more was at work.
One woman wrote of teaching Emily Dickinson the domestic art of folding a baby's laundry, only to have the famous poet discover that gently tucking together socks was not unlike composing one of her poems.
"I've been doing various kinds of workshops for years, and there are always wonderful surprises," said Ms. Woloch, who would offer, "I think you caught a fish" when a student read a winner to the class.
John Brandi, a poet from New Mexico who taught another section of the workshop, said: "People get down to this. They write poetry. It's a brave thing."
The depth of interest was evident at Idyllwild, a pretty town of cabins and small inns 110 miles southeast of Los Angeles in the San Jacinto Mountains, the home of a music and arts boarding school during the year. There has been a summer arts program here for 50 years, and about 1,200 people now take courses or workshops.
This year the nonprofit organization that runs the site, the Idyllwild Arts Foundation, offered a poetry workshop for the first time. It had been inspired by signs of growing national interest in such courses and a sense that, as John Maguire, the senior consultant to the program and the retired president of Claremont Graduate University, put it, "Poetry offers a spiritual core for a society that seems to lack one."
Not only were the three-day workshops filled almost instantly when the brochures were first sent out months ago, but the foundation also added a second section in each session and expanded the number of slots to about a dozen per class, from an anticipated 10. The foundation is planning a further expansion next year because of the demand, Mr. Maguire said, and it has already lined up two writers as visiting poets: Billy Collins, author of several books of poetry, and Mary Karr, who wrote "The Liars' Club."
"Part of what drives the summer programs is what drives the whole economy, aging boomers," Mr. Fenza said. "The kids are out of the house, people are divorced, people are reinventing themselves. For some it's a spiritual crisis. For some it's the start of a real commitment to a different way of life."
There were two poets in residence, Naomi Shihab Nye, who has published two books of verse and a number of children's books and has appeared on several PBS and National Public Radio shows, and Thomas Lux, who teaches at Sarah Lawrence College and has published his poems widely and won several awards and fellowships. They said they were receiving an increasing number of invitations to appear at workshops; Mr. Lux said he was attending four this summer.
"I have a theory on why adults are writing more poetry," he said. "They're usually very accomplished people who've wanted to get back to the 60's or whatever, and now they have a chance to do that. They have the time and they have the money, and the interest hasn't gone away."
My own poems did improve considerably from the peanut butter-smeared face of the first day, even if they did not ascend the emotional summits. Perhaps most satisfying was an exercise in which I had to use both Muhammad Ali and cooking in a poem. I turned it into a lesson, in which the whimsical and inventive boxer taught me how to cook for my children, persuading me in the process that although I had believed I cooked quite well and that my children were well fed, they were, in fact, hungry -- a verse, of course, about my metaphorical efforts to refresh my use of language. Well, it was a start.
Ken Karman, the music editor who was my classmate, had turned the trip into a family experience. His wife took a painting class, and his teen-age son was studying electric bass. He said he felt he had almost no facility with words and was awkward in the first exercises without anything very clear to say.
But on our final morning he suddenly blurted out that right then and there he had written a poem and was eager to read it. It was a jazzlike verse about his father, as a philandering hipster in a two-seat sports car, and the impression he had made on the child.
"I think you caught a fish," Ms. Woloch said.

HEADLINE: With Concerts and Web Site, U.N. Agency Attacks Poverty

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Bidding to fight poverty with music and megabits, the United Nations Development Program and Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of data communications gear, have enlisted a dozen popular entertainers to kick off an Internet-based initiative to help the world's poor.
The new project, called Netaid, appears to represent the most extensive partnership the United Nations has ever formed with private enterprise in trying to relieve poverty in the developing world. The development program is casting about for ways to advance its anti-poverty mission even as countries including Denmark and Germany have slashed their contributions to the agency. 
 Cisco, which makes makes much of the complex communications equipment that forms the synapses of cyberspace, has agreed to underwrite the Netaid project with assistance from KPMG, the consulting firm, and Akamai Technologies, an Internet communications company. Cisco and KPMG have each agreed to spend up to $20 million on the project, according to people close to the companies.
"It's not unprecedented in that we on many fronts are starting to engage with the private sector," said Mark Malloch Brown, who took over as administrator of the U.N.D.P. last month after serving as a vice president of the World Bank. "However, there has been nothing attempted on this scale and of this ambition before. For us, this is a quantum step up from the previous level of collaboration with the private sector."
Netaid's public debut is scheduled for Oct. 9, when the group will stage overlapping concerts at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N. J., Wembley Stadium in London and the Palais des Nations in Geneva featuring musicians including Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend and Jewel. The MTV and VH1 cable television channels have agreed to televise the concerts in the United States; the British Broadcasting Corporation will televise them in Britain.
But Cisco and Mr. Malloch Brown say that Netaid is not just another charity telethon. The heart of Netaid is not the concerts, they say, but a Web site (www.netaid.org) being created to allow people around the world to participate in antipoverty efforts long after the music is over.
The Web site will be intended to allow, say, a church group in Iowa to make contact with a needy church in Indonesia. The U.N.D.P. plans to work with nongovernmental organizations to develop the site.
"The money raised is not the measure of success of this project," Mr. Malloch Brown said in an interview yesterday. "This is organized very differently from the earlier things like We Are the World or Live Aid, which were intended to meet the immediate knee-jerk fund-raising potential of the event. For me, the money will come, but it will come out of building a very large group of people in the millions who will keep coming back to the issues through the Web site."
He added, "People who write their Congressman or organize a local chapter of Oxfam will be making at least as significant and perhaps more significant contribution than someone who writes a $15 check."
The others scheduled to appear at the Netaid concerts are Bush, the Corrs, Counting Crows, Celine Dion, the Eurythmics with Annie Lennox, Wyclef Jean with Bono, Michael Kamen and Orchestra, George Michael and Robbie Williams. It is not clear which artists will appear at which concerts. Netaid plans to add a few more artists to the lineup.

Blockbuster Closes at Its Offering Price

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
Shares of Blockbuster Inc. closed unchanged yesterday from the offering price after the video rental chain's $465 million initial public stock offering, reflecting investors' view of the company as a well-known name offering few surprises.
Blockbuster priced 31 million shares at $15 each, below the expected range of $16 to $18 on Tuesday. 
 The Dallas-based Blockbuster has about 6,500 stores in 27 countries. Blockbuster's stores captured a 27 percent market share in the United States in 1998, according to an industry estimate from Paul Kagan Associates.
It plans to open approximately 1,500 new company-operated United States stores by 2001, with 200 new franchise stores. International expansion plans call for 170 new company-operated stores and 125 franchises over the next three years.
The market for initial offerings has been less than receptive in recent weeks as the flow of deals has begun to smother buyer interest and the stock market in general is weighed down with interest rate fears.
Blockbuster was carved out of the media and entertainment group Viacom Inc., which bought it in 1994. Blockbuster has been in operation since 1985.

Many LatinStocks Leave Home, Trading on Wall Street

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 11

 BODY:
For the first time since he started trading stocks 16 years ago, Helio Ozaki, the chief trader at a small securities firm here, is shifting his focus to Manhattan. His firm is planning to move much of its trading of Brazilian shares to the New York Stock Exchange because declining volume and high transaction costs have sapped much of the activity on the local stock market.
"This is one of the most melancholic times of my career," said Mr. Ozaki, 40, in an interview at his trading desk on Avenida Paulista, a skyscraper strip that is the Wall Street of Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial capital. "Foreigners have lost their interest in the Brazilian market, and we Brazilians are being forced to trade our own stocks in the United States." 
 Since Brazil's Government imposed a tax on financial transactions in June, volume on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest market, has dropped by a third. With many banks and brokerage firms opting to trade in international centers like New York and London, the Sao Paulo market has become a victim of a trend that has spread through Latin America in the 1990's.
While markets like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are thriving, and even considering issuing shares to the public, their counterparts in Latin America are struggling to survive. The institutions in the region once synonymous with capitalism could fall prey to the volatile capital flows that once fueled their success.
"This is what happens when the migration of capital turns so free," said Ivan Sant'Anna, 58, who left a career as a trader in the Brazilian and United States markets to become an author of novels of financial intrigue.
One of the most telling indicators of the problems faced by Latin markets is a region-wide plunge in trading volume. After swelling when foreign interest in Latin equities reached a peak in mid-1997, volume has fallen in markets from Bogota to Buenos Aires.
From July 1997 to July 1999, the average daily trading volume on the Sao Paulo exchange fell by 75 percent, in Mexico City by 48 percent, in Lima by 69 percent, in Buenos Aires by 37 percent and in Bogota by 74 percent, according to Economatica, an economic research firm here.
Some smaller exchanges, like the Maracaibo stock market in Venezuela, have shut down. Others, like the 156-year-old Rio de Janeiro exchange have made radical changes to stay alive. Last month, the Rio exchange switched from the old-fashioned auction system with screaming floor traders to an electronic trading system similar to the Nasdaq.
This is not the first time Latin America's stock exchanges have suffered a decline in business. Over the years, they have been subject to swings between euphoria and despair.
"Similar phenomena occurred in 1914 with massive capital flight out of Brazil to Europe to help fund the First World War," said Gail Triner, an economic historian at Rutgers University.
Yet there are signs that this latest bout with fickle money flows may test Latin markets in new ways.
Transnational corporate takeovers have rocked some exchanges. When Repsol of Spain acquired YPF S.A. of Argentina earlier this year, it chose to delist the big oil company from the Buenos Aires market. In one swoop, the exchange lost one of its largest companies and about 15 percent of its market capitalization.
Another factor is the proliferation of American depository receipts, or A.D.R.'s. These securities represent shares of foreign stocks that can be traded in the United States. Foreign companies can also raise money in United States markets by issuing new A.D.R.'s. And there are similar securities called global depository receipts that can be listed on stock exchanges in other financial centers, like London.
Latin America's largest companies have increasingly used these securities in the last few years, starting in 1990 with the region's first A.D.R., from Compania de Telecomunicaciones de Chile. There are now 95 Latin A.D.R.'s listed on the New York Stock Exchange and a handful more on Nasdaq, according to Guzman & Company, a Miami-based securities firm.
"The growth of A.D.R.'s happened after companies sensed they could widen their investor base," said Leo Guzman, the firm's president.
Many of these securities were listed in the mid-1990's, when much of Latin America, aside from Mexico, was buoyed by strong flows of foreign investment into local stock markets. With business going well, resistance to this trend, and others that strained local exchanges, was not that strong. That has changed.
"It is worrisome that the authorities are standing by while the capital markets of this country are being squeezed," said Alfredo Rizkallah, the president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, which is known as the Bovespa.
Nowhere are the problems of Latin America's stock markets more apparent now than in Brazil. Last week, the Bovespa's 300 floor traders halted dealings for half an hour to protest the shift in business to the New York Stock Exchange, where costs are cheaper largely because of the financial-transaction tax here. The traders received support from their brokerage houses and the administration of the stock exchange.
The tax on almost all financial transactions is part of the Government's effort to contain the budget deficit, a piece of discipline that is a critical component of an aid agreement with the International Monetary Fund that has helped stabilize Brazil since the currency crisis in January.
Over one year, the Government hopes to collect about $9 billion from the tax, which has proved easier to collect than income tax or many corporate taxes, since the banking system is closely regulated by the central bank.
The tax shows another weakness that has contributed to troubles at Brazilian stock exchanges: the deficit. Since Brazil has had difficulty reining in public spending, many investors have cut their holdings of Brazilian securities because they feel this stifles economic growth. The deficit also contributes to a low domestic savings rate, which translates into less capital to invest in stocks.

The Traffic Congestion Strangling New York

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

 BODY:
People on California's central coast have decided that gridlock and congestion just do not mesh well with their life style.
Last week the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission approved a plan to put five miles of high-occupancy/toll (HOT) lanes on Highway 1. While those in carpools, buses and vans would ride in the designated lanes free of charge, solo motorists would pay a variable toll that would be higher during rush hours and lower in the off-peak. Like similar lanes in San Diego and Houston, the HOT lanes would free space in general-purpose lanes. Toll revenue would help finance the lanes. 
 In the New York metropolitan area, the vast majority of folks seem content to spend large chunks of their waking hours inhaling fumes in bumper-to-bumper traffic and using their vehicles as some kind of mobile study outfitted with books on tape, cell phones and CD's. Local radio and television stations nowadays cover rush hour in the region as if gridlock were a natural phenomenon beyond human control, right up there with Nor'easters. Some people even see clogged streets as an indicator of prosperity -- great for the economy and the area's future.
This mindset does not augur well for that future. Travel times in the region are 40 percent longer than they would be if traffic flowed freely, according to the Texas Transportation Institute, which reviewed 1996 data from 70 metropolitan regions. Fuel wasted annually in traffic jams amounts to 51 gallons per capita and 63 gallons per driver. Congestion's cost -- adding the price of delay and wasted gas -- makes the New York region second in the nation in dollars squandered, wasting $9.8 billion in 1996, just behind Los Angeles.
This is not, of course, a new problem. A mid-1980's congestion study clocked the average commute to Manhattan from eight communities, all of them a mere 15 miles away. Under free-flow conditions, reaching Manhattan took anywhere from 20 minutes (Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn) or 21 minutes (Yonkers) to no more than 34 minutes (Little Neck, Queens). Rush-hour trips from these points took anywhere from a maximum of 47 minutes (Yonkers) to 49 minutes (Sheepshead Bay) or 1 hour 10 minutes (Little Neck). Things have only gotten worse since then.
More and better rapid transit -- a new trans-Hudson commuter tube from the west, a new subway on Manhattan's East Side and improved rail service from the other directions -- would surely help. Cutting aid for new roads and sewers and other incentives that promote sprawl and auto use is another good idea. But these ideas, which take years to institute, have yet to make the jump from press release to firm policy.
Political leaders ought to declare rush-hour road space a scarce, underpriced commodity, similar to the services utilities offer. Power and telecommunications companies use peak and off-peak prices to vary the cost of their products and modulate demand. Similarly, there should be variable tolls on some stretches of road and major bridges and tunnels, higher at rush hour and lower when fewer cars are on the roads. At the very least, the region should experiment with variable tolls on all or most of the bridges and tunnels leading to Manhattan -- including the toll-free bridges on the East River, which charged a fee until Mayor William Gaynor removed the tolls early in the century.
Regrettably, neither the Governors of New York and New Jersey nor the Mayor of New York City seem eager to let market forces rule rush hour, even though all three are Republicans and, presumably, believers in the market's wisdom. The only congestion-pricing experiment in the region is a modest one for trucks on the Tappan Zee Bridge.
The New York region has spent the last decade ducking opportunities to use variable pricing, despite Federal mandates to produce cleaner air and the area's thirst for more jobs. Those needs, plus the quality-of-life gains that smoother traffic would bring, should persuade local politicians to give market forces a try.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Big Companies Back a New Web Site Aimed at Blacks

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
A group of big media and technology companies has agreed to back BET Holdings, which operates several black-oriented cable television stations, in establishing an elaborate Internet service aimed at black Americans.
BET has raised $35 million for the project from the Microsoft Corporation, USA Networks, the News Corporation and AT&T's Liberty Media unit, which is a minority owner of BET. The service, which is known as BET.Com, is scheduled to be introduced on Nov. 1 and will replace the company's existing joint venture with Microsoft, MSBET. 
 While the earlier site mainly focused on links to programming on BET's Black Entertainment Television network, the new site will have a broader range of offerings including news, E-mail, shopping and -- most important -- chat rooms and other features to help build a community within the World Wide Web site.
So far, blacks have been less active on the Internet than has the overall population. Forrester Research estimates that 23 percent of the 12 million black households are on line, compared with 34 percent of white households. But on-line use by blacks is increasing faster, Forrester notes.
"Until now, African-Americans have found the Internet hard to use, expensive and at the end of the day they said 'There's nothing here for me,' " said Robert L. Johnson, the chairman and majority owner of BET. "We're going to change that."
Mr. Johnson said the audience was poised to increase now that the price of computers and Internet access had fallen sharply and in some cases could be had free.
The company hopes to make money by selling advertising and by selling merchandise, including urban apparel, black-oriented music and collectible items.
The BET venture will compete with several existing sites aimed at blacks, all of which are backed by major media companies. The largest is Blackvoices.com, an offering of the Tribune Company, which says it serves 500,000 users a month who look at a total of 14 million pages. Net Noir (www.Netnoir.com), which is 20 percent owned by America Online, is a close second. Blackfamilies.com is another and is operated by Cox Communications.
E. David Ellington, the chairman of Net Noir, said tht he was not worried about the BET venture, despite the company's well-known name and the promotional power of its television network.
"This is a new medium and it needs new brands," he said. "Name a big media company that has done well on the Web."
Mr. Ellington said that Net Noir was raising $10 million to $15 million from venture capital funds and that it was about to add new features to its site.
Barry Cooper, the president of Blackvoices.com, said that the Tribune Company was considering selling a portion of the Internet service to raise money to compete with BET.
"If it takes $35 million to stay at the top, we'll raise $35 million," he said.
Mr. Cooper said Blackvoices.com had found limited success trying to sell advertising and merchandise on line.
"African-Americans are new to the Internet, and to expect them to give their credit cards on line is a bit of a stretch," he said. The company has found a profitable niche selling job listings from large companies that are seeking to attract a diverse work force. Serving this need works well with the largest group of blacks Internet users: office workers who surf at their jobs.
Mr. Johnson, however, said that BET expected that its consumers would ultimately shop on line and that the service could help enable a new group of black entrepreneurs to find ways to sell their products on line.
"There is tremendous wealth being created in the Internet economy that African-Americans should be a part of," he said. "The Internet can give us the opportunity to control our own destiny by cutting out the middle man."

HEADLINE: Solomon Dutka, 75, Founder Of Marketing Research Firm

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Solomon Dutka, who started a marketing research firm in a one-room office in New York City in 1953 that grew into one of the largest companies in the industry, died on Saturday at his home in Riverdale, the Bronx.
Mr. Dutka, who was 75, was the chairman of Audits and Surveys Worldwide, with operations in more than 90 countries. His death was caused by complications from a stroke, the company said. 
 Mr. Dutka was born in the Bronx on Nov. 5, 1923, the son of a tailor. He graduated from City College with degrees in mathematical statistics and physics before joining the United States Army during World War II. While in the armed forces, Mr. Dutka worked as a nuclear physicist on the Manhattan Project, which earned him a citation from the Secretary of War for his efforts.
He began his career in marketing research with a teaching position at Columbia University. He became the chief statistician at Dun & Bradstreet and Elmo Roper Associates before leaving to start a business first called Audits and Surveys Inc.
The company eventually grew into one of the most respected firms of its type, representing clients like the Coca-Cola Company and the Xerox Corporation.
Audits and Surveys became a publicly traded company in 1994 and was acquired by the London-based United News Media earlier this year. Mr. Dutka continued to serve as the chairman after the acquisition.
He wrote books and articles on research methodologies and their practical applications. In a 1996 commencement address to the graduate school of Baruch College, he warned the new graduates of the dangers of conventional thinking.
Mr. Dutka served as an American statistical associate delegate to the United Nations subcommittee on statistical sampling and was a member of the United States Census Advisory Committee. He was a fellow of the American Statistical Association and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
He was also a past president of the Market Research Council, a trade group, which presented him with its 1984 Hall of Fame Award for his contributions to the practice of market research.
Mr. Dutka also served on the boards of Daytop Village, a narcotics treatment center; the Neurosciences Institute, and numerous other social, scientific, academic and cultural organizations.
He is survived by his wife, Joyce; two sons, James of Santa Monica, Calif., and Michael of Doylestown, Pa., and three stepsons, David Fried of Montpelier, Vt.; Barry Fried of Makawao, Hawaii, and Stephen Fried of New York.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Seek Using Farm Products in Lieu of Fossil Fuel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton will announce a long-term effort on Thursday to help replace coal, oil, natural gas and uranium with farm products, crop wastes and trees to make things as diverse as electricity, pharmaceuticals and car fuel and forks.
In an executive order, the President will set a goal of working with various industries to triple the amount of energy generated from such products by 2010. The order, White House officials said, will also instruct the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to write plans to coordinate research, create markets and take other steps to nurture "renewable technologies." 
 The Administration also plans to develop proposals for research grants and tax credits to promote such technologies.
Administration officials predict that developing more uses for agricultural products will result in $15 billion to $20 billion in additional farm income by 2010 and less use of imported oil.
"Essentially all of society in the last 100 years has been built on petroleum as the energy and raw material," said a participant in the effort, Dr. Robert R. Dorsch, director of biotechnology development at Du Pont.
"We need to go from black gold to green gold," Mr. Dorsch said.
Du Pont is working on an improved polyester based on natural sugars instead of petroleum, and is hoping that with Federal research money and coordination, the price of such sugars will fall.
Other companies that have been working with the Government over the last nine months contend that motor fuels, solvents and electricity can be made from natural materials, known as biomass, on a cost-effective basis, with a reduction in pollution. The discussions have included major companies in agriculture, chemicals, oil, natural gas and forestry, as well as genetic engineering and other high-tech companies.
"We're looking at taking things we currently just throw away, making them profitable, fighting global warming and cleaning the environment at the same time," said Roger Ballentine, the deputy assistant to the President for environmental initiatives.
Vice President Al Gore, who has emphasized Federal promotion of new technology as well as environmentalism and support for farmers, said today in a telephone interview that the initiative would "help insure that the agricultural economy is part of the new economy."
The Vice President said that the effort did not yet involve allocating money but that some money would be redirected from other programs, mostly in the Energy and Agriculture Departments. More Federal attention could encourage use of natural materials, he said, and would be "a very significant step forward."
Past efforts to use natural materials have been stymied in part by falling prices for oil and natural gas. But proponents of the idea say the drive to reduce pollution and technological advances in biology and materials science will help them.
Biomass now accounts for about 3 percent of national energy use, including processes as simple as home heating with wood.
Some agricultural processing companies expect big markets if they can make new products that have environmental benefits, at equal cost. Cargill Inc., for example, has a venture with Dow Chemical to produce polylactic acid, a polymer that can be used instead of petroleum-based products like polystyrene in insulated cups, and polyethylene in soft drink bottles. The acid can also be used for garbage bags or for clothing fibers. Unlike plastics, it breaks down completely in a compost heap.
"It could be made from any kind of organic biomass," said Robert R. Parmelee, president of bioscience division of Cargill.
Polylactic acid is now made from sugar from corn kernels and other high-value products, but with a few technical advances it could be made from parts of the plant with lower value or none at all, like corn stalks, Mr. Parmelee said.
"Over time, if you really want to make this big, then raw material costs are going to have to come down," he said.
The Government is already involved in many biomass projects, but the participants see greater potential. For example, the Energy Department contributed $1.3 million to pay for equipment at the Northern Indiana Power Company's Bailly Generating Station in Burns Harbor to mix wood chips with the coal. The result was less nitrogen oxide, which contributes to smog, less sulfur dioxide, which makes acid rain, and less carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause climate change. But the company would like to try a different system of using wood, cooking it into a gas that can be burned at very high efficiencies in a turbine, said Arthur E. Smith, Jr., the environmental officer at Nisource, which is Northern Indiana's corporate parent.

HEADLINE: Drought Forces Farmers Into Unprofitable Livestock Sales

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Va., Aug. 11

 BODY:
The endless bawling of calves being separated from their mothers sounded doubly pitiful today here at the auction block. For the cattle ranchers were hurting, too, as they unloaded their livestock at an emergency sale in order to cut their mounting losses from the deepening drought.
"Out of water, out of grass," said Swanson Dowling, one of the local ranchers who came by all day to the Monterey Livestock Sales auction yard to commiserate with one another and reluctantly shed large parts of their herds, which are proving increasingly expensive to maintain given the searing heat and the lack of rainfall. 
 The emergency sales this month and last in some of the hardest-hit areas of Virginia and West Virginia are providing a graphic measure of the economic impact of the drought gripping the nation's Eastern farm belt.
"I estimate we'll lose 10 percent of the state's 21,000 farms," said Gus R. Douglass, the Commissioner of Agriculture in West Virginia, where the entire state -- like all of Connecticut and parts of New York, Virginia and four other Eastern states -- has been declared a Federal farm disaster area.
"We're having a most unusual mass marketing of livestock all through the drought region," Mr. Douglass said, adding that "35 percent of our water wells have failed" in West Virginia. He noted that the state had been forced to start laying pipe to tap into emergency flood control dams in the areas suffering the most and to haul water in by National Guard tankers.
The severity of the conditions varies widely across the drought-hit Middle Atlantic States. In Pennsylvania, the nation's fourth-largest dairy state, milk production is down at least 20 percent because of the drought, according to state agricultural monitors. Estimates of losses in basic crops like corn, soybeans, feed hay and garden vegetables vary from 30 percent to 100 percent across the state, said Bob Bunty, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Agriculture Department.
In Maryland, where farmers are searching for ever more costly feed beyond their seared fields, the state is instituting a cover crop program in an effort to retain moisture and prevent soil erosion. Under the program, emergency plantings of barley, rye and winter wheat will be undertaken with 87 percent state financing -- provided that enough ground moisture arrives by autumn planting time.
"Our main concern now is that the pasture land in central Maryland is all burned out and our farmers are already dipping into winter supplies," said Harold Kanarek of the State Agriculture Department. "We had droughts in '97 and '98, and this might be the one that pushes farmers over the edge," Mr. Kanarek said of the fears of failure among hundreds of the state's 12,000 farms.
There is nothing new under the sun about the risks and vagaries of the agricultural industry. East of here, there are wineries anticipating a bumper crop of grapes that are sweetening beautifully now in the relentless blaze of the summer.
But here in the rich Shenandoah region, vital pastures glare fallow in endless swaths of yellow worthy of van Gogh, long burnt out by the 14-month-old drought. Feed intended for winter use is already running short, and water is being hauled. No end of the drought is predicted, and ranchers warn that problems can compound: free-flowing water is healthiest for stock, while ponds and other still waters that are now the emergency resort increase the risk of disease.
"I sold a $100 ton of hay for $150 here two weeks ago," said Kenny Hoffman, a buyer from Columbia City, Ind., who brought the hay in when he came to bid at the emergency cattle auctions. "That farmer turned around and sold it for $200. That's how bad things are here."
And Mr. Dowling, a rancher for 25 years, said: "There's never been a time like this. Old-timers are saying not since the dust-bowl days of the 30's."
Normally calves far fatter and more profitable would come to auction in the autumn. But ranchers are being forced either to run up more debt by buying feed and hauling in water or to cull their herds earlier and far more deeply than usual.
The immediate result is a price perhaps $100 less than a calf would typically fetch, or about $3,200 less for Mr. Dowling's yearlings. The owner of a larger ranch just over the state line in West Virginia suffered a $40,000 loss in similarly having to cut corners.
Beyond the calf sales, the longer-range threat is that ranchers like Mr. Dowling are also being forced to sell their mature cows and bulls -- as much as two-thirds of his basic 40-head herd, he said. They thus reduce their reproductive inventory and their ability to rebound well from the drought. Indeed, Mr. Douglass, the West Virginia Agriculture Commissioner, said this forced culling meant that genetic lines of the ranchers' foundation herds would be damaged well after the return of the rains.
"The only thing surviving out there is the chicken industry," Mr. Douglass said. "But their wells are starting to go dry, and that could create a domino effect."
For example, West Virginia may be forced to consider curtailing water to a principal chicken processing factory in Moorefield, a town on the Potomac River, in order to guarantee good water to communities downstream. This could affect 1,700 slaughterhouse workers, which, in turn, could crimp the livelihood of hundreds of poultry broiler growers.
In Maryland, the region's chief poultry state, officials say the large agribusiness producers are weathering the drought so far with no threat to production. These companies have multiple deep wells, but officials are nonetheless tracking them, given rainfall in the last year 14 inches below normal for the region.
Back here in Monterey, "we've never moved anywhere near this amount of livestock in July and August," said Sherry Sullenberger, manager of the Monterey Livestock Sales auction yard, which has put on three emergency sales, with others scattered all about the Virginias. "But our hay crop is probably less than half of what it should be. Some farmers have even come in and gotten rid of all their sheep. Some are going to have to go out of business."
Out in the yard, truck after truck arrived with cattle to be auctioned to buyers mainly from the West, where ranchers hit hard by drought two years ago are buying to rebuild their herds.
"It's grim around here," said one bidder, a middleman who uses video and cell phones in handling sales. "These ranchers are so discouraged. Their calves are averaging 100 to 200 pounds lighter than usual, and they know they can only dip into herd assets for so long for a problem that's been running nonstop for 14 months."
Nearby, some of the ranchers in leather chaps stared morosely as they prodded and shouted the cattle into the auction pens in a hot, dusty scene marked above all by the bawling of calves.

HEADLINE: Anxiety in Amex's Smaller Pond;
Can N.A.S.D. Save It? What if It Goes Public? Stay Tuned

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
If the New York Stock Exchange successfully converts itself to a public corporation later this year, as it plans, the owners of its 1,366 seats will get shares of the new company that might ultimately be worth as much as several million dollars a seat.
If the American Stock Exchange, after the Big Board the nation's second-largest auction market for stocks, follows suit, its 864 members will be legally entitled to -- well, nothing. 
 The members sold their stake in the Amex last year when they approved its acquisition by the National Association of Securities Dealers, which also owns the Nasdaq stock market. In return, they mostly got promises, including the critical assurance that the N.A.S.D. would make $110 million in overdue technology improvements that the exchange could not afford on its own.
The seat owners "weren't thinking in terms of an I.P.O.," said John T. Sullivan of Charlotte, N.C., who leases out the Amex seat that he owns. "We were thinking in terms of survival. We needed that infusion of capital. We needed that technology." An initial public offering "was a pie-in-the-sky notion at the time; our view was, first things first," he added.
To appreciate the galloping uncertainty at the nation's stock exchanges these days -- uncertainty that is driven by new competitors, new technology and escalating investor demands -- one need look no further than the desperate past and unpredictable future of the American Stock Exchange.
Just a year ago, the Amex seemed to face such daunting odds that its members agreed to give up their ownership stake to gain access to the money necessary to stay competitive. Today, other markets around the world, including Nasdaq and the Big Board, are betting they can raise money by selling ownership stakes to public investors.
Frank G. Zarb, the chief executive of the N.A.S.D., says that within the next two years even the long-struggling Amex -- the perennial also-ran in the stock market sweepstakes -- could get a new lease on life and fresh capital by being spun off as a publicly traded company.
But that optimistic vision assumes that the N.A.S.D. can first conquer the problems that caused the exchange to rush into its arms in the first place: outdated trading technology, a dearth of new equity listings and an uncertain market niche. If the association fails -- as some Amex members fear it will if core weaknesses in the market's equity trading are not addressed quickly -- there may be little for former seat owners to squabble over.
By one measure, at least, the Amex is thriving. Seat prices have increased by nearly 60 percent in the 17 months since the N.A.S.D. deal was announced, more than twice the percentage gain in the price of Big Board seats during that time.
But the number of listings has drifted relentlessly down, from 822 in January 1995 to 772 last January to just 761 more recently. That is barely a quarter of the number of Big Board listings and less than a fifth the number of listings on Nasdaq. And the annual Amex trading volume, roughly 7.3 billion shares, is utterly dwarfed by the multibillion-share volume at its two bigger rivals.
The American Stock Exchange was born in the mid-19th century as the New York Curb Market, a loose affiliation of brokers who gathered outdoors in lower Manhattan to trade stocks that were not listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Like the N.Y.S.E., the Amex is an auction market, where traders gather on a central trading floor to bargain openly for shares of each listed stock. From the first, it was the home of stocks that did not meet the stiffer financial standards for listing on the Big Board. That remained its primary identity until the debut, in 1971, of Nasdaq, a decentralized "dealer market" in which market makers, linked by phones and computer screens, buy from sellers at one price and sell to buyers at a higher price, profiting on the markup.
The Amex tried to diversify. In 1975, it introduced trading in stock options, and by the early 1980's options trading had become a thriving business. But by then its traditional stock market business was being increasingly eclipsed by Nasdaq, especially among the technology companies that have become so important to the modern economy.
Again, the Amex tried to supplement its lagging equity business with creativity. In the early 1990's, it established a strong presence in equity derivatives. Today, it conducts robust trading in more than four dozen equity-linked products, from unit investment trusts meant to track various Standard & Poor's indexes to a new "tracking stock" that mimics the Nasdaq 100 index.
But despite its successes -- it is the nation's second-ranking options market, after the Chicago Board Options Exchange -- the Amex remains heavily dependent on its equity trading business to pay its bills. And by late 1997, that business was a chronic invalid, too weak to generate the amounts of money the Amex would need to upgrade electronic trading systems that were, by that point, as much as a decade old.
By early March 1998, leaders of the Amex were negotiating the details of the N.A.S.D. deal, which had a structure only Rube Goldberg could love. The N.A.S.D. set up a subsidiary holding company, which controls a new limited liability company, Amex L.L.C., which acquired the assets of the old American Stock Exchange from its members.
The exchange members were granted certain rights, including trading privileges, of course, and a voice in any major changes in the trading structure on which their livelihoods depend. Members also got a right of first refusal if Amex L.L.C. is ever put up for sale, provided they can match the best competing offer.
Most important, the members were promised that N.A.S.D. would invest up to $110 million in the exchange.
That promise is being kept in ways that will soon become obvious to everyone, said Salvatore F. Sodano, the N.A.S.D. chief financial officer, who is acting president of the Amex. "It is probably a two-year project for everything we want to get implemented," Mr. Sodano said. "But we have made some pretty significant strides in moving the institution along in a short period of time."
Roughly $30 million worth of technology upgrades are already in the works, Mr. Sodano said. These include a faster and vastly more versatile electronic system to display and track pending stock orders at specific prices and a new order-routing system for equities and options that will sharply increase the capacity on the options floor, Mr. Sodano said.
Beyond technology, the Amex plans to set up a service desk to deal with its trading firms' problems, and it will soon hire a senior-level sales executive to oversee efforts to attract more listed companies and retain those already listed.
Moreover, in an aggressive bid for orders from brokers who serve individual investors, it is permitting any retail order of fewer than 2,100 shares to trade on the floor at no charge. Investors are demanding low-cost trading, Mr. Sodano said, "and it is tough to beat 'free.' "
So far this year, he said, 40 to 45 companies have listed on the exchange, compared with about 50 new listings in all of 1998. "And we have a pipeline of more than a hundred companies waiting to list," he said. "If all goes well -- and they are all real good companies -- we will have 150 new listings by the end of the year."
That would help offset the steady loss in listings as companies merge or move to other exchanges. But people working with the exchange, which has suffered through some major scandals in its life, say management is still wrestling to bring the regulatory machinery up to speed, a problem that must be resolved before there is any substantial surge in new listings.
That will further disappoint people who had expected the N.A.S.D. to usher in a more effective pursuit of new Amex listings, without which its trading floor cannot prosper. The continued growth in Nasdaq's listings adds to the apparent bitterness that some traders express.
Among those skeptical of the efforts being made to improve the core stock-trading operation is Andrew Schwarz, a specialist on the Amex and a former member of its board of governors.
"Our equity business was broken and needed to be fixed," he. "Unfortunately, that has not been fixed yet, and the floor was, and continues to be, unhappy about that situation."
He favors establishing segments of the Amex market to match the existing segments in the Nasdaq market, the National Market System and the Small-Cap Market, with each Amex marketplace ready to list any company that wants to move from the corresponding Nasdaq lineup. The Amex could set up a market where even unlisted "Bulletin Board" stocks could benefit from auction trading, he suggested, so long as any companies that proved dubious were promptly kicked out.
"If you go back to the basics of what Frank Zarb promised -- that companies on the Nasdaq would be given a choice between the dealer market and the auction market -- that hasn't happened," Mr. Schwarz said. "We still get hung up on miles of red tape and listing standards."
He argues that the Amex can survive and prosper only if it returns to its roots and once again becomes the auction market for companies too small for the Big Board. Only then, he added, does it make sense to speculate about what a publicly traded Amex might be worth, and to whom.
"How does one predict the future when the environment is changing as fast as it is?" Mr. Schwarz asked as he questioned who would dare buy shares in a stock exchange. "If you look at the last 50 years, there has been more change in the last 2 years than in the previous 48."
While members are hoping for a turnaround that could make the Amex more valuable, such a success might also intensify the bickering over any profits from a spinoff.
The N.A.S.D. acquisition of the Amex was "a bloodless coup," said William B. Astrop of Atlanta, the owner of two Big Board seats and one seat on the Amex. Estimating that an Amex seat might be worth as much as $1 million in a public offering, Mr. Astrop predicted that "there are going to be some unhappy seat owners when it dawns on them that they are left out totally, that there is no payday, no windfall."
Some members acquainted with terms of the acquisition wonder whether the right of first refusal if the N.A.S.D. sells the Amex could become a lever for disgruntled members to pry a share of the proceeds out of the new owner of the exchange.
Mr. Astrop, who gives Mr. Zarb extremely high marks for the progress that has been made, nevertheless says that seat owners might "get their dander up" if the Amex was sold in a way that "was viewed as being high-handed." He mused, "If we made a big enough fuss, Mr. Zarb might toss us a bone just to keep us quiet."
For his part, Mr. Zarb said that it was "legally debatable" whether the old Amex members could claim any of the proceeds from an Amex sale or stock offering. "But practically, an unfriendly transaction would be very, very unlikely," Mr. Zarb insisted. "Who would want to own an institution that doesn't have a wholesome, happy set of practitioners?"

HEADLINE: Fed Report Seems to Take Edge Off Worries on Rates

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The economy is expanding with little sign of inflation, the Federal Reserve said today in its latest regional report card, taking the edge off investor expectations that the central bank would raise interest rates again soon.
The survey, which is produced eight times a year and is based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks, cited expanding manufacturing, strength in retail sales and construction, and rising loan demand as evidence that the economy was not slowing much. That leaves the current expansion on track to set a record for longevity early next year. 
 At the same time, the Fed said most regions of the country reported more jobs than workers to fill them. "Despite the labor shortages, none of the districts report evidence of any broad-based acceleration in wages," the report said. "There is no evidence of any broad-based pickup in consumer price inflation."
Tight labor markets were reported in most districts, the Fed said. "There are severe shortages of skilled construction workers in most districts," the report said.
Still, with little wage pressure, "consumer prices remain relatively stable despite some apparent intensification in input price pressures," the report said. Prices for construction materials, transportation and energy have been rising, it said.
"Retail sales, which had been robust in the second quarter, decelerated somewhat in July, in some cases due to low inventories of clearance merchandise," the report said. "Manufacturing activity continues to expand in most parts of the country, though a few districts indicate some softening."
The report, known as the beige book, will help form the basis for discussion on interest rate policy at the Aug. 24 meeting of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee. Still, the anecdotal details of the report will not do a great deal to enlighten committee members, who will have already seen detailed statistics on employment and prices for July as well as internal Fed analyses of economic conditions.
"People have been saying a Fed tightening is a slam-dunk on Aug. 24, but it's not," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago.
The latest beige book underscores other reports that the economy is not slowing as much as the Fed had expected earlier this year.
The July employment report showed that the economy added 310,000 workers, after an increase of 273,000 in June, while hourly wages rose at the fastest pace in half a year. Unemployment stayed just a tenth of a point above the three-decade low of 4.2 percent earlier in the year.
That is just the mixture that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned about last month in his twice-yearly message to Congress.
"If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully" to raise interest rates, he told the House Banking Committee on July 22.
Inflation, however, has remained in check. The Consumer Price Index was unchanged in May and June after jumping seven-tenths of a percent in April. The core rate of the index, which excludes food and energy costs, rose just one-tenth of a percent the previous two months.
And that is a conundrum for the Fed. "At this particular moment, the underlying core cost structure of the economy is behaving, in my judgment, quite benignly," Mr. Greenspan said. "There is no immediate evidence that I can see that what we are dealing with is an incipient acceleration of core inflation."

HEADLINE: Alcoa Seeks To Acquire A Competitor

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
In the second consolidation shock to hit the aluminum industry in two days, Alcoa Inc., the largest producer, said yesterday that it wanted to buy the Reynolds Metals Company, a troubled competitor that is nonetheless the third-largest player.
The announcement came a day after three huge Alcoa rivals -- Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney of France and the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland -- announced they intended to merge, creating a $21.6 billion behemoth called Alcan that would displace Alcoa, which had $15.5 billion in sales last year. All three foreign companies had been rumored to be talking to Reynolds themselves. 
 Reynolds said its board would discuss the offer on Sunday. But if Alcoa's proposal is accepted, the merged company's combined 1998 sales of $21.3 billion would put it back within breathing distance of the top spot. In fact, since the new Alcan would derive $17.4 billion of its sales from aluminum, Alcoa would remain the biggest company in the business.
While this merger flurry is big news on Wall Street, where both Reynolds and Alcoa shares rose yesterday, it is unlikely to have much impact on the consumers who buy Reynolds Wrap and other aluminum foils, or the automotive companies designing ever-more aluminum into their cars.
Even if the mergers result in fewer aluminum producers, aluminum itself is a basic commodity that is in in ample supply throughout the world.
"Neither of these mergers, assuming they go through, will have any impact on aluminum prices, or even on aluminum supply," said Leanne Baker, the metals analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Even the heaviest users of aluminum seem unworried. "Aluminum is a market-driven commodity, so you've got to presume that the market will drive the price to wherever it is going to go," said Ronald H. Iori, a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company.
The deal may yet run into antitrust opposition. In December 1997 the Justice Department sued to prevent Alcoa from purchasing some of Reynolds' assets in Alabama, saying the purchase would result in higher prices. A day later, the companies abandoned the deal. "Since we looked at the previous proposal, it is likely we'll be looking at this one as well," said Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.
Still, analysts expect this proposal will survive regulatory scrutiny. In fact, some analysts suggested that the advent of two such big deals may help each one go through.
They reason is that the Justice Department is likely to look more favorably on a strengthened Alcoa, now that it has the prospect of a far bigger Alcan operating across the border in Montreal, while the European Union will want a bigger presence in the aluminum industry to fight the specter of a joined Alcoa and Reynolds.
Moreover, Alcoa and Reynolds are not mirror images. Reynolds, for example, is big in aluminum packaging, which Alcoa has shunned. Alcoa is a huge supplier of aluminum sheeting for cans; Reynolds divested that business a few years ago.
While aluminum producers cannot affect prices or supply by joining forces, they can reduce costs and thus increase the profit from every pound of aluminum they sell. That is something many need to do.
Aluminum prices have been badly depressed for a decade. First, the collapse of the Soviet economy led to heavy selling of aluminum by Russia, a huge aluminum producer, in a panicky quest for hard currency. At the same time, auto makers, aerospace companies and other huge consumers of aluminum were merging into global giants with more influence over what they would pay for aluminum, keeping prices low. The General Motors Corporation, for example, announced a multibillion-dollar 10-year contract with Alcan in November that provides a steady supply of the metal at a relatively stable price.
The result is that aluminum, which routinely sold for more than $1 a pound in the 1980's and often spiked far higher, costs 70 cents a pound or less now.
"Prices have been on such a steady downtrend that many companies were not even earning their cost of capital," said Warren Spitz, a portfolio manager at Prudential Investments, whose funds are heavily invested in both Alcoa and Reynolds shares. "This consolidation is hitting an industry that has had substandard profitability for at least a decade."
The news has not been all bad in the industry, of course. As economies in Asia and Latin America continue to recover, aluminum demand and prices are expected to increase, "although even getting to 75 cents would be worth a hallelujah," said James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research.
Aluminum producers have also succeeded in increasing industrial use of the metal in place of steel. Auto makers now use aluminum in transmissions, wheels, doors and roof racks. The popularity of four-wheel drives has been a boon for the aluminum makers, since the vehicles require two transmissions instead of one.
G.M. will use 1.7 billion pounds of aluminum in its cars and trucks this year; five years ago, that volume was 1.1 billion pounds. Last year G.M. cars and trucks contained an average of 275 pounds of aluminum; this year they contain 290 pounds.
"The use of aluminum has increased much faster than anyone had expected," said Daniel J. Bealko, G.M.'s global commodity manager for lightweight metals.
Still, the persistently low prices, combined with the huge number of plants producing aluminum have kept prices and profits low. Manufacturers have coped partly by shuttering older plants.
Alcoa, by far the lowest-cost producer, has been one of the few to remain solidly profitable. It also was one of the first to pursue mergers, buying Atlanta-based Alumax and three European aluminum companies in the last year. The company earned $2.42 a share last year. Charles L. Hill, director of research at the First Call Corporation, which tracks analysts stock recommendations, says that analysts predict it will earn $2.67 this year.
Reynolds, by contrast, has foundered. Last year it earned $3.47 a share; this year, analysts predict it will do $2.15 at best. In this year's first quarter, a bad one for the entire industry, Reynolds lost 15 cents a share.
Reynolds has spent the last three years trying to reorganize. It has cut costs by closing old plants and selling a number of operations deemed to be underperformers.
In 1977, revenue at Reynolds totaled $6.88 billion; this year, the figure is unlikely to hit $5 billion. But, that revenue will be heavily from packaging, construction, wheels and primary aluminum ingots, the businesses that have historically been Reynolds' best.
"If I were Jerry Sheehan, I'd be terribly frustrated right now," said Mr. Kelleher, the Argus analyst, referring to the Reynolds chairman, Jeremiah J. Sheehan. "He's got to feel, we've restructured this company, whipped it into shape, done the heavy lifting, and now Alcoa comes up with this."
Alcoa's offer was presented to Mr. Sheehan in a letter that Alcoa made public yesterday. The letter suggested an offer of half stock and half cash that amounted to about $5.8 billion, or $65 a share. Reynolds had rejected a merger overture from Alcoa in March, saying the price -- a combination stock-and-cash deal that had Alcoa paying about $60 a share for Reynolds stock -- was too low.
The price in the offer announced yesterday pushed Reynolds shares up $9.375, or 16.8 percent, to $65.25. Alcoa shares rose $2.9375, or 4.4 percent, to $69.375.
Still, turning down the March offer has cost Reynolds investors. The shares of both companies have increased in value, and if Reynolds had accepted stock from Alcoa, that deal would be valued today at about $94 a share.
Reynolds investors, in fact, have been pushing Reynolds to find a buyer for some time. Richard L. Grubman, an investor at Highfields Capital Management in Boston, which owns approximately 6.5 percent of Reynolds, wrote Mr. Sheehan a scathing letter in June, accusing him of "trying to buy time to execute a transaction best for you before being forced to pursue one that is best for us."
This time, Mr. Sheehan may have no choice but to accept the offer. Unlike Alcoa, which ranks high on many analysts' lists of recommended stocks, Reynolds rarely makes it on the Wall Street recommended buy lists.
"Analysts just do not like this stock," said Mr. Hill of First Call. Reynolds executives reportedly spent much of the spring speaking to all three of the companies involved in the Alcan merger, in hopes of finding a more generous buyer. None of them offered a sweeter deal, and now that they are caught up in their own merger, Alcoa is the only logical suitor left.
Alcoa is being advised by Credit Suisse First Boston. Merrill Lynch is working with Reynolds.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Markets Rebound Sharply, With the Nasdaq Gaining 3%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
After some early hesitation, stocks bounded higher yesterday as computer-related shares lifted the Nasdaq market by slightly more than 3 percent, its biggest gain in eight weeks.
Besides bargain hunting and a handful of surprisingly strong earnings reports, notably that of Cisco Systems, the main catalyst seemed to be a growing belief that interest rates might be approaching a peak. That notion seemed to spread in the afternoon when a Federal Reserve survey found "no evidence of any broad-based pickup" in consumer prices or in wages. 
 Rate jitters have bedeviled stock markets in recent weeks, with most analysts expecting the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates by another quarter-point at its Aug. 24 meeting.
But after that, said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston, the pressure on stocks may subside. "Equity investors seem a bit more optimistic that rates will retreat after the Federal Open Market Committee" meeting, he said, noting that high-technology and financial stocks, which are among the most highly sensitive to rates, were pace setters yesterday.
Alfred Kugel, senior strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham, largely agreed. "If we have any more increases, it won't be a lot," he said. "The beige book put the icing on it," he added, referring to the Fed's eight-time-a-year survey that it uses to help make monetary policy.
Defying a recent series of broadly lower market days, more than three stocks advanced yesterday for each two that declined on the New York Stock Exchange, the best breadth since mid-July. Volume was a moderate 792.4 million shares, compared with 831.6 million on Tuesday.
Broadly based market gauges performed strongly. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 20.50 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,301.93, compared with the narrower Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 132.65 points, or 1.24 percent, to 10,787.80. The Nasdaq gained 74.87, or 3.01 percent, to 2,564.98.
Twenty of the 30 stocks in the Dow, the market benchmark, advanced.
J. P. Morgan, which was up 4 3/4, to 126 11/16, and I.B.M., up 4, to 123 5/16, accounted for one-third of the Dow's rise. Alcoa also posted a big gain, adding 2 15/16, to 69 3/8, after making a $5.6 billion bid for Reynolds Metals, which soared 9 3/8, to 65 1/4.
Drug stocks, which have been weighed down amid continuing fears of Federal legislation that would curb prices, were left behind in the rally. Merck was the biggest loser among Dow stocks, down 1 5/16 to 60 5/16. Eli Lilly slumped 1 9/16, to 61 1/2, while American Home Products, which is mired in litigation over its discontinued fen-phen diet-drug combination, fell 2 1/8, to 41.
Although the climate for initial public offerings has recently soured, Red Hat Inc., which sells a version of a computer operating system that seeks to compete with Microsoft Windows, made a spectacular debut. The company, based in Durham, N.C., offered six million shares at 14, and they finished at 52 1/16 on a volume of 17.9 million shares, meaning that each share changed hands an average of three times. It was the biggest gain for an initial offering since July 1.
But Blockbuster Inc.'s 31 million shares, spun off by Viacom, ended the first day of trading at the offering price of 15, apparently requiring support from the underwriters, Salomon Smith Barney.
The session's high-technology winners, most of them computer companies as opposed to Internet issues, included a surge by Intel of 4 1/4, to 76. Cisco gained 4 3/16, to 62 15/16. EMC soared 5 1/4, to 58 7/8. Gateway also rose 5 1/4, to 83 1/4. Motorola added 4 1/4 to 92 3/4, and Microsoft was up 1 1/4, to 84 3/16. Apple Computer rose 4 5/16 to a 52-week closing high of 59 11/16. America Online jumped 7 3/8, to 92 3/8.
"The deflated Internet sector is very healthy for the market," said Timothy J. Morris, a senior official at Bessemer Trust.
Among financial stocks, besides J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch rose 3 5/16 to 67; Goldman Sachs gained 4 1/2, to 61 1/2; Chase Manhattan rose 2 5/8, to 76 15/16, and American Express rose 2 1/2, to 127.
Advancing issues beat declining ones on the Big Board by 1,881 to 1,147. Still, new 52-week lows exceeded new highs by 230 to 44.
Overseas, stocks were modestly higher in Europe, nearly unchanged in Japan and up a hefty 3.1 percent in Brazil and 2.4 percent in Mexico.

Bonds Are Higher, Too
 By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices rose for the first time in four days yesterday after a Treasury sale of 10-year notes drew more demand than expected, and the Federal Reserve said there was relatively little evidence of inflation.
The $12 billion in notes sold at a yield of 6.085 percent, the highest for a 10-year auction since August 1997 and a level that drew buyers into the market. "We're going to take a look at possible purchases here," said Ted Neild, a portfolio manager at the Nuveen Advisory Corporation in Chicago, which oversees $40 billion of fixed-income securities. "We think interest rates may be peaking."
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to a price of 87 4/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.21 percent from 6.25 percent on Tuesday.
Treasuries also gained as the Federal Reserve's regional economic-outlook report helped cool concerns about higher inflation, which erodes the value of a bond's interest payments.
Demand for the notes surprised many in the market. Investors bid for 2.07 times the amount of securities available, the most in a year.
But corporate bond sales in the days and weeks ahead may hurt prices, as they offer investors a higher-yielding option to Treasuries, Mr. Neild added.
DaimlerChrysler A.G., Europe's largest industrial company, is leading borrowers with a planned $3 billion issue.

HEADLINE: The Birds of Manhattan Are the Prey of a Killer

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
A young girl was chatting with friends in the northeast section of Central Park yesterday when a pigeon fell at her feet, dead.
The girl, Victoria Sweet, 11, said that she and her friend "were just scared and sad to watch Mother Nature just fall from the tree." 
 Between Tuesday morning and yesterday afternoon, 30 pigeons, 10 sparrows, one grackle and two ducks were found dead in the park, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said at a news conference near the Harlem Meer. And yes, he said, poisoning was suspected, as stricken birds continued to fall to the ground.
"The poisoning of innocent animals is an outrage," Mr. Stern said, quickly acknowledging that the precise cause of death would not be known until state conservation authorities in Albany completed autopsies in about two weeks.
But the Commissioner said he strongly suspected that the Central Park birds were being killed by the same culprit who has been targeting city birds since 1997.
In August of that year, the first evidence of poisoning emerged when a sick red-tailed hawk was found on Fifth Avenue and 74th Street. The hawk, which was found to have ingested a very powerful pesticide called carbofuran, recovered. But the hawk's mother was killed by the same poison two months later. Since pigeons are the principal food of hawks, Parks Department investigators reasoned that the hawks must have eaten pigeons that had been fed poisoned seed.
The poisonings continued in July 1998, when there were numerous reports of dead pigeons from the Upper East Side and West Side to Times Square. Forty dead sparrows were found in a parking lot on 97th Street and Columbus Avenue.
In the fall of 1998, several groups of 10 to 20 dead pigeons were found on the Upper East Side. Autopsies revealed carbofuran in the bodies.
Mr. Stern said that the culprit faced criminal prosecution, though he did not yet know what specific city or state law would be applicable. Killing the ducks, sparrows and grackle would be a violation of the Federal Migratory Bird Act, he said.
Mr. Stern said he would ask the Manhattan Distict Attorney for a jail sentence for the perpetrator. "As long as he's on the loose, the pigeons and ducks and birds of this park are in danger," he said.
A reward of $1,000 has been offered by the City Parks Foundation, a private philanthropic group, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the bird killer.
Parks Department workers discovered the first dead birds on Tuesday morning. Seeds and bread crumbs at the scene were collected for examination. Police emergency tape blocks off the areas where the crumbs and seeds were found, and law enforcement officers are on duty to steer children and dog walkers away, said Bob Lawson, a department spokesman.
The Commissioner acknowledged that his agency often complained about pigeons and that he had many times advised the public not to feed them. But, he emphasized, the Parks Department does not kill them. Ed Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said that no city agency killed pigeons or any other birds.
Building owners can legally control the pigeon population by employing a trained and licensed exterminator who uses the pesticide Avitrol. Both houses of the State Legislature passed a bill allowing localities to ban the use of Avitrol, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. George E. Pataki. Yesterday at the Harlem Meer, which attracts birds year round, women pushed baby strollers and camp groups marched in single file as birds struggled and died. Eric Erickson, an unemployed man who visits this part of the park every day, said, "I've never seen anything like this. It's a sick act."
Doubtless the most informed person on pigeons in the area was Sean Fine, a producer and cameraman who is filming a documentary about pigeons in New York City for the television series "National Geographic Explorer." As he photographed the death scene, he said that there were approximately as many pigeons in the city as people and that they had originally been brought from Europe as a source of fresh food.
Mr. Fine had a theory on why the killings were happening. He pointed to an article about the earlier killings in the current issue of New York magazine, and suggested that it had motivated the killer.
"I think some person is just laughing in people's faces," he said.

Opportunity Presents Itself: Kill the Penny

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
AS New Yorkers struggle through the great penny shortage of 1999, there are profound mysteries to contemplate:
How many bonuses must banks and stores offer to get New Yorkers to bring in the pennies stashed in their sock drawers? 
 How many pairs of socks would those pennies buy?
How can there be a shortage of something that nobody wants?
Those mysteries are too profound to be addressed in this space. But there is room to deal with a more mundane question: how can we seize this historic opportunity to get rid of the penny?
Prompt action is required, because the United States Mint is working around the clock to inflict more pennies on America. To resupply banks that have run out, it is churning out more than a billion pennies a month, most of them justly destined for oblivion.
"The majority of pennies don't circulate," said Philip N. Diehl, director of the mint. "They make a one-way trip from us to penny jars, sock drawers, piggy banks and the spaces between couch cushions. Two-thirds of the pennies produced in the last 30 years have dropped out of circulation."
Those billions of castoff pennies prove that Americans are too smart to spend their valuable time handling worthless pieces of copper-plated zinc. This lesson still escapes the Federal Government, even though a few penny abolitionists are at work in Washington.
The most vocal is James C. Benfield, the executive director of the Coin Coalition. His group, which is supported by the vending-machine industry, wants to eliminate the penny to make room in cash registers and pockets for one-dollar coins. He advocates rounding off to the nearest nickel on all cash transactions.
"Pennies are useless, but they make up 42 percent of the coins you get in change," Mr. Benfield said. "Forty thousand tons of zinc a year are wasted to make new pennies. We can easily get rid of this nuisance by rounding off. It's already being done on American military bases overseas."
Attempts to eliminate the penny, though, have been stymied in Congress by politicians from Illinois, who object to taking Lincoln's face out of coin circulation, and by the penny industrial complex: the companies that mine zinc and turn it into the blanks used to make the coins.
These companies support a group called Americans for Common Cents, which puts out material like "Ten Reasons to Keep the Penny." No. 9 is, "The penny has been an integral part of the American experience." No. 5 is even more weighty. Noting that consumers would feel "ripped off" by having to pay $7.80 for a $7.78 purchase, Americans for Commons Cents warns: "Abolishing the penny could erode consumer confidence in the economy."
IT'S easy to see how those arguments, accompanied by an occasional campaign contribution, could stop politicians from doing anything. But why hasn't the private sector responded? A few merchants have taken steps -- Saul Zabar has priced everything in his new cafe on Broadway to spare clerks from handling pennies -- but most are passing up a chance to save themselves time and money.
A typical drug store could save more than $2,000 a year by eliminating pennies, according to a study done by the Walgreen Company. Managers wouldn't have to buy rolls of pennies; clerks wouldn't have to unwrap the rolls and count up the coins at the end of the shift. The average transaction would be 2.5 seconds shorter.
"Rounding off is something we might consider if the penny shortage persists," said Ed King, Walgreen's director of trade and corporate relations. "But we're not sure how customers would react."
That uncertainty, along with the work involved in retraining clerks and reprogramming cash registers, has stopped most retailers from making the switch. What if clerks had to spend a minute explaining the system to each customer? What if some misers refused to accept the rounding up of a 98-cent purchase?
But if enough retailers started doing it, most customers would adjust. And as a public relations measure, perhaps a store could post a sign offering to provide the rounded-off pennies to anyone who demanded them. That way penny-pinchers would be mollified, and everyone else would have lighter pockets -- plus, of course, extra space in the sock drawer.

HEADLINE: Returning Gleam To Marble Church;
Crumbling Piece of City History Is Getting Its Stones Restored

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
If any church in New York City ought to have its stonework in good repair, it is the one called Marble.
Looking like a Romanesque pile of sugar cubes, it was consecrated in 1854 as the Fifth Avenue Church. But the glistening stones imprinted themselves on the civic consciousness, and the building material at last gave its name to the congregation, which was formally designated the Marble Collegiate Church in 1906. 
 Now, the congregation is repaying the favor. It has undertaken a $1 million repair, restoration and cleaning of the stones, all of them discolored and some disturbingly eroded by time, the seasons, polluted air and acid rain.
"To our knowledge, this has not been touched in 145 years," said Dr. Arthur Caliandro, the senior minister. "We really needed to do it, to brighten the building up and bring it back to its lustrous original self."
While it does not rival the grandeur of St. Patrick's Cathedral farther up the avenue, the Marble Church at 29th Street has been in the public eye for a long time. Centuries, in fact. As part of the Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, it traces its origins to 1628. And it was the pulpit for 52 years of Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, author of "The Power of Positive Thinking."
What is now an intense job of architectural surgery -- a web of scaffolding envelops the landmark as workers go over the stone surface with diamond-edged grinders, chisels and knives -- began innocently enough two years ago as a simple cleaning project of the marble, which was quarried in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
"The building has never had a bath," said Dwight D. Rangeler, the church master. "Our first image was, 'Wouldn't it be nice to bring up a garden hose and spray it on the building?' "
Before they could start cleaning, however, church leaders were advised to examine the facade.
They brought in Diane S. Kaese, senior architect at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, a nationwide engineering and architectural firm based in Northbrook, Ill., that specializes in solving problems for existing buildings.
That was when the congregation learned that sugar has an ominous meaning in the stone trade -- not white and sparkling but granular and crumbling. An inspection disclosed that the marble was "sugaring" in many spots under a black gypsum crust caused by decades of exposure. In some places, the mortar had turned to powder, if it remained at all. Blocks could be rocked back and forth by hand. Through stones in the bell tower, one could see blue sky.
Church leaders decided to seize the opportunity provided by a strong economy to undertake a more ambitious restoration of their building. "We want to make sure it can last for another few generations," Mr. Rangeler said. "By that time, some new preservative techniques may have come to the fore."
"It's got to be done," he said. "Or else."
Or else more of the conditions he saw the other day on a not-too-happy tour of the facade given by Ms. Kaese; Timothy D. Henry and Timothy J. Farrell of Henry Restoration, the contracting company from Nesconset, N.Y., and John K. Copelin of the William A. Hall Partnership, the architect for the church.
They began along the rooftop balustrade. Ms. Kaese paused. "It looks like someone poured hot water on a sugar cube and it melted," she said, pointing to an 18-inch-high, 4-cusp opening called a quatrefoil.
Indeed, it did. The contours of the once-crisp carving had softened into a doughy lump and the surface was the color of a calico cat: white marble, black gypsum crust and orange granules.
"I shouldn't have worn bifocals today," Mr. Rangeler said as he peered over Ms. Kaese's shoulder at the deterioration. "I should have come up blind. I don't want to see this."
At the base of a spire at the southeast corner of the church, Ms. Kaese was able to stick her finger all the way into a masonry joint because there was so much space between stones and so little mortar.
"Theoretically, that should not be," she said.
They shimmied their way along the planks and through the narrow network of pipe supports. "Here, Dwight, I want to show you this," Ms. Kaese said, pointing to the arabesque base of a pier on the south facade from which a knoblike ornament known as a boss had simply broken off.
"Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay," was Mr. Rangeler's appreciative response.
Mr. Farrell, the field superintendent for Henry Restoration, kept watch on his crew. One worker was using a chisel to extract old mortar from a buttress. "Don't bury that shank all the way in or you'll pop the stone, O.K.?" Mr. Farrell cautioned.
At another buttress, Mr. Farrell used a low-tech device called the flat of his hand to determine the condition of the stone. Instead of a sharp report, the block sent back a hollow reverberation. "It doesn't sound good," he said.
Discouraging as this litany might seem, Ms. Kaese does not despair. Over all, she said, the metal anchors behind the stone blocks are in good shape and there has been minimal breakage of stone. But there is more surface and joint deterioration than she expected to find.
Some stones will have to be recarved. Others must be replaced entirely. Most of them will be cleaned with a light misting of water that will eventually dissolve the gypsum crust. For those that are badly stained, a clay-based poultice can be applied -- not unlike a facial mudpack, Ms. Kaese said.
Church leaders are tamping down expectations in the congregation that the building will emerge dazzling from its cocoon. "It's going to be cleaner than this," Mr. Copelin said, "but it's not going to be the Taj Mahal."
After the restoration work is finished, in about four months, the grounds around the building will be landscaped and the building will be illuminated at night.
"Churches -- not only Marble -- serve as lighthouses to passers-by," Dr. Caliandro said. "For many, there's a feeling of comfort, hope and security when they see churches. Also for the neighborhood. The Flatiron district is moving north and we will be helpful to the whole value of the neighborhood by being outstanding."

HEADLINE: Alexander, After 6-Year Run, Is Short on Time and Money

SERIES: THE CONTENDERS -- Running Toward 2000

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Lamar Alexander is trying hard to stay positive while he runs out of money. "We're just beginning," Mr. Alexander insists, six and a half years into his Presidential run, on another day spent driving across the state to share a sack lunch or a bowl of ice cream with a tiny handful of mostly longtime supporters.
But his bitter belief that the Republican Party's whole nominating process is being short-circuited by big money and big media has become a consuming preoccupation. And in these last days before Saturday's straw poll in Ames, where even supporters say he needs a surprising show of strength for his campaign to survive, his appearances have turned into extended warnings that not only his candidacy but a whole way of political life is in danger. 
 "This could be the last Iowa caucus," he says at nearly every stop. "Now you can just come into the airport, buy a few bales of hay, pretend you know Iowa and have the media proclaim you the winner. You don't need to bother with picking a President because it's not your business anymore."
In one sense the straw poll is an unfair measurement, because its votes are literally bought and paid for. But as Mr. Alexander acknowledges, it is an indication of early organizational strength and can energize or end a candidacy.
All of the other Republican campaigns have shown a certain amount of exasperation at their party's rush to bankroll Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Former Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, recently lashed out by calling Mr. Bush a "party frat-boy type."
But no one has been running harder or longer than Mr. Alexander, a two-term Tennessee governor and Bush Administration Education Secretary, who has not held any other full-time job since he left Washington in January 1993. And he is leading the field in complaining that Mr. Bush and his money are subverting the system.
Away from the podium, Mr. Alexander's resentment is even more pronounced. Surfing wave upon wave of Iowa cornfields in a borrowed van, he derided the front-runner in a way that was remarkable not for its viciousness but for its volume.
Mr. Alexander is a serious man, known for improving Tennessee's schools and economy, as well as for the plaid shirt he has finally ditched. In 1996, he had an encouraging third-place finish in both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. That same year, President Clinton told friends that Mr. Alexander was the Republican he most feared running against.
He has been to Iowa so often he would surely win the upcoming straw poll if it were awarded after a pop quiz on the state. But he is almost broke -- with just $91,000 on hand compared with Mr. Bush's $30 million in the bank -- and has already laid off staff members. Everywhere, he fields only one real question from reporters: When is the wake?
Jim Beckner, a Nashville lawyer who has raised money for Mr. Alexander in past years, said he had stopped trying, explaining: "Most of his supporters were saying, 'Last time I gave out of enthusiasm, but this time, show me some reality.' "
After Mr. Alexander left the Governor's mansion in 1987, he took his family to Australia for six months, to reflect and reconnect. In his memoir of that trip, "Six Months Off," he describes the chemical reaction that occurs when voters fall for a candidate -- in this case, him, as he walked across Tennessee while running for governor:
"The thousand-mile walk, day after day, became my metronome, a practiced discipline that infused me with the music of the lives of the people I sought to serve. I knew I was in my groove -- or was it their groove? I began to radiate the glow of a winning candidate. For the first time ever, I possessed that incandescence that voters see in a candidate with a sense of purpose."
But some of that rosy glow is conferred by cash, and with both Mr. Bush and Steve Forbes outspending him 10-to-1 on the straw poll alone, even friends are saying this does not seem to be Mr. Alexander's turn to be incandescent: "Why does a lousy restaurant sometimes have a line down the block and people knocking to get in?" Mr. Beckner said. "Who knows? Politics is like that, too. He's very intelligent, wonderful background, but for whatever reason he just has not caught on."
In hopes of pulling off a surprise on Saturday, Mr. Alexander, traveling with his national chairman, former Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, is trying to hit 64 of the state's 99 counties, fairly begging folks to strike a blow for the little guy through the straw poll. He is offering them free T-shirts, dinner and a mini-concert by the singer Crystal Gayle, not to mention transportation in an air-conditioned bus, in all, "a $25 value."
But Iowans show no sign that they share his frustration. When he told members of the Pachyderm political club in Marshalltown to remember that "there is no Ronald Reagan in this race, and no George Bush, either," nobody laughed. Afterwards, a couple of people said they thought he seemed a little negative, and two others thought he might make a fine Vice President.
"I like all of the Republican candidates, but I think Bush can win," said Bill Egleston, who runs a mail order business here. "Anyway, the money goes to benefit the Iowa Republican Party, so Iowans should be happy about it."
Mr. Alexander, though, spends considerable energy unhappily working and reworking his own feelings about the Texas Governor. Over bacon and eggs at a coffee shop in New Hampton, Mr. Alexander said, "He's relying on celebrity and money while I'm relying on hard work and issues."
Clenching his fist, his voice tightening, Mr. Alexander went on: "Governor Bush has been here three times, all in the last month. It's all built on image and on sand. All the people he's talking to are screened."
On a long drive to lunch in Vinton, he mocked Mr. Bush's attempts to speak Spanish. "Bush says, 'Todos los ninos must be educated,' Mr. Alexander said, trying a Texas twang. "I can do that."
Passing near Waterloo, Iowa, he remarked: "In the real Waterloo, there's a statue of Napoleon that says, 'Whenever I see a throne, I have an urge to sit on it.' I've known a lot of people like that."
And that evening, before tucking into a comfort-food extravaganza of turkey, dressing and a chocolate shake, Mr. Alexander observed: "We've had an overdose of charisma. You don't beat Al Gore trying to sound like Bill Clinton."
When Mr. Alexander is not on the subject of Mr. Bush, his ideas come through much more clearly. At dinner with a few aides and reporters, amid a discussion about how much television is suitable for children, he recalled struggling with the question of at what age he should let his children read of the evil of the Holocaust in Elie Wiesel's "Night."
Then he said: "It all boils down to something that may be more profound than what we can deal with in a Presidential race. How do people know the difference between right and wrong and why it's getting harder, with the culture getting coarser and institutions weaker? That's the issue with Clinton and that's the issue with all these shootings."
"This whole debate has gotten off track," he went on, "because our party gets off on family values and issues including abortion and gay rights and other things that quickly get us off track, instead of talking about how we can arm parents to teach their children."
His central message is that he wants to improve schools and make life easier for parents in a number of ways, including tax breaks. For the rest of the evening, he seemed energized.
But the next morning, back in the van, someone had seen a copy of a political obituary for Mr. Alexander in The New Republic, and after a few lines were quoted to him he got quiet. Then, for probably the 10th time in 24 hours, a reporter from Mr. Alexander's home state of Tennessee repeated the same question: "So, would you say this is make or break for you?"
In response, with his voice rising a little, he said, "The real question isn't the money people but the media. Typically, you wait for a race to start before declaring a winner. The press has traditionally given at least three tickets out of the Iowa caucus. Now at least they ought to give three out of the straw poll."
Later in the day, as his van pulled into the parking lot of his Des Moines headquarters, he tried once more. "I would just like to say that the whole purpose of what we do between now and the end of the year is to come in in the top three," he said. "That's what the competition was all about."

HEADLINE: SHOOTINGS IN LOS ANGELES: THE SUSPECT;
Acquaintances Describe Loner Bent by a Rage

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 11

 BODY:
It did not take long for people who had seen the police mug shot of Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. when it flashed on a television screen to remember other, more disturbing images of the man.
There was the picture, taken four years ago by a Spokane newspaper, of Mr. Furrow in a neo-Nazi uniform, standing guard outside the north Idaho compound of the Aryan Nations. He had developed a militant hatred of Jews, blacks and homosexuals who are routinely compared to "spawn of the devil" at the headquarters of a small group of racists, acquaintances recalled. 
 There was the confrontation in the forest, when Mr. Furrow, with pistol strapped to his hip, asked a logging crew in northeast Washington State if there were any blacks among them, according to people who worked for the timber outfit.
And, perhaps most revealing, Mr. Furrow himself told the authorities who questioned him after he was arrested in an assault case last year that he was a racist who fantasized about committing a mass killing. In his wallet was a card identifying him as member of the Aryan Nations, and in his car was a 9-millimeter handgun and rounds of ammunition.
"Sometimes I feel like I could just lose it and kill people," he told the police in the Seattle area, court records show.
He was a loner with an obsession for guns who thought constantly about murder and suicide, acquaintances say. But there was another dimension: a hatred for people different from himself that led him from the Aryan Nations compound to a small Washington town, where, several friends said, he became the second husband of the widow of one of the United States' best-known domestic terrorists.
In Metaline Falls, Wash., a broken mining and timber town of fewer than 300 people, Mr. Furrow took up residence for nearly two years in the mid-1990's with Debbie Mathews, the widow of Robert J. Mathews. Still revered by white supremacists around the country, Mr. Mathews founded a neo-Nazi group called the Order, which carried out a campaign of assassinations, bombings and robberies. He died in a shootout with Federal authorities in 1994.
Mr. Furrow met Mrs. Mathews at the Aryan Nations compound. Several friends said the two later married, although civil documents have no record of any ceremony.
"They were living together, and I never was sure if they were married or not," said Roger Lynn, manager of a tractor repair business in Colville, Wash., that formerly employed Mr. Furrow as a mechanic.
After the Order was broken apart by arrests, internal dissent and killings, some of the more violent racists of the Pacific Northwest vowed to strike at their targets in small groups, or alone, earning membership in something known as the Phineas Priesthood by committing a violent act against Jews, blacks, homosexuals or abortion providers.
The police would not say today whether Mr. Furrow was a member of the loose-knit fraternity of racists who called themselves priests. But in his van yesterday, police officials in Los Angeles found a book written by Richard Kelly Hoskins, who also wrote a manifesto on the Phineas Priesthood and many other books about race and banking.
In a brief interview today from his home in Lynchburg, Va., Mr. Hoskins said the book found in Mr. Furrow's van, "War Cycles/Peace Cycles," was about "the history of usury," including what he called "the traditional Jewish presence in banking."
He added, "I don't know what a book of economics has to do with shooting children at a day care center," and then he hung up.
On his Web page, Mr. Hoskins describes the book as "the definitive work on usury" and writes that it explains "the necessity for assassination of national leaders."
In describing his book on the Phineas Priesthood, Mr. Hoskins wrote: "As the kamikaze is to the Japanese, as the Shiite is to Islam, as the Zionist is to the Jew, so the Phineas Priest is to Christiandom."
After taking a taxi cab across the desert from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Nev., then turning himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday, Mr. Furrow told the authorities that the shootings were done as "a wake-up call to America to kill Jews," The Associated Press reported. But Federal authorities and the Los Angeles police would not confirm any statements about the motive for the shootings at the Jewish community center in the Granada Hills section of Los Angeles.
Some of the people who know Mr. Furrow say he demonized Jews particularly, in accordance with the religion of Christian Identity, which holds that Jews are subhuman and are the offspring of the devil.
Groups that research and track hate groups say there are about 35,000 Christian Identity followers in the United States.
"There are a lot more active followers of Christian Identity than there are members of the Ku Klux Klan," said Morris Dees, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has filed many lawsuits against racist groups.
T. J. Leyden, a former skinhead who is a consultant for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said Mr. Furrow "was very hard-core Christian Identity."
Mr. Furrow was once teaching a course in hand-to-hand combat at the Aryan Nations compound outside Hayden Lake, Idaho, said Mr. Leyden. Mr. Leyden, a former marine, said he told Mr. Furrow that his combat technique was wrong. A strong argument ensued, in which Mr. Furrow talked of his hatred for nonwhites, Mr. Leyden said.
Mr. Furrow also showed flashes of the temper while living in Metaline Falls, some acquaintances said. And it was the temper that led to Mr. Furrow's only known brush with the police.
"He had a violent temper," said Meda VanDyke, who described herself as a 20-year friend of Mrs. Mathews in Metaline Falls. The couple broke up, she said, because "he wanted to control everything and tell her what to do."
Outside her house in the woods today -- posted with three 'No Trespassing' signs -- Mrs. Mathews declined to talk to reporters.
Around Metaline Falls, which is tucked in the heavy forests of Pend Oreille County near the Idaho border, Mr. Furrow was ubiquitous in camouflage outfits in the mid 1990's. Rick Rieber, the town marshal, said he stopped Mr. Furrow once for speeding, his only known infraction.
He presented himself as an engineer or a mechanic in various jobs and on official documents. From Metaline Falls he commuted 100 miles round trip every day to a job at LaDuke & Fogle Equipment in Colville.
"He showed up to work every day, did his job, and never got involved with any trouble that I knew of," said Roger Lynn, the company manager. "After he left, I heard he was a neo-Nazi and a racist. But we never heard any of that while he was here."
He worked for the company for about a year, in the mid 1990's, and then was laid off, Mr. Lynn said.
After leaving Mrs. Mathews, Mr. Furrow moved back to Western Washington. Last year, Mr. Furrow tried to stab a woman at a psychiatric center outside Seattle. In court documents, he described his rage and fantasies of committing a mass killing. He had come to the center, Fairfax Hospital in Kirkland last year, seeking admission. But he appeared to be drunk, and when hospital officials tried to take his car keys, he threatened to stab one of them, according to court records in Seattle.
Mr. Furrow served 165 days in jail for attempted assault. He was released this May.
Dan Donahoe, a spokesman for the King County Prosecutor's office, said Mr. Furrow served a slightly above average sentence for his crime. As a first-time offender, he could not be expected to spend more time in jail, Mr. Donahoe said.
He also said Mr. Furrow's racist background was not ground for further charges or prosecutorial investigation.
Growing up in a rural community outside Olympia, Wash., Mr. Furrow was known as somewhat overweight boy. "He was raised in a good Christian, patriotic family," said Bill Wells, an uncle to Mr. Furrow, who lives in West Columbia, S.C. "We don't support any white supremacist groups. We are not a bunch of bigots or racists."
Mr. Furrow may have tried to present himself at the Aryan Nations compound as a warrior schooled in the arts of combat, but as a real soldier in the United States Army, he was a bust. Military records from the Pentagon showed that Mr. Furrow lasted only two months in the Army in 1980. He had an unstable knee and received an honorable discharge, records show.
In recent years, Mr. Furrow listed addresses in Lynnwood, Wash., at his parents' home outside Olympia, and -- most recently -- in Rosamond, Calif. Outside the Furrow family house in Old Nisqually, near Olympia, neighbors today recalled a mostly benign man prone to occasional grandiose acts.
"He stopped traffic outside my driveway once to help my my wife get the mail," said Tim Tyrolt, who lives next to the Furrows. "They are regular, quiet neighbors."

Re "Teddy Roosevelt Betrayed" (Op-Ed, Aug. 9), by Susan Dunn:
I doubt that Theodore Roosevelt, who persuaded Congress to establish the inheritance tax, intended for the tax to have a punitive effect on the middle class, but that's what has happened. 
 The estate tax has become a revenue-raising device, not a way of leveling the playing field. Real estate inflation and the booming stock market have increased significantly the number of middle-class people exposed to the tax. Surely Roosevelt never intended to include in the plutocratic class middle-class people who have two adult children and four grandchildren, and want to assist with the housing and education needs of their offspring. That is not a way for our Government to reward initiative and a lifetime of hard work.
By all means let the true plutocrats be subject to Teddy Roosevelt's wishes, but leave the middle class out of it.

Re "The Other Surplus Option" (Op-Ed, Aug. 11), by Robert B. Reich: Significant investments by the Government in basic research over the past 50 years have provided this country with the advances that allowed it to achieve the economic prosperity and security it enjoys. Just a few examples include the Internet, which has transformed communication and commerce, geographic information systems, which have modernized how the public and private sector plan, and magnetic resonance imaging, which has revolutionized diagnostic medicine. 
 Economic growth and technological advances are dependent on increased support for basic research. In its zeal to cut taxes and impose spending limitations, Congress seems to have forgotten this.

HEADLINE: The Car You Covet: Was It Totaled?

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
ANN HASSELBACH paid $27,000 for a low-mileage, three-year-old Toyota Supra from A. J. Foyt Honda in Kingwood, Tex., in 1997. When the car developed steering problems, the nursing student took it to a mechanic, who gave her more bad news. It needed a new transmission and its electrical systems required an overhaul because it had been flooded. The seat belts were not even bolted down, she said.
When she confronted the dealer's used-car manager, she said, he denied knowing the car's history and declared the vehicle safe. "Talk about anger," Ms. Hasselbach said. "Even a slight fender bender and I could have been dead." 
 Neither the general manager at A. J. Foyt Honda, nor the dealer's lawyers, returned phone calls seeking a response.
Ms. Hasselbach's lawyer obtained a title history indicating that the car had passed among three auto brokers in a year before reaching the dealer. Only after filing suit against the dealer and brokers for fraud did Ms. Hasselbach, 25, learn she had paid top dollar for a cosmetically disguised wreck.
It turned out that a doctor from Beaumont, Tex., had surrendered the once-flooded car to the Progressive Insurance Company after receiving a $31,000 payoff.
"Nobody did this intentionally," said Mark R. Lapidus, Progressive's lawyer in Houston. "I think what happened is, a mistake was made and the paperwork didn't get sent." A trial is set for next year.
Concealing damage when reselling autos prompts so many complaints that legislation to set a national car-title standard has been proposed in Congress several times, only to collapse under pressure from competing interest groups. Insurers, law enforcers, the collision industry and consumer advocates agree that the issue should be resolved, but they disagree over how.
From 20 to 40 percent of the 2.3 million vehicles that are declared "totaled" by insurers each year are rebuilt and put back on the highway, some legally, some not, say experts who have studied the problem. A significant portion of the vehicles that insurers consider too damaged to repair are freshened up and reregistered without their titles being branded as salvage -- the category for cars that cannot be economically fixed. Telltale signs, like spot frame welds and parts from different model years, can be hard to detect.
Last year in Indiana, the State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, the nation's largest auto insurer, agreed to pay nearly $4 million in restitution to settle a case involving extensively damaged cars it had bought and resold without obtaining salvage titles.
"What we hear from other states is that the practice is not unique to Indiana," said Jeffrey A. Modisett, the state Attorney General. He said a similar investigation was under way in Iowa; plaintiff's lawyers in Texas and New Jersey are at work on class-action suits over similar allegations.
Unscrupulous rebuilders and car thieves have plenty of opportunity to reregister vehicles with clean titles or new identification numbers, since there is no national data base for salvaged and stolen vehicles.
And state laws governing vehicle titles are inconsistent. In Iowa, for example, a car must be given a salvage title if repairs exceed 50 percent of a vehicle's value. In Texas, the threshold is 75 percent. States with relatively lax rules, like Oregon and Pennsylvania, become havens for laundered vehicle titles, cleaned through reregistration.
A bill proposing a national standard for titling salvage vehicles was approved in June by the Senate Commerce Committee. It is supported by insurers and auto rebuilders, but opposed by consumer groups and several state attorneys general. Critics hope that the bill, written by Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, will be amended before it is considered by the full Senate.
Attorneys general including Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Joseph Curran Jr. of Maryland and Bill Lockyer of California oppose the proposed Federal standard, saying it is weaker than many existing state laws that it would pre-empt. The proposal defines a salvage vehicle as one needing repairs worth 75 percent of its value, but exempts vehicles over six years old and those valued at less than $7,500.
Consumer groups support a competing bill by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. Rather than focus on salvage vehicles it would require pre-sale damage disclosures on registrations, a condition set in a few states including North Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. Her bill, which would set criminal penalties, was not considered by the Senate committee.
Insurers oppose rules requiring owners to tell potential buyers about accident damage that falls short of salvage status. Insurers do not want policyholders' vehicles to be stigmatized over what amounts to cosmetic damage, said Dave A. Hurst, a State Farm spokesman in Bloomington, Ind.
Shoddy repairs stem partly from the strong used-car market. Insurers end up declaring repairable cars "totaled" and paying policyholders the full value, then recouping much of that expense by selling the cars at auction, said Jack J. Rozint, marketing vice president of CCC Information Services Inc., an auto claims processor in Chicago.
"The rebuilder has a strong incentive to complete the repair as cheaply as possible, as every penny saved goes in his pocket," Mr. Rozint said. "The title still should be branded as salvage."
 
Clues on the Web for Title Sleuths
 
PROSPECTIVE used-car buyers need not accept on faith assurances about a car's history from salespeople or private parties. For $20, consumers can obtain a title history from Carfax or VHR, rival information providers that have long catered to insurers and auto dealers.
Carfax began in 1985 as a service to dealers who wanted to avoid buying problem cars at auction. A third of its business now comes from consumers, who can check histories on line at www.carfaxonline.com or by calling (888) 422-7329.
VHR, owned by CCC Information Services of Chicago, developed its data base from its business of auto-insurance claims processing. It includes records on 18 million vehicles declared "totaled" by insurers, said Jack J. Rozint, a company spokesman. Its Web site is www.vehiclehistory.com.
Both companies' historical knowledge can be useful to buyers of used cars. Even so, gaps exist in both data bases, because a few states have refused to make public their registration and title records.
Histories are indexed based on vehicle identification numbers and labels like "lemon buyback," "salvage" and "gross polluter." These red flags are sometimes excised when cars are moved between states that use different definitions of what is a lemon or a flooded vehicle. "Title washing happens all the time," said Scott Fredericks, a spokesman for Carfax, which was recently acquired by the Polk Company. With a title history, consumers can learn the previous registrations and transactions involving a vehicle, whether it was repossessed or used as a taxi, and whether its odometer was rolled back.

Chart: "How A Damaged Vehicle's Title is 'Washed' "
 
A truck owned by an Iowa farmer, Joe, is rear-ended. Joe submits a claim to his insurance company.
 
The insurer declares the truck totaled because repairs would exceed 50% of it's value, the salvage threshold under Iowa law.
 
Joe receives a check and surrenders the truck and its title to the insurer.
 
The truck goes into an insurance salvage pool and is bought by an auto broker, shipped to Texas, repaired and made ready to be sold at auction.
 
Because Texas does not consider the vehicle to be salvage unless repairs exceed 75% of its value, the broker legally obtains a "clean title."
 
At auction, the truck is resold to a used-car dealer in Dallas.
 
The truck is put on a lot and bought by a college student. The title says that the most recent owner was a Texas auto broker.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Big Increase in Retail Sales Pushes Treasury Yields Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Yields of Treasury securities moved sharply higher yesterday as stronger-than-expected retail sales kept alive investor concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates later this month.
Also weighing on the market was a $10 billion Government bond sale, which generally reduces demand for existing issues anyway. Yesterday's sale was the third and final part of the Treasury's $37 billion quarterly refunding this week. 
 The bond auction did not go as well as some in the market had hoped. The issue's high yield came in at 6.144 percent, which was slightly more than expected. But even as the number of bids produced an acceptable bid-to-cover ratio of 2.22 to 1, retail demand was weak.
By late in the day, the price of the current 30-year bond dropped 13/32, to 86 12/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.27 percent from 6.21 percent on Wednesday. The newly auctioned long bond saw its yield rise to 6.17 percent from an average 6.113 percent.
"Market participants are now firmly convinced that another Fed move to a less accommodative policy stance will take place at the Aug. 24 F.O.M.C. meeting," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. The Fed's Open Market Committee last raised rates on June 30, when it increased the overnight lending rate between banks, known as the Federal funds rate, a quarter-point, to 5 percent.
"At this juncture, the best planning assumption looks for a quarter-point rise in the target Federal funds rate, to a level of 5.25 percent," Mr. Fine said. Furthermore, he added, an additional quarter-point increase seems likely at the Fed's meeting on Oct. 5 in light of rising prices and wages amid a buoyant economy with low unemployment.
Retail sales in July rose a greater-than-expected seven-tenths of a percent, although a downward revision to the June data took some sting out of the number. The latest weekly jobless claims were also interesting, Mr. Fine said, as the four-week moving average registered a cyclical low of 288,250, a sign of an extraordinarily tight labor market.
On that note, the market is awaiting the release today of Producer Price Index data for July. While the core rate is expected to be subdued, rising energy prices are projected to raise the overall index by three-tenths or four-tenths of a percent.
Other data to be released today include business inventory figures for June and the University of Michigan's midmonth consumer sentiment survey, the first look at consumer attitudes in August.
Theodore Ake, Treasury note trading manager for First Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C., said, "The Street bid on the long bond today and they now own it, while for the most part the retail side continues to wait for upcoming inflation data before they decide."
"What direction short-term interest rates will take will be dictated by those numbers," Mr. Ake said. "However, the real question is how many more Fed tightenings will it take? The market is betting on not too many more in the pipeline."
Over the next couple of weeks, the yield on the 30-year bond should hover around 6.25 percent, Mr. Ake said.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 30-year bond:

HEADLINE: Gap and Kmart Both Post Rises In Their Second-Quarter Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Gap Inc. and the Kmart Corporation said yesterday that second-quarter profit rose as shoppers scooped up low-price spring and summer fashions.
Low inflation, rising wages and unemployment near 30-year lows have encouraged consumers to spend, producing the longest stretch of gains in retail sales in at least a decade. Among retailers, discount chains have benefited the most, broadening their appeal by redecorating stores and updating fashions while keeping prices low. 
 "More consumers seem to be interested, however good the economy is, in saving money and making their dollar go further," said Kurt Barnard, an industry consultant.
Net income at Gap, which owns the lower-priced Old Navy chain as well as its namesake outlets and Banana Republic stores, rose 43 percent, to $195.8 million, or 22 cents a diluted share, compared with $136.9 million, or 15 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter ended July 31 jumped 29 percent, to $2.45 billion.
Analysts had expected Gap, based in San Francisco, to earn 21 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings.
Kmart's profit from continuing operations rose 44 percent, to $134 million, or 26 cents a diluted share, compared with $93 million, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 7.9 percent, to $8.76 billion.
The company, based in Troy, Mich., was expected to earn 25 cents a share, according to First Call.
In the quarter, Kmart took a charge of $230 million, or 41 cents a share, for costs related to the bankruptcy filing of the Hechinger Company, which subleased some former Builders Square properties from Kmart. Kmart sold the Builders Square chain in 1997 but guaranteed some of the leases.
The charge resulted in a net loss of $96 million, or 15 cents a share.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stocks Slide After Fears Of Rate Rises Kill a Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks were held to a minuscule gain yesterday and broader indicators retreated. A surge in interest rates after a disappointing Treasury bond auction deflated a bid to extend Wednesday's broad stock-market rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 1.59 points, to 10,789.39. The Dow rose as much as 113 points earlier in yesterday's session, following through on Wednesday's gain of 132.65 points. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.77 points, to 1,298.16; the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index slid 15.49 points, to 2,549.49.
Stocks were higher across the board for much of the session as bargain hunters sought out shares that have been pounded down from the record heights reached in mid-July. But worries about higher interest rates, which have held the market down for the last three weeks, prevailed again yesterday.
Stocks fell after the Treasury's afternoon auction of $10 billion in 30-year bonds. Traders said demand for the bonds fell short of expectations, driving the price down and the yield up. Yields on 30-year bonds hit 6.27 percent in the open market, a level not seen since October 1997.
"As long as the bond market is behaving like a bear market, it will be tough for stocks to take off," said Eugene G. Mintz, financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
The rise in bond yields this summer has hurt stocks in two ways. Rising interest rates raise the cost of business borrowing, cutting into profitability. And, with rates at more than 6 percent, bonds present an attractive alternative to investing in volatile stocks.
The latest evidence that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates further came from a stronger-than-expected report on retail sales. The Commerce Department said yesterday that retail sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in July, bolstered by a big gain in automotive sales. Strong consumer spending could suggest to the Fed that the booming economy is overheating.
But without automobiles and seasonal goods like air-conditioners, the retail sales increase was quite modest, Robert Smith, chief executive of Smith Affiliated Capital in New York, noted. "It was really kind of a bland number," he said. "But there's a lot of anxiety right now about every new domestic economic indicator."
Most analysts say the Fed will be more interested in the Producer Price Index, due for release this morning. That index is a measure of inflation pressures at the wholesale level, or before reaching consumers.
While economists focused on the stream of economic data, companies across a wide range of sectors served up market-moving news.
United Technologies posted the sharpest gain of all Dow components after saying it would cut 1,500 jobs to try to reduce costs at its Pratt & Whitney jet-engine unit. United Technologies shares rose 3 3/16, to 66 3/8.
Caterpillar also helped buoy the Dow after Goldman, Sachs added the company to its list of recommended stocks. An analyst there said that Caterpillar should benefit from the improving global economy. Shares of Caterpillar climbed 1 3/4, to 61.
America Online, the leading provider of on-line services, extended its recent gains. Shares of America Online rose 7 3/8 on Wednesday after company executives held an upbeat conference call with analysts and investors. Yesterday, they rose another 3/8, to 92 3/4.
But stocks of most major computer manufacturers slipped after an analyst at Merrill Lynch said that a trend toward low-priced computers could eventually cut into profits. Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's biggest declining component, falling 6 5/16 a share, to 103 1/16.

HEADLINE: 2 Reports Bolster Outlook on Rates

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Retail sales accelerated in July and the number of workers seeking jobless benefits fell to near a decade low, Government reports showed today, suggesting that more growth is likely for the economy.
Sales rose seven-tenths of a percent, to $248.7 billion, paced by increased demand for cars, pickup trucks and building supplies, Commerce Department data showed. That more than reversed a decline of two-tenths of a percent in June. 
 In addition, the four-week average of the number of workers filing state unemployment claims declined to 288,250 last week, the Labor Department said. The figure is down from 295,000 a week earlier and the lowest level since the week of Feb. 4, 1989.
Both reports left intact concerns that Federal Reserve policy makers will raise interest rates later this month -- to slow the economy and to prevent tight labor markets from leading to outsize wage gains that ignite inflation.

HEADLINE: Pathum Thani Journal;
Most Serene of Sects Creates Uproar in Buddhism

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PATHUM THANI, Thailand, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The sheer psychic power of 30,000 people meditating together can make miracles happen, say the monks here at the headquarters of Thailand's biggest, richest and -- to the established priesthood -- most dangerous new Buddhist sect.
Last Oct. 5, for example. 
 In the harsh heat of the afternoon, worshipers say, the sun seemed to soften above them into a cool crystal ball. Then the vivid image of the sect's founder materialized within the ball, deep in meditation along with his followers.
"Tens of thousands of people saw it," said Chuleeporn Chungrangsee, a witness. "Some saw only a halo effect. Some saw the sun spinning in rainbow colors."
The spectacle was reported widely in Thai newspapers, along with pictures of the sect's newly constructed temple, a vast, low-slung building that sits in the dry fields, 30 miles north of Bangkok, looking like a slightly menacing flying saucer.
People suddenly became aware that a huge and unsettling religious movement had been growing in their midst and had put up by far the largest temple in the land.
The movement calls itself Dhammakaya (pronounced tah-mah-guy), and the circular shape of its main temple is meant to represent the universe, a fitting symbol: its leaders intend it to become the central landmark of world Buddhism, a sort of Vatican or Mecca for their faith, whether the established hierarchy likes it or not.
Unlike the Falun Gong in China, a new sect that has drawn a government crackdown, the Dhammakaya sect has existed unobtrusively in Thailand for several decades, swelling recently to claim more than 100,000 followers, who gather in temples around Thailand and 10 foreign countries, including the United States.
Religious scholars and commentators say this is a movement for its time -- a sign of the failure of the established priesthood in Thailand to minister to a changing, modernizing nation.
Dhammakaya, they say, offers solace to Thailand's newly affluent middle class -- with its newly acquired middle-class angst -- left reeling and rootless by two decades of heady economic growth followed two years ago by a sudden and dislocating crash.
"We forgot where we were going," said Manit Rattanasuwan, an advertising executive who worships here. "Our youngsters want to be like Westerners, with their music and clothes and outgoing style, not so serious about life. And the old traditions cannot deal with that."
Another worshiper, Penchara Asavasopon, managing director of an executive-search company, offered a familiar middle-class complaint. "These days we hardly find time for the children, for the family," she said. "We have all these problems with teen-agers, with drugs, so many things. So we are looking for some activities that the whole family can do together, like meditation."
And then there is making money. Over the last two decades, many here say, it has become a national pursuit, as much a part of today's Thai culture as its Buddhist traditions. That's fine with Dhammakaya.
"The audience is the globalizing middle class, and Dhammakaya is telling people they can have it both ways," said Suwanna Satha-Anand, a professor of philosophy at Chulalongkorn University. "It is trying to transform Buddhism to make it comfortable with both capitalism and consumer culture."
For example, she said: "One teaching is, you make money Monday to Friday, then on Saturday and Sunday you come to the temple and meditate and your mind will be more supple and clear so that on Monday you can make more money."
All of this has thrown Thai Buddhism into an uproar. The sect's leader, Phra Dhammachayo, 55, has been accused of fraud and embezzlement as well as heresy. Newspapers are filled with demands that he be tried or defrocked or both. The top body of Thai Buddhism has demanded the abbot's removal and has summoned him for questioning -- all of which he has ignored, only deepening the public's sense that the traditional religious structure has become weak and irrelevant.
The controversy strikes at the cultural heart of Thailand, where Buddhism is a state religion in all but name and most of the country's 60 million people follow the established religion. Thailand is one of the few countries to adhere to the older form of Buddhism, the Theravada school. There are 40,000 temples in Thailand and 300,000 full-time monks, whose numbers are augmented each year by tens of thousands of young men who enter the monkhood for a short stay.
But respect for the monkhood has been shaken in recent years by scandals involving corruption and criminality. Monks frequently attract followers and make money by telling fortunes and suggesting lucky lottery numbers.
"To put it in a nutshell, traditional Buddhism does not cater for modern Thai people, only for those who go to temples for superstitions or astrologers or fortune telling," said Sulak Sivaraksa, a Buddhist scholar and social critic. "Otherwise people only care about the temples for funeral services and car parking." Many temples make extra money by letting out their grounds for parking.
Or in other words, said Kavi Chongkitavarn, a columnist for The Nation, an English-language daily: "It is Jurassic Park."
Ms. Suwanna offered a telling detail. "Over 95 percent of all the textbooks the monks read today were either written, revised or supervised by one monk, and that monk lived almost one century ago," she said.
By contrast, Wat Dhammakaya, the main temple, is modern: clean, efficient, quiet, with a huge underground garage and ample bathroom facilities. Almost all its monks have college degrees, while most other monks have only minimal education.
Unlike most temples, this is a place to spend the day, eating and meditating. People dressed mostly in white -- a sign of purity -- sit cross-legged in a huge open-sided hangar, with the distant abbot cloned on hundreds of video monitors.
Insulated from the traffic, pollution and abandoned, half-built office buildings of Bangkok, the giant temple offers a vague, one-world utopianism that has as much in common with New Age optimism as with Buddhism. "World peace through inner peace," proclaims the temple's literature.
"Maybe the new religion is peacefulness," Mr. Manit said. "Maybe we can share that. Share the similarities, avoid the differences; that is what we always say."
He added: "We are at the forefront. Maybe that is why we are being attacked."

HEADLINE: Earle Jorgensen, Reagan Adviser, Dies at 101

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Earle M. Jorgensen, who built one of the nation's largest steel distribution companies and helped persuade Ronald Reagan to go into politics, died Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles.
He was 101 and until weeks before his death went to work nearly every day at the business he founded, the Earle M. Jorgensen Company in Brea, Calif., which has annual sales of about $1 billion. 
 Mr. Jorgensen served on Mr. Reagan's "kitchen cabinet," an informal network of businessmen who advised Mr. Reagan and urged him to run for governor of California in 1966 and later for President. But Mr. Jorgensen declined to take any job in Washington, saying that he wanted to stick with his business.
William A. Wilson, a California businessman who served as Ambassador to the Vatican in the Reagan Administration, said Mr. Jorgensen's personal success story "had a lot to do with influencing" Mr. Reagan's economic policies in support of free enterprise. "Everyone had appreciated the fact that Earle had started with nothing and built himself a nice fortune," Mr. Wilson said.
In a statement issued today, Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, said: "Earle Jorgensen was one of our oldest and dearest friends, and we will miss him terribly. However, he has left us with many wonderful memories."
Mr. Jorgensen was a former chairman of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross and was the largest individual contributor to the chapter over the years. He donated to many universities and was a trustee of the California Institute of Technology for 42 years, despite having never gone to college, or even finishing high school. He was also a founder of the Los Angeles Music Center and the Los Angeles Art Museum and involved in many other civic organizations.
Mr. Jorgensen was born in San Francisco on June 22, 1898, the son of Danish immigrants. His father, a sea captain, died when Mr. Jorgensen was in high school, forcing him to drop out and get a job, according to Mr. Wilson, a friend who has known him since 1936.
After serving in the Army Tank Corps in World War I, Mr. Jorgensen came to Los Angeles in 1920 and, the next year, began trudging over sand dunes to sell steel to oilmen working on the beach. The business eventually prospered as a supplier to California's growing aerospace and construction industries.
In 1989, Mr. Jorgensen's son John, who had become president of the steel company, died of cancer at the age of 64, forcing Mr. Jorgensen, at age 91, to resume a more active role in the business. Mr. Jorgensen sold the company to Kelso & Company, a New York leveraged buyout firm, in 1990 for $264 million, with his 32 percent stake worth $84 million. He remained chairman until 1994, when he became chairman emeritus.
His slogan, written on a sign on his office wall, was "Hustle! -- That's All." In his desk he kept stacks of a book called "The Go-Getter: A Story That Tells You How to Be One," about a scrappy kid who becomes a successful salesman. Mr. Jorgensen had stumbled upon the book, written by Peter B. Kyne in 1921, in a bookstore and liked it so much he bought the publishing rights and gave away signed copies to visitors.
The friendship with Mr. Reagan came after Mr. Jorgensen was introduced to the Hollywood scene, apparently through his wife of 47 years, Marion, who had previously been married to Milton Bren, a Hollywood producer. Mr. Jorgensen became the stepfather of his wife's two sons, Donald and Peter Bren. Donald Bren is now a billionaire real estate developer as owner of the Irvine Company, outside of Los Angeles.
In addition to his wife and stepsons, Mr. Jorgensen is survived by two children from his first marriage, Maren Long of Ojai, Calif., and Earle M. Jorgensen Jr. of Mariposa, Calif. His son John and a daughter from that marriage, which ended in divorce, predeceased him. He also had 17 grandchildren, 21 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.
Mr. Jorgensen did not take up sports until learning to ski at age 59, according to Mr. Wilson. He then moved to tennis and golf. Even in his 100th year, he was getting up at 5 A.M. three days a week to work with a personal trainer. But work was always paramount and it seems he credited it for his longevity.
"I've always worked," he told Forbes magazine last year. "I'm too busy to die."

HEADLINE: Waiting to See Reynolds' Cards

BYLINE: ByCLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Talk to industry insiders about Paul H. O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, and words like "maverick," "stickler," even "ruthless," crop up all the time. But rarely does "poker player" enter the vocabulary.
Still, that may just be the role Mr. O'Neill is playing, as he waits to see what the Reynolds Metals Company's board will do when it meets on Sunday to discuss Alcoa's $5.8 billion bid to buy their company. Most everyone paying attention to the deal expects the board to say that the price, which comes out to about $65 a share, is just too low, and that Alcoa will have to sweeten the pot or Reynolds will go elsewhere. 
 Many industry observers say, however, that Reynolds has nowhere else to go. Alcan, Pechiney S.A. and Alusuisse Lonza Group A.G., the three big aluminum companies that Reynolds has talked to in the past, are busy combining their own operations. Although Jacques Bougie, Alcan's chief executive and the man who will head the merged mega-company, said yesterday that "we will rule out no options," few expect him to seriously entertain a Reynolds bid.
Reynolds might be bluffing. And most expect Mr. O'Neill to call that bluff.
"For Alcoa to offer more money would be like bidding against itself, and why would it want to do that?" said a person close to the talks.
In his 12-year tenure as Alcoa's chief, Mr. O'Neill has certainly not made a name for wasting money. He is often credited with keeping costs so low and management systems so lean that Alcoa could reap more profit from the metal than any other company in the business.
"In personality, he's not all that distinguishable from the other suits, but in vision, this man is truly innovative," said James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research.
Mr. O'Neill has been full of surprises from the day he joined Alcoa in 1987. That was the year that the Alcoa board, concluding that aluminum was a dead-end business, decided that only an outsider could get the company into more lucrative fields. It plucked Mr. O'Neill, who had been an outside director of Alcoa for a year, from the presidency of International Paper to be Alcoa's new leader.
Mr. O'Neill proceeded to do the opposite of what the board had expected. He scuttled a budding diversification program, instead snapping up aluminum assets in the United States and elsewhere.
Alcoa had been treating its overseas operations as ancillary. Mr. O'Neill treated them as pivotal to Alcoa's becoming a global presence. He formed a joint venture with Kobe Steel of Japan. When Alcoa executives advised him to shut down Alcoa's ailing Brazilian operations, he instead coordinated with local management to turn them around -- and groomed a Brazilian executive, Alain J. P. Belda, to be his successor. (Mr. Belda was recently named chief executive, and will become chairman when Mr. O'Neill retires in December 2000.)
By the late 1980's, many American executives had grown leery of bloated staffs and endless meetings, but Mr. O'Neill was allergic to them. Armed with degrees in economics and public administration, he had spent 16 years working for the Government, culminating with a stint as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1974 through 1977.
When he joined Alcoa, he began slashing. Early on, he wiped out two layers of management jobs, shuttered underproductive plants and reorganized the company in about 25 businesses.
Nor did he confine the benchmarking activity to internal operations. He adopted many quality control techniques from Kobe. He studied the Toyota Corporation's "just-in-time" inventory control and adapted it to Alcoa.
Alcoa's plants are now the smoothest running, lowest cost in the industry. They also have one of the best safety records -- a fact that Mr. O'Neill recites like a mantra, quoting safety statistics at the beginning of every conference call with analysts.
Last year, Mr. O'Neill introduced what is probably the most visible symbol of the made-over Alcoa. He moved the company's 400 headquarters employees -- down from 2,000 when he first took over -- into a sparkling new six-story building in Pittsburgh. It has no elevators, no long corridors and no doors on offices. Escalators link the floors. And no one's office is bigger than 9 feet by 9 feet, not even Mr. O'Neill's.

HEADLINE: SOCCER: MetroStars Struggle to Get a Footing;
In City Where Success Counts, Team Is Losing Games and Fans Are Losing Patience

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Their MetroStars had lost 15 of 20 games and had scored no goals in 366 minutes. For their season tickets, the fans wanted spirit but what they saw were sad sacks in shorts. When asked to express his frustration during a bus ride to Wednesday night's MetroStars game at Giants Stadium, a fan named Brent Gamit spelled aloud, "C-H-A-R-L-I-E," the first name of the team's general manager, Charlie Stillitano.
And Gamit offered a mordant toast of beer bottles with a friend, Holly Duthie. 
 "To a shootout loss!" he said as the bus rolled along Route 3.
"I don't even remember what a goal would look like," Duthie said.
"You wish there was relegation, so the MetroStars could go down to the second division for a couple of years," said Blaise Dupuy, a recording engineer from Manhattan, referring to the policy of demotion that awaits failing teams in European and South American leagues.
These are difficult days for the MetroStars, the New York-New Jersey beachhead of the four-year-old Major League Soccer, a laboratory for soccer socialism with a single-entity structure that handles all player signings centrally.
Because the team has never posted a winning season, the MetroStars are discovering how difficult it is to barge into a market saturated with 10 other major league teams, and to look even moderately successful when 15,000 fans spread to watch an underachieving team in a massive 77,000-seat stadium.
But it is even harder to generate fan and sponsor support when the team undergoes a hefty turnover of players and coaches. And the hoped-for Holy Grail of a new soccer-only stadium is at least a couple of years away.
"When things haven't worked out, we've gone through a series of Band-Aids that haven't worked," said Stuart Subotnick, one of two investor-operators of the MetroStars and the M.L.S. chairman of the board. "You may not believe it, but we're trying to improve the MetroStars."
Although the MetroStars finally scored on Wednesday -- and even led, 1-0 -- they lost by 4-1 to powerful D.C. United and endured their 16th loss. The announced attendance of 6,876 for a sultry weeknight game rescheduled from Oct. 6 seemed to be three times larger than the actual crowd.
The MetroStars' average attendance of 17,608 is the league's fourth best -- although it ignores the season's 52,000 no-shows -- yet they have lost more money than any other team in a league that has lost $100 million since its inception.
The team's television ratings on the MSG Network have plunged 48 percent since 1996, worse than the 42 percent drop in the league's ESPN ratings. Most league games are carried by ESPN2, where ratings have perked up 23 percent this season.
"We're obviously concerned about not being successful in New York," said Don Garber, a National Football League executive who replaced Doug Logan as the M.L.S. commissioner last week. "It's a major priority to work on. Nothing could be more important than having a New York franchise winning more games and having a higher level of appeal."
The MetroStars have a 48-69 regular-season record and have faltered in two playoff appearances. They have used a league-high 78 players and are being led by their fifth coach, Bora Milutinovic.
Yet the team is resisting a clamor from critics and fans to dismiss Stillitano, the general manager. They say that he has turned over the roster too frequently to suit coaches' whims; that he wrongly hired as the team's first coach Eddie Firmani, who left after eight games amid tension with his players, and then had two more coaches bolt for better offers abroad; and that he unearthed too few foreign players of the caliber of Roberto Donadoni, who departed to return to his Italian league team, AC Milan.
Stillitano said fans now unfairly compare the MetroStars to the Columbus Crew in Ohio, "which they view as the epitome of a well-run organization, but in Years 1 through 3, they had one more win than we did." Actually, it was two.
This year, Columbus is 14-7 and second in the Eastern Conference, after three years of finishing 15-17.
The best marketing tool is often a winning team, which the MetroStars are not. The MetroStars' woes are exacerbated, in part, by a core audience that has fond memories of the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League, with its roster of international superstars like Pele and Giorgio Chinaglia.
The M.L.S. would love to have a wildly popular New York team like the Cosmos, but not by overspending, which doomed the N.A.S.L.
"This team is completely devoid of stars and celebrities in a market spoiled by the Cosmos," said Leandro Stillitano, a vice president of Integrated Sports International, a sports marketing firm. Stillitano is a brother of the MetroStars' general manager and a former team executive.
Still, one critic said, the MetroStars have not thrived in a league with lower expectations. "The problem is 90 percent management, but the absolutely extraordinary thing is the only one who doesn't see it is Subotnick," said Paul Gardner, a columnist for the weekly Soccer America. "No g.m. with this record for three and a half years should last this long."
Subotnick said: "I don't attribute bad luck and injuries to Charlie. I won't give in to a hatchet job of someone who doesn't have full player control."
Last year, however, Subotnick relieved Stillitano of his marketing duties, replacing him with Jim Leahy, the vice president for marketing, who has built a data base of fans, has tried to increase season tickets above 6,500 and has put games on Spanish-language radio and bought time on WFAN-AM for a weekly soccer show.
Indeed, no M.L.S. general manager can exert full roster control, as, say Steve Phillips of the Mets can. In the M.L.S. single-entity system, players are signed by the league, paid from a central fund and allocated to the 12 teams to ostensibly create parity.
General managers can scout players and recommend which ones they want, but if they are too costly, the league will not approve them. The league has never paid more than $2 million for a foreign player, thus restricting its participation in a free-for-all world market. Spain's Real Madrid recently paid Arsenal of England's Premier League a $35.7 million transfer fee for Nicolas Anelka.
"If Charlie was running the Knicks or Yankees, every one of his decisions would be his responsibility," Subotnick said. "But he can only suggest and recommend players he wants."
The single-entity system is designed to hold at bay the spiral of player costs caused by free agency and salary arbitration in other sports. There are no traditional owners, but investor-operators who hire coaches and general managers and control front-office operations like sales and marketing. The single-entity system is also employed by the Women's National Basketball Association, which is controlled and bankrolled by the N.B.A.
M.L.S. executives note that the average 1999 attendance of 14,994 is healthy for a four-year-old league (but down 14 percent from the inaugural 1996 season) and better than the W.N.B.A's season-to-date average of 9,768.
The comparison is imprecise. W.N.B.A. teams play in 15,000- to 20,000-seat arenas, while M.L.S. teams play largely in football stadiums. And eight of the W.N.B.A.'s 12 teams reap the cost benefits of playing in arenas owned by their parent N.B.A. clubs. Although there is considerable wealth among the M.L.S. investors, greater confidence is seen in the N.B.A.'s backing of its offspring.
The M.L.S.'s system of governance is being challenged in Federal court by players who charge that the single-entity system is a traditional league in disguise with investor-operators who illegally conspire to restrain salaries.
Even Subotnick is unhappy with the way some players are distributed. "We haven't built up teams from the bottom the way we should," he said. "It hasn't always worked right. It's not a perfect world."
Six months ago, the M.L.S. deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati, a respected soccer expert who was in charge of player allocation, was dismissed by Logan for renewing the contract of MetroStars midfielder Tab Ramos without informing Subotnick. The injured Ramos has played in only five games this season.
The MetroStars not only need better players, but stronger economics. Their rent is the league's highest (from $15,000 to $60,000 a game), said Subotnick, and they have been unable to get some M.L.S. sponsors to advertise at Giants Stadium because they are in conflict with some of the facility's sponsors.
Like most team executives hankering for a new stadium, Subotnick said the MetroStars were in dire need of a facility where they could control all revenues, not share them as they do with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
Subotnick said the team would choose later this year between sites at the Meadowlands and in Newark to build a $40 million, 27,500-seat stadium.
The model for a new soccer-specific stadium is the new one built by Lamar Hunt, the investor-operator of the Columbus Crew, who also owns the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League.
"It's hard to make seats scarce in an 80,000-seat stadium or sell season tickets if you can just get tickets by walking up," Subotnick said.
Subotnick said the league is examining whether to sell a 20 percent stake in the league to the public to raise money to help build more new stadiums. The plan, of course, would have to overcome skepticism about the future of a league in which no team has made a profit and two teams lack investor-operators.
"Everybody talks about survival," said Mark Abbott, the M.L.S.'s chief operating officer. "There are no survival issues here. Lamar Hunt didn't invest $28 million in a stadium if he thought we were going out of business."

HEADLINE: Venezuelan Leader Moves a Step Closer to Broad New Powers

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Venezuela's newly empowered Constitutional Assembly approved a decree today that gives the group far-reaching authority to abolish Government institutions and dismiss officials, and strengthens the authority of President Hugo Chavez.
Citing what it called the "exhaustion, collapse and loss of legitimacy" of the current political and administrative structure, the assembly gave itself the right to "decree measures pertaining to the competency, functioning and organization of the public powers of the state." No date was set for the relinquishment of the special powers, with the decree stating that the edict would remain in effect "until the cessation of the situation that justifies it." 
 Mr. Chavez, a 45-year-old former Army paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt, took office in February vowing to carry out a peaceful social revolution in his country, which in recent years has become the principal source of imported oil for the United States. But his critics maintain that his real aim is to impose a left-wing military dictatorship on the South American nation and its 23 million people.
Sworn in last week, the assembly has six months to write a new Constitution to replace the country's current charter, which dates from 1961. Mr. Chavez, however, urged the representatives to speed up their work so that a plebiscite can be held before year's end, and submitted a draft constitution that would expand his term to six years and permit him to succeed himself in office.
In theory, the decree formalized today would allow the assembly to dissolve the Congress and the Supreme Court, as Mr. Chavez repeatedly threatened to do before the July 25 special election to pick 131 assembly delegates. Seeking to avoid such a confrontation, Congress went into recess until October and even offered to let the new body hold sessions in the capital building.
Assembly members have made it clear, however, that they intend to resolve hundreds of cases involving lower-court judges accused of taking or demanding bribes. They have also called for the dismissal of several popularly elected state governors and mayors, many of whom are opponents of Mr. Chavez, that they maintain are corrupt.
Acting in accordance with his own argument that all other government organs are subordinate to the new assembly, Mr. Chavez even volunteered to resign as President if the body so desired. But, to no one's surprise, his offer was rejected, and on Wednesday he took his oath of office again before the body, delivering a speech in which he spoke of a deepening economic crisis and denounced what he called "an international campaign against Venezuela."
Supporters of Mr. Chavez, including his wife, a brother and a half dozen members of his Cabinet, occupy 120 of the 131 seats in the all-powerful body. Three other seats are reserved for representatives of the country's Indian tribes, meaning that supporters of Venezuela's two traditional political parties and other members of the opposition account for only eight seats.
One of those critics, the lawyer Alan Brewer Carias, described the special powers measure as too broadly drawn, and "the equivalent of declaring a state of siege." Isaias Rodriguez, a vice president of the assembly, dismissed such concerns, describing the document as merely "a declaration of competence to deal with national problems."

HEADLINE: Suspect in Los Angeles Shootings Confesses to a Killing

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12

 BODY:
In chilling detail, Buford O. Furrow Jr., the man held in a shooting on Tuesday at a Jewish community center here, has confessed that he shot a Filipino-American letter carrier because he was a nonwhite "target of opportunity."
Mr. Furrow told investigators that he was driving down a quiet residential street in a Toyota he had carjacked when he spotted the letter carrier, 39-year-old Joseph Santos Ileto, in his uniform, stuffing letters in a mailbox next to a mail truck. 
 Mr. Furrow said he thought Mr. Ileto was Hispanic or Asian, and he told investigators that he stopped his car and asked Mr. Ileto if he would mail a letter. Mr. Ileto agreed. Mr. Furrow said he then pulled a Glock Model 26 pistol from his back pocket and shot Mr. Ileto twice. But that was not the end, he said.
"He stated that the mail carrier bent over and attempted to run away," said a criminal complaint filed on Wednesday but unsealed this morning. "He then shot the mail carrier a few times in the back until he saw the mail carrier fall to the ground face down."
Mr. Ileto was shot at close range nine times.
The complaint added that five of the nine shots that hit Mr. Ileto were considered fatal by the coroner. Both the Federal and state authorities filed murder charges today in that killing. Either could bring the death penalty.
At a news conference this morning the District Attorney, Gil Garcetti, said he separately filed a seven-count complaint against Mr. Furrow, 37, including the hate-motivated murder of Mr. Ileto, the attempted murder of the five people at the Jewish center and carjacking.
Mr. Furrow made an initial appearance before a Federal magistrate on the murder charge and on another felony count, illegal possession of a firearm. He was denied bail. But the relaxed, heavyset man in prison blues, handcuffs and shackles stood in stunning contrast to the cold-blooded, racist murderer described by the United States Attorney and the Los Angeles District Attorney.
Mr. Furrow, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with close-cropped hair, a mustache and wire-rimmed, aviator-style glasses sliding down his nose, shuffled into the courtroom so quietly at 11 A.M. that few of the several dozen reporters present seemed to notice him initially.
He tersely answered a few procedural questions posed by the Federal magistrate, Carolyn Turchin, and spoke up only once in the seven-minute hearing, to correct her when she read his name, adding "Junior" after she said Buford O. Furrow.
In trying to fill in details of Mr. Furrow's rampage here on Tuesday, the authorities only added to the questions about how Mr. Furrow, a well-known member of white supremacist groups and a convicted felon, could amass the money he used to pay for his expedition to Los Angeles from his home in Washington State and the huge arsenal of weapons he brought with him.
He was believed to be unemployed with a history of losing jobs, but he used at least $4,000 to buy a van last Saturday. He then spent $800 on a taxi ride to Las Vegas, Nev. Law-enforcement officials would not comment on whether they have evidence that he received financial or other kinds of assistance.
The shootings began about 10:49 A.M. on Tuesday, when he entered the North Valley Jewish Community Center in the Granada Hills section of Los Angeles and squeezed off at least 70 shots with an Uzi submachine gun, hitting five people, including three children at a day camp.
All five are now recovering, although one 5-year-old boy was still listed in critical condition today. He then fled in his van, parked it then carjacked the Toyota, the police said.
"There is evidence that the murder was racially motivated," said Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the United States Attorney here.
Another puzzling element was added today when the taxi company that transported Mr. Furrow to Las Vegas after the shootings said that he had hailed the taxi near the heart of Hollywood, about 20 miles from where he had abandoned the Toyota after shooting Mr. Ileto. Somehow he covered that distance in spite of a police dragnet in the vicinity of the crimes.
Alexander Konopov of the Independent Taxi Company said a driver, Hovik Garibyan, had picked up Mr. Furrow near Sunset Boulevard. and Cherokee Street between 5 P.M. and 6 P.M. Mr. Furrow initially asked to be taken to the airport, then said he was afraid of flying and asked to be taken to Las Vegas, Mr. Konopov said.
A price of $800 was negotiated, Mr. Furrow paid with $100 and $50 bills, and then he slept most of the way.
In addition to raising serious concerns about a conspiracy, the shootings also intensified the debate over gun control. Mr. Furrow had such a large arsenal, including handguns, an assault rifle, hand grenades and thousands of rounds of ammunition, that the police had said earlier they felt lucky more people had not been hurt.
President Clinton commented on the shootings today, calling them "another compelling argument for the passage of hate crimes legislation and the common-sense gun legislation." Law-enforcement officials have not yet said how they believe Mr. Furrow obtained the weapons or the results of any tracing they have done of the origins of the guns.
The Federal complaint unsealed today listed two charges, the premeditated murder of a Federal employee in the performance of his duties, and the illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Mr. Furrow was convicted of attempted assault in Washington State last year. Mr. Mayorkas said Mr. Furrow could face other Federal charges. His next hearing on the Federal charges will be on Aug. 24.
Law-enforcement officials did their best to present a unified front, since there had been a behind-the scenes struggle between the United States Attorney's office and the District Attorney over who would charge and try Mr. Furrow first. Those issues remained unresolved today, but at the news conference Mr. Garcetti said they had formed a joint task force to continue the investigation and to determine when and where Mr. Furrow would ultimately be tried.
"We intend to continue working together to insure that justice is served," said Mr. Garcetti, who added that he expected Mr. Furrow to be arraigned on the state charges within a few days.

HEADLINE: Forbes Puts His Money and His Message on the Line in Iowa's Straw Poll

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Aboard his high-tech bus, watching the corn fields whiz by, Steve Forbes is wheeling into town squares all over Iowa these days in search of respect as a Presidential contender.
Mr. Forbes -- publisher, politician and patrician -- is a blur of nonstop motion, rolling around the rural landscape at the rate of four to six cities a day, 180 events in four weeks. He is seeking enough support -- and spending whatever it takes -- to make a respectable showing in the Republican straw poll here on Saturday, a prize that confers headline status even though it is no real test of voter sentiment. 
 Accompanied by an entourage in two shiny big buses equipped with the latest satellite and digital gear, Mr. Forbes is banking on a decent enough showing to justify the $10 million he has spent on his message of conservative morals, politics and economics, themes his advisers say resonate best in rural America.
For all his money, in fact, Mr. Forbes is often seen here as being a regular guy, as he travels the byways from Grundy Center to Marengo, Pella to Monona.
"I back everything he said," said William Baretich, a retired high school principal who showed up at a Forbes event this week in Eagle Grove. "So far as I am concerned, his wealth is a plus. I have no idea how he got it, but he's got a good business sense and we need someone with his expertise to run the Government because it's probably the biggest corporation of them all."
Alone among the Presidential candidates to foot his own bill, Mr. Forbes, chief executive of the business magazine Forbes, whose net worth is estimated at $440 million to $500 million, said he would spend whatever it took to be competitive with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Forbes spent more than $35 million on his failed Presidential bid in 1996. Mr. Bush has raised more than $36 million, and both candidates have opted out of the campaign finance system and its limits on spending.
"Be assured," Mr. Forbes, 52, said, without being specific, in a back-of-the-bus interview, "I will spend enough to be very competitive."
In Iowa, what he is buying, besides lots of radio and television advertisements, is organization, which is what really counts in the nearly 25-year-old Iowa straw vote. His campaign entourage has been pulling up to American Legion and Elks halls in hundreds of quiet Iowa towns, the sound system on the buses blaring Mr. Forbes's presence like a political music man. While the scenes can be charmingly old-fashioned, the buses are anything but.
Inside, they look like something from a James Bond movie set. A squadron of clean-cut young men, all in identical khaki pants and blue polo shirts emblazoned with the Forbes logo, operate from a hidden high-tech world of laptops, digital laser printers and satellite phones, and make use of three cellular telephone line connections and two dedicated lines for modem use from any town square. Also in the entourage are a bevy of young women in khaki skirts and white polo shirts with the Forbes logo, who hand out Forbes materials, as well as a separate small crew of men in khaki pants and gray polos with a Forbes Iowa logo, who are local supporters.
All the gadgetry is intended to create grass-roots support, and what it means is this: Names and phone numbers written on cards handed out at the events are put into the campaign data bank before the bus reaches the next town; Anyone who wants a picture taken with the candidate gets a color laser copy of the photo before the campaign event is over, and any photos taken can be instantaneously put onto the Forbes campaign Web site, which has received 35 million hits, the Forbes staff said, and drawn 25,000 volunteers on line.
"We're using the Wal-Mart strategy," said K. B. Forbes, the campaign's Iowa press secretary, who is no relation to the candidate. "We are hitting the rural areas first. We're finding the activists who are attracted to Mr. Forbes. All the other candidates are focusing on the chiefs, the elites. We're focusing on the Indians, the grass-roots activists."
This weekend will be the first test of whether Mr. Forbes's messages really do resonate here. 
In his endless stream of gatherings, typically attracting 40 to 80 people, Mr. Forbes offers a stump speech that attacks abortion, Washington-as-usual politics and the recent interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, while extolling a flat 15 percent income tax, higher military spending and greater choice in school and health care selection.
He has loosened up his speaking style, and, while he still appears to be more the banker than the politician, his words are greeted with respectful interest and standing ovations in this politically conservative region. His reference to the "infernal revenue service" is a standard laugh-getter, with his designation of Washington officeholders as "critters looking for the honey pot" of money.
Cora Goodman liked what she heard when Mr. Forbes appeared in Gundy Center, her hometown, this week. "We need a leader to carry on the Reagan policies," Ms. Goodman said. "His idea for a flat tax is honest and simple, and he's not a Washington politician."
John Whalen of Eldora said, "We're in a world of hurt here, and we've got to get the Government out of things, whether it's farming or Medicare. He's right on those issues."
The Iowa straw poll has been criticized as a way for the local Republican Party to gather publicity and dollars -- everyone who votes in it must pay a $25 entry fee and voting must be done in person here in Ames. As a result, candidates like Mr. Forbes pick up the $25 fee for supporters and try to get as many people as they can to come to Ames on a hot summer weekend to vote in a poll that is not binding.
It is a contest where money matters, and Mr. Forbes is pouring on his resources: His aides say they have lined up 85 buses to transport potential voters -- for a total of about 4,000 people in a contest where 10,000 to 15,000 are expected to vote. To attract supporters, Mr. Forbes is offering them a barbecue party in Ames beneath two air-conditioned tents where the country music singer Ronnie Milsap and the inspirational singer Debby Boone will entertain.
Such spending, especially from so wealthy a man, is not troublesome to some here.
Catherine Broer of Iowa Falls, who said she typically voted Democratic, said Mr. Forbes's wealth "was one of the reasons why he intrigues me."
"He's willing to risk his personal fortune in this endeavor," Ms. Broer said.
Keith Schwebke, also of Iowa Falls, said: "His wealth does give him the ability to compete with the Bushes. Yet he still comes across as a common guy I could go up and talk to."
While Mr. Forbes may be dismissed by some as indulging in the political fantasies of a rich man, he sees himself as a man with a message. He contends that the Republican Party has failed when it offers candidates who are long on image but short on policy substance.
"There can be no victory without a message," he said. "Right now, my party is rallied around one candidate," he said, referring to Mr. Bush. "But those who want real change will come more and more to this campaign."
In contrast to his slow start in 1996, Mr. Forbes came out early and aggressively this time, and is sustained by the belief that the party establishment will no longer shrug off his candidacy if he does well in early party caucuses.
Mr. Forbes is spending his money on television, radio and newspaper advertisements and direct mail and phone banks in crucial early states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona and California. As a measure of how the candidate is doing, his campaign likes to pull out a headline from The Fairfield Ledger which said: "Forbes, author of the flat tax, sings to the choir in Fairfield."

HEADLINE: To Save Money, Spend the Surplus on Health;
New Yorkers' Penalty

 BODY:

To the Editor:
John Tierney is right that New York State pays a disproportionate share of Federal income taxes (Big City column, Aug. 9). The tax structure is unfair to New Yorkers, whose taxable incomes are not adjusted for the high cost of living, and puts a huge fiscal drag on our economy. 
 In 1993 the Federal tax increase drained more money out of New York than all but two states, Connecticut and New Jersey. By absorbing funds needed for spending and investment in recession-stricken New York, our recovery was more difficult. Sadly, the increases were passed with the support of many of New York's representatives in Washington.
It's time for substantial tax relief for New York and its neighbors. Congress's tax cut would undo some of the 1993 damage.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Tax Cut Poses More Risks for Giuliani Than for Mrs. Clinton

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Across the nation, Congressional Republicans fanned out this week to rally support for the $792 billion tax cut -- the cornerstone of their 2000 election effort -- that President Clinton has pledged to veto. Across New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton, advocating the Democratic line as she prepares for a probable run for Senate, denounced the same bill as a threat to Medicare, Social Security and the nation's financial health.
Those conflicting political views have now converged at the feet of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the New York Republican who, like Mrs. Clinton, is considering a race for the Senate next year. Suddenly, Mr. Giuliani is finding himself squeezed on one side by Mrs. Clinton and on the other by conservative Republicans who are pressing him to take a position on a piece of legislation that he would, presumably, like to avoid discussing for as long as possible. 
 Since Ronald Reagan came to Washington in 1981, reducing taxes and government spending have been the defining issues for Republican officeholders in this nation. That philosophy shaped the nearly $800 billion tax cut that Congress passed earlier this summer, the largest since Mr. Reagan was in office, and it is the program that Congressional leaders hope to run on next year.
But there is no evidence, pollsters and political consultants said yesterday, that New York voters of either party share quite the passion of Congressional Republicans on tax cuts, particularly during flush economic times. That is particularly true when cuts are presented as coming at the cost of spending on programs that are relatively popular, like Social Security and Medicare.
"Mayor Rudy Giuliani will have a difficult time mobilizing the New York electorate using tax cuts as his message," said Jonathan W. Siegel, director of the Harris Poll Election 2000 unit. "Barring a change in the political or economic environment, they are simply not that compelling an issue to most people."
Initially, Mr. Giuliani, while reiterating his own support for more Federal tax cuts, declined to say how he would have voted on the tax cut bill, saying he had not had an opportunity to study it. By yesterday, under attack by Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, and Representative Rick A. Lazio, the conservative Republican who had threatened to challenge Mr. Giuliani for the senatorial nomination, the Mayor offered a slightly more expansive view on the measure.
Mr. Giuliani said that he backed large tax cuts, but not as large as those that had been legislated by the Republicans.
Mr. Giuliani did not say whether he would actually have bucked his party's leadership had he been in Washington to vote against the bill; Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly said she would have voted against it.
On one hand, the debate on the Republican tax cut has presented New Yorkers with a sharp and early contrast between the two probable major party candidates for Senate. Over the last few weeks, Mrs. Clinton has been talking first about assuring the viability of two of the nation's largest spending programs, Medicare and Social Security. By contrast, Mr. Giuliani has talked mainly about cutting taxes, particularly the capital gains tax.
Beyond that, Mr. Giuliani's predicament suggests that Mrs. Clinton is not alone in confronting some fairly tricky ground in the year ahead, as each seeks to please the diverse political agendas of supporters. In Mrs. Clinton's case, the main complication is her husband's administration; for Mr. Giuliani, it is the Republican leadership in Congress, as well as conservative voters in New York.
There is no doubt that the Republican Party, intense in its devotion to defeating Mrs. Clinton, will give Mr. Giuliani some room to move as he seeks office in a state where Democratic voters hold the edge.
"Short of endorsing Al Gore, Rudy Giuliani can do anything he wants, and the Beltway G.O.P. will tolerate it," said Nelson Warfield, a Republican consultant. "Rudy Giuliani has cheated on the national party repeatedly, and on issues like the tax cut, he'll stray again. But the G.O.P. leadership is married to him."
But there is only so far that this Republican in particular can go in defying the Republican leadership in Congress, should he choose to do so. Mr. Giuliani is already viewed suspiciously in Republican circles, given his moderate position on such issues as abortion rights and gay rights, and his endorsement of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, in 1994.
Tax cuts are a particularly central issue for the party, as has become clear this year on Capitol Hill. And Washington politics notwithstanding, Mr. Giuliani has to take care not to take positions that discourage Republican voters from turning out. And he presumably needs to make sure that the Conservative Party, which has made no secret of its concerns about Mr. Giuliani's opinions, does not abandon him in the 2000 election.
That is what explains Mrs. Clinton's decision to attack the tax bill at her recent listening seminars; though she never mentions Mr. Giuliani's name, she is trying to force him to deal with the issue. Mrs. Clinton found herself in a curious lock step with Mr. Lazio when he criticized Mr. Giuliani for not taking a position on the issue.
Still, even in New York, the tax cut is not a cut-and-dried issue, and for all of Mr. Giuliani's difficulties, Mrs. Clinton may not have an easy time using it against him.
That is because income in the Northeast is so high, and New York residents are apt to get back a disproportionate amount of any Federal tax cuts. And because living costs in the region are so high, a tax cut that might be attacked by Democrats in other parts of the nation as benefiting the upper class will in fact be of interest to many upper-income New Yorkers who consider themselves middle class.
That was why Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, voted for the initial Republican version of the tax cut bill.
"It's a caution I'm giving to Hillary," Mr. Torricelli said yesterday. "What may have looked like a significant income tax cut in Arkansas is decidedly middle class in New York and New Jersey."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Beekman Town House Going Condo

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Work is winding down on a $10.5 million renovation to transform a 19th-century single-family town house that has long been vacant on Beekman Place into a seven-unit condominium building, a first for this tony two-block stretch of Manhattan, between 49th and 51st Streets on the East River.
The seven-story building, at 25-27 Beekman Place, will have seven one- and two-story apartments, including a penthouse. The apartments will all have terraces, river views and fireplaces -- as many as three -- and will range in size from 1,725 to 2,950 square feet. The prices will be from $2.6 million to $5.2 million. The ground-floor duplex units also have gardens. 
 The developer is Enrico Minoli, an investment banker from Italy, who stumbled upon the 40-foot-wide building, between 50th and 51st Streets while he was seeking a Manhattan pied-a-terre, said Elizabeth Sample, a director at Brown Harris Stevens, the brokerage firm. Ms. Sample and her associate, Brenda Powers, are the sales agents.
Combining the two ground-floor duplexes for his own use, Mr. Minoli was hoping that others would want to buy units in an intimate building.
"I wanted to incorporate the luxury and elegance of the European life style into functional yet sophisticated living in Manhattan," Mr. Minoli said. Contracts have been signed for three of the remaining five apartments, the sales agents said.
The Minoli project is not the only example of a large town house in a prime location undergoing conversion to condominiums. At 136 East 19th Street, between Third Avenue and Irving Place, a 47-foot-wide five-story town house is being turned into five apartments of 2,200 to 2,400 square feet that are for sale. Prices have not been set, according to the Sunshine Group, which is marketing the project.
At 3 East 80th Street, off Fifth Avenue, a 40-foot-wide six-story town house is becoming two apartments, one with 8,000 square feet for the developer. The other, with 6,000 square feet, is to be sold for $9.75 million.
And a development team from Greenwich, Conn. -- Stephen Weiss and Stuart Berelson, principals in the Newhardscabble Corporation -- is building a new high-end town house condominium -- a five-story building at 9 East 64th Street, between Madison and Fifth Avenues. The building, designed to blend with its neighbors, will have three condominium apartments, ranging in size from 3,300 to 6,800 square feet, and in price from $3.9 million to $7.5 million, according to Douglas Elliman, another brokerage that is marketing the building as well as the one at East 80th Street.
The activity, brokers say, is constrained because of the limited inventory of one- and two-family town houses in Manhattan, which the Real Estate Board of New York put at 2,854. Zoning restrictions are also a factor. Large town houses in prime locations are even more scarce and generally are being bought by people as private homes, said Sharon Baum, director of the exclusive property division at the Corcoran Group.
Nan MarElia, director of the town house division at Douglas Elliman, added, "The few buildings being turned into apartments represent special opportunities to create condos in a town house setting, but developers must buy them at the right price to make the economics work."
In the last year, prices for town houses have risen. According to the Real Estate Board, the median sales price for East Side town houses increased to $2.5 million in 1998 from $1.7 million in 1997 and for West Side town houses, it rose to $1.4 million from $1.3 million.
Beekman Place is named for the Beekman family, which in 1763 built its long-since-demolished riverfront mansion, Mount Pleasant, there. Today, few town houses become available and, with the United Nations nearby, many are used as foreign missions and consulates.
Still, two are for sale at $5.6 million and $21 million, brokers report. Ms. Sample of Brown Harris Stevens said town houses in good condition were selling for $8 million to $9 million. And at 1 Beekman Place, the 39-unit cooperative that John D. Rockefeller developed in the 1920's, a three-bedroom, 4,500-square-foot unit is on the market for between $7 million and $8 million, she said.
The units at 25-27 Beekman Place are selling for an average of $1,200 a square foot, which is competitive and slightly below the price for new condominium apartments on Fifth, Madison and Park Avenues, she said.
Mr. Minoli bought the Beekman Place town house in 1997 for $5 million. The building is known as the Merle-Smith House after Van Santvoord Merle-Smith, a diplomat and banker, who bought the two houses in 1927 and gave them a neo-classical facade. It also had a squash court.
It was sold in 1984 to a developer who proposed a 60-story building on the site. Local residents successfully battled the proposal in court and won a zoning change to restrict the height of new buildings to the neighborhood's low-rise scale, said Buddy Radisch, president of the Beekman Place Association, a neighborhood group. After that, the town house sat vacant.
In 1998, Mr. Minoli began renovating the building, including installing new mechanical systems, creating a lobby and adding terraces as well as a rooftop room for the penthouse. The building will be faced with white limestone-colored stucco and most of the one- to three-bedroom units will have entry foyers and nine-foot ceilings. The renovation architect is Constantine Wickenberg of Manhattan.
The project was delayed for six months through last March because of a change in construction companies. Occupancy is expected in October, Ms. Sample said.

HEADLINE: Resisting a Society's Rage to Spend;
Robert H. Frank Wants to Rein In Galloping Consumption With a Tax

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
On the bulletin board of Robert H. Frank's office at Cornell University here are two glossy photos.
One is of a Porsche 911 Turbo, price $105,000. The other is of a Patek Philippe Calibre '89 timepiece, price $2.7 million. 
 They are not there as objects of lust, but they are not there quite as objects of mere censorious academic disapproval either.
Instead, they symbolize the subject of Mr. Frank's work on the psychology and utility of spending and the relative virtues of public and private consumption. Indeed, Mr. Frank, whose newest book is "Luxury Fever" (Free Press, 1999), has become the popular economist of the moment and academia's most conspicuous critic of the dizzy spendathon of the 90's. He argues that people are caught in an arms race of consumption and that tax policies need to be changed to encourage public investment over private spending.
Mr. Frank's new-found celebrity -- he has become an opinion-page regular of various newspapers and an ascendant talking head on television -- has not come without criticism. Even some friendly economists fault his work for being long on supposition and short on data. And conservative economists say the government has no business encouraging or discouraging people from buying luxury goods they want.
But even some who see his prescriptions as political nonstarters concede that Mr. Frank has ventured into one of the most intriguing thickets in economics and modern life: why people spend money, what they spend it on, whether they spend it on the right things.
"What's smart for each individual may not make sense for the group," said Mr. Frank, who is 54. "It's very often smart for one, dumb for all. It's my core idea. I've been pushing it for 25 years, but when I wrote about it back in 1985, no one wanted to discuss it. I'm glad people are listening now."
Mr. Frank, who has an undergraduate degree in mathematics, a masters degree in statistics and a doctorate in economics has taken a textbook route from cloistered academic to op-ed page regular and talking head.
His early books, like "Choosing the Right Pond: Human Behavior and the Quest for Status" (Oxford University Press, 1985) focused on rivalry and cooperation in economic and social behavior and were written for a largely academic audience.
But in recent years Mr. Frank has emerged as a purveyor of deceptively simple ideas that have skillfully tied economic issues to broad social problems. In 1995, he and his co-author, Philip J. Cook, published "The Winner Take-All Society," which argued that the economy and public life is being warped by a society increasingly dominated by a few big winners and many losers. Instead of thousands of privately owned coffee shops, there are now thousands of Starbucks. Students, instead of happily going to their local college, are funneled into a national sweepstakes in which the lucky few get into Harvard. The outcome, they argue, is a high-stress society that directs too many resources in the wrong direction and generates wasteful spending patterns.
In "Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of Excess," Mr. Frank updates many of the ideas of "Choosing the Right Pond," to the Land Rover-stock options-Chateau Latour era. In the earlier book he examined the ways, as he saw it, in which "people come into the world equipped with an inner voice urging them to rank as high as possible on whatever social hierarchy they belong to."
In the new one, he analyzes the boom in luxury spending, whether for a $5,000 Viking-Frontgate Professional Grill, a $17,500 Patek Philippe wristwatch, a $1,800-a-night suite at the Four Seasons Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., or a $48,000 Lexus LX450 sport-utility vehicle.
He argues, as he did in "Choosing the Right Pond," that spending choices have more to do with comparative values than absolute ones. A 3,000-square-foot house that would be a palace in Japan, for example, or even in 1970's America, no longer measures up if your neighbor's house has 4,000 square feet. If competitors are wearing $1,500 suits to job interviews, you need to do the same thing.
There are other critics of consumption, many of them allied with the notion of "voluntary simplicity," which argues for individuals to scale down their lives and demands.
Unlike them, Mr. Frank contends that hyper-consumption can make sense for individuals. If they want the best school district for their child, it might make sense to buy an overpriced house in an exclusive town. If others are driving enormous sport utilities vehicles, people might not be safe in an economical, environmentally friendly Honda Civic. Like a crowd of people at a concert, who all decide to stand because the row in front of them has done so, individual behavior -- standing at a concert, instead of comfortably sitting -- can sometimes make sense if it is dictated by group dynamics.
The problems arise when the needs of the individual are contrary to the needs of the group. The result of luxury fever, he argues, is that individuals work too many hours and undergo too much stress; that society neglects too many critical public needs, ranging from better roads to cleaner air and water, at the expense of often-frivolous private ones.
"The left basically got it wrong from the beginning," said Mr. Frank, who votes Democratic and is clearly closer to the left end of the spectrum than the right. "They said the market is bad because the firms are too powerful and they take advantage of us. They manipulate us through advertisements. They control the political process. It's totally wrong. If there's something really good out there, you'll buy it with or without advertising and if there's a crumby thing, the ads can make you try it once, but you won't come back. So corporations have an incentive to spend their advertising dollars on things you are going to like."
The right, he said, gets it wrong by putting all its faith in the wisdom of the market and the idea that individual demands give the best outcomes for all.
"Sometimes, they do," he said. "But often they don't. When whatever I want has negative consequences for someone else, then the invisible hand doesn't work."
To Mr. Frank, the solution does not lie in the good intentions of the "voluntary simplicity" movement or the imposition of luxury taxes on yachts or diamonds. Instead, he says, it lies in a progressive tax on consumption: not the conventional sales tax, under which all purchasers pay the same thing, but a tax on total spending, with rates increasing as spending increases. Consumption would be calculated, essentially, by subtracting savings from earnings.
The tax would act like boxing gloves or steroid bans, he said, to keep the competition at a more sensible level by deterring runaway spending on luxuries: the biggest houses and biggest boats and costliest cars would tend to get smaller and less costly and the restraints on spending would ripple down through society, just as the luxury arms race now ripples up.
"Listen, I love stuff," said Mr. Frank, who has a Saab and BMW in the garage of his 1911 Arts and Crafts-style house in Ithaca, N.Y. "I like cars. I like food and wine. I buy rugs and lamps. You can't change human nature. You can just change the rules of the game. You don't eliminate the race. You just make it cheaper."
Many mainstream economists applaud the idea of a consumption tax, and say the idea makes sense, however dim its political prospects may be.
"Even if you don't use the argument Frank does about consumption, it's an excellent way to encourage savings," said Kenneth Arrow, a retired Stanford University economist and Nobel laureate. And many liberal economists applaud Frank's ability to put broad issues about consumption and public investment on the table.
To many free-market conservatives, however, Mr. Frank's scholarship and newfound celebrity are equally suspect.
Sherwin Rosen, an economist at the University of Chicago, said Mr. Frank's views on why people spend are based on supposition, not on research. He said the Government has no business telling people what to spend money on, and the robust economy is eloquent rejoinder to Mr. Frank's critique. And he argues that data showing an alarmingly low savings rate fail to take into account the degree to which a rising stock market has allowed people to accumulate wealth in ways that savings figures do not measure.
"Why should some guy in Ithaca be telling me what I should be spending money on?" he said. "How does he know why people spend? He has no data, no proof. You can't have economic policy or government involvement in the economy based on pure speculation."
Some say an overall consumption tax is too crude an instrument, one that would still allow people to spend on the most socially harmful goods if they chose. Others say that a proposal, in effect, to take resources from the rich and give them to the Government is the kind of solution only a liberal academic could seriously propose at a time when politicians are battling over the size of tax cuts. And conservatives argue that private spending is more efficient than Government spending, so a dollar taken from consumption need not mean a dollar in services like better roads or Federal food inspection.
Mr. Frank concedes that his argument can sound too simple, particularly when he adds the seemingly contradictory kicker that if people followed the incentives to save and invest rather than spend, their extra earnings would allow them to spend even more than they did earlier.
Still, even the critics tend to give credit to Mr. Frank for being onto something truly vexing and insufficiently examined in American life at a time houses built in this country have doubled in size since 1970.
Jack Hirshleifer, a retired University of California at Los Angeles economist, reviewed "Luxury Fever" unfavorably in the publication Reason. But he concluded: "Still, I am inclined to defend Frank in one important respect: as a moralist and a Jeremiah. If our society is to remain at its barely civilized level, from time to time we do need to be reproved for the vulgarity of wasteful consumption, not to mention the in-your-face boorishness currently recommended by ideologies of self-assertiveness and self-esteem."
Mr. Frank sees his work as scholarship, not moralizing. But he is comfortable with the degree to which his work has taken economic issues and raised overarching social issues.
"It's always been natural for me to think of everything as an economic question," he said. "It's all choice. It's all scarcity. You want to do more of one thing, you have to do less of another. Money is just a unit of accounting to think about how much we care about different things. I think one of the problems with economics is that it has insisted on too narrow a model of human nature, too impoverished a view of social interaction. You can't explain everything as trying to squeeze our every ounce from the bottom line."

HEADLINE: After Years of Division, Cherokees Get New Leader

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: TAHLEQUAH, Okla., Aug. 12

 BODY:
As a member of the Cherokee Nation and a student of its history, Chad Smith need only look to his family tree to find a famed leader of his tribe. Redbird Smith, his great-grandfather, was a patriot who went to prison rather than accept the Federal policy that deprived the Cherokees of millions of acres.
A century later, Mr. Smith will take office on Saturday as the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, and, like his great-grandfather, who served in the Cherokee Senate, he is assuming leadership at a time of crisis. For the last four years, the Cherokees have engaged in political infighting so bitter that it almost undermined their constitution and ultimately led to intervention by the Federal Government. 
 Asked about the priorities of his administration, Mr. Smith, a 48-year-old lawyer from the Tulsa suburbs, replied simply, "Healing."
With an estimated 200,000 members, half of whom live here in northeastern Oklahoma, the Cherokees are the country's second-largest tribe, behind the Navajos. And they have enjoyed a degree of prosperity and autonomy that has made them a model to other tribes. Now Mr. Smith must restore confidence in the tribal government not only among Cherokees but also among Federal officials, who stepped in two years ago at the height of the tribe's crisis, after members brawled outside the tribal courthouse.
"It's extremely important that the tribe come back together, and I think it will," said Rennard Strickland, dean of the University of Oregon School of Law, who is half-Cherokee and has written five books about the tribe. "The Cherokees have a very long history of being able to heal these kinds of tribal divisions. It has been a long 100 years."
For many Cherokees, the last four years alone have seemed interminable. The election of Joe Byrd as Principal Chief in 1995 followed the disqualification of his runoff opponent by the tribe's highest court. That opponent, George Bearpaw, was ruled ineligible because he had once pleaded guilty to an assault charge, though the conviction was later expunged. Many Cherokees regarded Mr. Byrd's victory as tainted, and his predecessor, Chief Wilma Mankiller, refused to attend his inauguration.
In 1997, the tribal government, with headquarters here at Tahlequah, teetered on collapse. First Chief Byrd dismissed 15 members of the Cherokees' marshals service who had executed a search warrant of his office as part of an investigation into the possibility of financial wrongdoing. Then, at the urging of Chief Byrd, eight members of the tribal council -- the seven other members were absent -- ousted by impeachment the three justices on the court who had issued the warrant. And on June 20 of that year, an armed security force hired by Chief Byrd seized the tribal courthouse and locked out all the employees, a move tantamount to taking over the judicial branch.
"It seemed that every month we would have a new problem," Ms. Mankiller said the other day. "Just when we would think things wouldn't get any worse, they did."
The bottom came on Aug. 13, 1997, when the fired marshals, led by their director, Pat Ragsdale, tried to take back the courthouse at the behest of the three impeached justices. A fight broke out with Chief Byrd's security force, and town police officers and county deputies arrested Mr. Ragsdale. Federal officers eventually came to Tahlequah (pronounced TAH-luh-kwah), and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt helped mediate the dispute. The justices were ultimately reinstated.
The 1999 election, with a field of nine, including Chief Byrd, became a referendum on his administration. Respected leaders like Ms. Mankiller and Julian Fite, a former United States Attorney, endorsed Mr. Ragsdale in the primary, but Mr. Smith, who had finished third in 1995, built a coalition with an appeal to Cherokee tradition, heritage and culture. He had worked as a tribal prosecutor, as well as a public defender in Tulsa, and had served in two tribal administrations. He had also taught Indian law and history at several colleges, including Dartmouth.
Still, Mr. Smith's candidacy was not without problems: It came out during the primary that he had fathered three children outside his marriage. But his wife, a former Miss Cherokee, issued a statement entitled "In Support of My Husband," and when Mr. Smith emerged as Chief Byrd's runoff opponent, the defeated candidates and their backers rallied behind him. He won by 1,600 votes, of about 13,000 cast, in the runoff balloting last month.
"The kind of coalition that came together to bring in new leadership and defeat this administration was really something that I haven't seen in a long, long time," Ms. Mankiller said.
The soft-spoken Mr. Smith says his "defining moment" came on June 20, 1997, the day Chief Byrd's officers seized the courthouse. County deputies had cordoned off the building, essentially enforcing the Chief's takeover, but Mr. Smith ducked under the police tape. As he began to walk toward the courthouse to protest, he was tackled and arrested. He says he considered the seizure of the courthouse a challenge to the legitimacy of the Cherokee Nation's government and constitution.
The challenges facing Mr. Smith and his new administration are formidable. The Cherokees, who have no reservation per se but exercise certain jurisdictional rights in 14 northeastern Oklahoma counties under agreements with the state and Federal governments, operate on an annual budget of $150 million, about $90 million of it from Washington. But the Government, having found a lack of accountability in the use of Federal money, has placed the tribe under a monthly draw for those grants, rather than yearly. Chief Byrd himself also faces misappropriation-of-funds charges brought by tribal prosecutors.
In an interview this week, Chief Byrd denied any wrongdoing and said he had never overstepped his constitutional bounds. He said that he would leave the tribe with a $12 million surplus in the current fiscal year and that under his leadership improvements had been made in the tribe's high school and its business, Cherokee Nation Industries, which builds computer boards.
"We're leaving the goose that lays the golden egg," said Chief Byrd, who remains popular among the people from whom he sprung, the tribe's many rural Oklahomans.
Mr. Smith and his allies are far less certain of the tribe's fiscal health. Ms. Mankiller, whose daughters are now working on Mr. Smith's transition team, said initial financial reviews had found a bookkeeping mess. She said only one independent audit of government finances had been conducted since 1995.
Mr. Smith said he planned to institute new rules and procedures to insure the tribe's fiscal integrity. He also hopes to promote economic development, improve services and promote the Cherokees' culture and heritage. At the inauguration, he said, he will plant a tree on the courthouse grounds.
"It symbolizes rebirth," he said. "We reach into our history, and we try to honor it and remember it."

HEADLINE: L. L. Bean Casts About For Ways To Grow;
New Clothing Lines; Updated Web Site; More Retail Stores

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

DATELINE: FREEPORT, Me., Aug. 9

 BODY:
First came the indoor trout pond. Then there was the barnlike addition devoted to children's clothes and accessories. Now comes what is perhaps the ultimate sign that L. L. Bean, the 87-year-old arbiter of what's what in rugged outerwear, is going after cosseted baby boomers in a big way: the company's Maine Hunting Shoe, its first product and essential icon, has been revamped to make it more comfortable.
The changes in the boot are subtle to the naked eye. What was a vulcanized, hand-formed rubber sole is now molded in a machine-driven method that the company says saves money and results in a lighter, warmer, better-fitting product. "It may look the same on the outside," declares the literature that accompanies the new boot, which is still arrestingly utilitarian-looking, "but there's an inside story." 
Other recent changes within the privately held company -- based, as it has always been, here in this tourist mecca of outlet stores and lobster shacks -- reflect an even bigger effort to recast the venerable L. L. Bean into a more up-to-date mold.
The company has added a new brand aimed at working women, expanded its home-furnishings department and "turned up the volume" on its children's line, as one executive put it. Even more startling, Bean plans to develop a bigger retail presence -- once unthinkable in a company that made its name in mail-order -- by opening three to five full-scale stores along the Eastern Seaboard. The first is scheduled to appear by next summer in a sprawling suburban mall at Tysons Corner, Va., outside Washington.
All this is meant to counter plateauing sales at L. L. Bean, which does not publish a financial statement but says it sold just over $1 billion worth of gloves, parkas, kayaks, coffee tables, boot-shaped chocolates, rifles, fly rods, lamps, duffle bags, snowboards, men's dress shirts, dog beds, khakis, blazers, skirts, pillow shams, knapsacks and bathing suits last year.
The company witnessed enormous growth until recently. In 1967, it had just under $5 million in sales. Lately, however, the commercial environment has grown more complicated, with shifting consumer tastes and the explosion of electronic commerce -- two areas where Bean has been slow to adapt.
Now the goal, says Leon A. Gorman, who has been Bean's president for the last 32 years, is to increase sales at a double-digit rate every year, to about $1.4 billion by 2002.
Mr. Gorman outlined the challenges facing the company in a memo last year. Among his points was that the company's traditional attitude toward profits -- that they would emerge naturally if customers were treated well and stakeholders well served -- had to go. "This attitude was naive, perhaps, on our part although it served us well for many years," Mr. Gorman told his staff. "In today's environment, however, we are going to have to focus much more intently on profitability."
Some see risks, however, in moving further into bricks-and-mortar retailing. "It's going to be intriguing to watch, because often you find the folks who are successful with catalogues are not successful with stores, and vice versa," said Kenneth M. Gassmann, a retail analyst with Davenport & Company in Richmond. "J. Peterman? We all know what happened there."
J. Peterman, whose catalogues were famously wordy and eccentric, declared bankruptcy earlier this year after a high-speed expansion into retail stores that did not do well.
But Bean executives, pointing to successful examples of outdoor-oriented companies like Patagonia, a unit of Lost Arrow, and REI that have expanded beyond mail-order into retailing, insist that they have examined the issues carefully and expect the concept of additional stores to work. While the company has a handful of factory outlets in four states, and through a partnership has a dozen or so boutiques in Japan, it says its new, large stores will bring in many new customers.
"There are 1.5 million Bean customers within five miles of Tysons Corners," said L. L. Bean's general manager for retail, William P. Shea, a portly, exuberant proponent of the retail concept, so much so that Mr. Gorman, his boss, refers to it as "Bill's baby." He added: "And that's before we arrive. Just wait till we arrive."
Mr. Shea plans to move as many as 100 Bean employees to work in the new store, "to transfer the culture," as he put it.
Mr. Gorman, a serene, athletic 63-year-old, is emblematic of the old-school L. L. Bean, which his grandfather started in 1912. Committed to as much domestic manufacturing as possible, especially if it is done in Maine, he was pivotal in the effort to revamp the Bean boot, whose rubber soles will be made by a small factory near Lewiston, Me. (Another small factory made the old soles.) He supports sturdy causes like the Nature Conservancy, the Boy Scouts and the Maine chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.
At the same time, he talks of brand loyalty like someone fresh out of an M.B.A. program, citing the self-assessment and subsequent reorganization the company went through last year as priming it well for the future.
"We have the initiatives in motion now that will provide substantial growth opportunities in the years ahead," Mr. Gorman says, looking slightly embarrassed about the management-speak that has invaded his vocabulary lately. Terms like "brand management" do not sound quite at home at a company that hacked its way out of the wilderness, selling hunting gear and, when its thoughts turned to domesticity, scratchy woolen blankets and chairs made from snowshoes. "I have to invent a new word," he said.
Yet for all its cautious leanings, Bean set itself up for a serious fall twice in the last two decades. First came its response to "The Official Preppy Handbook," a spoof of boarding-school style, or lack thereof, published in 1980 that named Bean footwear as part of the required wardrobe.
Mr. Gorman says now he wishes that distinction had passed the company by. "The women's apparel in particular got this frumpy appellation," he said, calling it "not really reflective of the product line." The company geared up to handle an influx of orders, which came and went, leaving Bean with excess capacity.
More devastating was the company's blighted love affair with the Japanese. In the late 1980's, the Japanese became heavy users of Bean products, part of it a fashion trend, part of it stemming from interest in the outdoors, and all of it helped along by the strong yen. Sales to Japan built steadily, reaching 20 percent of the company's overall business by 1995, Mr. Gorman said.
Shortly after that, the bottom dropped out of the Japanese economy, taking most of Bean's sales to Japan with it. At the same time, domestic sales were weak, and competition from longtime rivals like Lands' End, which posted $1.4 billion in sales last year, intensified.
Then there is the matter of the Internet. Bean had jumped on the concept early, and its Web site was open for business by 1996. But competitors roared by it, embracing improved technology that helped consumers find their sizes, for example, while the Bean site puttered along exactly the way it had started.
"At a very basic level, there are some things L. L. Bean really needs to get on, including offering more sizing information and more tools," said Evie Black Dykema, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Over all, their site is very thorough. It's basically their catalogue, on line. But to realize their full potential, they will need to expand their functionality beyond what can be found in their catalogue."
Other outdoor suppliers, like Lands' End and Recreational Equipment Inc., or REI, have moved well beyond Bean's efforts in cyberspace, she added. And other analysts are less charitable about the situation.
"They really fell behind the pack by not picking up on E-commerce soon enough and not being more aggressive with it," said Alan Mak, an analyst with Argus Research in New York. "They lacked the vision to see how powerful the Internet was as a retail medium. And trying to play catch-up on the Internet is extremely difficult."
Part of the problem seems to have been the revolving door at Bean's E-commerce division. Patricia Robles, the current executive in charge, is the third person to hold the post in the last two years. One recent departure was Tom Harden, an executive vice president who left to work for an Internet mail-order gift company, Send.com. But Ms. Robles insists that the company's revamped Web site, which is supposed to be available in October, will counter all of the criticism by being as efficient, user-friendly and up-to-date as possible.
"For a company that's known to be conservative and traditional, we really were out on the Web early," said Ms. Robles, whose 15-year career at Bean has included stints as a women's apparel product manager and a manager of inventory control. "The disadvantages are that you put in early infrastructure and it quickly becomes outdated. We did not move quickly to replace some of the infrastructure, but we're doing that now."
Electronic commerce recently achieved improved status within L. L. Bean, Ms. Robles said. "We are really putting significant resources into the Web," she said. The new site, she said, will include tips on where to go on outdoor excursions, as well as what someone might need and how to order it from Bean.
Another recent addition is a brand called Freeport Studio, which is supposed to appeal to working women by offering clothing that is low maintenance, relatively stylish and affordable. "We're trying to address the casualization of America," said Cindy Marshall, the marketing executive for the line. "We're certainly not corporate."
The brand came out with its own catalogue in January, and sales are strong, Bean executives say. The line came about in response to a letter from a longtime customer who bought other Bean products, but pointed out that while they were useful on weekends, "there are only 52 weekends a year, and I need something to wear the rest of the time."
She closed the letter by advising the company: "Get with it."

After decades of rapid gains that transformed L. L.Bean from a tiny $5 million company in 1967 to a $1 billion titan in the mid-1990's, sales have stalled recently. To restore growth, L. L. Bean is even tinkering with its iconic Maine Hunting Shoe, above, expanding into cyberspace and building its first full-scale retail stores outside Maine.

HEADLINE: Producer Price Index Numbers Ease Investor Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
The stock and bond markets surged yesterday after the Government released a reassuring report that showed a modest increase in prices at the wholesale level in July, easing investor concerns about inflation.
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July as the first decline in food prices since April blunted the impact of a surge in energy prices. The July increase, which followed a decline of one-tenth of a percent in June, was below analysts' forecasts. When the volatile food and energy components were excluded, prices were unchanged. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 184.26 points, its biggest rise since mid-June, as interest rates fell as much as one-tenth of a percentage point.
While most analysts say they believe the Federal Reserve will still raise the target for a key overnight lending rate at its policy meeting on Aug. 24, the July producer price figures seemed to rule out any need for a rate increase of more than a quarter of a percentage point and diminish the likelihood that further increases would be needed to keep inflation at bay.
But other soundings could still change things, including the Government's report Tuesday on inflation at the consumer level.
"It was a quite good number," Stan Shipley, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said of yesterday's report. "Deflationary pressures persist in the economy."
The so-called core rate, which excludes food and energy, was unchanged last month, after a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in June. That figure was also a bit lower than the consensus of forecasters.
Moreover, analysts said they found no immediate cause for concern about inflation at earlier stages in the production pipeline even though price increases in some categories of goods were enough that they might become unsettling if they were to continue.
Prices of intermediate goods, like cloth, rose six-tenths of 1 percent, while those of crude goods, like coal, declined two-tenths of 1 percent.
The drought that has ravaged grain, vegetable and other crops in much of the Northeast and Southeast had little effect on food prices, which tumbled nine-tenths of 1 percent, offsetting the combined increases for May and June.
"It's difficult to find any food commodities that rose in price that could be attributed to drought," said Joe Kowal, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, noting that growing conditions in the Midwest have been excellent.
It is possible, other analysts said, that the drought actually helped restrain the rise in producer prices as farmers and ranchers sped livestock sales up because of a lack of affordable feed. Prices of cattle for slaughter, for example, fell 2.4 percent in July after rising 3.8 percent in June and price declines accelerated for hogs and chickens for slaughter.
Bruce Kasman, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan, called the latest inflation reading "very benign" but added that a long period of steadily lower inflation was giving way to price "normalization" that would require vigilance at the Federal Reserve.
Other Labor Department reports in recent weeks have showed wage acceleration and continued drum-tight job markets, intensifying jitters about inflation in the securities markets.
"There's no problem here right now -- no reason to slam your feet on the brakes," Mr. Kasman said. But he added that some of yesterday's data did show "reasons to be a little concerned" if increases persisted into the autumn. But James E. Glassman at Chase Manhattan said that strong productivity growth by manufacturers was likely to prevent these increases from being passed along.
One sensitive area is durable items like copper and plywood used in the manufacturing process, an element of the intermediate-goods category. These materials, which also include brass mill shapes, building board and glass, jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent last month after rising seven-tenths of 1 percent in June.
Construction materials rose seven-tenths of 1 percent while chemicals and other nondurables consumed by factories rose four-tenths of a percent following an exceptional surge in June.
Energy prices were sharply higher at all stages of production -- 3.4 percent among finished goods, 2.9 percent among intermediates and 3.7 percent for raw material. More than half the jump in finished energy was a result of a 12.7 percent jump in gasoline after a decline of 1.9 percent in June.
The index for beef and veal slumped 3.4 percent after rising more than twice as much in June, while the price of fresh eggs jumped 7.1 percent, both moves possibly reflecting the effects of drought.

HEADLINE: A Worsening Crisis Over Taiwan

 BODY:
With tensions mounting dangerously across the Taiwan Strait, both sides need to step back and consider the risks they are courting -- Taipei by its reckless declarations and Beijing by its unacceptable military threats. Taiwan and the mainland have escalated the crisis by repeatedly flying warplanes in the direction of each other's territory. Chinese publications now regularly report on Beijing's preparedness to assault Taiwanese-held territory, and Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, holds to his provocative demand that China deal with his island as a separate sovereign state.
Any military clash between China and Taiwan would imperil Taiwan's prosperity and democracy, threaten China's economic development and gravely damage relations between Washington and Beijing. 
 The United States, like most countries, recognizes Beijing's as the only lawful government of China. Washington considers Taiwan geographically part of China, but not currently subject to mainland political rule. That widely accepted formula leaves the question of China's eventual reunification to be resolved peacefully, at a later date, by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Meanwhile, America is committed to providing Taiwan with adequate means to defend itself against attack.
That sensible arrangement was deliberately challenged last month by President Lee with his new formula of two separate sovereign states. Beijing predictably and unjustifiably responded with threats of military force. Concern has centered on the possible blockade, shelling or occupation of several small islands controlled by Taiwan just off the Chinese mainland.
Four decades ago, Chinese shelling of the two offshore islands Quemoy (now called Kinmen) and Matsu brought American warships to the Taiwan Strait and Washington and Beijing close to military confrontation. Relations between the United States and China have come a long way since that unhappy era. Beijing should not risk reversing that progress with a new episode of aggression.
In the event of Chinese military action against Taiwan, President Clinton would have little choice but to chill relations with Beijing, freeze economic talks and consider whether American military intervention was warranted. The Administration must be sure that Beijing understands these likely consequences before China resorts to force.

HEADLINE: Pullout From Panama and Venezuelan Reluctance Leave Gap in U.S. Air War on Drugs

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
The withdrawal of the United States from military bases in Panama, combined with the refusal of Venezuela's new Government to let its airspace be used for American surveillance and pursuit flights, has created a huge gap in regional drug interdiction that trafficking cartels are exploiting, American officials say.
The weakness has emerged since May, when the United States returned Howard Air Base, from which 2,000 anti-drug flights a year had been operating, to Panama as required by the Panama Canal Treaties. 
 Three alternative sites have been found, but they either are not yet able to function at full capacity or their effectiveness has been sharply limited by political considerations.
"These are very clever people," Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, said of the drug cartels, "and they are watching us very closely. So if you have an enormous hole in the middle of the equation, it will have a fundamental change on the effectiveness of these solutions." He made the remark during a four-nation South American tour in late July.
In a telephone interview from Washington, one Pentagon official expressed hope that "by the end of the year, we should be up to 85 or 90 percent" of the flight capacity that existed before the end of operations in Panama.
The official would not estimate the number of drug shipments now getting through as a result of the problem but conceded that at the moment, interdiction efforts were "not doing so well in the source zone."
Still, said Bruce Bagley, a professor at the University of Miami who is an expert on the Latin American drug trade, the United States "is not without other assets that can be used," like satellite photography.
"Although it is a setback, it is not a disaster," Professor Bagley said of the Venezuelan policy. "Colombia is the principal focus of growing and processing cocaine now, and the lack of rights to overfly Venezuela does not inhibit efforts as significantly as many analysts in Washington have suggested."
Although interdiction "doesn't work very well" and is "barely a holding action," he said, "the alternative is "to do nothing, to give up."
Venezuela is not a grower of coca, the raw ingredient for cocaine, or of opium poppies, from which heroin is derived. But it shares a long, poorly patrolled border with Colombia, which produces 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, and more than 100 tons a year of that drug were estimated to have passed through Venezuela last year before flights were banned.
The United States hoped to negotiate an agreement with Panama that would allow the use of Howard Air Base into the next century. But after announcing in December 1997 that such an accord had been reached, President Ernesto Perez Balladares of Panama reneged.
In an effort to close the gap, the Netherlands agreed in April to grant the United States ground and air access to and use of selected airfields in the Dutch colonies of Aruba and Curacao, which lie just off the Venezuelan coast.
A similar agreement has been signed with Ecuador, which allows United States drug surveillance planes to fly from a military base in the coastal city of Manta.
The Manta flights are intended to monitor drug trafficking up the Pacific coast of South America to Mexico, which is the main drug route to the United States. But the runway there is not long enough for sophisticated electronic surveillance aircraft, nor can it take their weight. That makes flights from the two Dutch islands "extremely important," a Pentagon official said.
Without overflight permission from Venezuela, though, the flights from Aruba and Curacao are of limited use.
"We want this to be a truly multilateral effort," said Niek van Zutphen, the Dutch Ambassador in Caracas, referring to aerial surveillance and interdiction. "If you leave one weapon so explicitly unused, you give yourself a handicap and make things very easy for the other side."
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, a 45-year-old former army colonel who took office in February promising a social revolution, has stated explicitly that he will not countenance what he regards as a violation of his country's sovereignty.
"Venezuela is historically very zealous about everything occurring on these two islands," the country's Foreign Minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, said in an interview, "because we consider that it affects our national security."
He said that "we cannot accept that planes leave from these bases," and that he "absolutely ruled out" any possibility that Venezuela would change its position.
Mr. Rangel said the Chavez Government had cooperated with the United States in other areas of the war against drugs, including the installation of three radar centers near Colombia or on drug routes and has "captured more drugs in five months than were seized all of last year."
He also argued that Venezuela had the drug interdiction situation well under control and thus did not need outside interference.
"We have complied with our responsibilities without any need for bases in Curacao and Aruba or overflights that we do not consider to be suitable," he said.
But General McCaffrey said that since the closing of Howard, "there have been seven criminal penetrations of Venezuelan airspace that have had unsuccessful endgames because there is no endgame in Venezuela."
Some key members of the United States Congress are growing impatient with the Venezuelan stance. They warn that if Mr. Chavez's position does not change soon, the United States may retaliate by refusing to certify that Venezuela is collaborating fully in the drug war, a step that would deprive it of trade and other benefits.
"If Venezuela isn't cooperative, and the amount of trafficking increases as a result of that, then it would certainly affect the certification process," said Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
"Right now we are hard pressed in our efforts, and until we are able to establish some alternative facilities, which is going to take quite a while, we will continue to have a major strategic gap," Mr. Gilman said.
But the Clinton Administration is eager to avoid such a confrontation. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East and in recent years has become the United States' principal source of imported oil.
Despite the public rebuffs they have received, American officials remain hopeful that Mr. Chavez can be persuaded to change his mind. Even before General McCaffrey's visit, State Department and other delegations sought to lay out the American case to him, pointing out that drug traffickers were regularly violating the sovereignty he says he holds dear.
"President Chavez has been so focused on politics and the economic situation that he frankly hasn't spent a lot of time up to now on drug stuff," said an American official who monitors the issue. "Our goal is to help him and his administration get oriented as to how we see the drug threat regionally and how it affects Venezuela specifically, and use that as a basis to move forward on cooperation."

HEADLINE: Teamsters Push To End Decade Of Supervision

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Ten years after Federal officials gained a strict supervisory role over the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in an effort to rid it of mob control, the union's new leadership is pushing hard to get the Government out.
The teamster president, James P. Hoffa, who took office in March, has made ending Federal supervision his chief goal, insisting that the giant union can run its own affairs now that the Mafia's hold on it has been broken. 
 Mr. Hoffa says that the supervision, unprecedented in its scope and duration, is too meddlesome and expensive. For all the millions that the mob has bled from the union, many teamsters complain about the $82 million the union has had to pay for the decadelong Federal effort.
"The teamsters' union is as free of corruption as any great institution," Mr. Hoffa said.
And with Mr. Hoffa saying the teamsters will no longer reflexively endorse Democrats, as it did under his predecessor, Ron Carey, some union officials say he may ask Presidential candidates to support an end to supervision as the price of endorsement by the 1.4-million-member union.
Government officials acknowledge that the teamsters has been substantially cleaned up but are uneasy about withdrawing, saying pockets of corruption remain in the powerful union, which was long infamous for shakedowns, intimidation, payoffs and looted pension funds.
These officials say it would be unwise to cut short the supervision -- the most ambitious Government effort to clean up a single union -- which they say has largely succeeded by obtaining the expulsions or resignations of more than 250 teamster officials accused of corruption.
"The cleanup has done a tremendous amount of good, but it would be a mistake to say the union is corruption-free, mob-free," said Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan and the Federal official in charge of the supervision. "You don't want to say prematurely, 'It's fixed.' You don't want to backtrack."
The teamsters were forced to accept Federal oversight in 1989, to settle a racketeering lawsuit. The agreement set no time limit on the supervision and established the first rank-and-file elections for the teamsters presidency to give members the power to vote out corrupt leaders. While teamster officials kept the powers to negotiate contracts and handle most union matters, major anti-corruption work was given to Federally appointed monitors.
The oversight has included a Government-appointed investigations officer, with a staff of a dozen investigators; a three-person review board to adjudicate corruption cases, and a Government-appointed elections monitor.
The agreement has an understanding that the Federal Government would end its supervision when it was satisfied that the union was clean and would aggressively move against any hints of corruption.
Mr. Hoffa has vowed to keep organized crime out of the union, long considered the nation's most mob-dominated, saying the Mafia was responsible for the disappearance of his father, the teamster leader James R. Hoffa, in 1975. The elder Hoffa, who led the union from 1957 to 1971 and went to prison for jury tampering, disappeared after promising to end mob control as he campaigned to regain the union's presidency.
But many critics of the younger Hoffa assert that he has ties to a corrupt old guard, and they question his motives for wanting to end Federal oversight.
Interviews with prosecutors and teamster leaders indicate that Federal supervision has accomplished something that 40 previous years of investigations and prosecutions had failed to accomplish -- it has rid the teamsters of mob control.
For years, the Mafia handpicked the union's president and the heads of many locals, and strong-armed the union into lending mobsters hundreds of millions of dollars from its pension funds. Federal prosecutors said the Mafia even controlled the elder Hoffa for several years.
"The union has come an enormous way since the 1980's," said Michael Cherkasky, the Federal elections monitor. "The union is not controlled by the mob anymore. At local after local where there was pervasive corruption and complete control by organized crime, you see a sea change."
But law-enforcement officials say the cleanup is far from over. Some mob influence remains, and in a union with 600 locals, including truck drivers, warehouse workers, security guards and flight attendants, an unsettling number of officials continue to steal union money or commit other crimes, though on a far smaller scale than in decades past.
Federal officials point to stubborn problems like Local 714 in Chicago, which represents movie-truck drivers and trade show workers. A Federal oversight board ordered it into trusteeship in 1996 after finding the local's leaders guilty of nepotism and doing business with movie-truck companies owned by relatives.
The local's principal officer, William T. Hogan Jr., Chicago's most powerful teamster, was disgraced into leaving the union and dropping his campaign for secretary-treasurer on the Hoffa slate.
But many members complain that a corrupt old guard is back because last year Mr. Hogan's son, Robert, won the local's top post, and he appointed his father as Local 714's organizing director and his uncle as executive director.
At the same time, there have been shining examples of cleansed locals. For decades, Local 560 in New Jersey was a piggy bank for the mob and was considered the nation's single-most-corrupt union local. It was run by Anthony Provenzano, a captain in the Genovese family, who was sentenced to life in prison for murdering a popular union rival and who, prosecutors say, had another teamster murdered for rubbing him the wrong way at a meeting.
But after a trusteeship purged the local of more than a dozen mob associates, members attending the local's recent monthly meeting did not hesitate to criticize or joke with Local 560's popular new president, Pete Brown, whom Federal monitors have vetted as clean.
The Federal oversight has been unprecedented in its size and invasiveness.
Under agreements with the Government, other unions have had anti-corruption monitors, including the Laborers International Union of North America, which many labor-relations experts consider the most corrupt in the country today. But those unions, in effect, were allowed to handle their cleanups.
The $82 million the teamsters have had to pay for oversight has included $17 million for the three-person review board, the investigation officer and their staff, and $38 million for Federal monitors to conduct three nationwide teamster elections.
With the end of mob control, law-enforcement officials say, the teamsters has again become a union dedicated to winning its members better wages and working conditions.
The national economy has also benefited because mob extortion amounted to a criminal tax of several percent on the billions of dollars in freight that teamster truck drivers hauled around the country. Already, in New York City, the authorities estimate that ending mob domination of the union has saved the construction industry millions of dollars.
Control of the teamsters was so central to the prosperity of many crime families, that breaking their hold has hurt them badly, the authorities say.
To demonstrate that the union can clean its own house, Mr. Hoffa recently appointed a respected former Federal prosecutor from New Jersey, Edwin H. Stier -- the man who cleaned up Local 560 -- to head an in-house, anti-corruption effort.
Mr. Hoffa has also begun talks with the Clinton Administration and several members of Congress with the aim of persuading the Government to end its supervision.
"We have been under Government supervision for 10 years," Mr. Hoffa said. "It's time for a fresh review of this."
Ms. White, the Federal prosecutor, and other Government officials declined to say outright whether supervision should be ended, saying they were still weighing the matter. But several former Federal prosecutors were more emphatic about the need to continue supervision.
"After five decades of organized corruption in a union, corruption does not go away in one year or 10," said Randy Mastro, who as an assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan oversaw the racketeering lawsuit that forced the teamsters to accept supervision after 40 years of failed efforts by the Government to end the Mafia's choke hold.
The lawsuit, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, sought to place the union under Federal supervision as part of a comprehensive strategy to kick corrupt officials out and keep them out. It named 26 Mafia leaders and all 18 of the union's board members as defendants, accusing the board of failing to fight corruption and the mob bosses of controlling four teamster presidents, including Jimmy Hoffa.
Fearing years of litigation and millions in legal fees, teamster leaders agreed to the most far-reaching Federal supervision of any national union.
In the decade since, the investigations officer, Charles M. Carberry, a former Federal prosecutor, has charged two dozen teamsters with being members of organized crime, including the heads of two large Chicago locals and the president of New York City's teamster council. He has also charged 60 teamsters with associating with mobsters and 150 more with financial wrongdoing.
Mr. Carberry said mob control is gone but that mob influence remains in some locals along with plenty of garden-variety graft. "You won't see a capo of the Gambino family as secretary-treasurer of a local anymore," he said. "But one may anticipate they will try to maintain whatever influence they still can, although more subtly than in the past."
Both sides in the debate over ending supervision can find ample evidence within the sprawling union to support their view.
Those who want supervision ended can point to successful cleanups like that at Local 282 on Long Island, which Carlo Gambino, once New York's boss of crime bosses, had turned into family property.
The local's 3,000 members deliver concrete to New York's construction industry, and the Gambino family recognized that if it controlled Local 282 and its deliveries, it could easily extort money from builders by threatening delays.
In 1982, Federal prosecutors gained an extortion conviction of the local's president, John Cody, who was so feared by builders that they provided him with chauffeurs and helped build his beach house. His successor, Bobby Sasso, also had the Gambinos' blessing, but he was pressured into resigning in 1992 after the review board charged him with extortion.
When yet another mob associate became president, the Federal cleanup went into high gear. Local 282 was put into trusteeship, Mr. Carberry brought charges that resulted in the removal of 22 local officials, and one of the local's trustees, Milton Mollen, stripped 50 local officials of their posts because of mob ties, theft or other wrongdoing. Today, all Local 282 officials must pass an F.B.I. screening.
Years ago local members were too intimidated to talk at union meetings, but nowadays Gary Labarbera, the trustee who runs the local's day-to-day affairs, welcomes rank-and-file input as a way to strengthen the union.
But those who favor continued supervision point to locals still troubled by mob ties. In 1991, Mr. Carberry brought charges against four officers of Local 377 in Youngstown, Ohio: two for extortion and two for engaging in a gun battle. But as recently as February, Mr. Carberry accused one of the local's shop stewards with finding a construction job for a mob enforcer newly released from prison, while the oversight board expelled one of the local's leaders for running a gambling operation for Pittsburgh's mob boss.

Wire Transfers Raise Questions
Many of the estimated six million Mexicans who live and work in the United States send money to relatives in Mexico. But as the wire transfer business has boomed, more customers have complained about the costs.

Russia Takes Tough Line Against Islamic Militants
The new Prime Minister, Vladimir V. Putin, threatened to launch air strikes against Islamic militants in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, a move that risked widening the week-old conflict in the neighboring region of Dagestan, where Islamic insurgents are also active. If Russia does attack, Chechen forces are ready to make "Russian helicopters drop from the sky like rain," a local official warned. A1
 
Israel Rewrites Its History
The new school year will bring a quiet revolution in the teaching of Israel's history to most pupils there. New, approved textbooks make plain that many Israeli beliefs are as much myth as fact. The arrival of the textbooks mirrors the growing acceptance of some new views of history. But controversy is also likely to ensue when the books' contents become better known. A1 

Latin Cartels Seize Opportunity
The withdrawal of the United States from military bases in Panama, along with Venezuela's refusal to let its airspace be used for American surveillance and pursuit flights, has created a gap in drug-interdiction efforts, and traffickers are exploiting the opportunity, officials said. A4

Hoffa Wants U.S. to End Oversight of Teamsters
The president of the teamsters, James P. Hoffa, has made ending Federal supervision of his union his chief goal.

G.O.P. Set for Straw Poll
The Republican Party holds its nonbinding but nonetheless important Presidential straw poll in Iowa today. Beyond the big-money rivalry between Gov. George W.

Suspect's Mental History
The mental health system in Washington State got an extensive look at Buford O. Furrow Jr. in the months before he admitted to having opened fire on school children in a Jewish community center and killed a postal worker in Los Angeles. Yet despite lengthy evaluations at mental institutions and no shortage of resources, Mr. Furrow was never ordered to remain under long-term state psychiatric care. A1
 
The Glock semiautomatic pistol used to kill a mail carrier after the shooting at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles was sold last year by an unlicensed vendor at a gun show near the Idaho compound of the Aryan Nations, the neo-Nazi group to which Mr. Furrow belonged, according to interviews.

A Career Cut Short and a Continuing Tradition

BYLINE: By Helen A. Harrison

 BODY:

'Light'
 William Floyd Memorial Library, First Street, Greenport. Through Aug. 25. 477-0660.
In 1952, when the German photographer Ingeborg Tallarek arrived in New York, she was immediately struck by the captivating quality of American light. She decided to make her home here and eventually moved to East Marion, where she still lives. Sadly, her career was derailed after all her cameras and darkroom equipment were stolen in the mid-1970's. Nevertheless, many of the images she created establish her as a notable member of the small sisterhood of early freelance photographers that includes Margaret Bourke-White, Berenice Abbott and Dorothea Lange. 
 But unlike those women, whose achievements have been honored in solo exhibitions, Ms. Tallarek has never before had a one-woman show. Although some of her pictures have been widely reproduced, there is no publication devoted to her work. This is the first opportunity to see a sizable group of her prints, including portraits, photojournalism and North Fork landscapes, and it should not be missed.
Ms. Tallarek's assignments led her to a diverse range of subjects, from political heavyweights, artists and movie stars to anonymous firefighters and children living in poverty. One of her best-known images shows two unidentified Hasidim in Central Park. Although their backs are to the camera, one can imagine their fascinated expressions as they study a skywriter's tick-tack-toe game. The volunteers battling a blaze on a Provincetown rooftop are also unnamed, but their heroism is dramatized by the smoke and sparks surrounding them.
Images that capture Marilyn Monroe's candid sensuality, Marlene Dietrich's detached hauteur (juxtaposed with her daughter's shy reserve) and Eleanor Roosevelt's audience with members of the Women's Press Corps stand out as prime examples of the photographer's ability to reveal intimate dimensions of celebrated subjects. Her shot of a fainting Miss America at the 1952 beauty pageant exposes the private tension behind the public performance.
 
'Footfalls '99'
Greenport. Through Sept. 26.
Fourteen artists have created site-specific sculptures for this year's group of outdoor installations in and around the village. Many respond to the area's maritime heritage, while some relate to issues of communal space and civic responsibility.
The facade of the library, where Ingeborg Tallerek's photographs are on view inside, serves as a forum for Poppy Johnson's Keatsian equation, "Beauty Is Truth." Bold banners proclaim the equivalence, rendered in pointillistic painted letters that strike a note of subjectivity to counter the statement's authority. An even more authoritative document, the United States Constitution, provides the text for Gary Rieveschl's "We the People," a sculpture of privet hedges that vitalizes words to symbolize the living nature of participatory democracy.
The port and its history inspired Andre Kreft to memorialize the slaves who came to the area by sea and whose gravestones are often blank. His grid of 20 boulders, extending from the beach into the water, is revealed as the tide recedes, poignantly indicating the slaves' marginal status and reminding viewers of their tragic journey from distant shores.
Mel Pekarsky's "Ghosts" is a different kind of memorial, one that pictures a solitary bush in a barren twilight landscape. Its sparseness stands in sharp contrast to the bustle and clutter of the nearby ferry dock and restaurant, highlighting human intrusiveness on nature's fragility.
"Tourist Trap," a wood construction by Bennett Blackburn, is a more lighthearted commentary on human intrusion. Resembling an oversize lobster trap, the enclosure has lawn chairs for the comfort of those it snares. Louise O'Regan Clark's imposing compasslike structure alludes to navigation as the guiding principle of maritime life. Like the skeleton of an old-fashioned three-dimensional trade sign, Ed Smith's "Lure" pays nostalgic tribute to the artist's memories of fishing in childhood, when the catch was plentiful and life seemed less complicated.
 
'The Search For the Pictorial'
Oysterponds Historical Society, Village Lane, Orient. Through Sept. 26. 323-2480.
Subtitled "The Life and Art of William Steeple Davis," the exhibition traces the career of a self-taught painter, printmaker and photographer whose memorial trust supports residencies at the Davis home and studio on King Street. Last year's resident scholar, Kimberly Rhodes, catalogued his work and organized the show, which is to travel to the Museums at Stony Brook next year.
Born in Orient in 1884, Davis spent most of his life in his native village. His family encouraged his artistic aspirations, but he never received formal training. His 1909 self-portrait shows a serious, rather shy young man studying his own reflection. Its color scheme and composition indicate familiarity with Whistler's work, which he apparently knew from reproductions. His primary inspiration, however, was the surrounding landscape and seascape, and he regularly sent paintings of those subjects to exhibitions in New York City and elsewhere. He also worked as a commercial illustrator, making paintings for reproduction on calendars, book and magazine covers, and post cards.
Although Davis received modest financial reward and recognition for his paintings, they are not his most notable achievement. His oil technique is uneven, and his larger canvases are often contrived and sentimental. His sketches and pastels, on the other hand, are fresh and lively, and he had a particular talent for printmaking. Subjects that he overworked in oil are treated with sensitive economy in etchings like "Racing Along," a study of competing yachts, and block prints like "In Tumult," showing surf pounding against a massive rock.
But Davis' most significant work was in photography. He began photographing seriously as a teen-ager, wrote prolifically on the subject and invented a developing machine that he patented and marketed. The show includes a fine selection of his prints, illustrating an esthetic rich in tonal nuance and allied with the Pictorial ist movement championed by Alfred Stieglitz and his contemporaries. Whatever his shortcomings as a painter, Davis deserves recognition for this all-but-forgotten body of work, as well as for the William Steeple Davis Trust, a legacy that allows succeeding generations of artists to live and work in his former home and find creative stimulation in the surroundings he loved.

Tax Liens Can Enrich Investors

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
ANYONE who has seriously contemplated making money in real estate has probably encountered the arcane but potentially profitable practice of investing in tax liens at public sales -- the legal process through which municipalities obtain payment of delinquent property taxes.
Real estate experts say it is possible to make a secure investment with a high rate of return in property tax liens, even for unsophisticated investors. And savvier, more careful and more knowledgeable investors can even obtain title to real estate for a small fraction of its market value by buying property at a tax foreclosure sale, the experts say. 
 "Tax liens can be a great investment," said Saul M. Simon, a certified financial planner for Allmerica Investments in Edison, N.J., "as long as you know what you're doing."
Mr. Simon said that investors must normally seek out these sales independently. Tax lien investments are generally not marketed like securities by brokerage houses. The investors must be aware that states have different procedures for handling properties on which the owner has failed to pay property taxes. In New Jersey, for example, municipalities are allowed to "sell" their tax liens -- or their right to foreclose on a property when the owner has failed to pay taxes -- at public auction. Mr. Simon said he has realized a 16 percent rate of return on tax lien certificates he has purchased in these sales.
So what is a municipal tax lien certificate?
"It's a memorialization of a town's lien for unpaid taxes on a property," said Hugh McGuire, a Jersey City real estate lawyer. When a property owner in New Jersey fails to pay local property taxes, he said, the municipality acquires an automatic lien against the property. That lien gives the municipality the right to force the sale of the property to raise the money necessary to pay the overdue taxes.
Usually, however, instead of foreclosing, most municipalities take advantage of a provision in state law that allows the tax collector to sell the municipality's lien in exchange for the payment of overdue taxes, Mr. McGuire said. To make it worthwhile for investors to buy those liens, the law also allows the buyer to collect interest on the amount he paid when he redeems the lien.
Mr. McGuire said that the interest rate that applies to a particular lien is determined at the time the lien is sold by the municipality. The maximum interest rate permitted by New Jersey law -- and the rate offered at the time of sale -- is 18 percent. Accordingly, when a tax collector holds a tax lien sale, investors will "bid" for liens on particular properties, Mr. McGuire said. Since the municipality is interested in obtaining payment of all of the unpaid taxes, however, all bidders must bid the entire amount of unpaid taxes. The successful bidder is the one who is willing to accept the lowest interest rate.
So, for example, if only one bidder is present, he will obtain the highest interest rate permitted by state law -- 18 percent. If a rival bidder is present, however, he may "bid down" to 17 percent, meaning that he is willing to pay the overdue taxes in exchange for a 17 percent rate of return.
"Most people purchase tax lien certificates with the hope that at some point in time, someone will come forward" and reimburse the investor for his outlay, paying any interest charges that have accrued, Mr. McGuire said. That is what happens in most cases, he added.
For example, if the original owner tries to sell the property, the buyer will require that all back taxes and tax liens -- as well as interest due any lienholders -- be paid in full. And when it appears that the lien might not be satisfied, either because the owner cannot be located or cannot or will not sell the property, the law gives the lienholder the right to foreclose after holding the lien for at least two years, Mr. McGuire explained.
"If your ultimate intention is to foreclose," Mr. McGuire said, "it is usually wise to continue paying taxes for the two-year period to prevent someone else from picking up a subsequent year's lien." Generally speaking, he said, it makes sense for investors to pay taxes that accrue during the waiting period because when they redeem a lien, they are allowed to collect interest on any additional taxes paid at the same rate established at the tax sale.
In Connecticut, similar procedures are used, but in New York State, the procedures for handling tax-delinquent property depend upon where it is located.
Eric Davis, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said New York City sells tax liens similar to the liens sold in New Jersey. However, he said, in recent years the city has adopted procedures for the sale of such liens that have resulted in the liens being sold "in bulk" to large institutional investors.
In other areas of the state, Mr. Davis said, individuals can invest in tax-delinquent properties, but the procedure is somewhat riskier than the city's.
Outside New York City, a county tax collector is allowed to hold a tax sale for any property that has accrued three years' back taxes, Mr. Davis said. Before holding such a sale the tax collector must notify the property owner of the time and date of the sale and the amount of taxes that are due. If the taxes have not been paid by the date of the sale, the tax collector has the right to sell the property to the highest bidder. But buying property from a tax collector is not the same as buying it from the owner.
"What you get from the county is what is known as a quitclaim deed," Mr. Davis said. Such a deed transfers to the successful bidder all of the county's rights to the property.
And while the county's tax lien takes precedence over all other liens except Federal claims, a quitclaim deed from the county tax collector may not always be the safest investment.
"If the county didn't provide proper notice of the tax sale, the sale could be subject to challenge," Mr. Davis said. For example, he said, if the county notifies the property owner at the address on the deed, but the property owner had properly notified the county of a change of address, the sale could be defective.
Moreover, Mr. Davis said, properties sold at tax sale can be occupied by tenants, squatters or even the property owner himself -- a complication that could require lengthy legal proceedings to rectify.
Accordingly, Mr. Davis said, investors considering purchasing New York State property at a tax sale should inspect it before the sale. It is also wise to conduct a title search to determine the chain of title and to find out whether the person the tax collector has identified as the owner is the current owner of record, he said.
"This is not something you would want to just jump into," said Mr. Davis, who has purchased about 120 acres of upstate property at tax sales. "The risks can be significant. But that's not to say you can't get lucky."

HEADLINE: Parrish Plans Growth Without the Pains

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS BRAFF

 BODY:
COMBINING a need to modernize with an opportunity to expand, the Parrish Art Museum is embarking on a revitalization plan that is likely to bring a needed infusion of energy and sparkle to Southampton's commercial area.
On Aug. 7, the museum's 25 trustees unanimously voted to accept the recommendations of its architectural planning committee for restoration and improvement made possible by the acquisition of the Rogers Memorial Library building next door at Job's Lane and Main Street. Now, the staff will prepare a master plan for governmental and community review this fall. Work is expected to begin in September 2001, with completion in early 2003. 
 Long aware of the need to bring its 1897 facility up to current museum standards, the Parrish was waiting for the library building to become available for purchase. (A new library is under construction one block west, on Windmill Lane.)
"The decision to delay any modernization and wait for the adjacent structure, which also dates from the late 19th century, opened up a whole new way of thinking about the village and about the museum," said Trudy Kramer, the Parrish's executive director. "We now had a chance to gain needed space while also preserving two historic buildings. We could provide a hub with a cultural facility that is true to Southampton's period character. Long Island villages are changing quickly."
The museum project is very appealing to local businesses. "We see the Parrish's success as helping the local economy to be more of a year-round success," said Wayne Swiatocha, a past president of the Southampton Chamber of Commerce.
The space revisions will accommodate larger exhibitions and larger paintings; additional galleries, allowing popular works to go on permanent view; climate-controlled storage for the collection; an orientation area; a reading room; a lecture hall; offices; classrooms, and visitor amenities like a tearoom and an expanded museum shop.
An architect with considerable experience in museum projects, Chad Floyd of Centerbrook Architects and Planners in Essex, Conn., is preparing the design. Mr. Floyd's previous commissions have included the Hood Museum at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., and the Norton Museum in West Palm Beach, Fla.
"I'm interested in making the character of the existing museum really sing," Mr. Floyd said.
He said he was developing plans that would retain the integrity of the original museum building but permit the installation of updated technical systems. He plans to change only post-19th-century treatments he regards as inappropriate. "Everything we do will have a friendly relationship to the historic building in terms of textures and colors," he added.
No changes are planned for the exterior of the red-brick Queen Anne-style library building, although classrooms, a lecture hall and offices are to be created inside.
Ms. Kramer expressed confidence that the overall new concept and the way the redesigned space is programmed would give the Parrish the potential to be a noteworthy destination. "Our ability to tell the story of art on eastern Long Island will be an attraction, and one that will be enhanced by visitor orientation materials," she said.
Alicia Longwell, the museum's curator, added: "With the collection on permanent view, people will arrange visits knowing that the paintings they dearly want to see are available."
Late last month, the museum announced the establishment of the Otto Endowment Fund for the Study of the Art of Eastern Long Island. Werner and Maren Otto, part-time residents of Southampton, have given $750,000 to support research, study and interpretation of the art and artists of the region.
The museum owns works by many well-known 19th- and 20th-century artists associated with the area: Thomas Moran, Childe Hassam, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Larry Rivers, Alfonso Ossorio, Malcolm Morley, Lynda Benglis, James Brooks, Esteban Vicente, John Ferren, Ibram Lassaw, Jane Freilicher, Chuck Close, Roy Lichtenstein, Dorothea Rockburne and Jane Wilson.
But the collection also has a broad range. When the Parrish organizes the new space to tell the story of American art in general, it will be able to draw from its 19th-century portraits, genre and landscape paintings, including pieces by William Sidney Mount, Albert Pinkham Ryder, John Twachtman, Thomas Doughty, James McNeill Whistler and Martin Johnson Heade. Galleries for 20th-century art are likely to use pieces by Charles Burchfield, Robert Henri, John Marin, Reginald Marsh, Eli Nadelman, Agnes Martin, Phillip Guston and Alex Katz.
Other Parrish resources that generate widespread interest and demand for gallery space include the extensive holdings of works by William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) and Fairfield Porter (1907-1975). These large collections of major paintings are supplemented by related archival and reference materials that make the museum the primary study center for both artists.
On the exterior, Douglas Reed, a landscape architect based in Cambridge, Mass., is doing the research and planning on how the surrounding three-acre park setting and its re design will serve the community. "I asked for a close collaboration with the landscape architects from the initial phases because the role of the park is such a positive force in this museum scheme," Mr. Floyd said.
Mr. Reed sees special meaning in the way the project merges the functions of campus and park with historic sites and the roles of public and private institutions. "It's a wonderful opportunity for an important civic place," he said.
"The museum's interest in reaching out to the public in new ways is driving the site development design. The idea is to create a cohesive character along Job's Lane with walks and terraces that allow the entire length to function as an entrance, bringing the public into the buildings and surrounding areas.
"We want to make the arboretum and park accessible from Job's Lane and to go further by creating a center for pedestrian circulation, increasing the hub character and tying-in, too, with Southampton's master plan for an independent system of pedestrian walks." That system is currently under review by the village planning board. "The Parrish is regarded as a major centerpiece for the village," said Charles Coulter, a planning board member.
The arboretum was laid out in 1897 by another Boston-area landscape architect, Warren H. Manning, using many rare specimen trees, and it was regarded by Samuel Longstreth Parrish as an important part of his gift to Southampton. Saving the original arboretum, which the planners are now calling the historical arboretum, is a significant aspect of the project.
A summer resident during his boyhood and in the years he practiced law in New York City, Parrish moved here permanently after retiring and became active in village endeavors. An admirer of classical Italian art, Parrish also commissioned copies of 18 marble busts of the Roman Caesars for his museum. Long a familiar part of the garden, the busts are to be retained in the renovation.
In addition to developing a fuller agenda of lectures, workshops and classes in the expanded space, the museum plans to treat the original arboretum as a teaching resource.
The museum staff considers Parrish's spirit of edification and enlightenment to be the foundation of a strong education mandate. "We've never had the physical space to carry out our teaching role as completely as we wished, but we are now in a position to fulfill our mission," Ms. Kramer said. "In all its endeavors, the museum should give visitors a memory to carry away, and we want to do that."

The New Goal at Retail Power Centers: Eye Appeal

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
IN response to New Jersey's strong retail market, big-box retailers continue to expand in the state and developers put up shopping centers to house them. But now a small but growing number of towns are requiring -- and at least one county is aggressively advocating -- that the centers have a more appealing design, signaling a departure from the gray cracker box strips of the past.
An example is the combined Nassau Park and Nassau Park Pavilion on Route 1 and Quakerbridge Road in West Windsor, which at 1.1 million square feet is the largest "power center" in the state. Following a design ordinance by the township, the center, nearing completion on its final phase, has distinctive exterior architectural touches and extensive landscaping and walkways. When completed in March, it will also have amenities from a promenade and plazas to fountains and an ice skating rink. 
 The project is a power center as defined by the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan: an open-air retail strip with 250,000 square feet of space or more and three or more large specialty or big-box stores. It will have six big-box retailers, including a 135,000-square-foot Wal-Mart; a 127,000-square-foot Target, and a 115,000-square-foot Wegman's supermarket, as well as 17 other stores with 9,000 to 59,000 square feet each.
More than half the stores are completed and occupied and the rest, already leased, will open by year's end, said J. Charles Hendon Jr, president of Hendon Properties of Atlanta, the developer. "We followed the township's demands and in retrospect the project is better for it," he said.
The trend extends to smaller strip centers, including one proposed on King George Road in Bernards Township in Somerset County. The township hired an architect to design the center and, as part of rezoning the 20-acre site from residential use, adopted an ordinance requiring the developer to build the project following its design.
"If we didn't do this we knew we would get the quickest and easiest retail strip," said Peter Messina, the township engineer and planner. The project will have six colonial- and Victorian-style buildings, totaling 95,000 square feet, that will frame a central green and feature a clock tower and antique street lamps.
"There will be more cost up front, but the project will draw higher-end tenants who typically do not go into strip centers," said Scott Loventhal, a vice president at Garden Commercial Properties, of Short Hills, the developer. Construction will start next year.
Last fall, Somerset County responded to the spate of projects, particularly power centers, under way or planned in the county by developing guidelines that municipalities can follow and a model ordinance they can adopt to incorporate design elements into projects of 40,000 square feet or more. They include at least four power centers, totaling almost three million square feet.
Robert Bzik, the county's planning director, said the guidelines called for, among other things, projects designed with materials, colors and roof lines compatible with those in the adjacent neighborhoods. They also require increased landscaping and community spaces, like seating areas.
"The aim is to increase the quality and appearance of projects so they reflect their surroundings," he said, adding that the Bernards center embodied that concept. Though the guidelines have not yet been used fully in the large projects, Mr. Bzik said a few have utilized certain aspects, like adding architectural variety and upgraded materials.
Power centers and shopping strips are the dominant form of retail being built today, data from the shopping center council show, although the rate of growth of power centers nationally has slowed. There were 54 power centers built last year, down from 81 in 1997, according to the National Research Bureau, a publisher of shopping center trends based in Chicago.
Ted Kraus, who heads TKO Real Estate Advisory Group in Mercerville, said big-box retailers continue to drive the market in New Jersey, which with a vacancy rate of less than 3 percent is strong. The look of a center can help distinguish it from the competition, but it will not make an unsuccessful center a success, Mr. Kraus said.
"The rub is the cost," said Bill Farber, chief executive of Levin Management in North Plainfield, which develops, owns and manages shopping centers. Smart developers will not fight a better design, he said, but "mandating it is the extreme and happens only in towns where the economics are strong enough to make the project viable."
That is the case for the West Windsor center, which sits on 162 acres once zoned for offices. It is the first project in New Jersey for Hendon Properties, which bought the initial 62-acre component in 1994 from Wal-Mart, which was working with a developer who did not proceed.
The company, using bond financing from Wall Street, began that component with a rezoning in place and secured leases from three tenants -- Wal-Mart, Sam's Wholesale Club and Home Depot -- totaling 380,000 square feet. By 1996, it began adding 220,000 more square feet in eight stores, Mr. Hendon said. In 1997, Hendon brought in Developers Diversified Realty of Cleveland, a real estate investment trust, as an equity partner. It then bought 100 adjacent acres, which after two years of legal wrangling was rezoned to build Nassau Park Pavilion, expanding the complex by 450,000 square feet to its current size.
MR. HENDON said that Target, Wegman's and an 86,000-square-foot Kohl's store would anchor Nassau Park Pavilion, which is rising on 40 acres. The remaining 60 acres will be open.
The project is the only power center in West Windsor and there are no other large sites zoned or expected to be rezoned for retail, said Sam Surtees, its director of community development. So "we wanted it to be aesthetically pleasing and have amenities" to invite in the public, he said.
The township's ordinance, which was even more entensive for the project's third phase, specifies the colors and textures of the material to be used. All the buildings have a colored masonry base and their facades are accented with horizontal bands, with those of the larger stores also featuring canopies and synthetic stucco finishes. Designed by Pieper O'Brien Herr Architects of Atlanta the centers also feature metal trusses and brick and steel towers.
The focal point of the amenities, now under way, will be the pedestrian plaza, winter-garden and ice skating rink complex. The plaza, set next to the Wintergarden -- a glass enclosed structure that may house a restaurant -- will access the rink, which will double as an amphitheater during the summer. There will also be a gazebo, which will serve as a sitting area, overlooking a pond, green areas and the historic Delaware & Raritan Canal beyond. The Hillier Group of Princeton is the project's planner and landscape architect.
Mr. Hendon said that the required design and amenities added $14.5 million to the project's cost, to $120 million. "We had to compensate for that cost in the rents," he said, noting that they were raised by $2 to $5, to $16 to $30 a square foot. But, he said, tenants were willing to pay and be flexible in their typical store designs because of the center's location and the area's demographics.
The site is close to the Quakerbridge and Mercer Malls in nearby Lawrence Township, creating what Mr. Hendon described as a "retail node" in that part of central New Jersey. And, he added, 397,555 people with an average annual household income of $67,360 live within 10 miles of the site.
"We would never do the project this way if all those factors were not in place," Mr. Hendon said. In the five-year development process, he added, "we were lucky the retail market remained strong and no other sites outside of West Windsor opened up."
"Having a more attractive center," he said, "is good for the community and good for us because it brings in more people."

HEADLINE: No Small Potatoes;
Agriculture Is Booming in Suffolk, as Farmers Move Beyond Spuds Into High-Tech Methods and Upscale Crops

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
WITH hundreds of acres of farmland growing a final crop of houses each year, agriculture on Long Island's East End remains under assault by land development that continues to consume some of the finest soil in North America.
But as open spaces and traditional farms in the Island's last truly rural region come ever more under siege, a surprising economic evolution has taken place. 
 Far from being on the ropes, a new and vastly different agricultural industry centered in the East End towns of Riverhead, Southold, Southampton and East Hampton is prospering, and Suffolk County is maintaining and even strengthening its hold on first place in New York in the market value of its agricultural products.
Traditional farmers who grow potatoes and other field crops continue to struggle, but operators of greenhouses, nurseries, vineyards and, to a more limited degree, sod farms have taken up the slack.
According to United States Department of Agriculture figures based on a 1997 agricultural census, the market value of Suffolk products from greenhouses and nurseries, combined with sod and such specialty items as Christmas trees and mushrooms, accounted for $125,975,000 of the $167,858,000 Suffolk agricultural total, which in turn was a 25 percent increase over the total in 1992, the year of the previous survey.
The increases came over the same years when the roaring regional economy raised development pressures to new heights and peppered farm areas with new housing. But the 1997 agricultural census, which profiles agriculture in every county in the nation, showed that the amount of land in Suffolk being farmed actually increased by 1.4 percent during that period between 1992 and 1997, or from 35,353 to 35,858 acres.
The figures do not reveal how much of these lands farmers are renting from developer-owners, a years-old pattern particularly common among traditional farmers.
And to be sure, in a county where farmers grew potatoes on more than 50,000 acres four decades ago, the remaining farm acreage in use is not great. The No. 2 agricultural county in New York, Wyoming County, has nearly 200,000 farm acres and the Suffolk total was among the lowest in the state. And only about 6 percent of Suffolk's total acreage is used for farming.
But it is this ability to do more with fewer acres that characterizes the new era of agriculture in Suffolk County, where capital-intensive greenhouse operations cover 214 acres and produce many times the profit a potato farm on the same acreage would earn even in the most favorable market.
"The agricultural economy has reinvented itself," said Stephen M. Jones, the county Planning Director. "It is no longer potato-based, it is based on high-value crops."
While Suffolk still remains first in the state for potato production, and while its high-quality vinifera grapes account for just 6 percent of the grapes grown in the state, it is the high-value crops that have made the difference, Mr. Jones and others said.
In addition to grapes, the list of high-value crops includes a wide range of plants, flowers, ornamentals and young trees as well half the sod grown in the state.
Some traditional farmers have found niches such as varieties of lettuce or other field crops that are custom-grown for special markets. Others grow fruits, corn and other produce for their own or neighbors' farm stands, bypassing wholesale markets to sell directly to customers.
"It is remarkable how resilient this industry has been," said Joseph M. Gergela, the Long Island Farm Bureau's executive director. "It continues to evolve, and now you have people looking to buy farmland because it is disappearing. There's still a chance for us to hold on here."
Suffolk farmers are praised by the state. "They are masters of agriculture," said Pete Gregg, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. "It's just a fabulous area for agriculture.
"There is a lot of direct marketing of agricultural products and a tremendous amount of agritourism, and that definitely helps revenues. The vineyards are doing great, and of course the greenhouses and nurseries are just booming. I would say Suffolk is pulling further ahead."
One measure of the county's intense, high-value agriculture is a market value for products in 1997 of $4,681 an acre, a figure no other county in the state approached. The state average was $390.73 an acre.
While the $167,858,000 market value of all Suffolk products sold is small compared with values in counties in prime farming regions elsewhere in the country, the per-acre value is still impressive. In Fresno County, Calif., the No. 1 agricultural county in the country's No. 1 agricultural state, market value for products was nearly $2.8 billion in 1997. But the value per acre was $1,474, or less than a third of Suffolk's.
The numbers mask the strains felt by traditional farmers, whose fields of crops, far more than rows of young trees or greenhouse complexes, fit the public notion of what farms should be.
Severely tried by economic hardships and tempted by rising land prices that make selling to developers inviting, farmers' ranks have dwindled to about 400 full-time farms and about 600 farms in total averaging 60 acres, according to the 1997 agriculture census, which was released in February by the United States Department of Agriculture.
But the tenacious traditional farmers who remain, including some whose families have farmed the North Fork for more than 300 years, have relied on a variety of strategies and crops plus dogged hard work.
Their operations have also taken a toll. A monitoring program to detect pesticides in groundwater, performed by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, contained alarming results. The report, released in June, showed far more pervasive contamination of groundwater in farm areas, particularly on the North Fork, than officials had anticipated. Some of the contaminants were traced to pesticides that were banned 10 or more years ago.
The findings highlighted the chemical-intensive nature of Suffolk agriculture, particularly among traditional farmers, and raised questions about the health impacts on residents of farm areas whose wells for drinking water contained contaminants in excess of safety standards.
While East End farmers have relied heavily on pesticides, fungicides and herbicides, they have had natural advantages, including highly productive soil and the easy availability of groundwater for irrigation.
In the current drought, a disaster for farmers in many areas, farmers and greenhouse and nursery operators have fared well.
"One thing about irrigation, it's expensive and labor-intensive, but we can always put the water where we want it, when we want, and only as much as we want," said Philip A. Schmitt, who specializes in growing lettuce and cabbage on a 150-acre farm on Sound Avenue in Riverhead.
"It's not that I'm loving it quite this dry," Mr. Schmitt, a former president of the Long Island Farm Bureau, said before the dry weather was interrupted by drenching rain last week. "It's just that I'd rather have it dry than too much rain."
The drought is also having limited impact on greenhouses and nurseries. Vineyard operators, whose high-quality grapes do best in hot, dry conditions, said the weather was raising hopes of a vintage year.
A troubling downside, industry spokesmen said, is a scarcity of farm labor as higher wages paid by restaurants and landscapers lure away freelance workers, many of whom are illegal immigrants.
The abysmal labor camps that once housed migrant laborers, most frequently black men, are now history, and few farm operators make arrangements with the New York State Department of Labor to legally hire and house foreign laborers for specified times. The labor department said only 2 of 235 applications filed statewide for such hiring this year came from Suffolk.
Most operators get by with help from family members, retired farmers or local residents still willing to work long farm hours for minimum wage or little more. Almost universally, the operators work Herculean hours themselves.
"The biggest problem right now is labor," said William J. Sanok, an educator at the Cornell Cooperative Extension in Riverhead. "Any time you have unemployment so low, you don't have a lot of people coming to the farms."
But the agriculture industry has had a degree of public support that may be unequaled anywhere else. Since the advent of a county farmland preservation program in the 1970's, Suffolk has purchased development rights to hundreds of farm acres to assure that the land can be used only for agriculture.
Most of the purchases have been in the North Fork towns of Riverhead and Southold, where Suffolk agriculture is most intensive. Residents in the South Fork towns of Southampton and East Hampton, where land prices are higher, have augmented the county program with local development-rights purchases.
Kevin McDonald, vice president of the Group for the South Fork, a private environmental and planning group in Bridgehampton, said 2,400 acres in Southampton and 800 acres in East Hampton had been preserved under combined programs. He said 3,600 acres in Riverhead and 2,300 acres in Southold had been preserved on the North Fork.
County Executive Robert J. Gaffney, like his predecessors, has pledged support for East End farm preservation. In November, Suffolk voters approved a $60 million open space and parks program strongly backed by Mr. Gaffney that includes $20 million for additional purchases of farm development rights.
Yet as second-home developments continue to overtake farm fields, particularly in Southampton, and as other farmlands lie fallow while their developer-owners pursue building plans, Mr. McDonald and other conservationists see limitations in an agricultural industry that is "getting more and more profit out of less and less land."
Mr. McDonald said farmers must now also come to grips with "the emerging issue of how the pesticide monitoring reports begs the question of how to have Long Island-wide public support for farm preservation."
"We are at a critical juncture," Mr. McDonald said. "We're going to have to get a lot smarter about farming practices, and it's going to require extraordinary creativity and statesmanship among folks in the agricultural industry, public health officials and others. It can't just degenerate into a big finger-pointing exercise."
Mr. McDonald said one problem was a reluctance he found on the part of farms to discuss their use of farm chemicals.
Some farmers say they are too busy to discuss anything. "Look, I've got a lot of work to do, O.K.?" said Todd Wells, a farmer in Riverhead who declined the other day to stop and talk.
Then Mr. Wells drove his tractor into a potato field to spray potato plants within view of a new golf course on a neighbor's land that used to be a farm.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Obstructions to New Rental Projects Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
ON Sept. 14, a referendum will be held in New Canaan. If it succeeds, the voters will have blocked a $5 million appropriation meant to cover the cost of moving the town's public works garage to a landfill area, thus scuttling plans for a fully approved 104-unit apartment complex by Avalon Bay Communities of Alexandria, Va., that is to be constructed on the garage site.
In New Canaan and three other southwestern Connecticut towns -- Darien, Wilton and Orange -- grass-roots opposition to Avalon's luxury rental communities seems to reinforce recent decisions by state courts. 
 Elsewhere in Connecticut, in the towns of Glastonbury, Newtown and Bridgewater, state courts have upheld local planning and zoning commissions' decisions to deny various developers' applications that conformed to Connecticut's affordable-housing law. The applications were rejected primarily because of a shortage of sewers and of potable water.
The law is intended to provide housing for people of moderate means in towns where zoning regulations and land costs preclude almost all housing for lower-income families. On average, well under 3 percent of the housing in Fairfield County's affluent towns qualifies as "affordable housing," a proportion that falls far short of the 10 percent goal that the state has set for all 169 towns statewide.
Under the 1989 law, developers are allowed to build more densely if one-quarter of their projects are priced below market rates, leading many critics of development to believe that developers use the law to benefit themselves, building large, out-of-scale projects.
Such critics contend that densities ranging from 100 to more than 300 units per complex can overwhelm services in towns with small populations accustomed to single-family homes on one-acre lots. But density is the key to making a project economically feasible.
Antipathy toward rental housing -- the only housing that Avalon builds -- and the word "affordable" persists. To many critics, "affordable housing" is an invitation to undesirable transients with no vested interest in the town. The law requires that affordable units remain so for 30 years.
Nonetheless, Avalon has been notably successful at winning court cases and building formulaic but elegant apartment compounds, with swimming pools, gymnasiums, clubhouses and other amenities residents can use without charge.
One of the largest developers of rental apartments in the state, Avalon has built four market-rate complexes in Stamford and two in Danbury, cities in which the amount of low-cost housing exceeds 10 percent of the total. Under the affordable-housing law, Avalon has built one complex each in the upscale towns of Wilton and Trumbull.
Nationwide it has built or owns 137 apartment communities containing 39,739 units in 16 states.
Samuel B. Fuller, regional vice president in the company's Wilton office, said that residents of other states have tended to accept affordable housing without the protracted legal battles that the company has encountered in Connecticut. "Connecticut is by far the worst," he said. "People are much more afraid of any kind of new development."
The dispute between New Canaan and Avalon began more than five years ago, when Avalon's application to build housing and some retail stores on a three-acre downtown parcel next to the railroad station was rejected, revised and rejected again. Avalon sued New Canaan under the affordable-housing law, saying the town had failed to provide compelling reasons for the denials.
Avalon won that case and prevailed on appeal, but after the town approved the project, a citizen-led referendum to condemn the site for use as a commuter parking lot was passed. Rather than fight an injunction obtained by Avalon to halt condemnation, a land swap was negotiated.
Avalon and the town agreed to exchange the Mill Pond public works site for the downtown parcel in 1997. New Canaan got the commuter parking space it wanted downtown, and Avalon got a suitable construction site as well as a 99-year lease-back on a small portion of the downtown site. It expects to build a 15,000-square-foot building there for its Connecticut headquarters and other offices. The town agreed to bear the $5 million cost of moving the public works buildings to the landfill area.
John M. Potts, a Democratic candidate for First Selectman in the coming election and an opponent of development on either site, calls the swap "giving away the store."
IN an agreement made outside the provisions of the affordable-housing law, Avalon agreed to set aside 21 apartments at Mill Pond for town employees, using a state formula in which the area's median income of $94,300 is the basis for computing eligible incomes and rents. The lower rents, deemed "affordable" by the town, would be $1,508 to $2,800 a month for one- to three-bedroom apartments. Market-price rents would range from $1,700 to $3,100 a month.
Save Mill Pond Park, the name of a citizens' group spearheading opposition to the development, "is a misnomer," said John Cannavino of the Stamford law firm of Cummings & Lockwood. He has represented the town during the years of litigation. "The pond and park areas will not be lost," he said, noting that Avalon's plan will not disturb them. The existing garage, salt storage building, unpaved parking area and dump site for construction debris will be replaced by apartments, landscaping and a public nature trail around the pond, he said.
Richard P. Bond, the Republican First Selectman, who is up for re-election in November, said he supported the Avalon project.
"My position is that we should go ahead with the exchange of property," he said. "It is the most beneficial solution for the town. We are not in the hands of the courts to make a decision on condemnation or to establish the price." The cost of moving the garage, he said, would be half that of condemnation.
Avalon cannot set a date to break ground on the property until it changes hands. Mr. Fuller said that if the referendum passed, the swap would be canceled and Avalon would proceed with its original plan to develop the downtown site.
Mr. Potts and many other town residents opposed the town's adoption of a new zoning category, large-lot apartment development, which was suggested by Avalon for the Mill Pond site. The new designation allows the developer to build higher-density apartments. The critics believe that other developers working under the affordable-housing law will apply the designation to any 5-acre lot with 100-foot frontage on a state road where sewers and public water were available.
"Untrue," said Hiram Peck, New Canaan's Town Planner. "The standards limit where the zone can be located -- on a very small portion of state roads that run through town. There are few potential parcels for which it is applicable." His office is revising New Canaan's long-range plan and zoning regulations, including limiting the expansion of sewer and water districts into residential areas to discourage housing developments.
In Darien, a citizens' movement supported by the Board of Selectmen is focused on condemning a site where Avalon plans to build 189 apartments, some affordable, on 32 acres near the railroad station. Avalon obtained an injunction to halt the action until briefs are filed in State Superior Court in Stamford next month.
Darien's lawyer, John Wayne Fox, recently obtained permission from Superior Court to make test borings on Avalon's property for environmental reasons, despite the fact that the town's environmental protection agency had already approved the project.
Jay Sandak, a lawyer for Avalon, objected, saying the town had no right to enter the property until it had determined a public purpose for it, had had it appraised, and had formally stated its intention to condemn. A decision is expected within the next few weeks.
In the town of Orange, voters recently approved a referendum to condemn a 30-acre parcel under contract to Avalon, where 168 units, including 25 percent at affordable rents, had been proposed. An injunction prevents any action until a Superior Court judge in Middletown makes a decision. The court is also considering Orange's rejection of Avalon's application for residential zoning approval at the site. The area is zoned for light industrial and residential development, said Timothy Hollister, another lawyer for Avalon.
Late last month a public hearing at Wilton High School broke into guffaws and catcalls when Avalon officials presented a proposal to build 119 housing units, some at affordable rents. Speakers objected to the location off Route 7, where traffic is heavy, and to the density -- more tightly packed than anything else in town. The hearing is to continue on Sept. 13.
John Scott of Scott Kinney Partners in Westport, a market research and real estate planning firm, spoke at the hearing on behalf of the developer. "After doing this for 25 years, I've concluded that the public doesn't like change in any form," Mr. Scott said in a telephone interview later. "There is a groundswell of anxiety today, which relates to overcrowded schools and stressed services. I find that hearings have become more belligerent. We are seeing elected commissioners who have always been able to put down an unruly audience but now tend to reflect the popular attitude of 'no growth.' "
Undaunted, Avalon continues to expand its presence in Connecticut. In Stamford, the 195-apartment Avalon Corners opened this month, and Greyrock Towers, with 306 units, is scheduled to open in 18 months. A schedule for 306 apartment units to be built on the site of the former Burdick School in Stamford has not yet been determined. In addition, Avalon has applied for permission to build 306 apartments in Newtown.

HEADLINE: Albany Still Digs in Taxpayer Pockets, Spano Says

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
"DON'T be fooled by the state's budget," County Executive Andrew J. Spano is advising Westchester taxpayers, now that Albany has passed its long-awaited spending package for 1999-2000.
Although local school districts and other parts of the economy are seeing windfalls in the budget -- and property owners can expect some reductions in their taxes as a result -- residents must also factor in $40 million in lost state aid to the county government for social services over two years. 
 "Let's face it, what the state did was take the money out of one pocket and put it in another," said Kathleen M. Tooher-Carrano, Westchester's Budget Director. "Eventually, though, it all comes from the same taxpayers."
If not directly in raised taxes then in a reduction of services, Westchester residents will be asked to make up for the lost dollars, county officials said last week.
"Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, this budget is not to be trusted on its surface," said Thomas J. Abinanti, a member of the Board of Legislators' Budget and Appropriations Committee. Mr. Abinanti criticized the state for cloaking what he said was the real intent of the budget: to mandate but not pay for services like welfare and food stamps.
Not everyone, however, was buying the state budget doom scenario for Westchester. "I don't think it's time to say the sky is falling," State Senator Nicholas A. Spano said. With $32 million in aid for Westchester school districts, Mr. Spano, who is not related to the County Executive, called Albany's spending plan, "generally speaking, a very good budget for the taxpayers of Westchester."
Meanwhile, the County Executive ordered department heads immediately to freeze nonessential hiring and spending. Having campaigned in 1997 on a no-tax-increase platform, County Executive Spano said that other types of cutbacks would also have to be enacted in the coming months. He has pledged to reduce the county's property tax levy by 15 percent, or $52 million, over four years.
"All new initiatives are now at risk," he said.
The county has three main sources of revenue, with about 30 percent of its budget coming from state and Federal aid, about 36 percent from parks fees, sales taxes and hotel occupancy taxes and about 34 percent from property taxes.
"The latter," Ms. Tooher-Carrano said, referring to property taxes, "is the last place we like to go."
The state's $73.3 billion spending package for the current fiscal year reduces state aid to all counties and forces them to absorb the entire cost of cutbacks in social welfare programs.
The reductions come seven months into Westchester's 1999 fiscal year, and while they will not directly create deficits in the county's $1 billion budget, they will significantly erode its $17.8 million surplus at year's end. On Wednesday Ms. Tooher-Carrano said the county will use about $14 million of the surplus to "backfill state aid losses." The surplus ordinarily is applied to subsequent budgets.
"This is especially frustrating when the state is sitting on its highest budget surplus in years," Larry S. Schwartz, Mr. Spano's chief adviser, said.
The state's surplus is now nearly $3 billion. Gov. George E. Pataki achieved one of his major goals for the year, an agreement not to spend the $1.8 billion surplus accumulated in the last fiscal year, which will be saved to help the state pay for tax cuts to take effect next year. But Mr. Abinanti said the Governor will be doing that at the expense of Westchester's residents.
This year, state cutbacks to Westchester could force reductions in hiring and spending. Next year, it might mean higher sales taxes, increased fees and decreased hours at county parks, reduced funds for neighborhood health centers and cutbacks in money for the arts, among other things, county officials said.
"Every program will have to be looked at," Mr. Schwartz said. "It's either cutting services or raising taxes."
By contrast, most school districts in the county reveled in the happy news that they would receive more state aid than ever, with the Board of Education in Ossining, for example, announcing that an increase of about $600,000 -- to $5.8 million in the new budget from $5.2 million last year -- will spell 1.5 percent in relief for property owners.
Yonkers also learned that it would be a beneficiary of the state's apparent largesse, with New York's fourth-largest city receiving a record $72 million -- or 31 percent more -- from the state. Last year the city received $54.5 million. Yonkers officials said they have lobbied hard in recent years to even out what they termed past inequities in state aid. The city will be able to continue to phase out at least two taxes on residents (an income tax surcharge and a real estate tax) and to hire 30 new police officers.
By contrast, here on the ninth floor of the County Office Building, where Mr. Spano's office is situated and the Board of Legislators meets, the words "devastating," "shocking" and "unfair" have echoed through the halls since news of the 120-day-late budget accord was delivered on Aug. 4.
To close Westchester budget gaps, Mr. Spano announced, among other things, his intention to jettison his earlier proposal to set aside 25 percent in tobacco settlement funds for antismoking programs. The money is part of a $206 billion settlement between tobacco companies and 46 states that sued to recoup Medicaid costs related to smoking. Over 25 years the county will receive $481 million in tobacco settlement money, the County Budget Director said.
For the 2000 budget, the County Executive said he had hoped to lighten the tax burden for Westchester property owners with an estimated $12 million from the county's share of the settlement of the lawsuits against the tobacco industry. In June, he pledged to use the remaining $4 million from the first year's tobacco payment for antismoking and public health programs. Now, that money may have to go toward paying for mandated programs.
Although the state has indicated that the county should use the tobacco money to offset the cuts, the County Executive disagreed. He has argued that the funds are Westchester's, and it is therefore the county's decision to determine how to use the money. Also, the intent of the settlement was not to backfill state aid cuts, Mrs. Tooher-Carrano said.
There are other budget restrictions being considered, and Ms. Tooher-Carrano predicted that Albany's reductions would have "a long-lasting impact" on Westchester.
In addition to limiting all new hiring, except in public health and public safety, Mr. Spano has ordered freezes on all nonessential travel, equipment orders and contracts of less than $20,000. Moreover, he said no overtime can be allowed without first being approved by the budget office. As of Sept. 1, the need for hourly employees will be reviewed. About 200 hourly workers who could be affected in September, Ms. Tooher-Carrano said. .
In part, the county will lose nearly $1.8 million in Federal aid because of the state's failure to enact in January new regulations for the Adoption and Safe Families Act, a program meant to move children out of foster care more quickly.
The county will also have to pay an additional $2.3 million in Medicaid expenses because the State Legislature failed to continue a cost-containment measure by June 30.
Westchester will also lose about $500,000 in state reimbursements this year to house some state inmates at the County Jail in Valhalla.
In addition, the county estimates that this year alone it will lose $4.2 million because the state refused to absorb a 3 percent reduction in Federal funds for food stamps, another $1 million because of the elimination of funds for a state-mandated program to move welfare recipients to managed care and an estimated $3.1 million from a shortfall in statewide money for welfare programs.
With more of the same projected for the full 12 months of next year, the county predicts a loss of $25 million in revenue. The county's fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, while the state's budget year runs from April to April.
At least one state legislator questioned why Westchester was acting so surprised and shocked over the cutbacks and said elected officials had "failed to see the handwriting on the wall." Assemblyman Michael J. Spano, Republican of Yonkers, said that although he was sympathetic to the county's plight, he had warned Westchester officials in June that "we're going to lose a ton of money." He said they did not heed his warnings.
The Assemblyman faulted the county's Democrats for failing to work hard enough in Albany on behalf of their interests. "They lobbied with one arm behind their back out of respect for the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly and they ended up getting shafted," he said. "They had to see this was coming." Mr. Schwartz disagreed, saying that county officials paid many visits to Albany. "All of us were up there often," he said. "We were in their face constantly."
He also said that not only did county officials visit Albany but that they also sent letters and made calls.
But Sandra R. Galef, a Democratic Assemblywoman from Ossining agreed that the presence in Albany of Westchester and other counties was not as significant as it should have been.
Overall, the state slashed aid to counties by $300 million.
Referring to a strongly worded letter sent by the County Executive to the State Legislature the day before the budget was passed, Ms. Galef said, "Westchester did not present its case until the very last hour."
Ms. Galef also suggested that the Albany-based New York State Association of Counties, a lobbying group, should have worked harder on the counties' behalf.

HEADLINE: WORKING;
Sharing a Staff With a Ghost

BYLINE: By MICHELLE COTTLE; Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

 BODY:
You were recently brought in to replace the head of a department who was let go because of conflict with upper management. Despite your predecessor's rocky relations with her supervisors, she was popular with her staff. Now you're faced with trying to motivate a group of workers demoralized by the loss of their leader, one or two of whom, you suspect, regard you as the enemy. Do you address the problem or ignore it and hope everyone eventually adjusts?
Many people don't deal well with change under the best circumstances. And the firing of a popular supervisor can leave employees with a sense of loss as well as one of fear. The new leader should address both.
"When people work closely with someone, they bond," said Laurie Kalman, president of Performance First, a human resources consulting firm in Branford, Conn. "That's a relationship that needs to be acknowledged. You need to give the staff permission to go through a bit of a mourning process." 
 Cynthia Guy, a partner with Crystal Clear Concepts, a management consulting firm in St. Clair Shores, Mich., said that this process can benefit both the employees and the new manager. "Your job is to maintain high empathy," Ms. Guy said. "Listen. Try to understand their feelings. Find out, if you can, what their fears are. Find out what you need to do in their eyes to build trust."
Ms. Guy said that staffers might be asking themselves: " 'Am I going to get it? Is the new manager going to come in with a new broom?' "
Such concerns are far from groundless, said Joe Buys, another partner with Crystal Clear Concepts. "In terms of any management change, people frequently say, 'We're not going to make any changes,' then they come in and clean house," Mr. Buys said. "So people always have that trepidation."
Be careful not to make any promises, about job security or other conditions, that you may not be able to keep, Ms. Guy warned. "You can't go in there and promise roses and sunshine, because you may decide down the road that you need to make some staffing changes based on performance," she said. Your focus should be to reduce the fear that just because you're a new manager you're going to make changes.
Let the employees know where you stand on things and what you expect of them, Mr. Buys suggested. Lay out your philosophy, your goals for the group, how you like to receive information, some of the things you plan to do.
You should also solicit employees' suggestions. "Find out as much as you can in terms of what their feelings are, what their goals are, what they feel their accomplishments have been, what their ideas are for making improvements or moving ahead," Mr. Buys said. Too often, new managers feel compelled to put their mark on a department immediately, "when really what they need to do is a lot more listening," he added.
Although it's important to talk with employees about their concerns, you don't want them to wallow in what has transpired, Ms. Guy said. Acknowledge the past, but then try to get them to focus on the future.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT;
Bayonne, Long Maligned, Torn Over Trash Plant

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: BAYONNE

 BODY:
Since state and Federal environmental regulators shut down the Frank family network of marine-transport companies in 1993, the family's former headquarters here along the Kill van Kull has generated little more than weeds.
Even when it was in business, city officials say, the family did not contribute its fair share. In October, the city foreclosed on the bankrupt Standard Tank Cleaning Corporation property -- not only contaminated but marred by a charred and collapsed fuel tank, decaying docks and rotting offices -- to recoup $2.9 million in unpaid property taxes dating to the 1980's. 
 Now, a proposal has come along to clean up the site and provide millions of dollars in annual revenue to the city by building a plant to transfer New York City garbage from barges to trains, and ship it to Pennsylvania and the Midwest.
On Dec. 16, the City Council approved a 50-year lease estimated to be worth more than $150 million. The Bayonne Planning Board needs only to formally pass on the plan on Aug. 24. The company proposing the facility, American Marine Rail L.L.C. of Englewood, also needs the approval of the state Department of Environmental Protection, the Army Corps of Engineers and Hudson County.
But the trash train is not being welcomed by everyone. It would pass within feet of the homes on Isabel Avenue, and residents have mobilized in opposition, with support from City Councilman Anthony Chiappone and former Mayor Leonard P. Kiczek.
"Initially, I embraced the idea as a way to give tax relief," said Mr. Chiappone. But he said he was converted by his constituents' outrage.
In front of the houses on Isabel Avenue are hand-scrawled signs that read: "Help Keep New York Garbage out of Bayonne," "Hey, Joe, the Garbage must go," and "Joe Doria for Mayor" crossed out with red ink.
Last month a group was formed calling itself the Bayonne RATS -- for Residents Against Transfer Station -- referring to the rodents members say will be attracted.
One member, Bill Meehan, 49, recorded a protest song, "The Garbage Train." But it is not so much the train that is feared. Members are more worried they will smell it, and feel it, in the form of falling property values.
In the largest of several emergency cleanups of the Bayonne property, in 1994 the Federal Environmental Protection Agency supervised removal of 840,000 gallons of water and waste oil from a huge black tank that still looms over the site.
Proponents of the complex say it is the only realistic proposal so far for the property. The RATS are not sure how the site should be used, only that it should not attract garbage.
Supporters of the transfer station say the concerns of its opponents are unfounded. Moreover, they say politics is a possible motive, since Mr. Kiczek is a rival of Mayor Doria, a Democratic State Assemblyman who is also the Assembly minority leader.
The transfer station was proposed by Ronald A. Klempner of Teaneck, a former project manager for Browning-Ferris Industries, the Houston-based trash hauler known as BFI. The law firm representing Mr. Klempner is that of Edward T. O'Connor, a Democratic State Senator who represents Bayonne, though the firm says Mr. O'Conner is not working on the project.
Mr. O'Connor said last week that although he worked on the American Marine application, he was not the lead counsel. In addition, he rejected the assertion that he has a conflict of interest by representing a project oppsed by some constituents.
"I don't really see my duties as a legislator conflicted by my law firm's representation of a client that has a project that is now opposed by Isabel Avenue residents."
Mr. Klempner said he and his partners, who include Christopher J. Daggett, a former New Jersey environmental commissioner, will spend $10 million to clean up the Frank site and $40 million to build what he called a state-of-the-art transfer station. "We are a new type of waste facility," he said. "Our trash never touches the ground."
Nor does it stink, he said. Under the plan, up to eight barges a day carrying a total of 5,000 tons of garbage would be floated down New York Harbor and up the Kill van Kull to the site. Mr. Klempner said the trash would be covered with the same type of heavy tarpaulin used to keep smells out of grain transported on Mississippi River barges.
In addition to the approval from the various governmental agencies, Mr. Klempner also needs New York City to agree to the deal. A spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Sanitation said American Marine's proposal is being reviewed, but could not say when the department would award a contract or to whom.
At the Bayonne site, hangar-like doors would swing open, letting the barges into the station. The doors would close, the cover would come off, and with air scrubbers working to cleanse the odor, the trash would be loaded from the barge into sealable containers. Once a day, the sealed containers would transferred to the garbage train.
"Rodents are basically attracted by the smell of the waste, and if they can't smell it, like everybody else, they don't know it's there," Mr. Klempner said.
Mayor Doria has promised homeowners a significant property tax saving. Terms of the lease include annual payments that would start at $420,000 and be pegged to inflation after three years, plus a $1.51 tax, called a tipping fee, for each ton of trash transferred. American Marine would pay real estate taxes on the property, even though the company would not own it.
But Joe Hojnacki, 57, a retired Bayonne police captain who is a member of RATS, said the $170 he would save each year would barely make a dent in his $7,000 annual property tax bill.
RATS also insists that the garbage train will have another cost that not be calculated in dollars and cents. Members say that Bayonne has struggled to overcome ridicule as a dumping ground, an effort now embodied in plans to build Hudson County's first golf course on a capped municipal landfill.
"Bayonne has been the butt of jokes since the days of Abbott and Costello," Mr. Hojnacki said. "What I see is the rebirth of Weehawken, Hoboken, all these waterfront towns. What we get is garbage."

A Pause to Gape At Celestial Fireworks

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
OUT of gas, out of money and 200 miles from home, Roland Pahland had good reasons to regret his passion for seeing a solar eclipse.
He had battled traffic jams for nine hours driving south from Hanover to Stuttgart to get directly in the eclipse's path on Wednesday. When he got there, rain clouds blocked his view and that of hundreds of thousands of others. Now, having failed to calculate how much gas he would burn sitting in traffic, Mr. Pahland, an unemployed truck driver, was drumming up donations by singing country-and-western songs at a highway rest stop. 
 Yet for all that, he spoke with wide-eyed wonder about watching the sky turn dark and then light again. "This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience," he said. "We didn't get to see the corona of the eclipse, but we did see the sky become totally dark and then suddenly turn light two minutes later. I will never forget it."
Eclipses do that to people. Millions of Europeans drove for hours, just for the chance to put on paper glasses with blackened lenses and gape at an event that lasted two-and-a-half minutes.
There was something wondrous about the wonder itself. Between horrible weather and ghastly traffic in much of Europe, it was as if the Grinch had tried to steal the eclipse.
German autobahns were clogged all day with more than 200 miles of traffic jams. Yet there were few signs of bitterness or frustration. Even though they woke up to warnings of both bad weather and bad traffic, thousands of people decided they simply had to take a chance to witness the event, which won't repeat itself in the area until 2081.
In Paris, which was almost directly in the path of the eclipse, traffic stopped almost entirely and office workers poured into the streets. Trading came to a near halt at stock exchanges in Frankfurt, Paris and other cities. In Rome, Pope John Paul II shortened his weekly general audience in order to watch the eclipse.
Many Germans drove as close as they could to the eclipse's path, then parked along shoulders of the autobahn or at gas stations and rest areas. Parking areas became picnic spots. Astronomy buffs compared notes on their solar-shielded cameras and telescopes. Strangers shared their spectacles, which had become all but impossible to buy by Tuesday.
And as the moon slowly crept in front of the sun, novices and experts alike grew quieter and more reverent.
"You had the feeling that people had put everything behind them for the two minutes when it was happening," said Marcel Wenderoth, 23, a hotel receptionist who decided on Tuesday night to drive with his wife and 2-year-old son several hours from Dortmund. "It was euphoric."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Good Deeds Do Go Rewarded

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
IT is easy to wonder if there are any young professionals today who care about something larger than themselves. Two who do are New York lawyers in their 30's who have devoted themselves to employment issues. They were among the 11 New Yorkers -- out of 32 winners in all -- recently selected for grants by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
Sara Horowitz, 36, won $275,000 as founder and executive director of Working Today, a group that promotes the interests of people in flexible employment arrangments. Jennifer L. Gordon, 34, won $260,000 as founder of the Workplace Project, which fights employment abuse and discrimination against immigrant workers. 
 Ms. Gordon, who left the Workplace Project last year, said she was especially grateful for the MacArthur grant right now. "It gives me freedom to decide what I'm going to do," she said. "It gives me a huge sense of relief and potential."
Ms. Horowitz said the grant would help her continue the work she struggled to finance four years ago. "It's not like you get all this money and you decide to go live on some island somewhere doing nothing all day," she said. "I'm going to be doing what I'm doing, but this makes it easier."
Michele Lord, program director of the Norman Foundation, which has supported both groups, said: "These are the kind of people we look for all the time, people who are pushing the envelope, groups that promote systemic change. They've built up their constituencies, they've tested their strategies, they're very patient and they're not afraid to lose."
Both groups help people advance and protect their own interests. At the Workplace Project, which Ms. Gordon started nearly seven years ago, immigrants are encouraged to enroll in a night course, taught in Spanish, on labor law, history and organizing techniques. Graduates -- more than 500 so far -- then become members of the organization and its staff and board.
Ms. Gordon began her advocacy career working on political asylum cases for Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees in Boston after her sophomore year at Harvard University. She stayed with the organization, Centro Presente, for four years, traveling around Boston's dying industrial ring, to coffin factories, chicken-plucking plants, informing employers about their right to bar inspectors from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Visiting the shop floor, Ms. Gordon would stand on a box and explain in Spanish what workers should do to protect their rights if immigration officials carried out a raid.
In 1989, she decided to go to law school. "If I wanted to do something unconventional, I needed to have that stamp of approval of a professional degree," she said.
Ms. Gordon grew up in Storrs, Conn., where her father was a sociology professor and her mother taught special education. "I wouldn't say my parents are political activists, but they care a lot about fairness and justice and made sure we knew growing up that everybody's lives weren't like ours," she said.
State Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan of Queens, who worked with Ms. Gordon to make nonpayment of wages a felony, said she was impressed with how she mobilized people and then got out of the way. "I see grassroots groups where there is a strong leader who basically bosses people around," Ms. Nolan said. "She empowered people and they became the leaders."
Ms. Gordon is currently writing a book on law and organizing and teaching a course at Yale University called "Workers, the Law and the Changing Economy." Along with her partner, Linda Steinman, the director of litigation for Random House, she is raising a baby daughter, Sophie Rose,
Ms. Horowitz said she saw a void in the new, more decentralized, less unionized professional landscape in which health benefits and pensions were no longer guaranteed. She founded Working Today for independent workers -- freelancers, part-timers, independent contractors -- who lack corporate support systems.
"There is this tremendous disconnect between the way people are working and the laws that are protecting them," she said. "We needed some way to represent workers who are not connected to the workplace."
Joan D. Firestone, director of economic development for City Comptroller Allan G. Hevesi, said she was impressed with Ms. Horowitz's efforts. "The economy has changed enough so there are a lot of people who are not protected because they are not in full-time jobs," she said. "She has enabled them to have a sense of security."
And Margie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said Ms. Horowitz has a strong practical sense. "She first tries to help people address the real-life problems they face as contingent workers," Ms. McHugh said, "and then tries to engage them on the politics."
Unions are in Ms. Horowitz's blood. Her grandfather Israel Horowitz was a vice president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Her father, Milton, was a labor lawyer. Her mother, Bernice, a retired schoolteacher, was a union activist.
"It wasn't just about being political, but having a sense of a higher mission," she said. "To have the courage to not go along with the prevailing thought of the day."
Ms. Horowitz started working for unions at age 18 as an intern for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. After graduating from Cornell University, she attended law school at the State University of New York at Buffalo and earned a master's degree in public policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. She also married labor: her husband, Peter Dechiara, is a lawyer for unions.
Ms. Horowitz said the MacArthur award legitimized her unorthodox life choices. "It's nice to feel like you went a different way," she said, "and others think that turned out to be a smart decision."

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING;
As Layoffs Loom, Loyalties Are Divided

BYLINE: By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston. His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AN employee asks your advice about whether to buy a house. You know that the company is planning layoffs, and that he is likely to lose his job.
Do you keep quiet? Stall? Drop a hint? Or come right out and warn him? 
 The quandary is likely to keep coming up: even with unemployment at 30-year lows, layoffs are occuring at a record pace, a result of mergers and takeovers.
It's a problem that could test even the best managers. On the one hand, the person sitting across the desk is about to make a move that could turn into a colossal nightmare. Certainly, your compassionate side is drawn to his plight. How could you not tell him? Besides, can a company, a faceless institution, be harmed by one tiny indiscretion?
But hold on. What about your responsibility to the company? Spilling the news may seem insignificant, but it carries risks. The employee might spread the word, making other workers nervous or even setting off an exodus. Furthermore, if the company is public or is merging with a public company, letting an employee know beforehand might run afoul of securities regulations.
If those evils do not outweigh the potential harm of leaving an employee in the dark, where do you draw the line? Would it be O.K. to tell an employee who is low on cash about a pending merger, so she could buy stock at the right time and get out of debt? Insider trading laws make the answer a clear no. But when the issue is ethical, rather than legal, judgment calls can be difficult.
The urge to stop a colleague from stepping off a financial cliff is natural, said Rushworth M. Kidder, founder of the Institute for Global Ethics in Camden, Me. "Here is a real live, breathing person whose whole life is tied up in this thing." But, he added, "you can't sacrifice the good of a great number of other people simply because you want to tell someone a little bit ahead of time."
Heather J. Stone, the president of the Murdock Group, a career training company in Salt Lake City, faced such a decision earlier this year when she had to lay off half of her 52 employees, including two who were house-hunting. She told one of them in advance, but the other "did not have much career maturity," Ms. Stone said, and "would have a hard time" controlling the impulse to talk to other people.
"So I opted not to tell this person," Ms. Stone added -- even though she knew the employee had just made an offer on a house. "No matter how much I want to share with the employee," she reasoned, "if the risk to the company is too high, I'm not going to do it." Because Ms. Stone owns her company, she has more latitude than most managers in making decisions.
Another solution may be to tiptoe between the conflicting principles of compassion and confidentiality, helping the employee make the better choice even when full disclosure is impossible. When my wife's former employer was planning layoffs, for example, she and many of her colleagues began searching for new jobs. When she landed one and went to give notice, her manager stopped her, saying, "If you've gotten a new job, don't tell me." My wife took the hint. She was laid off a week later and received a severance package that wouldn't have been available had she resigned.
"You have to come to terms with how to approach issues like this where you can't divulge all of the information, but to do it without lying," Mr. Kidder said. He recalled a woman who once told him, " 'I really find that I don't ever have to lie; I have too big a vocabulary.' "
Dropping hints may help abide by the letter of one's duty of confidentiality, but it's hardly fair to limit disclosure to employees whose personal situation you know. A better approach might be to immunize the whole company against unpleasant surprises by persuading top management to share information more widely. In fact, a growing number of companies practice a more open style of management, teaching employees how the company makes money by sharing financial statements with them. Employees at such companies "can see there are troubles and know enough about the business to understand when costs need to be cut," said John Case, author of "Open-Book Management" (Harper Business, 1995).
If everyone knew about looming layoffs, as they did at my wife's company, rather than asking for advice about buying a house, an employee could probably discern for himself whether the timing was right.

HEADLINE: So Hard to Find Good Employers These Days

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI

 BODY:
AT a recent dinner party in Southampton, N.Y., in a big white house with a picket fence, the help couldn't keep up with the orders thrown at them. The food was exquisite, lobster salad followed by lamb; the house was picture perfect, decorated only a year before. But the hostess, in a beige silk Bill Blass suit and simple Harry Winston diamond earrings, had two faces. To her high-powered guests -- Wall Street men and media moguls, and women in linen and soft cotton -- she showed a radiant smile. "It's so nice to see you," she said to one dark-haired man as he arrived. "Let's get Lee Ann to get you a drink."
But to the young serving woman in a black skirt and white apron, she barked, "Hurry it up." Minutes later, when the server was drawn into conversation by a guest, the hostess bee-lined over and scolded, "I said, 'Hurry it up.' " Pulling on her arm, she said, "You're not to talk to the guests." 
At the seated dinner, the hostess loudly upbraided another server, one of the full-time staff of three, "There aren't enough water glasses on this table!" As the woman retreated wordessly to the kitchen, the dozen guests looked away so as not to deepen her embarrassment and theirs. The hostess, turning to the man on her right, said, "She's not very bright."
As the economic good times roll on and on, never before have so many been able to employ so many others as servants. But a boom market in domestic help is coinciding with a boom in boorish and disrespectful behavior toward domestics, say maids and drivers on Fifth and Park Avenues, nannies in Central Park, servers at parties in the Hamptons, household employment agencies and chroniclers of the social scene.
"The bad behavior is epidemic," said David Patrick Columbia, the editor in chief of Avenue, the magazine of Upper East Side life, who circulates widely among the beau monde. "There's a huge amount of emotional and verbal abuse going on towards the staff."
Mr. Columbia is careful to keep an ear cocked to the servants who otherwise go unnoticed in the city apartments and country homes of some of the richest New Yorkers. He calls today's generation of ladies and gentlemen of the house "screamers."
"I've seen the hostess get up from dinner because the so-called right fork isn't there, and they get into the kitchen and start screaming at the staff," he said. "Mind you, these are people who didn't know what the right fork was until they married a person who could afford the right fork."
On benches around the Central Park Boathouse, Upper East Side nannies gather daily to trade stories about their employers. A widely heard complaint is that children imitate the raised voices and disrespect shown by their parents.
A West Indian woman who works as a live-in nanny five days a week on the Upper East Side said the family's young teen-age son kicked her in the shins when she wouldn't make sandwiches for him and his friends after school. She complained to the parents, but they did nothing to the boy. "His parents made believe they cared, but they didn't," the woman said. "They didn't punish him."
Complaints by these workers -- who are almost always women, and foreign born -- is wide ranging, and includes illegal abuses like payment below minimum wage for six- and seven-day workweeks, failure to pay taxes, and sexual harassment. Domestic workers deprived of their legal rights have been championed in recent years by a number of groups across the country, including the Workplace Project in Hempstead, N.Y., which helps immigrant maids sue employers in small-claims court for back pay.
Beyond such clear-cut abuses, however, there is a vast category of mistreatment that is not illegal, but simply boorish -- rude and demeaning. While it is rarely discussed by the dinner or house guests at elegant Fifth Avenue apartments or in the Hamptons, it is perhaps inevitable as more people who did not grow up with domestic help are able to afford it but remain unclear on where to draw the boundaries.
"People who come into money late in life or quickly, especially women, don't know how to behave with subordinates and don't respect them," said Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., the author of a 1988 memoir, "Old Money: The Mythology of America's Upper Class" (Alfred A. Knopf), and a member of the extended Rockefeller family.
Mr. Columbia agreed, citing employers who think any household chore, even rinsing a dish, is beneath them. "They go out of their way to leave everything," he said. "They let the food get stiff on the plate. With a lot of these girls it's a measure of success to leave the plates there overnight. The behavior is nouveau. Trophy wives are always the worst -- girls who married wealthy men and never had help before."
But this rudeness is hardly limited to women, or to those new to wealth.
Mr. Columbia noted: "We live in an age that people in general that work in stressful jobs in New York seriously lack the ability to control themselves. People rage a lot."
Scolding in front of guests is one of the most common complaints. It humiliates the employee, and many employers seem to think it adds power to their image. In fact, it often embarrasses their guests.
R. Couri Hay, a society columnist for Hamptons magazine, recalled a seated dinner for 36 at an estate in Westchester County when the hostess stopped the entire party because she thought the table was not being cleared properly. She stood and, in front of the table, chided her Hispanic maid for not knowing that she should "serve left, clear right." The maid started shaking and dropped a plate, a flowered antique, which caused the hostess to yell even louder. The maid burst into tears and left the room. The hostess apologized to her guests, rang her bell and had another maid come out to clear.
In their defense, a number of men and women described by guests as having made such outbursts said that competent household help is scarce and that good people can demand huge salaries -- up to $2,000 a week -- and are quick to leave for a better offer.
"Why is this anyone's business how we treat our help?" said one hostess in New York and Southampton known for frequently raising her voice and who spoke only on condition of anonymity because she pays off the books. "We pay them, and if they don't like it they can work somewhere else."
Carol Mack, a decorator known for her dinner parties in Southampton, New York and Palm Beach, Fla. -- but not known for mistreating staff -- offered an explanation for why some hostesses are prone to raise voices and dress down employees publicly.
"How often do you go to a party and they serve the lamb, and the rice and vegetables comes a half an hour after?" she said. "The reality is, people don't listen. You think they understood what you told them, and they go off and do what they want rather than what you want."
Ms. Mack employes a cook, housekeeper, laundress and house manager (for washing the car, changing light bulbs and stocking the refrigerator). "You're not dealing with a level of professionalism that I think once existed," she said. "People don't view domestic help as a profession. Half of them do it as a summer job."
Clifford Greenhouse, a co-owner of the Pavillion Agency, which has placed nannies and other domestics in the homes of wealthy New Yorkers for 38 years, said the disrespect shown the help is worse today than ever. Well-paid domestics -- who earn at least $500 after taxes for a five-day week while living in, or $400 while living out -- used to remain two to three years with a family. Now, many are leaving after two months, citing poor treatment, he said.
He described, but would not name, a "very high profile" couple who do not allow their help to eat the household food. "They insist that their leftovers be thrown in the garbage," he said. "They do not want their help to eat their leftovers. Few people last more than a few months with them."
Nannies, he added, increasingly find rudeness, and worse, in children. "There are lots of incidents of biting and kicking and verbal abuse," Mr. Greenhouse said. "The older the children are, the more drastic their tempers can be. I'm always hearing stories involving children, teen-agers robbing money and jewelry from the nanny, threats of physical violence."
A live-in nanny in her 30's from Hong Kong said the lady of the house calls her stupid in front of the children. "I'm taking care of their children and I'm not treated like a human," she said. "The children won't listen to their parents. They won't listen to me. The parents maltreat us, the children follow."
Coco Myers, a co-author with Susan Carlton of "The Nanny Book: The Smart Parent's Guide to Hiring, Firing and Every Sticky Situation in Between" (St. Martin's Griffin, 1999), said that in hundreds of interviews with nannies, the No. 1 complaint was lack of respect.
"That's the thing we found made nannies leave more than anything else -- not the money, not the hours, but the respect and the lack of respect," she said. "Employers don't think that they have a life outside the family they are working for. We found that once they feel the lack of respect, it's dispiriting. They disengage."
Another day, at Carl Schurz Park, next to Gracie Mansion, Mina Zayas, 29, sat with four friends, all domestics in some of the wealthiest homes in the city.
Ms. Zayas said that when she first came to New York from Paraguay in 1994, speaking no English and without a resident foreigner's green card, she was hired as a live-in nanny by Muriel Brandolini, a decorator who lives in a brownstone in the East 80's with her banker husband. Ms. Brandolini asked Ms. Zayas for her passport. "She wanted to make a copy," Ms. Zayas said. But her employer held on to it.
Ms. Zayas said she was promised $300 for a five-day week, but when it came to collect her pay, Ms. Brandolini only gave $200, complaining that she didn't speak English. "But she knew that in the interview," Ms. Zayas said. The nanny job turned into housekeeping as well, totaling seven days a week with no time off for the same $200.
Ms. Zayas said that Ms. Brandolini, whose interior designs have appeared in Elle Decor magazine and whose fashion designs have been featured in The New York Times and are sold at Barneys New York, would take her to her Hamptons house on weekends, and she was expected to work there full-time, too. When she said she wanted to leave, she said Ms. Brandolini, still in possession of her passport, would threaten to call immigration authorities. Finally, Ms. Zayas had a friend intervene and she was able to quit, she said.
Ms. Brandolini, reached on a sailboat in the Greek islands last week, said she did not remember Ms. Zayas, though she acknowledged she has had many household workers in the last six years. Currently she employs a housekeeper, a weekday nanny and a man who watches the children on weekends. Two domestics who work for one of Ms. Brandolini's relatives confirmed that Ms. Zayas had worked for her in 1994.
Asked about Ms. Zayas's specific charges of sub-minimum pay, withholding a passport and threatening to call immigration agents, she said, "It's completely nonsense." She added: "I take the passport to make a photocopy, for security. I take their green card and their Con Edison bill and take a Xerox and give it back. You never know if these people live where they say they live."
"You know, at the end they get bitter," she said. "They've done something wrong and they ask for a raise. They break 10 dishes, you get mad and they talk."
"Nowadays if someone offers $50 more a week, they run," she continued. "There's no fidelity. It's rare to find that type of people in help. They come to America to make money. It's hard to find good help."
 
Doing Unto Others
NOT used to having domestic help? Think you're asserting authority or impressing your guests by yelling at the maid? Think again. Remember the old social rule of thumb, as expressed by Letitia Baldrige, the etiquette expert: "The real sign of class in a person is the way he or she treats the staff." Here are some hints, compiled from interviews with etiquette mavens, longtime hosts, nannies, cooks and wait staff on how to treat the help.
* Never correct a servant in front of other people.
* Address your employees by name, look them in the eye, and don't mimic accents.
* Teach children to treat the staff with respect. Have them say, "Good morning" and "Good night." "A 10-year-old should not have airs that some people are beneath him," one mother with a nanny said.
* Provide quality food for the help. Don't eat filet mignon and lobster every night and give the employees TV dinners.
* If you must leave dirty dishes in the sink, at least rinse them off. Similarly, don't leave dirty laundry thrown across the floor.
* Time off doesn't mean taking the nanny to the beach house to watch the children.
* Be clear from the start about what the job entails. If a nanny is hired to watch the children and do light housekeeping, do not change the job to watching the children and cleaning out the basement.
* Don't confuse employees with family members. They have families and lives of their own, deserve time off and must get the minimum wage. Employers must withhold state and Federal taxes.
* To attract better help, pay above the going rate. Give bonuses and paid vacations.
 Employers who ignore these guidelines may think they are eliciting disciplined behavior from a staff that fears them. But they are just as likely to have employees who, behind their backs, sabotage the household, committing petty thefts or ruining a meal. As Ms. Baldrige said, "I see waiter rage instead of road rage all the time."

Allies Shift and Numbers Tease As Greenspan Charts a Course

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER George Bush lost the Presidency to Bill Clinton in 1992, some Republicans blamed one of their own: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Mr. Greenspan had first become involved in Republican politics during Richard M. Nixon's 1968 campaign, and he had been a fixture among the party's economic policy makers ever since. 
 He had been appointed Fed chairman by Ronald Reagan and reappointed by Mr. Bush. But in the eyes of Mr. Bush's supporters, Mr. Greenspan had committed an unforgivable sin: failing to bring the economy back to full strength quickly enough after the 1990-91 recession.
Mr. Clinton exploited the lingering economic angst masterfully in 1992, and ever since he has ridden an upturn that in hindsight was well under way by Election Day.
All of this is to suggest that Mr. Greenspan is by no means unfamiliar with the rough and tumble of election year politics, or with the many ways in which the Fed can become an issue. And it is already clear, nearly 15 months before Election Day, that Mr. Greenspan will figure into this political cycle.
The first salvos against him have again come not from Democrats but from Republicans. In Iowa, where the Republicans battling to stay in the race against Governor George W. Bush of Texas for the party's Presidential nomination have become increasingly desperate for attention, both Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have attacked the Fed and Mr. Greenspan for raising interest rates when crop prices are plunging and farmers are hurting.
"Interest rates are too high, and while Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve raise rates, commodity prices have plummeted," Mr. Forbes says in a 60-second radio spot being run in Iowa. Mr. Forbes goes on to blame monetary policy together with "bad economic advice from the Clinton-Gore Administration" for the troubles plaguing agriculture.
Populist rage from the farm belt at tight-money bankers is hardly new; what is a bit confounding is that the present attacks are coming from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Mr. Greenspan's ideological home.
Then again, Mr. Greenspan is an easy target for politicians of all stripes because he never hits back, at least not publicly. Perhaps more to the point in this case, some Republicans view Mr. Greenspan as having sold out and become all but a member of the Clinton Administration.
They have watched with some unease over the past six and a half years as Mr. Greenspan became chummy first with former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and now with his successor, Lawrence H. Summers, as well as with Mr. Clinton himself. And the party's more ardent tax cutters were dismayed, if not aghast, when Mr. Greenspan told Congress last month that the nation would be better off using projected Federal budget surpluses for debt reduction than for reducing taxes.
Since Mr. Clinton has framed the fiscal policy choice just that way -- his prudent debt reduction plan versus irresponsible Republican tax cuts -- Mr. Greenspan was seen as siding with the Democrats. No one paid much attention to the Fed chairman's stated preference for tax cuts over additional Government spending, which in the eyes of most Republicans in Washington is the real choice before the country.
If Congress and the White House fail to work out a deal in the next few months on splitting up the surplus, leaving the issue to be fought out on the campaign trail, Mr. Greenspan's name will no doubt be invoked repeatedly by both parties to bolster their positions.
WHILE fiscal policy can make for powerful politics, it is just a sideline for Mr. Greenspan. The far more compelling issue for him could be how high to push interest rates over the next 6 or 12 months if the economy continues to roar along, setting off inflation alarm bells.
Politically, it will be a tough call; Mr. Greenspan would no doubt prefer to avoid raising rates during a Presidential campaign.
Economically, it could prove even trickier, since Mr. Greenspan is still wrestling with the degree to which this technology-driven, financial-market-centric, globally oriented economy can hold off inflation.
Besides a dozen years' experience on the job and a tough skin, the Fed chairman has something else going for him. If there were a Bush family grudge against him, it has been put aside, and Governor Bush has sent clear signals that he would support Mr. Greenspan's reappointment next year to a fourth four-year term. Vice President Al Gore has been equally supportive.
With that bipartisan support, Mr. Greenspan has considerable leeway in formulating policy, as well as an opportunity to push ahead with his slow but steady efforts to make the Fed more open in the way it considers and communicates its interest-rate decisions.
In the end, demystifying the institution and making clear that the rapidly changing economy is sometimes as difficult to read from within the Fed as from without could prove the best insulation against political attacks.

HEADLINE: Making World Trade Work

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Global Food Fights: The Worst Are Yet to Come" (Economic View, July 25), on the widespread criticism of the World Trade Organization:
While there is undoubtedly room for improvement in the workings of the W.T.O., the organization has proved to be an effective and objective forum for resolving trade disputes and fundamentally better than past efforts at achieving fair, free global commerce. 
 In the United States, 12 million people owe their jobs to exports; two million of those jobs were created from 1993 to 1997. And those jobs tend to be better paid, with better security, than most. The W.T.O., by making trading simpler, cuts companies' costs and increases their confidence in the future. That, in turn, means more jobs and better goods and services for consumers.
The organization is also bringing more and more nations into a prosperous, rules-based world economy and is speeding technological progress that can benefit health, the environment, commerce, artistic creation, scientific research and political debate. And it is advancing the universal values of fairness, open government and the rule of law.
In December, at the World Trade Organization's third Ministerial Conference, which will be held in Seattle, global negotiations will begin that will help shape world trade as we move to the next century. President Clinton has called for this to be an accelerated negotiating round aimed at opening markets, regularly achieving speedy results of disputes and reforming the W.T.O. itself to make it more transparent, accessible and responsive to citizens.
The negotiations represent an extraordinary opportunity. If the system's efficacy is not improved, we are very likely to see public skepticism rise, opportunities for further improvements in growth and the quality of life be lost, and the strength of the system erode.

HEADLINE: PRELUDES;
A Generation of Freelancers

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FORGET about that X, and all of its slacker implications. We are now in the midst of Generation 1099 -- the once pitied but now envied group of self-employed workers whose income is reported to the Internal Revenue Service not on a W-2 form, but on Form 1099.
Prime evidence of the new era is the emergence of two companies that are making the life of a full-time freelancer even more attractive, offering a lot of the perks that most permanent employees enjoy. Freeagent.com and Aquent ( Latin for not a follower), both opened shop in the last two months, and act as virtual employers that offer group benefits. "The goal is to give the freelancer the same security earned by traditional W-2 employees," said John Chuang, Aquent's chief executive. 
 As of February 1997, there were 8.5 million independent contractors -- a k a free agents, freelancers or consultants -- according to the Government, 1.5 million of them between the ages 24 and 35. Not to be confused with temps, who are employed by one agency, 1099ers have many clients and set their own hours.
The life of the self-employed is not all leisurely lunches and afternoons at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Members of Generation 1099 spend an inordinate amount of time hustling, invoicing and politely harassing accounts payable. And unlike full-time employees, who have taxes withheld, 1099ers are responsible for paying their own state, Federal and Social Security taxes, and shelling out huge amounts for health insurance -- if they have it at all.
"I've never been sick in my life, and I said I'd wait until I'm 30 to get insurance," said Kris Tobiassen, 29, a graphic designer in New York who has been a full-time freelancer for five years. "My birthday's coming up in a few short months, but I'm thinking about waiting -- it's so expensive."
Health insurance, stock options and retirement plans pull many people toward full-time, permanent employment. "The accessibility of benefits can serve as a glue to an existing job," said Jeffrey L. Bradach, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. Then there's the camaraderie and the relief of more structure.
Still, those boons are not enough to lure some people. "It would have to be a helluva lot of money for me to go back to an office," said Michael Bassett, 35, a computer consultant in Manhattan. "Big fat six-figure sums. I like the freedom too much."
But freedom's often just another word for nothing left to deposit -- especially when the landlord comes knocking, the electric bill lands in your mailbox, it's midnight on April 14th, your tooth cracked on a piece of toffee and your latest client can't cough up the cash. That's usually when 1099ers flip through the help wanted ads, looking for permanent employment.
Until now, professional groups like the National Writers Union have offered freelance writers some benefits. Freeagent.com and Aquent aim to offer more benefits -- group-rate health, dental, life, property, casualty, professional and disability insurance; 401(k) retirement plans and pensions -- to freelancers in all fields. Freeagent.com even offers stock options in its privately held parent company, Opus360, for those who want to bet on its future. As a 31-year old in Manhattan, I could join an Oxford Health Plans managed-care plan for $224 a month through Freeagent.com, compared with $270 on my own.
Job seekers can display their resumes on these sites. The companies also have billing and collection services, although they collect only from established corporations. You invoice Freeagent.com or Aquent and they pay the money owed you, less 3 to 5 percent. The companies collect fees or earn commissions from the other benefits.
Mr. Chuang says he wants Aquent to be the "Rosetta stone which translates the W-2-based world of financial services to the world of independent professionals."
Mr. Bradach of Harvard says that the new services will encourage people to try new careers or take more risks. They will also give freelancers more leverage.
With all the possibilities, there seems to be only one reason to get a full-time job: the company Christmas party. Then again, that might be a reason not to.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
How to Play the Treasury Bond Buyback

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
AMERICANS on occasion have suffered various shortages -- of gasoline, for example, or pennies or sensibly priced Internet stocks. Never in memory, however, have they even imagined a shortage of Government debt.
Now, with the first budget surpluses in a generation emerging, the Government is moving to make its obligations a little bit scarce. That is, if anything amounting to $3.6 trillion can be thought of as "scarce." 
 The plan, announced earlier this month and still lacking details, is to buy back some outstanding Treasury bonds and to sell fewer new ones. The Government will eliminate one of three auctions a year it holds for bonds with the longest maturity, 30 years.
This prospect, many analysts believe, not only offers the chance of a modest profit to some bond holders, but also suggests that some rethinking may be in order on the part of those supercautious investors who put their faith in Washington's promises.
A shrunken supply of Treasuries implies higher prices and lower returns, thereby making competing high-quality bonds, especially the $1.1 trillion issued by Federal agencies and Government-sponsored organizations, like the Federal National Mortgage Association, more attractive.
Here's how William H. Gross, managing director of Pacific Investment Manage ment and a prominent figure in the world of bonds, recommends playing the buyback, which isn't slated to occur until next year.
"Start to buy what the Government is going to buy" several months from now, he suggested. "Individuals can actually front-run the Government."
However, transaction costs are significant relative to the potential profits, in the view of William C. Dudley, a vice president at Goldman Sachs. You may need to make a six-figure commitment to benefit enough to compensate for broker fees and other costs.
But other things being equal, the buyback program provides a cushion if rates rise, because the Government is acting as a support for bond prices. If they fall, it can only give your portfolio some extra juice.
You might suppose the Government would target its most expensive debt, such as its 14 percent bonds due in 2011 or its 15 3/4's of 2001, for buybacks, which will be conducted through dealers. But specialists say you would probably be wrong.
This is because such bonds now sell at prices way above their face, or maturity, value. The Government is required to treat any amount it pays above face value as an extra budgetary expense rather than a run-of-the-mill refinancing. That is something Washington presumably wants to minimize. And so, analysts say, the more likely issues to be repurchased are those due from 2015 to 2025 with coupons of between 7 and 9 percent. Today, these trade at far smaller premiums to their face value.
Still, Gary Gensler, Undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, cautioned that budgetary concerns would not necessarily bar the buyback of double-digit coupons since other factors, including market conditions, would also affect the choice.
In addition to saving interest costs, the Government is hoping to improve the liquidity of benchmark issues -- such as the 30-year bond auctioned last week -- by trimming the number of older, competing "off the run" issues, such as the bonds sold last August and now due in 29 years. Off-the-runs now yield about one-quarter of a percentage point more than their newly minted cousins.
"They're taking inactive ones out and issuing more on-the-run," said William Quan, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a specialist in Government securities. That will save the Government interest payments in the short term and insures more demand in future auctions.
With one of the goals being to shorten the average maturity of outstanding debt, another focus will likely be on issues with 15 to 25 years left until maturity, most of these with coupons in the high single digits. And it's almost certain that the Treasury won't be bidding for any bonds with call features under which it can force redemption, many of these, not surprisingly, carrying the highest coupons.
But instead of trying to guess which Treasuries the Government will seek to retire, investors may well decide to shop more profitably elsewhere.
"This is bound to encourage a widening of interest-rate differentials" between Treasuries and the debt of Federal agencies and corporations, said Henry Kaufman, proprietor of a New York advisory firm bearing his name. "That's where the opportunities lie."
Agency debt includes bonds of the Federal Home Loan Bank as well as those of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation -- the latter two actually private companies chartered by the Government. Their debt already yields between one-half and three-quarters of a point more than Treasuries of similar maturity. That differential will probably be wider in the future due to the lower rates offered by increasingly scarce Treasuries.
If you insist on a Federal stamp of approval, don't forget one obvious alternative: certificates of deposits available at your local bank. The six-month variety is yielding nearly a percentage point more than a comparable Treasury bill -- though, of course, you'll pay both state and Federal taxes.

HEADLINE: Confessions Of a Frugal Spendthrift

BYLINE: By RICK MARIN

 BODY:
FRUGALITY has never been my problem. I've always made enough to cover my rent or mortgage. I pay my bills on time. I've never been in serious debt. And yet, compared with my parents, I'm a spendthrift.
I leave lights on in my Manhattan apartment. I'm a sucker for the service economy: trainers, housekeepers, tennis pros. And every time I buy an absurdly expensive suit, pay too much for dinner or spring for an unnecessarily fancy hotel, I feel guilty. Not guilty enough not to blow $2,000 on a cool 60's-modern credenza, but guilty enough to resolve to be more cost conscious in the future. So I take the subway instead of a cab and think I'm a hero -- until the next bout of buyer's remorse. 
 Clearly, a deeper kind of fiscal self-examination is called for. So I got in touch with the authors of "Invest in Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life" (John Wiley & Sons, 1998) and offered to subject myself to the ultimate humiliation: a frugality audit.
Written by Marc Eisenson, Gerri Detweiler and Nancy Castleman, the book's 328 pages blend self-help of the simple-abundance school with hard-core financial belt-tightening tips and complicated charts. Reading it you become convinced you could become a millionaire by paying an extra $50 a month on your mortgage or by buying used cars.
Who better to cast a cold eye on my platinum card bill? A frightening idea. There are things on those statements I don't even want to admit to myself, much less expose to complete strangers.
We traded E-mails. Mr. Eisenson and Ms. Castleman, a happily unmarried couple for 19 years, live together on a farm in Red Hook, N.Y., and publish a quarterly newsletter called the Pocket Change Investor, which they describe as a guide to "living better on less." They wanted me to visit their bucolic paradise of organic vegetables. But I felt that to be appropriately appalled by my decadence, they needed to spring for train fare to Manhattan.
In the meantime, they made a series of requests. Information about my monthly mortgage payment, which was recently doubled by the purchase of a summer house, and my 401(k) situation. Phone and utilities bills. Checkbook. A 1998 tax return. Ms. Detweiler, for many years the director of a consumer group called Bankcard Holders of America, asked me to keep a "spending diary," accounting for every penny I shelled out over a week. Ms. Castleman and Mr. Eisenson wanted me to think not just about money but about quality of life issues.
"We're not financial planners," Ms. Detweiler E-mailed me. "We're more 'life style' planners, geared toward helping you create more of the life you want on any income (not just when your portfolio reaches a certain level and you can 'retire')." She added, "Where are you investing your time and energy well, and where do you seem to fall short? What kinds of changes have you been putting off because of money?"
Hey, I thought but didn't write back, if I had a lot of extra time, I'd be using it. Changes? I'd buy a grotesquely huge house in the Hamptons and spend my days by the pool ordering gimlets from my houseboy!
DEFENSIVE? Of course. Anything to avoid thinking too hard about such things.
But the "Invest in Yourself" trio continued bombarding me with subliminal frugality messages.
From Ms. Castleman, re lunch: "Are you by any chance allergic to sunflower seeds?! (I usually use them in my pesto because they're a lot cheaper than pine nuts, and we can't tell the difference.)"
How's anyone supposed to enjoy an overpriced bowl of pasta under this kind pressure?
The lunch date rolled around and the three of them showed up at my apartment with a bowl of sunflower pesto in hand. Mr. Eisenson has a long gray beard and the look of someone who checked out of the rat race -- in his case, an electrical contracting business -- a long time ago. Remember Mr. Natural, R. Crumb's aging cartoon hippie? That's Mr. Eisenson, only, it turns out, with a sense of humor and a savant's skill at crunching numbers in his head. Ms. Castleman is wearing the same sandals she wore to Woodstock in 1969. Literally. Ms. Detweiler, who is about 20 years younger than her co-authors, lives outside Washington, D.C., wore a suit and evinced a little less of the converts' zeal than her collaborators.
As we sat down to salad from Ms. Castleman and Mr. Eisenson's Red Hook herb garden -- served in a bowl purchased for $1 in 1970 -- I asked how long it took to grow the tomato we were eating.
"About 1,000 hours of labor," Mr. Eisenson said. "That's a $50 tomato."
Which was why I mentioned it. If your time is worth X dollars an hour, is it worth spending the time for less than that amount of money in savings? Mr. Eisenson offered a sort of zen reply: "There are times when our time should be worth nothing."
I wasn't going to win that argument, so I told them I needed a car. I've never minded not having one, but with the new house, it seemed to be a necessity. There comes a time in every man's life -- like at age 37 -- when he should stop having to borrow his girlfriend's parents' Land Rover.
They scoffed at the notion of leasing. "Like buying your grandfather a rented tuxedo and burying it," Ms. Detweiler said. Mr. Eisenson contended that "most millionaires drive used cars."
Then they started with the scare tactics, presumably based on a careful scrub of my financials. "If you bought a car, you could be really tight," Ms. Detweiler said. "It wouldn't take much to upset the apple cart," Ms. Castleman added darkly.
O.K., forget the car. I wanted to get back to the stuff I misspend money on right now, not hypothetical future squanderings. First, I demanded a kitchen inspection. My bottle of Pellegrino was the first subject of ridicule -- something wrong with New York City tap water? -- then a box of funghi porcini in the cupboard. "I can go out into the woods and pick these," Mr. Eisenson said.
Ms. Castleman moved on to my air conditioner, set at a refreshing 65 degrees. "It's nice out!" she scolded.
After our meeting, I was inundated with E-mails from Red Hook alerting me to the 23 percent savings I could enjoy on my electric bill if I turned the air-conditioning up to 72 degrees, 44 percent if I went up to 78 degrees. Sure. I could probably make money on the deal if I pushed the thing up to 85 degrees, but I might die of heat prostration.
After hearing that I pay bills the day they arrive, take the subway to work, eat in more than out, they looked disappointed.
"You're much too frugal," Mr. Eisenson said.
I knew better. I've always spent too much money on clothes. When I was in high school, my mother used to mock my vast collection of shirts. So I compared notes with Mr. Eisenson on our polo shirts: my neo-retro rayon J. Crew that has to be dry-cleaned, $65; his secondhand Gap, five cents.
"You paid $65, but really it cost you $100," he pointed out.
Calculating the "real" cost in earned income is one of the book's simplest and most useful suggestions. Always factor in what taxes take out -- in my case, around 30 percent. At this rate, to pay for a $14,000 car you have to make $20,000. Now figure out how long it takes you to make that $20,000. Sobering.
What makes the authors nuts, on the tax front, is the idea that you should spend money to get a deduction. "Every dollar you spend in the hope of saving 30 cents is costing you 70 cents," Mr. Eisenson said.
Still desperate to prove my profligacy, I handed over my latest Visa statement. They studied it as if it were some ancient parchment, full of cryptic words and incomprehensible numerals.
"What's Mikimoto?" Ms. Castleman asked, her eyes widening at the accompanying charge.
It's a jewelry store, I mumbled tentatively. Anniversary earrings.
Mr. Eisenson offered an alternative "gifting" philosophy: "Take over a chore your mate hates and let that be the present."
That was when I realized we were living in different worlds: theirs and the real world of my girlfriend, who requires baubles that can be either shown off or exchanged.
I bid my guests farewell with promises to send them more complete financial documentation of my paycheck-to-paycheck existence and to keep a spending diary for Ms. Detweiler to review.
I started the week of June 28:
Monday: Forget completely.
Tuesday: Subway ($1.50), oatmeal from company cafeteria (85 cents), cafeteria lunch ($6.60), "American Pie" (free press screening), wine for a friend's sendoff ($12.98). Total: $21.93.
Wednesday: More of the same, with some cabs, drugstore products and $27.85 worth of developed pictures thrown in. Total: $77.80.
Thursday: Host Canada Day party ($79.87 for beer and bacon and maple syrup), my housekeeper ($60), plus a bunch of other stuff, like two pairs of Adidas running shoes ($119). Total: $295.22.
Friday: Housekeeper again, for post-party cleanup ($20), stamps at Mailboxes Etc. ($6.90), CD holder from The Wiz ($8.62), gas (20.09), and -- the clincher -- returned stuff to Bed, Bath and Beyond (-$37.87). Total: $38.99.
The lesson of Ms. Detweiler's exercise, which even she agrees is incredibly tedious, is to show you what you think you spend money on versus what you actually spend money on. I think you're supposed to be surprised at where it all goes. I had the opposite reaction. I was amazed at how little I spend and resolved to live a little better from now on. That 85 cents for oatmeal seemed sadly Dickensian.
A few weeks later, I got an E-mail from Mr. Eisenson and Ms. Castleman breaking down some savings options. Dump the health club, to which I hardly ever go (saving $1,000 a year). Mow my own lawn ($2,340 a year). Buy cheaper and fewer clothes ($600). Raise the temperature (Con Ed wouldn't give them figures on that one). Buy cheaper wine ($520). Each dollar amount was accompanied by a "what you'd have to earn" amount: $1,538 for the health club, $3,600 for the lawn guy. How they arrived at some of these numbers I'm not entirely sure, but I got the point.
I could be more frugal.
It made me think about my late father, who considered my mother a reckless spender, even though she was known as the thrifty one among her friends. They both came from comfortable upper middle-class backgrounds. But she had lived through the Depression, in Canada, and he through the Spanish Civil War. Both had seen that it was possible to have everything taken away in a trice and I always figured that was why they saved all those bits of old string. He would do things like measure the amount of water in the kettle before boiling it.
My mother still mails me back uncanceled American stamps from Canada, so that I can re-use them. They litter my apartment, like tiny rebukes to my wasteful ways, until I finally get around to soaking them off the old envelope paper and gluing them on a new one.
A couple of weekends ago I went to my first warehouse club, a hangar-sized temple to frugality called B.J.'s on Long Island. On the way in I silently disdained all the people rolling giant flatbed carts piled high with toilet paper and frozen swedish meatballs toward the 800-items-or-less cash register. On the way out, I had filled two of those carts myself. Grand total: $531.47. But the important thing was how much I saved.
 
Six Steps to Monetary and Spiritual Rewards
ART -- hard-nosed advice about personal finance, part touchy-feely self-help, "Invest in Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life" argues that for readers who can learn to shave a few cents here, a few dollars there, monetary and spiritual riches await. For anyone too frugal to buy the book, here, in summary form, are the authors' "secrets":
MAKE YOUR OWN LIFE-STYLE DECISIONS -- Besides return on investment, consider time, energy -- even fantasies -- as equally manageable assets in your portfolio. That might mean downsizing from a two-income household to a one-income one or moving to the country.
PUT YOUR FAMILY FIRST -- Your love for your family isn't judged by how much you can buy them. The book quotes Paul Tsongas, the late Massachusetts Senator: "Nobody on his deathbed ever said, 'I wish I'd spent more time at the office.' "
BE IN BUSINESS FOR YOURSELF -- Jobs are no longer secure. Think of yourself as a consultant, not an employee. Freelance on the side.
MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TAKE-HOME PAY -- To paraphrase Ben Franklin: A dollar saved is $1.40 you'll never have to earn, assuming a 28 percent tax bracket. Wealth is having slightly more than you need; poverty is having slightly less -- so adjust accordingly. When you are about to buy something, ask: If I didn't need it yesterday, why do it need it today?
TURN YOUR DEBTS INTO INVESTMENTS -- A typical $100,000 mortgage costs $250,000 over 30 years. Prepay $25 more a month and you'll save more than $20,000 in interest. Paying down credit card debt returns the equivalent of as much as 20 percent on a taxable investment, which beats the Street.
MAP OUT YOUR OWN FINANCIAL FUTURE -- Don't adopt financial habits just because they're popular. For example, college is not a parental tithe; think of it as the six-figure investment it is. Likewise, determine how much you really need for retirement, not what planners want you to invest. Consider a working retirement. Touch the nest egg; you don't have to end up with a big estate.

Lose the Pignoli, Gain Five Grand
By substituting sunflower seeds for pine nuts, Nancy Castleman's pesto recipe may offend culinary purists. But for the frugal gourmet, it is one more way to save.
Ms. Castleman and her co-author and companion, Marc Eisenson, figure they consume a pint of sunflower pesto weekly, and thus 6.8 pounds of sunflower seeds a year. At the health-food store where they shop in Rhinebeck, N.Y., the seeds cost 99 cents a pound, versus $10 a pound for pine nuts. So their annual saving, on a nut-for-nut basis, is $61.27 a year.
By Ms. Castleman's calculations, the pine nut premium would cost an extra $94.25 in pretax dollars. But opting for sunflower seeds and investing the savings for 25 years at an average 8 percent return would yield $4,855.78 -- an impressive harvest.
 
NANCY'S PESTO
From www.investinyourself.com
Time: 10-15 minutes
 
20-25 cloves (5 heaping tablespoons) chopped garlic
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon honey (optional)
1 cup water
6 cups well-packed basil leaves (more or less).
1. Traditional recipes have you use a mortar to pound, or pestare, the ingredients -- thus the name of the dish. It goes a lot faster with a food processor or blender.
2. Either way, combine the garlic and sunflower seeds with the oil and honey, and a little of the water. Gradually add the rest of the water.
3. Add the basil, 2 cups at a time. Process until everything is well blended.
Yield: 4 cups of pesto.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Great Expectations;
The Retirement Mentality vs. Reality

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
THE United States is far from alone when it comes to worrying about how to sustain a long-term Social Security system in an era of aging populations -- or how to insure that there will be enough new talent to fill the work place as fewer babies are born and more people retire. Around the world, but particularly in Europe and richer Asian nations, the situation is even more alarming, and so are the choices governments may soon have to make.
Persuading people to retire later may seem like the easiest alternative, but planners worldwide are finding that cultural and social attitudes toward leisure, family, old age and status have a great effect on policymaking. Along with economic globalization and urbanization, the idea of a hard-earned, dignified and pleasurable retirement is catching on in many countries. 
 "Within the space of about 100 years, people have not only accepted, but grown to believe that retirement is a right somehow, a human right almost," said Dalmer Hoskins, secretary general of the International Social Security Association in Geneva. "Working with these 150 countries that have pensions system, I'm struck more by the commonalities among them than the differences."
No one knows exactly what a decent level of retirement living is, he said, "but it's written into the constitutions of country after country."
The question, as Mr. Hoskins frames it, is whether more retirement is really what most economies really need, particularly in industrialized Europe, where populations are shrinking and aging, and most people are retiring before the age of 60 and living another 20 years or more. He suggests that in Europe and the United States, national interests and those of private enterprise may be dangerously out of sync.
"The private sector is retiring people at consistently earlier ages," he said, adding that forcing people to retire in the name of downsizing and reorganization has gone hand in hand with the shirking of responsibility for pension plans.
Big, even cosmic, ideas float around the subject of retirement. Peter G. Peterson, an investment banker and chairman of the Institute for International Economics, argued in "Gray Dawn: How the Coming Age Wave Will Transform America -- and the World" (Times Books, 1999) that, "We are confronting demographic changes so substantive that they could redefine economic and political systems in the developed countries over the next generation." Early retirement, he asserted, is already undermining the survival of developed nations.
Unless people can be persuaded to work longer into old age, say Mr. Peterson and others, like Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations Population Division, developed countries will have to accept a loss of productivity, creativity and even general economic health.
Or they will be forced to accept waves of immigration from poorer nations, a policy Germany, other European countries and Japan would like to avoid for social and cultural reasons.
In the United States, one serious hurdle is ageism, Mr. Peterson says, reflecting on the youth culture that pervades many American companies. "Overcoming ageism will requiring ongoing education and commitment, much as overcoming racism in American work places has over the past few years," he writes. "An entire stereotype will have to be reversed, along with all the institutional rules and habits of thought that perpetuate it."
DON'T bother, a lot of retirees seem to be saying, as they settle into country club retirement communities or book another cruise.
In Singapore, where the proportion of people 60 or older will rise to 26 percent from the current 10 percent in the next 30 years, the Government hopes to push the retirement age from 62 to 67. But Singaporeans, who must contribute to a national savings plan, can take their accumulated retirement package at age 55, and a fair number do, said Dr. Kanwal Jit Soin, a former independent member of Parliament.
"People think they deserve retirement by the age of 55 or 60," she said in an interview, adding that this is particularly true of older people with few or no professional qualifications or skills, born before Singapore's economy took off. "And we are also a society with strong filial ideals," said Dr. Soin, an orthopedic surgeon. "Children take care of their parents and grandparents look after their grandchildren."
With Singapore's standard of living now rivaling southern Europe's, retirees also go on cruises and vacations that they could never have afforded in earlier decades.
Singapore -- with a dominant Chinese population but a mix of people of Indian, Malay and European ancestry -- is almost alone among Asian nations in changing its immigration policy to allow more foreigners with skills to settle in the small country, really an island city-state. It also allows unskilled workers, most from poorer Asian nations, to work for limited periods, filling manual jobs that Singapore's 3.5 million people have largely outgrown through education and training for a technological future.
Japan takes a different approach, rejecting increased immigration. It tries to keep people working longer through incentives to their employers, said Linda G. Martin, president of the Population Council in New York.
"The Japanese Government has a fairly aggressive policy to encourage employers to retain older workers," she said. "It provides some financial incentives to companies that maintain a certain percentage of older employees, and sometimes older workers retire and are rehired by the same company, often with a lesser title or lower stature.
"The Japanese," she added, "are a bit ahead of the United States in how to make productive use of older people."
In the third world, where most people keep on working to survive, the formal retirement situation is very mixed, and sometimes more complicated. A survey of retirement ages by the United Nations Population Division shows the lowest ages in the poorest countries, mostly African, but also several in South Asia. Yet these are also often places where there are no pensions or other benefits, no social security systems and no subsidized health plans. A low national retirement age -- the lowest is 40 in the Solomon Islands -- often reflects short life expectancy, the pressure of younger working-age populations, or both.
In India, the employed are squeezed from both ends of the age scale, with millions of young people joining the work force every year, while older people are living longer than ever before and are beginning to demand retirement programs. Since independence in 1947, India has raised life expectancy to 63 from 39. But until very recently it retained a 58-year-old mandatory retirement age for Government employees, opening places for younger people but forcing even experienced ambassadors and key civil servants to search for work. The age has now been raised to 60.
"In countries like India and China, people can't or don't want to be reliant on their children now," said Mr. Hoskins of the International Social Security Association. But they remain in retirement limbo, waiting for governments and the private sector to act.

HEADLINE: Dogfight Over a Must-Win Contract

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: PALMDALE, Calif.

 BODY:
HERE in the Mojave Desert, in huge hangers guarded by armed sentries and high fences, the Government and its two biggest defense contractors are engaged in a high-stakes, high-risk experiment aimed at building a fighter aircraft that will dominate the skies and protect the nation's security for decades to come.
The project is still in its early stages, with the competing airplanes given the code names X-32 and X-35 and workers admonished not to utter a word. 
 But at the end of what the Pentagon promises will be a "winner-take-all" contest, either the Boeing Corporation or the Lockheed Martin Corporation will land what should be the biggest military contract ever. For both companies, this is a must-win competition: The winner will collect nearly a third of a trillion dollars -- and the loser could be out of the military aircraft business altogether.
For now, the companies' competing teams of engineers, test pilots, computer experts and factory workers are at work here, where the scrub soil gives way to an outpost of chain motels and fast-food restaurants, preparing for a flyoff early next year.
After that, and another year of testing and analysis, the Pentagon will make its pick. The winner will build a Joint Strike Fighter in three versions: one able to fly off carriers for the Navy, another to land on ground for the Air Force and a third that can hover into hot spots for the Marines. Nearly 5,000 of these planes are expected to be made, to replace nearly all the fighter planes flying today.
"This plane is the future," said Richard Aboulafia, director of aviation for the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Va. consulting firm. "It will be the fighter plane for all the services. It will be the fighter plane for all the world."
More than an airplane, the Joint Strike Fighter is an unprecedented test of cutting-edge technology, of how the Pentagon does business, of how wars will be fought. And it has profound implications for both the domestic military-industrial base and the nation's security well into the 21st century.
Faced with an increasingly skeptical Congress -- just last month, the House voted to delete funding for the Air Force's new F-22 fighter from next year's defense spending bill -- and a history of eye-popping cost overruns, the Pentagon decided it needed a fresh approach to procurement. And it is starting with the largest contract it has.
The order is a tall one: Design a single-engine, single pilot fighter that can be used by all three services and sold to overseas allies. It must fly faster than the speed of sound, be invisible to enemy radar -- and be produced for the bargain-basement price, by fighter aircraft standards, of around $30 million an airplane.
In building this plane, the Pentagon for the first time is making cost as important as performance. Boeing and Lockheed are being told not to build the best plane they can, but the best the Government can afford -- both in terms of its initial price tag and in maintenance costs over time. Rather than being the Cadillac of the air, the Joint Strike Fighter is designed more as a Chevrolet -- but with a Saturn-style attention to innovation and cost control.
"This program is about building an affordable fighter plane," said General Michael A. Hough, the Pentagon's director of the Joint Strike Fighter program. "It's the real deal. The country is going broke trying to pay for the latest airplane. We want to build it like your car -- just put gas in it and go."
The program is an attempt to break one of Augustine's Laws, a not entirely satirical calculation developed by Norman R. Augustine, the former Lockheed chief executive, that says the price of military aircraft is growing so fast that by the year 2054, the nation will be able to afford only one airplane.
THE Joint Strike Fighter will replace a generation of planes, some of which are 30 years old: Lockheed's workhorse F-16 and Northrop-Grumman's A-10 attack planes for the Air Force; the Marines' Harrier short take-off and vertical landing planes, built by Boeing and British Aerospace; and the Navy's carrier-based F-14 from Northrop and F/A-18 from Boeing. It is designed to work in tandem with the F-22, a far more expensive ($80 million) and sophisticated two-engine plane designed to eliminate enemy aircraft in initial air-to-air combat. The Joint Strike Fighter is designed to follow as part of a "hunter-killer" team, dropping bombs once the F-22 clears the skies.
"We needed to replace older and outmoded aircraft for all three services, and we could not afford to develop three different planes," said Darleen Druyun, the Air Force's top acquisition executive. "So it made sense to make a family of vehicles -- three planes with the same motor, the same avionics and 60 to 80 percent common parts, but with variations for all three services."
The comparison with earlier aircraft development programs is stark.
"In the past, I threw the requirements over the fence and a plane came back, and we didn't think about costs," said George K. Muellner, a retired Air Force general who once headed several acquistion programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter program, and is now a Boeing employee.
Still, for all the Pentagon's sentiments, questions remain.
* Can a plane that is three variations on a theme -- 80 percent the same for all, and otherwise modified to meet each service's special needs -- actually work? Or will it be a compromise that satisfies no one -- like the F-111, a Vietnam-era plane for all three services that was both costly and wildly unpopular.
* Will the Pentagon really stick to it's "winner-take-all" strategy, an approach that some analysts say would most likely leave the Defense Department with only one tactical aircraft supplier? Or will the military -- or Congress -- feel that the work must be split to keep two military aircraft makers in business, even if this increases program costs and reduces efficiency gains?
Everyone involved is mindful of the fate of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which was cut from the Joint Strike Fighter program and, as a result, forced to merge with Boeing in 1997 -- in spite of rosy statements at the time from Harry Stonecipher, then McDonnell's chief executive and now Boeing's president, that "this does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business."
* Can the Pentagon really shed its old, expensive ways? It says it wants an aircraft designed and produced using the best commercial practices to simplify the plane and lower costs over its operating life. But will the military begin to tinker and increase the price tag?
For instance, if the F-22 program is canceled or drastically reduced from the 339 planes now on order, would the Joint Strike Fighter's capabilities be upgraded in ways that could make it more expensive? Just this month, Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, warned that cancelling the F-22 could lead to a costly redesign of the Joint Strike Fighter.
* Are Boeing and Lockheed up to the task? Boeing has already been forced to drastically redesign its plane to provide better control on carrier landings, trading a swept-wing design for a more conventional one. Lockheed, meanwhile, has had few design changes, but has faced cost overruns in the $100 million range and been forced to scramble its plans for next year's demonstration tests to stay within budget.
* Will the plane sell? Plans call for the Air Force to buy 1,783 planes, the Marines 609 and the Navy 408, along with 150 for Britain's Royal Navy, which has invested $200 million in the program.
The Pentagon estimates that other countries will buy an additional 2,000 planes. But European countries might decide instead to support European offerings -- the French Rafale, the Swedish Gripen or the British Eurofighter -- even with their higher price tags and lower performance capabilities. And Congress, in another round of budget-cutting, could cut back on Joint Strike Fighter purchases, raising the price for each plane.
"In theory, the Joint Strike Fighter is a good idea," said Eugene Carroll, a retired two-star admiral, who is deputy director of the Center for Defense Information, a Washington nonprofit organization that has been critical of military spending. "So far, it's retained an air of common sense that we are looking for in an era when we are not facing a high-tech major power."
But Mr. Carroll sounded a note of caution: "If we can build this meat-and-potatoes airplane, let's press on. But let's not do the same thing to it that we've done in the past and get the requirements jazzed up so much its goals can't be met."
IN a setting that seems lifted from the "X-Files," the two companies are building competing "concept demonstration models" to show the Government early next year. Spy planes and space shuttles are designed in utmost secrecy here, but it's hard to hide the Joint Strike Fighter program. On the highway coming into town from Los Angeles, there's a huge billboard of a fighter zooming over the motto: "Boeing, the Best. JSF." Leaving town, you come upon Lockheed's billboard -- its fighter with the single word "Imminent."
Inside two huge hangers -- one at Lockheed's Skunk Works, the other at Boeing's Phantom Works -- each company is making a pair of airplanes, one of which will be reconfigured during the Pentagon's flyoff to demonstrate the requirements for different services. Right now, they are only carcasses of titanium and composite, electronics and wires. But by year-end, they will become airplanes -- at a cost of about $500 million for each pair. The Government's total tab for the development process is about $2.2 billion, including $832 million to Pratt & Whitney for the engines for all the planes.
The real question here is just how serious the Pentagon is about "winner-take-all." Can the Pentagon come to the desert, hand one company a golden prize and leave the other empty-handed?
The Pentagon says yes. "I've been ordered to pick a winner," said General Hough. "I don't know how you can have two winners."
Officially, both companies take the Pentagon at its word, though observers argue that the nation cannot afford to be reduced to a single supplier of tactical military aircraft. Or, they say, political pressures will be such that both companies will get some business. That, though, could sharply escalate the costs of the aircraft.
"If you split it down the middle, you lose economies of scale," said Loren Thompson, a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., research group. "But if you get a tactical aircraft monopoly, the presumption is you would get less innovation, higher prices and lower performance."
Yet the Air Force's Ms. Druyun says a winner can be picked without harming the nation. "We're always concerned about the industrial base," she said. "But when I look out and see what will be there in 2010 and 2015, it is still apparent that there will be a viable industrial base in the fighter aircraft business."
Lawrence Korb, a military analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations, said the project was so large that no matter which company won, the other would get plenty of subcontracting work. "It's not a winner-take-all, but a winner-will-do-better program," said Mr. Korb.
There is, however, a critical difference between being a prime contractor and being a subcontractor. The prime has control over the project. It gets the most money. And, since it is where all the engineering, design, computer and high-end action is, it is where all the creative and talented people want to work.
"The guy who gets the money is the guy who makes the decisions," said Harry Blot, Lockheed's deputy program manager for the fighter. "If you lose, you may make as many parts as you want, but you won't have the design authority. It's interesting work that keeps engineering teams together."
Mr. Meullner of Boeing, the former Air Force acquisitions head, questioned whether the Government "has the guts" to pick just one producer.
"I'm hoping it will be winner-take-all," he said. "Our defense budget cannot sustain two production lines."
So far, Wall Street has not focused on the contest. The final payoff is at least a decade away -- an eternity for Wall Street. And the market's conventional wisdom is the program will be split: Lockheed will build the Air Force version and Boeing the Navy and Marine planes.
"There is no clear indication as to which way the program is going," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with J.S.A. Research in Newport, R.I. "So there's nothing of this program reflected in either company's stock."
For the military, the focus is much clearer. Driving the program is the Marine Corps, which wants its own new plane not dependent on Navy carriers for takeoffs and landings. The Navy, happy with the F-18, and the Air Force, going all out for the F-22, were more reluctant converts. The key in getting them on board, according to Mr. Muellner, was to minimize "scar penalty" -- the price that one service pays for the requirements of another.
So, with careful planning, the Air Force and Navy got what they wanted -- a stealthier plane with more range than existing fighters. And in Congress, where both the Air Force and the Navy have taken their share of hits of late, the leathernecks command great respect.
"The Marines have impressive powers of outlasting their doubters in getting the things they want," said Wolfgang Demisch, a managing director at Wasserstein Perella and Company. "And they really want this plane."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Hunting for That Elusive Surplus

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, went to a nuts and bolts factory outside Chicago last week and waved four $1 bills in the air. The money was supposed to represent a trillion dollars.
"This is the surplus," he said, and then promised to give three of the dollars back to Americans in the form of a whopping tax cut. 
 But the surplus right now is as real as a $3 bill. This year was supposed to bring the first surplus in three decades. But when Congress comes back from vacation in September, a ritual dance around this pot of money will resume. And when the dance is done, the pot will be empty. Its fate does not augur well for the 21st-century surpluses that are supposed to underwrite the Republican tax cut.
The tussle over the public treasure is shaping up as a war. Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority whip and conservative major domo, said in an interview last week that draining the surplus was a deliberate strategy designed to force President Clinton to submit to the Republicans' political will.
He said the President had three choices. One: get down "on his knees" and sign the spending bills the Republicans are writing, which cut or kill many of Mr. Clinton's favorite programs. Two: raid another pot of money, the sacrosanct Social Security surplus, to restore those cuts. Three: shut down the Government.
Mr. Clinton responded: "I can think of nothing more cynical or irresponsible."
As Congress and the White House play chicken, and Republicans and Democrats vie for advantage in next year's elections, this will be one of the only serious political games in town next month. "Both sides are just maneuvering, and we throw an occasional stone at each other," said Jim Dyer, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, where the spending bills originate. "Frankly, it's just a terrible way to do business."
With the future of the American economy, control of the Congress and the next Presidency at stake, each side is accusing the other of bad faith.
First President Clinton submitted a budget balanced with theoretical money, like $10 billion in proposed new cigarette taxes. The Republicans, who would sooner publicly convert to paganism than pass such a tax, wrote their own version of a budget balanced with more theoretical money, mainly cuts in domestic programs so deep that Congress would never approve them.
In theory, the only rule that both sides are supposed to play by in this game is the 1997 law that imposed spending limits, or caps, on Congress.
In practice, the game now is how to evade the caps. Congress has dug deep into a bag of tricks that Stan Collender, the managing director of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm, called "the biggest collection of budget gimmicks ever put together in one year."
F IRST, they're calling anything that moves an emergency," said Mr. Collender, whose job is explaining Government spending to corporate clients. This allows Congress to dip into the projected $14 billion surplus. So far, the emergencies include $4.5 billion for the 2000 census and $7.4 billion in farm subsidies. The Republicans also set aside $4.5 billion to finance the first year of their tax cut. Do the math: no more surplus.
"Then you have directed score keeping," Mr. Collender said, "which is essentially lying about the numbers, playing with accounting." This maneuver, by some lights, created the $14 billion surplus in the first place.
"Then there's forward funding," he said, "maybe $12 billion this year, which is borrowing from a future year." This is the Government's equivalent of Popeye's pal Wimpy saying he will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Add it all up, Mr. Collender said, and the Republicans will spend "about $30 billion more than they're saying they will spend," while claiming they are keeping the caps on tight.
"They can't live with the caps," the White House budget director, Jacob J. Lew, said in an interview. "They're having to do ridiculous kinds of things to keep the process moving along. We're clearly headed toward some difficult days."
Congress left town with 11 of this year's 13 spending bills incomplete. President Clinton has threatened to veto 7 of them over Republican cuts. After Labor Day, 16 working days remain for Congress before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.
If there is no budget by then, the Republicans and the President are going to have to cut a deal.
"We will negotiate with the President, after he vetoes the bills, on his knees," Mr. DeLay said, daring him to raid Social Security funds or risk a Government shutdown. This could prove either a brilliant ploy or a paralyzing blunder.
Either way, "It's kind of cynical," said Mr. Lew. "They're going to have to decide whether they want to create a sense of mounting crisis."
That decision seems to have been made. If there is no deal by Oct. 1, Mr. DeLay said, Congress can pass a "continuing resolution" that essentially finances the Government at this year's levels. President Clinton can give up and sign it. Or he can unleash a political nuclear weapon and veto it.
Then the Government shuts down -- or, as Mr. DeLay put it, "the President will have shut down the Government." The last time that happened, in 1995, the Republicans took the blame, and lost Congressional seats all over the country in the next election.
"I don't look forward to this," said Mr. Dyer. "It's really hard to figure how this plays out in September."

HEADLINE: Angst in the Great American Middle

 BODY:
"The American Middle, Just Getting By" (Economic View, Aug. 1), by Louis Uchitelle, discussed the feeling of many middle-class families that they are not sharing in the national bounty as earlier generations did. The column drew many responses.
 
To the Editor:
Mr. Uchitelle showed what average Americans know intuitively: that middle-income families do not feel middle-income, let alone middle-class. Two breadwinners today cannot do what one used to. 
 The first reason is falling wages. For men in nonsupervisory positions, especially, real wages have fallen sharply, dropping 15 percent between 1979 and 1997, according to Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and John Schmitt in "The State of Working America" (Cornell University Press, 1999). High-paying manufacturing jobs have been replaced with low-paid service jobs.
At the same time, the tax burden has been transferred from the economic elite to the middle. At the end of World War II, the average American paid little tax because the Government (both Republicans and Democrats) wanted a huge middle class.
In their book "America: Who Really Pays the Taxes?" (Touchstone, 1994), Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele showed that a Philadelphia family earning the median income of $38,000 in 1993 had to pay $8,000 more, in 1993 dollars, in taxes of all kinds than its counterpart earning the median income in 1953 would have.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Astonishingly, your article omitted the largest component of the modern family budget: taxes. 
 In 1997, the last year for which data are available, the combination of federal, state and local taxes took 37.6 percent of income of a median two-income family, according to the Tax Foundation -- more than food, clothing, housing and transportation combined. Compare that with 1957, when the tax bite on the median two-income family was 27.8 percent.
These figures mean that an average family with the $49,000 income of the Brandyberrys, who were profiled in the article, had $18,424 of its income pocketed by governments before its breadwinners even saw their paychecks. Nothing else costs the family so much.
The article was right to suggest that many middle-income families live paycheck to paycheck, unable to save and invest. It was wrong to omit any discussion of one of the principal causes: too much money is being taken by government. It's time Washington politicians and bureaucrats, especially, learned to tighten their belts as other people do.

To the Editor:
The article on the American middle certainly contains truths about why we are in many cases just scraping by. However, I think that most of us simply do not understand the philosophy behind frugality and thrift. We are inundated with consumerism and feel that finding creative ways not to spend money is something to be ashamed of. 
 People have real financial needs. But most of us can get what we want while keeping thrift in mind, without feeling deprived.

HEADLINE: Angst in the Great American Middle

 BODY:
"The American Middle, Just Getting By" (Economic View, Aug. 1), by Louis Uchitelle, discussed the feeling of many middle-class families that they are not sharing in the national bounty as earlier generations did. The column drew many responses.
 
To the Editor:
The typical New York Times reader, comfortable in his Upper West Side apartment in Manhattan, is obviously thirsty for information on how the typical American lives. It must be entertaining to read over fancy coffee at Balducci's about families with the median income of about $50,000, wondering how it might be possible for those of us who are not investment bankers to struggle with our difficult choices.

HEADLINE: Ex-Wife Is Suing Cuba Over a Spy's Deception

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 14

 BODY:
To Ana Margarita Martinez, an avowed anti-Communist Cuban-American, the dashing young jet pilot seemed to have dropped from heaven.
Juan Pablo Roque, a disenchanted officer in the Cuban air force, escaped the Communist-controlled island by swimming to the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in February 1992. He denounced President Fidel Castro of Cuba and quickly became a vocal militant in the Cuban exiles's pro-democracy movement in Miami. 
 He even flew planes for Brothers to the Rescue, a group of Cuban-American pilots who cruised the Florida Straits searching for refugees fleeing Cuba on rafts. He met Ms. Martinez his first year in Miami, in church, and they fell in love. They were married in 1995, as he established himself as one of the city's more visible anti-Communists. He wrote a book called "The Deserter."
It was all a lie. Mr. Roque, in reality a spy for the Cuban Government sent to infiltrate exile groups like Brothers to the Rescue, vanished from Miami on Feb. 23, 1996 and returned to Cuba, four years after his swim to Guantanamo.
The next day, Cuban jets shot down two of the small planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue, just outside Cuban air space in international waters. Law-enforcement authorities in Miami and Cuban exiles blamed Mr. Roque for the deaths of the four fliers.
Cuban exiles who had trusted Mr. Roque felt violated.
To Ms. Martinez, the betrayal was rape. She never would have married him, never would have shared a bed with him, Ms. Martinez said, if she had known the man she thought was an anti-Communist was actually an agent of the Castro Government.
Now, saying that her consent to have sex with the man over the 11 months of their marriage was based on a lie, she is suing the Cuban Government for sexual battery -- rape.
"They used me," Ms. Martinez said.
In a complaint filed earlier this month in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, Ms. Martinez contended that Mr. Roque used her as part of his cover, and that his decision to court and ultimately marry her was done only to establish himself within the exile community.
"She is the fifth victim of the downing" of the two planes, said Jose J. Basulta, president of Brothers to the Rescue. "We were all victimized but perhaps she was the person with whom there was the most cruelty."
When she filed the court papers, Ms. Martinez described the lawsuit as her only way of fighting back. She has since had the marriage annulled -- Mr. Roque, now in Havana, did not contest -- and has not heard from her former husband since he left the country in 1996.
In fact, in an appearance on Cuban television soon after returning, Mr. Roque told an interviewer that the thing he missed most about living in Miami was his sport utility vehicle, said lawyers for Ms. Martinez.
That man was not the one Ms. Martinez thought she had married.
"He was very attentive," she said. "He made me feel protected and secure. He was the kind of man who went to work and came home.
"He wanted a family," she said, and helped her raise two children from a previous marriage. Now she knows it was just part of his disguise.
"She would not have given her consent, had she known" who Mr. Roque really was, said one of her lawyers, Scott W. Leeds of Miami.
"Her 'husband,' " Mr. Leeds said, using the word derisively, "was a spy in the employment of the Cuban Government. She was victimized and was powerless to do anything."
Mr. Roque, who also served as a paid informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and supplied information about Brothers to the Rescue, has been named in a Federal indictment that accuses him and 13 others with spying and trying to sabotage the efforts of Miami's Cuban exiles. He is also charged with conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the attack on the Brothers to the Rescue planes.
One week before the two planes were shot down over the Straits two members of the alleged spy ring were warned not to fly in any Brothers to the Rescue planes near the island between Feb. 24 and Feb. 27, according to the Federal indictment. The warning apparently came from an agent of the Cuban Government.
Two days later, Mr. Roque appeared on CNN from Havana. That was how Ms. Martinez learned where her husband had gone.
"He just disappeared," said Ms. Martinez, an executive secretary in Coral Gables, Fla. "He told me he was going on a business trip, and the next thing I knew he was in Cuba."
Ms. Martinez is hoping for a moral victory and any financial reward is secondary, her lawyers said. Getting money from the Cuban Government has proved difficult in the past.
The families of the four fliers who were killed also sued the Cuban Government and were awarded almost $188 million by the Federal District Court in Miami, money they hoped to recoup from frozen Cuban assets.
But on Wednesday, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, denied the families access to what had seemed the most likely source of damages, $6.2 million in payments from American telephone companies to the Cuban telecommunications company, Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba.
That case, a complicated legal tangle, has been in the headlines in Miami for years.
Ms. Martinez's case, at least on the surface, seems simpler.
In the complaint, her lawyers point out that sex cannot be consensual if it is derived by "fraud and concealment."
According to the complaint, Mr. Roque was under orders from Cuba's Ministry of the Interior to become a member of the Cuban exile community, and -- while leading "a normal life" -- to infiltrate Cuban-American organizations.
As part of his cover, he was told to become active in church, where he met Ms. Martinez. His marriage to her was part of his directive, the complaint said. Meanwhile, he doubled as an informer for the F.B.I, also part of his directive from Cuba, the complaint said.
While the lawsuit does not contend that Mr. Roque was under orders to marry Ms. Martinez "specifically," he used her as part of his disguise, said Mr. Leeds, the lawyer.
Cuban-Americans here either defend the lawsuit or shake their heads at its seeming strangeness.
"I think it's a legitimate way of defending herself," Mr. Basulta said.
Legal experts have said the case will be difficult, since Cuban officials are unlikely to cooperate.
Meanwhile, Cuban exiles have one bit of satisfaction. Wherever Mr. Roque is, knowing the economic straits and shortage of good automobiles on the island, he is probably not driving a quality vehicle.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Wants Water Quality As New Gauge For Cleanup

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency will propose next week that states regulate water pollution by focusing on bodies of water, instead of individual discharges.
Once the state determined the extent to which pollution must be reduced in a body of water, the polluters would receive a quota and could then clean up their emissions or buy the right to discharge into the water from someone else whose cleanup had exceeded a quota. 
 The change, which was announced this morning by President Clinton in his weekly radio address, is based on a mostly unused provision of the 1972 Clean Water Act that requires pollution regulators to assess water conditions and issue discharge restrictions accordingly. Federal and state agencies have generally enforced discharge limits on factories and municipal water treatment plants without measuring the quality of the bodies of water involved.
Environmental regulators have sometimes set limits on pollution by analyzing the body of water, mostly when forced to by lawsuits brought by environmentalists; E.P.A. officials said the new rule would be the first that required the states to act.
Mr. Clinton said that under the new rule, states would have to establish schedules for cleanup or the Federal Government would step in and do it for them.
The proposed rule, which will be open for public comment for 60 days, is available at http://www.epa .gov/OWOW/tmdl/index.html. The agency is also publishing what it says is the first comprehensive state-by-state listing of "impaired" bodies of water, which shows the location and nature of each pollutant.
Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. administrator, said that the new rule would be "the last chapter in how we get to fishable, swimmable waters." Great progress has been made since Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, she said, but five million acres of lakes and 30,000 miles of rivers and shorelines are not fit for fishing or swimming. That comes to 20,000 lakes, wetlands or stretches of river or coast.
Developing the plans could cost the states $1 million to $2 million each, Ms. Browner said. She did not estimate the costs to actually reduce pollution.
Environmentalists hailed the rule but said the trick was not only to assess the water, but to actually force a cleanup. One problem is that much of the pollution comes from unregulated parties, like small farms, as opposed to factories, power plants and sewage treatment plants.
At the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Susan L. Sylvester, the administrator for water division, said that under existing regulations, "we've done a lot with 'point' sources," discharge pipes from factories and sewage treatment plants. But she said that many bodies of water were still polluted by contamination from "non-point sources," like runoff from farms or parking lots, which are not regulated. Farms are sources of pathogens from animal manure, insecticides and crops. Farms are also sources of nutrients, which can promote algae and plant growth in water that kills fish.
Under the E.P.A. proposal, Ms. Sylvester said, states could encourage farmers to relocate manure piles or route storm water around them, and take similar steps to cut runoff. States might even use grant money to finance farm improvements. Or, she said, under a trading arrangement, a municipal sewage plant emitting phosphorous, a nutrient, might pay a farm to reduce its releases of phosphorous, at a lower cost per ton. A plant might even pay a farmer to quit raising animals or quit farming, to the economic advantage of each, she said.
But the success of environmental orders based on bodies of water rather than discharges will depend on the willingness of regulators to follow through, said Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. Mr. Izeman said that such rules had prevailed from 1948 until the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, but had not been enforced, and that even under the Clean Water Act, regulations had been issued in 1979, 1985 and 1992 to allow such enforcement.
"The rules have resulted in beginnings of programs in some states, including listing of impaired water bodies," Mr. Izeman said. "But the program has largely not been implemented."

HEADLINE: Latest Construction Bottleneck: Shortage of Skilled Workers

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
John Carroll is among the most wanted men in New York.
A lean, red-haired electrician at a building project on 42d Street, Mr. Carroll and thousands of skilled construction workers like him are suddenly in short supply as the real estate boom finally ends what many in the industry describe as a brutal seven-year depression. 
 There are no unemployed workers at Mr. Carroll's union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 3, where a short time ago many electricians were out of work for six months out of the year. Many are now working what they call "six 10's," or six days a week for 10 hours a day.
"Right now, there are no men on the bench," Mr. Carroll said. "Everybody's at full employment. You can more or less pick your job. I worked just about every day in July. I've been working for 11 years and I've never been able to do that."
Everything seems to be on a fast track as contractors advertise for workers and scour the union halls for journeymen. There may be fewer skyscrapers under construction today than a decade ago, but there are many residential and commercial buildings being built, as well as billions of dollars's worth of public works and lots of rehabilitation work.
These projects range from an $87 million face lift for the Hilton Hotel on the Avenue of the Americas in midtown to the $237 million renovation of the 1.5 million-square-foot office building at 2 Broadway in lower Manhattan.
And contractors want the work done now, especially in Times Square, where everything from a new 50-story hotel at Broadway and 47th Street to the World Wrestling Federation's theme restaurant at 43d Street are rushing to open by the millennium.
Electrical contractors estimate that there is an immediate need for 1,000 to 2,500 electricians in New York today, and that does not take into account projects starting in the coming year or two. "Things have turned around," said Howard Hirsch, president of Forest Electric, which employs 1,200 electricians and is the city's biggest electrical contractor. "We could use a couple hundred electricians right now, easy."
The labor shortage is most keenly felt among electricians, but builders say it is also hard to find enough sheet metal workers and tin knockers who install the duct work and put together the heating and air-conditioning systems.
"We are facing serious shortages," said Ray McGuire, general counsel for the Contractors Association of Greater New York, a trade association. "There's a shortage of elevator construction mechanics, steamfitters, sheet metal workers and electricians. In the short term, the industry is dealing with it by working a lot of overtime. But that is not a long-term solution, because we see, if anything, increased construction activity in the next two years."
It does not help that the situation is no better in other Northeast cities or elsewhere in the United States. John Kirberg, president of Kirberg Roofing in St. Louis, cannot find enough experienced roofers to expand his family business. Some builders are offering bounties for operating engineers in Boston, car mechanics in Buffalo and electricians in New Orleans, Chicago and Fairfield, Conn. Construction companies in New York are luring badly needed project managers and superintendents from rivals with $20,000 bonuses, while others are starting incentive programs to keep their executives.
"It's been slower to hit the Northeast," said John Grau, chief executive of the National Electrical Contractors Association in Washington. "The rest of the country's been feeling it for two or three years. It's part of the stuff every industry is facing. There are more jobs and fewer people to accept the jobs."
And with the economy now booming in places like Ireland and Poland, skilled workers are no longer immigrating to New York in search of work they cannot find at home. Indeed, some Irish carpenters and electricians have already moved back to Ireland.
With the construction industry still largely unionized in New York, contractors have pushed Local 3 in particular to allow union members from the South and other areas to work here, much as they did in the 1980's. But Thomas Van Arsdale, the longtime leader of the electricians' local, has so far resisted, fearing that the labor shortage is a short-term phenomenon.
"Some locals had a tough time getting rid of out-of-towners in the early 1990's and putting their own people back on the job," said Edward Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. "That's why there's a reluctance to really open up this time. But they'll adjust to the concerns of the contractors."
The recession in the early 1990's, corporate layoffs and an abundance of vacant office buildings and empty apartments choked the life out of the last construction boom.
In 1988 and 1989, there were 15 office towers totaling 10.5 million square feet under construction and 50 residential buildings with 5,800 apartments, according to Yale Robbins Inc., a real estate publishing company. Construction cranes punctured the skyline from one end of Manhattan to the other and employment climbed to 120,800 in 1989, the highest level since 1964.
But by 1993, 35,000 jobs in the construction industry had disappeared. At Local 3, the electricians' union instituted a shared-work program in which members worked for 26 weeks and then stepped aside for unemployed co-workers.
It took years to fill the empty office space. Even as the New York economy recovered in 1996 and 1997, the cost of new construction proved prohibitive. Contractors went out of business, project managers found other lines of work and skilled workers retired, relocated or found unrelated jobs.
"We lost a generation of kids who wanted to be architects, engineers and tradesmen as a result of the recession in the early 1990's," said Louis Coletti, chairman of the Building Trades Employers' Association, a trade group for 1,100 construction companies and 22 associations. "There's no question that human resources are probably the biggest problem confronting the construction industry over the next 10 years."
The turnaround came suddenly.
Workers are finishing the first new office tower in the city since 1992, the Conde Nast tower in Times Square. There are hotels under construction at 47th Street and Broadway and on 44th Street. The steel is being erected for the Reuters Building in Times Square and work should begin soon on the Morgan Stanley tower on Seventh Avenue at 50th Street; the Bertelsmann building on Broadway at 55th Street; the Bear, Stearns tower on Madison at 46th Street, and the Ernst & Young building at 42d Street and Seventh Avenue. According to the Real Estate Board, there is an additional $1.4 billion in major renovation work at 14 buildings, including the Chrysler Building, Radio City Music Hall and the Woolworth Building.
There are building programs at Columbia and New York Universities and a $1 billion terminal project at Kennedy International Airport. Francis X. McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association of New York, estimates that there is a further $5 billion to $7 billion in public works projects in the works.
Although the number of construction workers in New York City jumped by more than 6,000 in the last two years, according to the State Department of Labor, there are still 14,800 fewer people employed today than in 1989.
Contractors say the shortage of electricians, who make $34 an hour, became acute in May and June. "There is such a strong market that many employers are really stretching to get the number of skilled craftsman they need," Mr. Coletti said. "The unions are, if not at 100 percent employment, as close as they've ever been in 20 years."
The demand for labor has been aggravated by changes in the construction industry as well. The corporations and retailers building new homes now demand accelerated schedules. They want a job that used to take, say, 20 weeks done in 10 or 12 weeks. New buildings, as well as renovation projects, also require more electrical work than a decade ago, with computer cables, fiber optic lines and redundant power systems.
"Everything in this city is done in a hurry," said Barry Katzen, president of Katco Electrical, which employs 100 journeymen and apprentices. "Fast track has taken over the business."
That means more workers and lots of overtime, which pleases many workers eager to pay off mortgages, boats and debts accumulated during the lean years. But it is also wearing.
At a hotel project in Times Square, Ed Garvey, a veteran electrician, has been working six eight-hour days a week and expects his workweek to grow to 60 hours in the final push to open before New Year's Eve.
"Instead of 30 guys working for six months, they now load up with 100 guys for two months," Mr. Garvey said. "It's chaos. Chaos means cash, but it also leads to accidents. They're looking to push the jobs a little too much."
To combat the shortage and expand the union share of the labor market, Local 3 and the sheet metal workers' union have organized nonunion contractors, while the Mason Tenders union has recruited immigrant workers. The steamfitters have doubled the size of their apprenticeship programs, but that is a long-term investment because it takes three to five years to attain journeyman status.
Joseph D'Angelo, president of the New York Electrical Contractors Association, said that the group had abandoned efforts to recruit Canadian electricians because immigration laws proved cumbersome and expensive.
Local 3 has taken in unemployed electricians from Long Island as well as 300 temporary college helpers, but it has been reluctant to open up to travelers, electricians with union cards from out-of-town locals. Union leaders say that the problem arose this summer, in part, because so many workers were on vacation. But the local may soon have a no choice but to recruit workers from other areas.
"We've requested that the unions bring in travelers, or out-of-towners, to make up the shortfall," said Ken Colao, chief executive of York Hunter, a construction management company. "So far, there hasn't been any agreement."
Meanwhile, builders have had to make do. Milo E. Riverso, president of the School Construction Authority, said that sheet metal delivered to some job sites lies unused for days because there are not enough skilled workers to go around.
Some contractors have turned down jobs. Only two of eight electrical contractors responded to requests for bids from one hotel developer, according to Raymond Quartararo, president of Quartararo & Associates, a construction manager on the Ernst & Young building and a project at 770 Broadway.
Ed Cettina, first vice president at Tishman Construction, which is building the Conde Nast, Reuters and Morgan Stanley buildings, said his company had resorted to dividing the electrical contract for each project among several subcontractors rather than relying on a single company.
"You don't want to get into a situation where you have a ton of overtime at the end of a job," he said. "It wears people out and you don't have the ability to bring in a fresh crew. They don't exist."

HEADLINE: Ex-Enemies, Ecuador and Peru Shore Up a Strategic Friendship

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Aug. 14

 BODY:
As recently as one year ago, Peru and Ecuador were preparing to go to war -- something they have done with unfortunate regularity ever since the Peruvian Navy blockaded Ecuador's principal port in 1860.
But in a sign that the squabbling neighbors are finally learning to live together, President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador finished a three-day visit through Peru on Friday -- complete with banquets, honorary university degrees, tropical river fishing and a triumphal tour through downtown Lima arm-in-arm with President Alberto K. Fujimori. 
 Troubled by a failing economy and increasing protests at home, Mr. Mahuad came to Peru to consolidate the gains won in October when the two countries signed a peace treaty brokered by the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile to settle a longstanding border dispute over a 50-mile swath of the Condor Mountains.
The two Presidents were jeered at on Friday as they drove through the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon by hundreds of protesters who say the treaty gives Ecuador too many commercial rights in their region. But most experts called the visit a success that augurs well for future relations.
Mr. Fujimori and Mr. Mahuad dressed in matching red sport shirts and donned Indian headdresses to pose for photographers in a dugout canoe on an Amazon tributary. And they met with residents of the jungle town of Sarameriza to announce the construction of a port project.
"Patriotism searches for development," Mr. Fujimori said as Mr. Mahuad smiled widely. Then Mr. Fujimori called for a show of hands of those opposed to opening river commerce to Ecuadoreans. No one voted against the Peruvian President, Mr. Fujimori noted, "not even Mahuad."
It was a backhanded slap at political leaders of the area who oppose the thaw with Ecuador.
"Our friend President Mahuad is Arab, and I am half Japanese," Mr. Fujimori said, "but we speak the same language."
The two Presidents announced an assortment of joint projects, including the extension of parks, construction of river port installations, bridges, roads, forestry projects, schools and clinics that will total up to $3 billion over several years. They also signed a free-trade agreement that will remove tariffs from 585 agricultural, consumer and industrial goods.
The October treaty sets a permanent border along the Cordillera del Condor mountain range, as Peru always demanded. Ecuador gained access to a piece of territory on the Peruvian side to commemorate its war dead at a memorial site in Tiwinza, as well as navigation and trade rights in the Peruvian river ports of Sarameriza and Pijuayal.
The last time the two countries went to war -- in 1995 -- 100 people were killed in four weeks of conflict. The fighting led to an expensive arms buildup in both Peru and Ecuador. Experts say peace will allow them to reduce the size of their militaries, which will help their economies and strengthen civilian rule.

HEADLINE: High-Rise Answer to Brooklyn's Courtroom Problem

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
After seeking for 15 years to escape cramped and outmoded quarters in Brooklyn, state and city court officials say they have finally found the answer: a 32-story, $350 million courthouse that would rise in the commercially reviving heart of Downtown Brooklyn.
Financial, commercial and educational interests near the proposed site, including Chase Manhattan Bank, have strongly opposed the plan, but these normally influential interests now have indicated that they are resigned to it. They say they will no longer fight the proposal, which the Giuliani administration supports. Court officials and the building's private developer will seek the required approvals from the City Planning Commission and the City Council. 
 The critics had contended that the high-rise courthouse, at 330 Jay Street, which would be Brooklyn's second-tallest building and an extension of the thriving Metrotech Center office complex, would bring traffic and security problems and dilute the area's image as a business center.
They said that Metrotech, a 10-block complex that includes seven buildings built during the last decade, was meant to attract corporate office tenants to Downtown Brooklyn, and that leasing one of its remaining prime sites to the government for a courthouse would betray that concept.
Commercial office space would occupy six stories near the top of the brick-and-stone building, whose height of 473 feet (taller than a normal 32-story building because courtrooms are higher than offices) would make it second in Brooklyn to the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building, which is 512 feet tall.
Court officials responded that the security concerns were unwarranted and that the plans included steps to reduce the effects of added traffic. They said they would support more ideas to minimize traffic, and emphasized that the proposed courthouse would add more than 70 desperately needed courtrooms. The new building would house the criminal part of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn and the entire Kings County Family Court.
"This is the linchpin of our Brooklyn plan," Ronald Younkins, director of court facilities management for the New York State Office of Court Administration.
The criminal section of Supreme Court, in which felony cases from serious assaults to murders are prosecuted, is now split inefficiently between two court buildings in Downtown Brooklyn that court officials say badly need upgrading. The Family Court, whose docket includes cases of child abuse, domestic violence and crimes committed by juveniles, is in a dingy, crowded old courthouse that judges say hardly engenders respect for the court system among troubled families.
Most of the space to be freed up when felony and Family Court cases are moved to the new courthouse will be renovated and used for civil cases now scattered among cramped and often makeshift courtrooms in three downtown Brooklyn office buildings. Those courtrooms are part of the city's Civil Court and Housing Court and the civil branch of State Supreme Court, and they were carved out in the office buildings as the courts expanded beyond the space that was available in regular courthouses.
"What were created as temporary have taken on a permanence we never intended," said Michael L. Pesce, an administrative judge of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. "In the effort to build a new facility, we were shunted from site to site over 15 years."
Justice Pesce said the latest site is at least the sixth to be considered for a new Brooklyn courthouse. Efforts at the other sites have failed for reasons like community opposition, difficulty in acquiring property and inadequate size. The plot at 330 Jay Street now has a seven-story building, used by the City Human Resources Administration, that would be razed.
Justice Pesce said the proposed courthouse was not out of keeping with its surroundings, noting that the existing Family Court, at Adams Street and Tech Place, abuts the site of the planned new courthouse and that the existing Supreme Court Building is just across Adams Street from the Family Court. The courthouses "have been there for decades," he said, and Metrotech and other developments were built near them.
A spokeswoman for the developer of Metrotech and of the proposed courthouse, Forest City Ratner Companies, similarly defended the courthouse proposal as suitable for its surroundings.
"Forest City Ratner has a billion dollars invested in Metrotech and would not do anything to endanger it," the spokeswoman, Michele de Milly, told a reporter during a meeting last week at which Community Board 2 in Brooklyn approved the courthouse proposal on the condition that its "significant adverse traffic impacts" be fully addressed and that steps to combat them be submitted for community approval.
Ms. de Milly said that task forces representing public agencies and civic groups that sought a location for a new courthouse "landed on this as the best site," and Forest City Ratner, a major developer in Downtown Brooklyn, agreed to go along, leading to the proposed court building, designed by Perkins Eastman Architects.
But various occupants of existing Metrotech buildings vigorously disagreed with the choice, as did Polytechnic University, which is across Jay Street from the courthouse site and was a leading force in originating the concept of Metrotech Center. Also objecting was Joshua L. Muss, the developer of Renaissance Plaza, a separate complex comprising an office tower and a Marriott hotel that opened last year next to the proposed court site.
The objecting Metrotech occupants included Chase Manhattan, which employs more than 5,000 people in back office and technology operations at Metrotech; the Securities Industry Automation Corporation, which processes trades for the financial markets, and Keyspan Energy, which has its headquarters at Metrotech.
"We do not look favorably upon the plans to build the new courthouse," said Charlotte Gilbert-Biro, a spokeswoman for Chase Manhattan. "But we don't intend to vocally oppose it," she said, though "we expect the developer to live up to his obligations in safeguarding the quality" of the area for businesses.
Spokesmen for the Securities Industry Automation Corporation and Keyspan said that their companies still believed that another area of Downtown Brooklyn was better suited for a new courthouse but that the companies did not plan to testify against the proposal before the Planning Commission and City Council.
David C. Chang, president of Polytechnic University, said he would express his concerns if those bodies "solicited our opinion." Among those concerns, he said, were the possible worries of prospective students and their parents about "a major criminal court across the street."
Mr. Muss originally thought the site "would be a great stimulus for the area as an office building," said his spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein. But about a month ago, he said, after "a great many discussions with the elected officials involved," Mr. Muss came to accept that "the government wanted it there and that there was a need to balance the need for court expansion with the desire for developers to build other commercial ventures."
Court officials and Forest City Ratner hope to gain the required approvals by the end of this year and to complete construction in 2002. Forest City Ratner would finance the construction and the city would lease the space for the courts.
The site is two blocks from the Federal Court in Brooklyn, where a long-planned expansion calls for construction of a 14-story addition. It has been delayed by financing problems.

HEADLINE: Japan Admitting, and Fighting, Child Abuse

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: CHIBA, Japan

 BODY:
What Miho Kakuno hated worse than the beatings was the bathtub treatment. It took place once or twice a week, even in winter.
Miho says that she and her younger brother were placed in the tub, while their stepfather filled it with cold water and covered them with a wooden top, leaving only a couple of inches of air for them to breathe. They could never push off the cover, she said, because there was something heavy on top. 
 Now, several years later, Miho, 12, is one of the lucky ones. Her grandmother eventually won custody of her, and she is living quietly trying to recover her equilibrium. Her brother, Hiroki, now 10, eventually ran away and, like his sister, lives in a location that is being hidden from their parents.
Miho and Hiroki's story of abuse is just one of many that have come to light as Japan begins to confront a problem many Japanese did not believe existed. Japan's unusually strong families are being strained, weakened by the long recession and record unemployment, which have undermined stability in the home. In addition to economic pressures, divorce rates and remarriages are rising, which experts say hasled to abusive behavior by some stepparents.
"In pediatric circles we thought there wasn't much child abuse and that we were different from the United States because our culture was different," said Dr. Seiji Sakai, a child psychiatrist and director at the Center for Child Abuse Prevention. "The single biggest problem was society realizing that there is child abuse."
But efforts by doctors, lawyers and welfare workers, as well as a recent campaign by the Mainichi Shimbun, a national newspaper, have begun to raise awareness. Recently, Parliament focused for the first time on the increase in child abuse cases by questioning bureaucrats and ministers. Lawmakers are considering relaxing rigid laws that give considerable power and autonomy to families and parents.
Statistics suggest a rise in child abuse, although experts are uncertain whether more is actually occurring or whether more instances are now being reported.
"Child abuse is on the rise in Japan," said Machiko Ayukyo, a lawyer who handles child abuse cases and is a director of the Center for Child Abuse Prevention. "Superficially, it seems the trend is rising," she said, because more is coming to light. "I feel that this has been happening for a very long time and it is finally just coming to the surface," she continued.
This year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare commissioned its first child abuse survey. It also plans to start specialized training for social workers in child abuse, to provide increased psychological support for abused children and to distribute a video to publicize the problem.
Newspapers are also increasing their coverage of individual cases, like one in which a couple left their 5-month-old infant in a coin locker one night last May, and went to eat at a nearby noodle shop. A passer-by heard the infant's cries and summoned the police.
Traditionally, the police rarely investigated accusations of child abuse or wife beating, believing these were issues best left to the head of the household -- meaning the father or grandfather. Authorities are now struggling to figure out when and how to intervene.
Government statistics show that in 1997, there were 5,352 reported cases of child abuse, a 30 percent rise from the previous year. But statistics may not present a full picture because the Government has not traditionally kept track of cases and few are reported to authorities.
"These figures are just the tip of the iceberg," said Satoru Saito, the director of the Institute of Family Functioning in Tokyo, who said that changes in the family are leading to more child abuse. "The family's relationship with relatives and the community is not so close anymore. Parents rarely seek support outside and they tend to be isolated from society."
Dr. Sakai, the psychiatrist, says that doctors often see injured children but do not investigate enough. A couple once brought in a 5-month-old baby who died from a cerebral hemorrhage -- but even after an autopsy, the death was not attributed to child abuse but rather to sudden infant death syndrome.
He also cannot forget the case of a young girl, now 7, whose parents he described as highly educated and well-to-do. They brought her to the hospital with a bone fracture when she was 6 months old. Then a year later, they brought her in with a cerebral hemorrhage.
Normally, a child would have died from the injury, but this girl lived. Now, protected in a special school for the handicapped, she is paralyzed and mentally retarded.
"I'm shocked that the second time, when the child had a hemorrhage, the doctor didn't report it as child abuse," Dr. Sakai said. "We have tried to ask about what happened and why, but the problem is that the mother doesn't speak up."
For Miho and Hiroki, the two children held down in the bathtub, the problems began when their father died and their mother, Mieko, quickly moved to the distant city of Nagano from Osaka to live with Kiichiro Kakuno, a small-time shop owner who was tall, handsome and charming.
Mieko's mother, Misako Ishibashi, objected to the relationship, partly because Mr. Kakuno was married. But Mieko persisted and eventually married Mr. Kakuno, and Mrs. Ishibashi gradually began to wonder what was happening to her grandchildren.
Mieko sometimes visited with her children, and Hiroki once came with a big bruise on his head and what looked like a small burn on his back. Mieko said that Hiroki had stumbled on the street. When it was time to climb into the car to return to Nagano, he wailed.
Then one day in 1992, Mrs. Ishibashi received a call from Miho's nursery school teacher. Could she please come to Nagano to see what was happening?
When she arrived, she was shown two large volumes of photographs that the teachers had taken of her grandchildren, both with bandages, bruises and cuts all over their bodies. In one picture, Hiroki's face was so black and blue that it was swollen like the moon, Mrs. Ishibashi said.
"We were overwhelmed," she recalled.
They waited until Mieko came to pick up Miho and took her to a nearby restaurant to ask her about the children. Mieko dodged their questions, repeatedly changed the subject and then left.
The Kakunos could not be reached for comment. They have no lawyer, and no listed phone number in the Tokyo area. They have refused to accept court documents and have not appeared in court. Two years ago, Mr. Kakuno denied all accusations of child abuse in questioning by a lawyer. Asked about the bathtub treatments, he told the lawyer that he was teaching his stepdaughter Miho how to swim, court documents say, and he said he never tortured her.
The children's grandparents went to the local police, who told them that unless they could prove how the injuries occurred, the police could do nothing. Moreover, if Mrs. Ishibashi were to take the children away, she would be arrested for kidnapping. When she called the local child consultation center, which has the power to shelter an abused child, she was told that even suing in the courts would be very difficult.
Japan has tried to keep its family structure relatively intact with laws that give enormous authority to the family. The tradeoff has been that abused children are sometimes trapped with abusive parents because authorities do not want to interfere.
For centuries, Japanese believed that children were like possessions and that parental authority was virtually supreme.
"In Japan, the right of the family head was very strong," said Toru Arichi, a professor of family law at Kyushu University. Until the 1860's, he said, "When a father unintentionally killed a child, by being too strict or too violent, he was not questioned."
Even now, authorities do not know how to handle mistreatment by parents. On May 15, a 23-month-old girl was brought unconscious to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. She was only 11 pounds, less than half the average weight of a typical 2-year-old.
Her mother, who was 18, was arrested after admitting that she had not fed her baby much that month and had given her nothing during the previous few days. The mother had separated from her husband after giving birth, and had a nighttime job, but simply had lost interest in caring for the child.
After deliberating a court sent the mother to a juvenile home for a few weeks of evaluation.
Even when authorities are aware of mistreatment, it often takes years before the children can be rescued because of rigid laws that protect the right of parents. In the case of Miho and Hiroki, it took about nine years for their grandmother to win custody of both of them.
Rigid laws coupled with a cultural deference to the parents prolonged the agony for Miho and Hiroki, even though neighbors repeatedly reported evidence of abuse to authorities.
"I hated everything," said Miho, who seems shy and hesitant throughout a long interview.
The first time she ran away, with the help of a teacher, school director and a police official, she was kept for a few days at the local child consultation center. But she was returned home when her mother and stepfather demanded her back.
In 1994, the family moved to Tokyo, and after Miho began playing with a friend downstairs she ran away to her friend's family, who reported the problem to the local authorities. But she went back home soon after because the authorities declined to help her. When she tried to escape again, the child center recommended that she not be returned home. But since it had no legal authority to keep her, Mr. Kakuno was able to collect the child.
Then, after months of silence, a neighbor reported to a child center that Hiroki had been found one morning wandering near a large train station in muddy pajamas. Miho secretly had helped her brother escape.
The child consultation center ultimately protected Hiroki and called a lawyer who helped Mrs. Ishibashi sue her daughter for custody.
A year after Hiroki left, Miho escaped. She had spent many hours plotting. She had been to school, where she told her teachers about her plan, and then she went to a friend's house. She prepared clothes and a small bag and left it with them.
She had once tried to leave by the front door, but had been caught. This time, she tried the window from her third-floor room. She piled up furniture in front of the window to climb out. She climbed sideways on the veranda to get to a hallway window, which she entered to go down the stairs. She took her in-line skates with her so that she could make a swift getaway over the hills
As she recalls the whole period of mistreatment, Miho gets a faraway look in her eyes, and it is clear that it still haunts her.
"When I first got here, I was a little worried," she said. "I worried about whether I can belong here, about whether I can survive here, and about what I should do if Dad or Mom and those kinds of people come here to get me."

HEADLINE: Lane Kirkland, Who Led Labor In Difficult Times, Is Dead at 77

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SERRIN 

 BODY:
Lane Kirkland, who was president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. from 1979 to 1995, a troubled period for American workers, and who resigned after an angry revolt of union presidents, died yesterday morning at his home in Washington. He was 77.
The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Irena Kirkland. 
 Together, Mr. Kirkland and George Meany, his predecessor as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and his longtime friend and mentor, led the American labor movement for nearly 45 years.
While Mr. Kirkland was serving almost 16 years as president of the labor federation, the American economy and the workplace experienced drastic change. Plants closed, jobs were lost, union membership shrank and union importance diminished. The growing concern for labor's future in the United States, which contributed to Mr. Kirkland's downfall, contrasted with its relatively powerful influence abroad, an influence that Mr. Kirkland helped to foster.
Mr. Kirkland was an ardent anti-Communist who was proud of his organization's efforts to assist the Solidarity movement in bringing democracy to Poland by any means it could. During the 1970's and 80's, he worked tirelessly to help Solidarity topple the Communist government, surreptitiously channeling organization money and fax machines to the movement led by Lech Walesa.
"The success of Solidarity owes a lot to Lane," said Henry A. Kissinger, a close friend of Mr. Kirkland. "He supported it with funds and organizers, and he had a big effect on American policy makers."
But leaders of several big unions forced him from office, saying that he lacked the same intense interest when it came to energizing American workers and winning them over to trade unionism.
Although the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has become more vigorous since Mr. Kirkland's resignation, it remains unclear whether the American labor movement can ever recapture its former power. When Mr. Kirkland assumed office, 24 percent of the workers in the United States belonged to unions. When he resigned, the figure was 15.5 percent. Today, it is 13.9 percent.
Joseph Lane Kirkland -- everyone called him Lane -- was born on March 12, 1922, in Camden, S.C., the son of Randolph Withers Kirkland, a cotton buyer, and the former Louise Richardson. A great-great-grandfather, Thomas Jefferson Withers, had signed the Confederate declaration of secession, and Mr. Kirkland often referred to the Civil War as the "War of Northern Aggression."
Mr. Kirkland was raised in Newberry, S.C., where he attended public schools, and where many of his classmates were sons and daughters of mill workers. "They'd leave school to work in the mills, and conditions were rather bad," he once told The Washington Post. "If they'd fire a guy, he'd lose his house; he'd lose everything. There's no better way to get an education in becoming liberal than to be exposed to those sorts of things."
Before the United States entered World War II, Mr. Kirkland unsuccessfully tried to join the Canadian military. In 1940, he became a cadet on the S.S. Liberator, a merchant marine ship. The following year, he entered the United States Merchant Marine Academy. Upon graduation in 1942, he served as a chief mate aboard American ships transporting war materiel, sailing to South America, the beachheads at Sicily and Anzio, and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific. Since then, he kept his membership in the Masters, Mates, and Pilots Union.
After the war, Mr. Kirkland entered the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, graduating in 1948. He then worked as a researcher with the American Federation of Labor, becoming a specialist on pensions and Social Security. A skilled writer, he was on loan in 1948 to the Democratic Party to write speeches for Alben W. Barkley, President Harry S. Truman's running mate. In 1952 and 1956 he wrote campaign speeches for Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic Presidential candidate.
He always impressed Mr. Meany, who had become president of the A.F.L. in 1952 and of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in 1955 when the labor federation merged with the Congress of Industrial Organizations.
In 1958, Mr. Kirkland became director of research and education for the International Union of Operating Engineers, but in 1960 he returned to the labor federation as Mr. Meany's executive assistant. He directed the organization's daily operations and often represented it on Capitol Hill and at the White House.
Always seeking accommodation, he helped resolve jurisdictional disputes among the federation's unions -- then a difficult problem in labor -- and helped to settle the mass-transit strike in New York City in 1966. He pushed strongly for a fair employment practices provision in the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
In May 1969, Mr. Meany selected Mr. Kirkland to be secretary-treasurer, the No. 2 position in the organization. His opposition to the policies of the Nixon Administration earned him a place on the President's notorious "enemies list."
Mr. Kirkland continued his intense interest in international affairs, maintaining that they were too important to be left to "a tight incestuous breed of economists and diplomats." He strongly supported American involvement in the Vietnam War and was instrumental in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s refusal to support Senator George S. McGovern as the Democratic candidate for President in 1972. In 1976 he was a founder of the Committee on the Present Danger, which demanded larger military budgets to confront the Soviet Union.
In the 1970's, as Mr. Meany's health declined, Mr. Kirkland often ran the labor organization. In September 1979, Mr. Meany, then 85, announced his retirement, and in November Mr. Kirkland was named president even though he remained remote to many union members.
In his acceptance speech Mr. Kirkland set a tone for his administration, making clear, in his tart manner, the importance that he placed on getting nonaffiliated unions to join the A.F.L.-C.I.O. He said "all sinners belong in the church" and unaffiliated unions should renounce "petty personal or pecuniary considerations, or ancient and tedious grudges." He regarded as his biggest achievement persuading the auto workers, the mine workers, the longshoremen and warehousemen, and the teamsters to join or rejoin the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Mr. Kirkland was proud of other changes under his leadership. He placed the first woman on the labor organization's executive council and increased the participation of blacks and Hispanics. He agreed to establish an institute to train new organizers. He also continued the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s vast foreign operations in Europe, Africa, South America and Asia.
But huge problems emerged with his leadership.
Mr. Kirkland was, as is said in the garment trades, an inside guy, not an outside guy. He often seemed detached, sometimes arrogant, incapable of banter or pleasantries. He was given to withering ripostes, and seemed to detest the news media, often refusing interviews and requests to appear on television, even on Labor Day, saying he found it demeaning. He said reporters should periodically be condemned to their morgues to read their clippings, an exercise he believed would show the shallowness and inaccuracy of much of journalism.
Critics said that Mr. Kirkland spent too much time on international affairs and not enough time on domestic concerns and that he linked American labor too frequently with conservative unions in foreign countries. They also maintained that in its foreign policy, Mr. Kirkland's organization too often allied itself with American corporations. In 1993, when Congress debated a bill to ban permanent replacement workers, Mr. Kirkland was in Europe. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. spent more money on international affairs than on organizing, civil rights and workers' health and safety.
At the same time, fundamental change was occurring in the American economy. In the 1980's, one industrial plant after another closed, and whole communities were in distress. The service economy, with little union organization, expanded. Jobs were lost to new processes and foreign competition. Strike after strike was lost, including one by the air traffic controllers in 1981, and labor suffered numerous defeats in Congress, including its failure in 1993 to block passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which unions opposed because of a concern over losing jobs in the United States. In 1994, Republicans won control of the House and the Senate for the first time in four decades.
Through all of this, organized labor failed to expand its membership, and Mr. Kirkland's critics in the union movement said he lacked the vision to reverse the slide.
In early 1995, an open revolt broke out, a remarkable event for labor unions, whose culture stresses loyalty, discipline and the private settlement of problems. Not since John L. Lewis and others left the A.F.L. in 1935 to form what became the C.I.O. had such a raucous, public fight occurred in American unionism.
The revolt was led by Gerald McEntee, president of the municipal workers; John J. Sweeney, then president of service employees; Richard Trumka, then president of the mine workers; and Ronald Carey, then president of the teamsters.
Mr. McEntee doggedly engaged Mr. Kirkland in debates. Union leaders, acting anonymously, condemned Mr. Kirkland in statements to reporters and he was criticized at a February 1995 executive council meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla.
Mr. Sweeney twice asked Mr. Kirkland to retire. He knew that President Clinton had offered Mr. Kirkland the ambassadorship to Poland, and he suggested that the union leader accept it and make way for new leadership. But Mr. Kirkland, always a stubborn man, refused to step aside.
In June that year, with presidents of some 20 unions opposing him, Mr. Kirkland said he would resign in August, becoming the only president in the American Federation of Labor's history to be forced to step down in this century. Thomas R. Donahue, the A.F.L-C.I.O.'s secretary-treasurer, and Mr. Kirkland's choice to be his successor, announced his candidacy for the presidency. But in October, Mr. Sweeney, the leader of an opposition slate, defeated Mr. Donahue.
After his resignation, Mr. Kirkland was rarely in the pubic eye. He never forgot or forgave Mr. Sweeney and the other insurrectionists, saying that they engaged in "mendacity and falsehood." He said the labor movement had always had difficulties, given its many enemies, but was built for "heavy weather." And he took pride in the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, believing that he and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had helped bring it about.
Mr. Kirkland was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Survivors include Mr. Kirkland's wife, the former Irena Neumann, a German concentration camp survivor whom he married in 1973, and five children from his first marriage, to Edith Draper Hollyday, which ended in divorce in 1972. The children are Blair Hollyday, Lucy Alexander, Louise Richardson, Edith Hollyday and Katharine, all of whom live in the Washington area.
He is also survived by five grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
Mr. Kirkland had broad interests that included gardening, gin rummy, wine, jazz, modern art, archeology and hieroglyphics. He was a constant smoker, and a trademark, along with a sharp tongue, was a long, yellowed holder with a burning cigarette.
In scores of articles about him over 20 years, only one, in 1984 in The Washington Post, showed him at ease. He was portrayed in his home, in Washington, playing "Amazing Grace" on his Marine Band harmonica, in the manner of a sailor at sea, with his dachshund Stanley howling in delighted accompaniment.

Seasons Go in Search Of Complete Games

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Earlier this season, the advance scout for the Anaheim Angels was in Philadelphia when Curt Schilling was trying to add to his streak of complete games.
"He was going for his fifth or sixth complete game in a row," the scout, Matt Keough, related. "Everybody was going crazy. Not to take anything from Mr. Schilling; he's a dynamic pitcher. But I had to laugh because that would have been a customary month for us." 
 Keough was a member of the Oakland Athletics' starting rotation in 1980 when he and his fellow starters pitched the astounding total of 94 complete games, including 20 by Keough, 24 by Mike Norris and 28 by Rick Langford. By that season, complete games were already in decline elsewhere in the major leagues, but the complete game had not yet become an endangered species.
It is that today. Just check the Mets' total of complete games. Through 118 games, that total is zero, as in 0, as in none. No team has ever gone through a season without a complete game.
In 1995, the Colorado Rockies, notorious for their inept pitching staffs, had one complete game. Bryan Rekar pitched it in his second major league start, beating Philadelphia.
"So far I don't think it has hurt us in any way," Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said of the team's absence of complete games. "It doesn't bother me that we haven't and whether we get one or not."
Phillips suggested that Schilling might have some questions about his eight complete games. If he hadn't thrown all of the innings needed to finish those games, Phillips said, "he might be healthy now" instead of being on the disabled list with a sore shoulder. "Is that a bigger factor than complete games," the Mets' executive asked, "that mentality of throwing pitches when you're tired?"
The number of complete games has been in decline since the late 1970's. For six successive seasons and seven of eight in the 70's, major league pitchers finished what they started from 1,009 times to 1,089. But the total fell steadily for the most part, reaching a low of 266 in 1997 before rising to 302 last year.
The National League reached its all-time low in 1996 with 127, and the American League followed the next season with its all-time low of 123. Both leagues are now headed for totals even lower than those.
The N.L. had 86 completes games before yesterday, a rate that would produce 121 for the season. The A.L. had 72, which would translate to a total of 101, less than two handfuls more than the 1980 Athletics had.
"I think the tendency is going to be toward fewer complete games," Tony La Russa, the St. Louis Cardinals' manager, said. "You have younger starters, and they're not prepared to get deep in the game. You also have just about everybody trying to build a bullpen. They put as much interest in building a bullpen as the starting rotation."
Addressing La Russa's first point, about young pitchers, Omar Minaya, the Mets' senior assistant general manager, said: "The industry as a whole is a little bit conservative with young arms and goes by pitch counts. That creates a psychology where when the pitcher gets into the fifth and sixth inning, he starts thinking he's tired."
The last thing player development people want to do, Minaya added, is overuse a pitcher. "You cherish arms when you have them," he said. "You don't want to burn them out."
On La Russa's second point, building bullpens, just about everyone interviewed on the subject said teams these days put their best arms in their bullpens.
Concurring that the best pitching prospects are turned into closers, Larry Dierker, the Houston Astros' manager and a former major league starter, said, "It used to be all the best pitchers were groomed to be starters and the older guys who couldn't go nine anymore were put in the bullpen and the best were made the closers."
Phillips readily acknowledged that he deliberately set out to build a strong relief corps for this season, then bolstered it with recent trades.
"We knew last winter we couldn't make trades or sign free agents to build our starting rotation to be better or equal to the Braves' rotation," Phillips said, "so we thought we'd focus on having a competent starting rotation with a very deep and strong bullpen."
Economics also enters into the equation. "If you're going to put together a strong rotation or a strong bullpen, it's more cost effective to do the bullpen," Phillips said.
In 1987 the Minnesota Twins won the World Series with a pitching staff that during the season produced 16 complete games, fewest in the A.L. This season the Twins have seven complete games, two more than the Yankees' strong starting rotation.
"I certainly don't want to go on the field," Tom Kelly, the Twins' manager then and now, said, meaning he would be happy never to have to remove his starter. "I think most managers would like to see the complete games. Then again, the general manager and the owner are paying some people out there to get some people out. So if you have the opportunity, why not use him? I'm not saying use him just for the sake of using him. But there's no reason to let a guy just sit out there."
Dierker has gained a reputation for encouraging his starters to pitch nine.
"I like them to finish if they want to, and I want them to want to," the Astros' manager said. "If I can tell there's any hesitation and he's looking down there at Billy Wagner in the bullpen, I'm not going to try to teach them lessons in complete-game pitching at the expense of losing games."
Beyond the existence of the sophisticated and carefully constructed bullpens, which La Russa had much to do with inspiring when he managed Oakland in the late 80's and early 90's, managers have practical considerations.
"There are several factors," La Russa said. "A lot of pitchers take the decision away from you because they're throwing so many pitches. Leaving them in in the eighth or ninth, you're risking that the fatigue will cause them to make a mistake and cost you the game. Or they'll reach back for something more and get hurt." The second factor, he said, is that "the fresh specialist generally gives you a better chance than a tiring starter." And three, "If you have a horse, you want him firing late in the season when everything is more important. You can burn out your starter by pushing him throughout the season. You look to save him pitches."
Doug Melvin of Texas added another factor -- agents.
"I recently had an agent call me and tell me he didn't want one of our pitchers to go to winter ball because he'd have too many innings," Melvin related. "He's going to have about 160. The agent thought pitching another 50 innings would be too much."
Dierker, who said he probably never would have wanted to be a closer, nevertheless thinks the existence of the closer has improved the game. But, he added, "You can fall into the trap of using the guy all the time." He cited the Astros' experience last week in Atlanta, where John Rocker, the Braves' closer, pitched the ninth inning of each game of the three-game series, preserving a victory each night.
"The first day he threw 96, then 93 the second day, then 90," Dierker said, referring to the velocity of Rocker's fastball. "I felt sorry for him. He was happy. He threw a lot of breaking balls and he won. But if I had been Bobby Cox, I wouldn't have used him the third day. I thought they were abusing him, bringing him in that third day."

HEADLINE: COVER STORY;
The Women Who Wrote the Songs That Made Grown Men Sigh

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
One of the greatest movie songs ever written, "A Fine Romance," was introduced by Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in the 1936 musical romp "Swing Time." In a snowy mountain retreat, two sweethearts whose budding romance has been temporarily sidetracked taunt each other with some of the sauciest erotic challenges to be found in a 30's pop song. In a witty sexual duel that has a jaunty melody by Jerome Kern and funny, incisive lyrics by Dorothy Fields, the woman more than holds her own.
"We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes/But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes," goes a lyric in which Rogers's character laments, "I've never mussed the crease in your blue serge pants." Racy stuff for 1936. 
 Examined outside its movie context, "A Fine Romance" stands as a rarity in traditional American pop: a woman's frank, unblushing confession of physical desire. No wistful moon-June-spoon, pining for Prince Charming here. The lady wants action.
A similar mixture of wit and spunk gives the Kern-Fields-Oscar Hammerstein 2d classic "I Won't Dance" its charm. Fields put the spice in Hammerstein's concept for this song, from the 1935 movie "Roberta." The narrator informs her attractive dancing partner that when they do the Continental, "this feeling isn't purely mental; for heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos." She tops off her flirtatious warning by declaring, "So if I hold you in my arms/ I won't dance!"
Why should it be that Fields, the author of such scintillating verses, was the only female songwriter in the pre-rock era to gain full admittance into an elite men's club peopled by the likes of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins and Richard Rodgers? The answer probably has something to do with outworn notions about show business's being too rough-and-tumble for a respectable woman to enter. Yet, paradoxically, most of the memorable stars of the Broadway musical -- from Fanny Brice to Ethel Merman to Mary Martin, Carol Channing, Barbra Streisand and Betty Buckley -- have been women.
The issue of inequality among songwriters is indirectly addressed in an American Masters program, "Yours for a Song: The Women of Tin Pan Alley," a one-hour special that has its premiere on Wednesday at 9 P.M. on PBS, with Ms. Buckley as the host. This revealing examination of female songwriters from the golden age of American popular song fittingly gives Fields, who died in 1974, the most coverage.
But it also goes out of its way to examine the careers of several other successful female composers, including Kay Swift, Dana Suesse and Ann Ronell. These women, who lived into the late 1980's and early 90's, may not have entered the songwriters' pantheon, but each left behind memorable songs, and each enjoyed a rewarding career as a professional songwriter.
Fields's output was remarkable, both in quantity (about 500 song lyrics) and longevity (five decades), by almost any standard. The daughter of the vaudeville comedian and producer Lew Fields, and also the sister of the stage and screen writers Joseph and Herbert Fields, she was born in 1904 and grew up in New York show business circles.
With the composer Jimmy McHugh, Dorothy Fields wrote her first hit, "I Can't Give You Anything but Love," for the revue "Blackbirds of 1928." The two went on to write "Exactly Like You," "On the Sunny Side of the Street," "Don't Blame Me" and "I'm in the Mood for Love," among others.
When the Depression threatened to close down Broadway, Fields joined the songwriting migration to the more lucrative fields of Hollywood, where the sound era gave birth to the movie musical. There she worked with several composers, most notably Jerome Kern. Their auspicious teaming reached a pinnacle in "Swing Time," whose classic ballad, "The Way You Look Tonight," won an Academy Award for best song.
Later Fields collaborated with her brother Herbert on the librettos for several Broadway musicals, including "Annie Get Your Gun." And in 1966, with Cy Coleman, who was 25 years her junior, she turned out the tough, slangy, utterly contemporary lyrics for the musical "Sweet Charity."
Kay Swift, a Juilliard-trained musician who performed in a classical trio and worked as a rehearsal pianist before diving into songwriting, was a comet in New York's bohemian social whirl of the 1920's and 30's and had a romantic relationship with that most eligible of bachelors, George Gershwin. Swift was 34 when she had her first hit song, "Can't We Be Friends?" (with lyrics by Paul James, then her husband).
Her hit 1930 show, "Fine and Dandy," which ran for 236 performances, was the first on Broadway to have all its music composed by a woman. Swift, who was productive until the end of her life (she died at 95), went on to write music for Radio City Music Hall productions as well as light pop-classical chamber music.
Dana Suesse, a vaudeville performer as a child, born in Kansas City, Mo., was a composer of jazz suites, including "Concerto in Three Rhythms," which was performed in Carnegie Hall by Paul Whiteman's orchestra in 1932. A number of her songs, including "My Silent Love," were themes from longer pieces. Her most famous hits include "The Night Is Young and You're So Beautiful" (written for a Billy Rose extravaganza) and the classic Hollywood come-on, "You Oughta Be in Pictures" (with words by Edward Heymann).
The two best-known songs by Ann Ronell, who was born Ann Rosenblatt in Omaha and broke into show business as a New York rehearsal pianist, couldn't be more dissimilar. "Willow Weep for Me," with its twisting, chromatic melody and haunted lyric, is an enduring jazz torch song infused with mystery and regret. The buoyant "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?," written in 1933 with Frank E. Churchill for the Disney cartoon "The Three Little Pigs," was a sensation, regarded in its day as an anti-Depression anthem.
In 1945 Ronell became one of the first women to break into another all-male preserve, the world of film scoring, as a co-writer (with Louis Applebaum) of the score "The Story of G.I. Joe."
As successful as they were, would these women have fared better in today's teeming marketplace? It's hard to say. The Broadway musical, oddly enough, is still largely a male preserve despite the inroads made by songwriters like Carol Hall ("The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"), Carole Bayer Sager ("They're Playing Our Song"), Elizabeth Swados ("Runaways"), Lucy Simon ("The Secret Garden") and others.
It is the world of pop recording, however, and the ascendance of the singer-songwriter that simultaneously ushered in a feminist revolution in songwriting. For the first time, women wrote about their personal experience with candor and freewheeling poetic imagery that were unimaginable in the Tin Pan Alley era. From Carole King, Laura Nyro and Joni Mitchell, through Madonna, to Alanis Morissette and Jewel, women finally achieved economic and artistic parity with their male peers.
Dorothy Fields, Kay Swift, Dana Suesse and Ann Ronell all lived long enough to witness the beginnings of this revolution. How could they not have approved? After all, they were its harbingers.

HEADLINE: Why Should We Have to Count Pennies?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
John Tierney suggests that we seize the opportunity of a penny shortage to abolish the coin (Big City column, Aug. 12). But over the past several decades, prices have tended to rise. Having a smaller basic unit for everyday transactions can only help to keep that rise slower. 
 Rounding off prices could mean a great deal of rounding up. It's possible that this could lead to competitive rounding down in large stores and chains, but would the "mom and pop" neighborhood stores be able to do the same? Do we want to subject these stores, which provide a useful service in many neighborhoods, to an additional economic pressure?

THE CONTENDER
Richard Nixon: The Congress Years, 1946-1952.
By Irwin F. Gellman.
Illustrated. 590 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $30. 
 RICHARD NIXON always wondered whether time would bring him vindication. Once, when reassured by Henry Kissinger that history would treat him fairly, he knowingly replied, "It depends who writes the history."
Historians are still writing, and still arguing. Recent books have reasserted Nixon's villainy (Stanley Kutler's "Abuse of Power: The New Nixon Tapes"); painted him as a liberal (Allen Matusow's "Nixon's Economy"); played down Watergate (Joan Hoff's "Nixon Reconsidered"); and put him on the couch ("Richard Nixon: A Psychobiography," by Vamik Volkan, Norman Itzkowitz and Andrew Dod). Now there's a very good new survey by Melvin Small, a historian at Wayne State University. A brisk, policy-heavy volume, "The Presidency of Richard Nixon" (University Press of Kansas, $29.95) reflects what is now probably the most widely held assessment of his Administration: a mixed bag of bumbling and breakthroughs in foreign affairs, a progressive if unenthusiastic domestic policy and a still unmatched record of executive wrongdoing.
But this year's big Nixon book is "The Contender," the first installment of a projected three-volume biography by Irwin F. Gellman. An impressive feat of archival scholarship covering Nixon's years in the House and the Senate, "The Contender" shows decided sympathy for its ever controversial subject. Nixon would certainly feel fairly treated.
A political historian at Chapman College in California, Gellman cares less about Nixon's personal life than his public career. Indeed, he defiantly shies away from exploring Nixon's psyche. Thus the southern California roots, the pious Quaker mother, the stern father, the early deaths of two brothers, the years in college, law school, government and the Navy -- all get shoehorned into 15 pages. Though a legitimate way to limit the book's scope, the omission of such fertile material divests Nixon of the psychic Sturm und Drang that has made him endlessly fascinating.
Gellman compensates by thoroughly chronicling the Congressional years. In the type of forgiving judgment that recurs throughout the book, he acquits Nixon of all charges that he got to Congress by running a dirty campaign against the incumbent Democrat, Jerry Voorhis, in 1946. He also denies that wealthy interests backed Nixon, arguing that the anti-New Deal businessmen, bankers and growers of California's 12th District weren't all that rich or powerful. He credits Nixon's victory to his tireless campaigning, spirited speeches and conservative ideology, as well as to Voorhis's ineptitude.
Once in Congress, Gellman continues, Nixon worked hard. He championed the anti-union Taft-Hartley Act and bucked his party's isolationists to support the Marshall Plan. His lead role in the House Un-American Activities Committee's interrogation of Alger Hiss gained him stature -- especially when Hiss was jailed for denying he had passed documents to Whittaker Chambers. Triumphant, popular and ambitious, Nixon then defeated Helen Gahagan Douglas in a rambunctious (but again, Gellman insists, clean) race for the Senate in 1950. Gellman lowers the curtain in 1952 with Nixon, at the age of 39, poised to become the first Republican Vice President in 20 years.
This is a rich and important political Bildungsroman, as such things go, and ably recounted. It's also, however, a familiar story, already told by (among many others) Roger Morris and Stephen Ambrose. Given that Gellman explicitly takes on his predecessors -- particularly those like Morris, who castigate Nixon -- the bottom-line question is how Gellman's version stacks up.
For sheer comprehensiveness, Gellman can't compete with Morris's 1,000 pages. And his writing, though perfectly lucid, has neither Morris's literary elegance nor Ambrose's effortless, snack-food digestibility. Where Gellman stakes his claim to superiority is in his research. Rare among Nixon books, "The Contender" relies hardly at all on previously published accounts. Having examined "every catalogued item" at the Richard Nixon Library involving the Congressional career and many previously confidential files in the National Archives branch in Laguna Niguel, Calif., Gellman reconstructs whole swaths of the Nixon story from scratch. It's a masterly achievement of spadework and stamina.
Gellman's thoroughness will raise questions about the reliability of other biographers. Gellman blasts Roger Morris for wondering whether a "Mr. Blue," who headed a Democrats for Nixon committee in 1948, "even existed." In fact, Gellman says, the very real real estate agent J. B. Blue Jr. worked closely with Nixon during the primary season that year. (He's right. I've seen ample correspondence between Blue and Nixon at the National Archives.)
More important, Gellman amplifies the record of Nixon's quotidian legislative chores. He meticulously details Nixon's participation in a key 1947 Congressional trip to Europe, seeing it as an early case of Nixon's leadership in foreign affairs. He also rediscovers Nixon's mediation of a dispute over a proposed dam in California (where water fights long raged), which notably enhanced the Congressman's prestige back home.
New research is valuable, though, mainly if it suggests a new interpretation. This Gellman doesn't really provide. Perhaps he will in future volumes, but in "The Contender" his thesis is basically that Nixon wasn't such a bad guy. Surely Gellman, who seems to have read every last Nixon monograph, knows that many other books (by Joan Hoff, Jonathan Aitken, Tom Wicker and Herbert Parmet) rest on this same claim. So, too, did a raft of pro-Nixon biographies from the 1950's. Hardly a revisionist work, "The Contender" takes one side in a well-worn debate.
Gellman can be persuasive in Nixon's defense. He convinced me that Nixon's famously aggressive campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, played a smaller role in the 1946 campaign than some have claimed. He also refutes speculation that Nixon had known Alger Hiss was a Communist well before the Chambers hearings -- and thus gives the young Congressman due credit for risking much in taking up that fight.
On many larger issues Gellman is more polemical than persuasive. He often argues by portraying matters of opinion as matters of fact. Sometimes, it seems to me, he distorts the views of those he would rebut. Again, one example. Gellman contends that Nixon was no ally of Joe McCarthy during the Red Scare but a voice of refreshing moderation. "Nixonphobes" (his blanket term for critics from Voorhis to Morris) were wrong to charge Nixon with "out-McCarthying McCarthy," he says. Here, with his language, Gellman creates a straw man. The brief against Nixon was quite different. What liberals charged was that while Nixon exploited the era's anti-Communist mania for political advantage, he did so from an affected pose of fair-mindedness that the ham-handed McCarthy could never achieve. As Irving Howe once wrote, Nixon's "only complaint was that Joe was 'inept.' And by comparison, Joe was."
As for whether Nixon acted irresponsibly, that's a matter of judgment, not fact. The Mundt-Nixon bill of 1948 defined Communist Party members, a priori, as conspirators, forced them to register with the Government and otherwise restricted their freedom. Gellman considers the bill a reasonable measure. Nixon's critics -- including such zealous cold warriors as Harry Truman -- thought it an outrage. I suspect most liberals and not a few conservatives today would side with Truman.
It seems to me that Gellman confuses his political arguments with his factual discoveries. Having corrected some errors in the record, he sees fit to claim that he has discovered the One Truth. He repeatedly counterposes other historians' "myths" against his own "facts," their rancor-filled prejudices against his own clear-eyed distillations. "The enormous mountain of Nixon material is staggering," he writes. "The truth is there, if only we will permit ourselves to see it objectively."
This strikes me as naive. For 50 years Nixon has been a battleground. Liberal intellectuals and conservative businessmen, psychoanalysts and conspiracy theorists, scholarly historians and partisan apologists -- each sees a different Nixon, and each Nixon has import and validity. "This is a man of many masks," Adlai Stevenson once astutely said. "Who can say they have seen his real face?" Gellman purports to have discovered it, but I wonder whether he is seeing just one mask.

MYTHS OF RICH & POOR
Why We're Better Off Than We Think.
By W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm.
256 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $25. 
 THERE was a time when the campaign biography was a staple of the American political process. It was a book published as a man began his quest for the Presidency that painted him and his career in glowing terms. Flaws that could not be ignored were explained away.
W. Michael Cox, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, and Richard Alm, a business writer for The Dallas Morning News, have written such a book on behalf of the American economy. They have a story to tell, and an amazing mastery of arcane economic statistics. But the effect is blunted by their reluctance to concede any possible problems.
By their account, "Myths of Rich & Poor" is needed as "an antidote to the prevailing pessimism" about the American economy. But that pessimism is hard to find just now. Worries about American competitiveness and corporate downsizing have faded in recent years as the economy has boomed. As I was reading this book, the Conference Board reported that Americans were more enthusiastic about current economic conditions than at any time since the organization began conducting consumer confidence surveys in 1967. (Confidence has since slipped a bit.)
One of the constants of those who have bemoaned the American economy in recent years has been statistics indicating that average income, adjusted for inflation, fell in the 1970's and 80's (although it has recently begun to rise nicely). Cox and Alm criticize those figures on several grounds, arguing, for instance, that inflation is overstated and that wage figures do not reflect growing benefits.
And what of income distribution? Sure, the richest people get a bigger share of the pie than they used to, the authors say, but so what? The pie is growing, and the economy is dynamic.
Anyone hurling as many numbers as Cox and Alm do runs the risk of appearing to shade statistics to support his case. That is a charge they level at some critics of the American economy, but it is also one to which they may be open. For example, they rightly argue that in assessing income gaps between blacks and whites, one must adjust the numbers to reflect differing levels of education. But a few pages later, in celebrating evidence that discrimination against women is on the verge of vanishing, they point to a study showing that women between the ages of 27 and 33 who have never had children make 98 percent as much as similar men. Such women are also more likely than the men to be college graduates, but there appears to have been no effort to adjust the figures to reflect that.
The most distressing evidence of lack of reverence for accuracy comes in a chapter entitled "The Upside of Downsizing," which argues correctly that corporate cutbacks are part of an economy that is creating new jobs all the time in growing industries. Ever eager to drive home the point that those who oppose such cutbacks also oppose progress, they reprint a letter they say was sent in 1829 by Martin Van Buren, then the Governor of New York, to President Andrew Jackson, decrying the threat posed by railroads to the jobs of canal workers, boat builders and farmers who grew hay for the horses pulling canalboats. It is a letter that seems too good to be true, but their discussion of it shows no doubts about its authenticity. (They even highlight it against a gray background.)
Curious as to where that letter came from, I turned to the notes and found, first, that the source was a book entitled "How to Be the Life of the Podium" and, second, that the authors knew historians consider the letter bogus. "Regardless of the letter's authenticity, the lesson is the same," the note says. Had they really believed that, they might have at least hinted in the book's text that the letter was a phony. With their wealth of knowledge about economic statistics, Cox and Alm could have written a much better book if they had felt less need to be cheerleaders.

INSIDE PICTURE BOOKS
By Ellen Handler Spitz.
Illustrated. 230 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $25. 
 EARLY children's books, which began being published toward the end of the 18th century by specialist printers like John Newbery in London, are increasingly rare: the antiquarian trade is hungry, but the supply scarce. Many known titles have disappeared, and others survive in numbers that can be counted on one's fingers. The reason is simple: they have been read to bits. Book dealers' typical categories -- Mint, Very Fine, Fine -- elude: survivors are missing pages, have been scribbled over, torn, sometimes (like one copy of "Struwwelpeter" I found) even clumsily slashed with scissors. Children often react to their early reading as if the stories they find there were real: Ellen Handler Spitz, in her sensitive, concentrated study of several perennials, tells of a little boy who was carefully placing his feet on the open last pages of "Goodnight Moon" (by Margaret Wise Brown, 1947) but then burst into tears. His mother realized that "he was trying with all his might to transport his whole small body into the cozy, loving world of 'Goodnight Moon.' " As Spitz also points out, "painted monsters may emerge from the pages of a book to terrorize young minds."
"Inside Picture Books" opens by asking what are the enduring qualities of such best-selling classics as "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" (1902), "The Velveteen Rabbit" (1922), "The Story of Babar" (1933) and more recent, lesser-known works: these include the author's own childhood bedtime reading, in the late 1940's and 1950's, and many stories she has since read with other children, including her own. She gives some impressive statistics: By 1996, over nine million hardback copies of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" had been sold in the United States alone. But her approach then sets aside consideration of economic or social vectors in the publishing business to look instead at the workings of fantasy in the developing mind of a child.
She stresses the pleasure of reading with children, its special intimacies and esthetic satisfactions of rhythm and reverie, sadness and humor. She draws attention to the pedagogical necessities of following child listeners' understanding, of listening to what they ask and feel, and guiding them, and she rejoices in picture books' power to develop "inner possibilities": "The best works are those that present a shifting universe of unfixed boundaries but in which work is also being done on other levels to differentiate and stabilize these boundaries." Read in the security of a parent's arms or in a caregiver's company, picture books also act as bridges to the world of outer experience. A "small gem of a book" like "The Wall," by Eve Bunting and Ronald Himler, about the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, will impart to children lessons "about death in formats that respect their needs and that emphasize both the value of life and the importance of memory." Shared, repeated, slow reading of such material also defends against the competing claims of television, movies, computer games and comics and their fast-paced, jumbled, raucous and often violent imagery, where "children encounter . . . unmourned deaths -- brutal, frightening and incomprehensible."
The phenomenon of a flourishing (and highly lucrative) literature for young ones who can't yet read reflects the new status of childhood. Yet the subject has attracted surprisingly little serious attention -- with the exception of Perry Nodelman's wide-ranging "Words About Pictures" (oddly not mentioned by Spitz). Spitz begins with nighttime terrors and books designed to lighten the Western burden of sleeping alone in the dark. Here she points to the difference in treatment of little boys, who typically deal heroically with their fears: Harold subdues his fears through art in "Harold and the Purple Crayon," conjuring forests, dragons, ships to defend himself; Mickey in Maurice Sendak's "In the Night Kitchen" zooms off in a plane. Mothers in such stories are often sidelined, even erased, or, when present, reveal that female authority still routinely presents boy protagonists with their most intractable problem.
Little girls, by contrast, as in Russell Hoban's "Bedtime for Frances," don't rebel: Frances lies in bed in uneasy solitude, imagining monsters -- "wrathful tigers, giants and spiders that are out to get her" -- until the fluttering of a real moth against the windowpane helps her distinguish between what is inside her and what is outside, an outcome Spitz finds "philosophically brilliant, an exquisitely apt gesture."
Though always calm in manner, Spitz, a lecturer in art at Stanford, can also be devastating, and in an analysis of stories about the loss of loved ones -- of pets as well as relatives -- she finds many targets for her criticism, picture books that peddle false consciousness to children through sentimentality, vagueness and prescriptiveness. She dislikes stories written in a child's voice, for they close down the space in which the young listener can enjoy free play with his or her own responses. "The Tenth Good Thing About Barney," by the veteran Judith Viorst, provokes her strongest attack -- that the corpse of a cat will fertilize the earth to make more flowers grow (pushing up the daisies, as the saying goes) strikes her as an evasive and inadequate solution to a child's loss.
British juvenile librarians in the 80's pronounced against animal anthropomorphism: much-loved Beatrix Potter and Kenneth Grahame, with their hosts of talking, clothed, home-dwelling animals, fell under the shadow of official disapproval, alongside more obvious political malefactors, like Herge, with his flamboyantly imperialist Tintin adventures. Ellen Spitz doesn't rehearse these arguments, but she clearly loves Beatrix Potter, and numerous animal protagonists figure in her pantheon of consoling and fortifying tales. Children can identify closely with rabbits, tigers, raccoons and so forth, she argues, and she quotes the anthropologist Judith Goldstein: "Children's books . . . use animals to encourage empathy, to permit children to identify without being blocked, presumably, by the particulars of race or sex or ethnicity. . . . Making all the characters animals is an advance over making them all white."
However, it seems a malignant symptom of identity politics that novice readers should not be invited to identify beyond their own self-image: the principle of negative capability, surely one of the most distinctive features of human imagination, can't be allowed to fall into decay like this. Part of the learning process Piaget called assimilation includes the ability to empathize beyond immediate -- and anyway fluid -- self-mirroring. It is a problem, too, for children that contemporary stories increasingly insist on their twinship with animals, who are, in Beatrix Potter no less than in Maurice Sendak, portrayed as devouring, insatiable and often monstrous.
The closing chapter of "Inside Picture Books," about "The Story of Little Black Sambo," first published in 1899 and thus the earliest book under discussion, points to the difficulty of finding intrinsic meanings in stories without taking account of changing times and reception. Spitz writes with spirit, integrity and courage about her pleasure in this fantastic and comical tale about foolish tigers who, on threatening to gobble up the hero, accept his smart new clothes instead, fight over them among themselves and spin around, chasing their own tails, until they're turned to "a ring of butter," which Little Black Sambo's mother then pours onto the 169 pancakes she dishes up for his tea. The illustrations by the author, Helen Bannerman, who created the book in India for her two daughters, are helplessly captive to their time's prejudices but have recently been redrawn in two 1996 versions, which Spitz recommends, "Sam and the Tigers," by Julius Lester and Jerry Pinckney, and "The Story of Little Babaji," illustrated by Fred Marcellino. She herself reads "Little Black Sambo"
"against the grain, as an anticolonialist narrative," and this challenge to enmeshed historical strands of prejudice shows her characteristic optimism and benignity.
Readers -- and lovers -- of the books she analyzes will differ in their memories and their judgments, but Spitz communicates vividly her pleasure in her material and speaks up vibrantly for the importance, complexity and place of shared reading and picture books in young lives and their future.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
In Africa, a Small Step To Bigger Game Parks

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
ONE of the dreams of the creators of African game parks is to tear down national borders and let the animals roam freely so that migration habits and grazing patterns determine a park's boundaries. Naturally, politics gets in the way, whether it's the politics of cartographers in the Colonial Office during Victoria's reign, or the touchy border disputes of modern African states.
In April, South Africa and Botswana announced that they had agreed to make one of those dreams come closer to reality. They signed an agreement to jointly manage eventually two parks contiguous to each other, the Gemsbok National Park in Botswana and the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in far northwestern South Africa. The combined park, 14,000 square miles in size (about as big as Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined), will be called the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (pronounced kuh-HAHL-uh-HOD-ee, the name is an attempt to get closer than "Kalahari" to the original word for "place of thirst" used by the San people, or Bushmen). 
 Each of the two parks will still run its own affairs and build its own tourist facilities, but they will adhere to a master plan. They will share entrance fees equally but keep the money they earn from renting out chalets and campsites.
The two parks have operated largely as one since the Botswana park was founded in 1938 (the South African one was founded in 1931). There is no fence. The border is the dry bed of the Nossob River, which is up to half a mile wide in some places; the road going along it meanders back and forth between the two countries. The parks are remote; just to drive to the entrance from Johannesburg or Gabarone, Botswana, 400 to 600 miles, can take two days.
The wildlife, which includes just about everything except elephants, giraffes and zebra, is concentrated in the Nossob and Auob riverbeds. Between them are the rust-red Kalahari dunes. The area gets about eight inches of rain a year and is classified as semi-desert, but the rains are unpredictable, so the antelopes and the predators that follow them wander great distances for water and grass.
Government and private groups have long envisioned cross-border parks. Perhaps the closest is the Limpopo Valley Peace Park, which would combine bits of the area where South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana meet. South Africa is already developing a new park in the area, the Vembe-Dongola Park. It has some land and some animals, according to Salifou Diddo, a spokesman for the South African National Parks, but no overnight or eating facilities.
The plan is to acquire more farmland, encourage indigenous vegetation and move in animals from other parks. If the park is created, it will still be split by the Limpopo River (that "great gray-green greasy Limpopo" of the Rudyard Kipling story "How the Elephant Got Its Trunk"), so the border will still exist.
Zimbabwe has parkland on its own side, but is afflicted by severe economic problems. Its currency has plummeted in the last two years and people are suffering from huge increases in the price of food and gasoline, so parkland is one of the Government's lowest priorities.
The most ambitious dream is to amalgamate South Africa's crown jewel, Kruger National Park, with the Banhine and Zinave National Parks in Mozambique and Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe into a megapark of 36,000 square miles, bigger than Portugal.
But that is a long way off. Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, and the relative wealth of South Africa is as big a draw to illegal immigrants as the United States is in Central America. There is a barbed-wire fence along the border; it used to be electrified, with the voltage set to kill. It's switched off now, but the military still patrols the fence.
More ominously, some immigrants who do slip through are hunted down by Kruger lion prides. Lions who develop a taste for human flesh then must be killed by Kruger rangers for fear that they will put tourists on their menu. One dissected lion was found with a purse with Mozambican currency in his stomach.
Also, Mozambique is too poor to mount serious poaching patrols. Its last rhinoceros was said to have been shot from a Cuban helicopter during the 1980's civil war; there used to be a small cross-border park on its southern border with South Africa, but many elephants that went north using an old riverbed migration route never came back, so South Africa closed the border there.
"We'd need some security that, if we took the fence down, it wouldn't be open season on our animals," Mr. Diddo said.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Baltimore

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS; LAURA MANSNERUS is a reporter for The Metro Section of The Times.

 BODY:
If time has passed Baltimore by, that is to Baltimore's advantage. Its successes -- the Inner Harbor's glassy hotels and franchise restaurants, Camden Yards, the rehabbed row houses of Federal Hill -- have become advertisements for urban revitalization. Yet just beyond, in neighborhoods happy to look pretty much the way they did in 1949, the city cultivates the oddball appeal that set John Waters and Barry Levinson to work.
What the visitor finds there is not marketed amusement but live blues and corner taprooms, vegan cafes and unreconstructed diners, rehabbers in ponytails and women in housedresses surveying them from webbed plastic lawn chairs -- in short, an affection for urban life. 
 Mount Vernon and Bolton Hill, for example, were always stately neighborhoods, though they had frayed at the edges. Both are still stately neighborhoods -- and still a bit frayed at the edges. The difference is that home-grown enterprises have burrowed in here and there, so that visitors to Mount Vernon's cultural institutions can stop for latte or Indian food in one of the gracious stone apartment buildings, joining the multiply-pierced music and art students who keep Charles Street alive at night.
Fell's Point and Canton, by contrast, were raw waterfront districts 20 years ago, the streets kept alive at night largely by prostitution. Fell's Point remade itself first. Its saloon-studded waterfront has become a Saturday-night teen paradise, with the smaller streets dotted with little pubs, shops and antique stores. Now Canton is following.
At the same time, the Inner Harbor's glassy jumble of malls and hotels offers more than shopping. For example, the new Port Discovery Museum for children is a three-story fun house with interactive exhibits. The National Aquarium provides a day's worth of exploration. So do the ships at the piers.
And the cultural district as always offers music -- in the modern Meyerhoff Symphony Hall and the 140-year-old Peabody Institute -- and art museums, all within an easy walk or light-rail ride from downtown.
 
Events
Port Discovery's present show, "Can You Tell Me How to Get to Sesame Street?" celebrates 30 years of the television program. Open through Sept. 19, it invites children to play with words and letters, curl up in Big Bird's nest and go on camera with a Muppet. Admission to the museum, at 35 Market Place in the Inner Harbor, is $10, $7.50 ages 3 to 12. Information: (410) 727-8120.
In the waterside tent pavilion on Pier 6, the summer concerts of the Harbor Music Festival continue through Sept. 10. Among the performers: Jeff Beck Aug. 27, Patti LaBelle Aug. 28, Britney Spears Sept. 4, Jethro Tull Sept. 5 and B. B. King Sept. 10. Information: (410) 625-3100. Tickets are $20 to $50, depending on the performer and whether you sit on the lawn or in the pavilion.
The Baltimore Conservatory in Druid Hill Park will offer a Sunday "Afternoon in the Garden" next Sunday from 2 to 4 P.M. The $3 admission covers garden walks and talks, refreshments and croquet. Reservations are required; (410) 396-0180.
The Maryland State Fair will run from Aug. 27 through Sept. 6, with livestock shows, rides, live entertainment and horse racing at the Timonium Fairgrounds, York and Timonium Roads. Admission is $4, free for children under 12. Information: (410) 252-0200.
The Baltimore Book Festival, in Mount Vernon Square on North Charles Street, is scheduled for Sept. 24 to 26. Exhibitors in the tentsinclude local bookstores, writers groups and publishers. The fair is free, and also offers storytellers, author signings, crafts, and computer and cookbook demonstrations. Information: (410) 837-4636.
Fell's Point will have a free festival, too, on Oct. 2 and 3, and in true street-fair fashion, the big attraction will be blocks and blocks of food vendors. But there will also be entertainment, arts and crafts. Call (410) 675-6756.
 
Sightseeing
One way to see a swath of Baltimore is from the Water Taxi, which travels the long arm of Northwest Harbor. The Inner Harbor, which would be the fist burrowing into downtown, is the main stop. The open boats pass marinas, dockyards, working wharves, rotting piers and, at the harbor's opening, the wide lawns of Fort McHenry. The $4.50 ticket is good for trips all day.
Fell's Point and Canton easily provide a day of walking, shopping and eating. Don't miss the quieter back streets. Canton, despite a whiff of gentrification, is still a neighborhood of formstone-clad row houses and corner taprooms. O'Donnell Square, with the stone Messiah Lutheran Church anchoring one end, has the air of a European town.
Camden Yards is a sight, even when the home teams are away. Much of Orioles Park (the other half of Camden Yards is Ravens Stadium, home of the National Football League team) can be seen from the outside, and even from the restaurants and bars in the B & O warehouse along the park's shoulder. If you want a better seat, Orioles tickets are available this year, for a change. Call (410) 685-9800; baseball's regular season runs through Oct. 3. Tickets are $9 to $35.
The American Visionary Art Museum, on the industrial waterfront rim of Federal Hill, celebrates uncelebrated artists -- the amateur, the home-grown, the self-taught. Among those on view now (through Sept. 5) is Gerald Hawkes, a hospital worker who made stunningly intricate furniture, sculptures and bas-reliefs from match sticks; look for the statue of Isaac Stern, with violin case and bright red match-stick heart.
Other museums include the Baltimore Museum of Art, off North Charles Street at 10 Art Museum Drive, and the elegant Walters Art Gallery, 600 North Charles Street in Mount Vernon, (410) 547-9000, known for its collection of ancient, medieval and Renaissance art. The Baltimore Museum of Art, (410) 396-7100, has a collection of modern works by Matisse, Picasso and Warhol, among others, and two sculpture gardens. Admission is $6, $4 for seniors and students at the Baltimore Museum of Art, at the Walters $5, $3 for seniors and young adults (18 to 25), $1 ages 6 to 17.
 
Where to Stay
Most hotels are clustered around the Inner Harbor. Expect decent views and the standard Federal reproductions and chintz bedspreads; also expect streams of sightseers dipping into adjacent malls and restaurants. Here are a few other choices.
The Hilton Baltimore and Towers, 20 West Baltimore Street, (410) 539-8400, fax (410) 332-4229, is along the seam between the Inner Harbor's glass and steel and the city's old downtown. Built in 1928, the 439-room hotel has the potted palms and dark, paneled lobby bar that could be the set of a Bogart movie. The rooms are smallish but nicely appointed in traditional style. Rates range from $125 to $209.
The Admiral Fell Inn, 888 South Broadway, (800) 292-4667, fax (410) 522-0707, places you smack in the center of Fell's Point's waterfront. With canopied four-poster beds in the 80 rooms and a fireplace in the lobby, it matches the neighborhood's vintage. The standard rate is $199.
For a bed-and-breakfast in a quiet precinct, many Baltimoreans tell visitors about Mr. Mole, 1601 Bolton Street, (410) 728-1179, fax (410) 728-3379, a town house in Bolton Hill, not far from Mount Vernon and the Amtrak station. It has five meticulously and distinctly decorated suites, all with private baths and telephones. Smoking is not allowed. Rates are $105 to $165.
Budget: The Mount Vernon Hotel and Washington Cafe, 24 West Franklin Street, (410) 727-2000 or (800) 537-8483, fax (410) 576-9300, a solid, well-kept old building, is near the Peabody and the Walters. The 191-room hotel is a training facility for hotel management students, and culinary students train in the cafe, better described as a dining room, with fireplace and white tablecloths. Rooms are $69 to $109.
Luxury: The Harbor Court Hotel, 550 Light Street, (410) 234-0550, fax (410) 659-5925, is downright opulent, with Asian antiques gracing the corridors and leather-bound books in the first-floor library. Many of its 203 rooms, each big enough for a cocktail party, command views of the Inner Harbor. Doubles are $310 to $340; suites are $500 to $3,000.
 
Where to Eat
One of the new magnets on the Canton waterfront is Atlantic, 2400 Boston Street, (410) 675-4565, all chrome and black steel. The menu is almost all seafood -- thick and rare tuna steak, wafers of grilled squid, flaky crab cakes. Dinner for two, with drinks, about $75.
In Fell's Point, Peter's Inn, 504 South Ann Street, (410) 675-7313, is a bar without bar food; instead, it offers serious entrees like filet mignon, chicken, seafood and always a vegan dish. The ambiance is loose, a point made by the herb garden in the clawfoot bathtub on the sidewalk. The menu changes weekly, and if there's nothing special for dessert, you may be sent around the corner for the homemade baked goods at Funk's Democratic Coffee House and Bistro. Dinner for two, with wine, about $55.
Gunnings Crab House, 3901 South Hanover Street, (410) 354-0085, is in the untouristed neighborhood of Brooklyn, two bridges south of downtown. Gunnings looks like a neighborhood bar (it is) that grew in an ungainly way to fit crab-eaters into two dining rooms and a covered patio. With the hard shells, try onion rings or the gigantic pepper rings -- green-pepper rings dipped in ultra-thick batter, deep fried till they look like doughnuts and sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. Dinner for two, with beer, about $50.
Breakfast is the main item at the Blue Moon Cafe, 1621 Aliceanna Street, (410) 522-3940, in a skinny row house in Fell's Point. French toast is the specialty, and there are five varieties of eggs Benedict (including Maryland crab). But you could come back for the lunch dishes, too, like quesadillas. The Blue Moon closes at 3 P.M. most days, but it stays open all night Friday and Saturday. Breakfast for two is $15 to $20.
The Sip & Bite, 2200 Boston Street, (410) 675-7077, is open 24 hours every day. This waterfront diner in Canton is a 1950's kind of place: pink and gray Formica and a long counter, and mainstays like pork chops and liver and onions. Breakfast is served any time, with crispy home fries. With a glass or two of beer or wine, if you worked at it, dinner could cost $10 or $12.
 
Shopping
Baltimore is a logical place to buy something old. Antique Row, on Howard Street in Mount Vernon, offers more than 30 shops, and there are two dozen more in Fell's Point. On the second Sunday of each month, a flea market sets up on Broadway Market Square, starting at 8 A.M.
Fell's Point and Canton also offer rich book shopping, all the richer if you're hungry. Bibelot, in the shell of the old American Can Company plant on the Canton waterfront, has literary magazines and European newspapers. It also has a branch of Donna's, the local coffee-bar empire.
At Adrian's Book Cafe, 714 South Broadway, break for cake or biscotti upstairs and check out the used books. And then there's the intensely unpretentious Funk's, 1818 Eastern Avenue, which, in addition to desserts and vegetarian-oriented bistro dishes, sells used books. Top price: $3.50. It's open until midnight.

HEADLINE: Touring the Happy Side of Hell

BYLINE: By MARGUERITE McGLINN; MARGUERITE McGLINN is a teacher who travels frequently to Europe.

 BODY:
I STOOD behind Selfoss Waterfall with my daughter, Heather, watching the glacial runoff make gothic arches splintered with rainbows as it hurtled down to become the headwater of a river. The sunny morning made Selfoss a rainbow machine; later, it placed a perfect multicolored wishbone around us as we stood near its sandy base.
We had just come from Hveragerdi, a town built on an active geothermal zone about 25 miles east of Reykjavik, the capital, where huge hothouses grow tomatoes and bananas close to the Arctic Circle and residents sell bread that bakes in the ground overnight. We were in Iceland traveling the Ring Road, Route 1, on a seven-day bus tour last August that included people from Britain, the Netherlands and the United States. We were all ages and had come for different reasons -- geological phenomena, sparse and wild beauty, pristine air, Nordic culture. Some had already been everywhere else. Heather and I were seeking a mother-daughter adventure before she began graduate school, and Iceland seemed exotic and isolated enough to qualify. 
 Our destination the first evening was Vik, the southernmost village in the nation but described in our guidebook as having the lowest summer temperatures in Iceland. Not knowing what to expect for food or lodging outside the capital, Reykjavik, I was nonetheless amazed when we pulled up to an Esso station cum convenience store -- the perfect set for a film noir -- to learn that we were having dinner there. My daughter and I looked at each other wide eyed, gathered our jackets and followed the crowd.
We walked past the cashier's post to a door that opened onto a large dining room with views of the ocean and the sea cliffs of Dyrholaey. We had already visited the nature preserve around Dyrholaey to see the stone arch that spans the wild Atlantic waves, which created it. Birds wheel over the sea cliffs and the stacks of rock in the sea. We recovered from our surprise in time to enjoy our meal of seafood terrine, roast lamb and apple pie.
With one exception we had good meals everywhere we went in Iceland. Although the guidebook and Icelandic films frightened us with descriptions of putrefied shark meat that had been buried in the earth for months, and sheep heads eaten with eyes and tongue -- the brain is considered a separate treat -- we usually dined on roast lamb or salmon. Esso or Mobil convenience stores were frequently the only place to eat lunch in remote regions, and I quickly learned that if you judged a restaurant by esthetics, you would starve.
We did have a memorable meal on the fourth day of the tour at a family-owned restaurant in the highland desert near Lake Myvatn, where NASA astronauts trained for moon walks. Blasting winds and scouring sand forced us to duck in our parkas and walk in a disorienting, hunchbacked manner. As I ate several helpings of a tasty creamed vegetable soup thick with potatoes and broccoli, I looked around to see people eating on every surface -- counters, tables and windowsills -- all seeking sanctuary from the wicked weather in bowls of comfort food.
"A surprise storm blew in from the North Atlantic," Adda Helgadottir, our guide, told us. "I believe there is better weather ahead." Adda taught philosophy and sociology in Reykjavik when not working as a summer tour guide. Throughout the trip, she was optimistic, resourceful, occasionally ironic. She and Stefan Thorvardarson, the bus driver, worked together to provide hospitality and to explain Icelandic culture, history, wildlife, economics and geology.
Adda's family was from the north and had owned farmland in the Lake Myvatn region, which lies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and was geologically one of the most interesting areas we visited. A submarine mountain range that surfaces in Iceland, the ridge grows by several centimeters a year by pushing apart the tectonic plates that meet there with magma from the earth's mantle rock. We stayed at the new Hotel Myvatn, which overlooks the southern shore of the lake, and in spite of its larger size and the addition of minibars, it offered the same blend of spartan accommodations and competent, friendly service we had encountered at other Icelandic hotels.
In touring the area, we first saw pseudocraters, formed when volcanic material flows into water. Resembling minivolcanoes, they dot Lake Myvatn, making it look like a great bowl of broth with triangular dumplings. Then we turned off the road, and in a short distance ran into a fenced area. Adda got out and released a gate; we drove through and picked her up on the other side.
"This is part of the land my grandfather owned," she said. "It is all right for us to visit here. My grandfather sold it because he was always having to stop his work to rescue some tourists who had gotten into trouble here."
In this smoking -- in spots, seething -- stretch of land, it would be easy to fall into boiling mud or get too close to a fumarole belching superheated smoke and gas. We walked to a cave that enclosed a hot spring in which Adda bathed as a child.
"There is a woman side and a man side," she said. "I will show you the woman's side first. It is steeper, a difficult path. Everything is always more difficult for the woman."
We climbed down and put our arms into the water, which was bathing temperature, more than 100 degrees. We walked down the men's side and from there, could see that the two sides joined to make one pool.
We drove on to Krafla, a northern mountain that erupted in 1984. We walked past a sign that warned in Icelandic and in English: "The ground is extremely hot and therefore dangerous to cross. Only walk on the light brown clay, not on the dark clay, the lighter gray or yellowish spots. Never go over the fences around the most dangerous areas."
As I was ticking off the color codes in my head, we began a brisk walk past smoking lava caves, around fissures and over crumbly surfaces -- images from Milton's portrait of hell. Below the boiling zone, we took photos of each other straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and moved on to see an area with gurgling mud and fumaroles. A sulfur-scented wind accompanied us on our two-hour hike as we viewed the strange color scheme of the soil: creamy and pale like the skin of an Icelandic beauty queen, contrasted with patches of Crayola hues.
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge crosses Iceland in a diagonal running southwest to northeast. Earlier, along the south coast, we saw volcanic mountains that had been honed and scissored by the ice fields, which are now below the summits. A volcanic eruption can melt a glacier and send huge blocks of ice and water to the lowlands. Such an event occurred in 1996, and another eruption was expected in Iceland before the millennium (indeed, last December, a volcanic eruption took place under Vatnajokull, the largest glacier in Europe).
Early in the trip, we toured the southern coast, ending the second day at Jokulsarlon Lagoon, famous for icebergs that break off into the water. Wearing life jackets, we sailed through the lagoon for half an hour, staring at towering ice cliffs; some carried a sooty layer of glacial soil, others had striations of peacock blue and arctic white.
We took a pristine chunk of latticed ice to our evening's lodgings, the Vatnajokull Hotel, named for the glacier, or jokull, that dominated the landscape and provided the ice that chilled our cocktails. After a very good salmon dinner in the hotel dining room, Adda made arrangements for a a jeep ride to the glacier. Because of Iceland's latitude, daylight is interrupted by only a brief twilight in midsummer, so 9:30 P.M. was as good a time as any to begin an excursion.
We happily mounted low ridges, dove down steep planes and splashed through a broad river. While the ride was still in its mundane, early stage, a Dutch man sitting next to the hotel owner, who was our guide, asked how he would rate Icelandic drivers. Just then, we hurtled down a hill as the guide bleated, "They are maniacs."
We stopped at a ridge overlooking the small lagoon formed from the summer melt and saw the heavily creased basalt holding an endless basin of ice. As we found everywhere in Iceland, alpine flowers clung to the rocks. In the shadow of Vatnajokull, we saw arctic river beauty: deep blue, horn-shaped flowers on grasslike stems; elsewhere, we had seen the cottony tufts of artic wool, bluebells and the delicate yellow of alpine cinquefoil.
When the guided tour ended, Heather and I followed Adda's advice and visited the Blue Lagoon, a 40-minute ride from Reykjavik. The romantic name belies the reality of the lagoon, created by runoff from a geothermal power plant. It now uses superheated seawater pumped directly from as much as 6,000 feet underground, which is cooled to about to 98 to 100 degrees. The azure color, which gives the swimming hole its name, comes from blue-green algae and silica mud.
We arrived during a period of light rain and mist, a signature of Reykjavik weather during our stay. The tanks and hangers of the power station loomed over the unrelieved volcanic landscape, a setting made odder by the combination of morning drizzle and mist rising from the lagoon. After following the instructions in the shower room (which are posted at all swimming areas in Iceland) to wash before putting on one's bathing suit and to include all areas marked in a graphic chart, we stumbled, wet and chilled, onto the lava bed that underlies the lagoon.
At some point, Heather and I started laughing. Very quickly, we submerged ourselves in the welcome heat and drifted through the industrial waterscape. We became separated in the mist, and I decided to get as close as possible to the plant to gauge the heat of the water there. I felt buoyant both inside and out, and wondered if this psychedelic experience could get any stranger. I looked around to see if there were lifeguards and spotted a Nordic giant in a snowmobile suit patrolling the perimeter. Tourists dressed in jackets and hats instead of bathing suits walked along the wooden planking taking photographs.
I spotted my daughter and began laughing again. We did a synchronized swim to the dock and steeled ourselves for the cold walk back to our traveling clothes.
 
Sure, it gets cold, but the water's fine
We booked the Iceland Complete Tour through Icelandair, (800) 223-5500, www.icelandair.com. It included air fare, transportation to and from the airport, two nights at the Loftleidir Hotel in Reykjavik and a seven-day, six-night escorted bus tour. A cold buffet breakfast of cereal, bread, meat, cheese, fruit, vegetables and skyr, a dairy product that resembles yogurt, was provided every day. A three-course dinner was part of the package during the bus trip. The Iceland Complete excursion costs $2,371 a person, double occupancy June through August; $1,752 in May, and $1,865 in September.
The Icelandic Tourist Board, part of the Scandinavian Tourist Board, has an office at 655 Third Avenue (42d Street), New York, N.Y 10017, (212) 885-9700, fax (212) 885-9710; www.goiceland.org. It provides information on sightseeing, recreational activities and accommodations. The bureau's tourist information office in Reykjavik is at 2 Bankastraeti, (354) 562-3045, fax (354) 562-3057.
 
Getting There
Icelandair is the only commercial airline traveling to Iceland from the United States. Flights leave New York (J.F.K.), Boston, Baltimore, Orlando and Minneapolis and arrive in Keflavik, 30 miles from Reykjavik, the capital. Passengers going to Europe on Icelandair can stay up to three nights in Iceland with no additional air fare. Current round-trip fares start at $448, for September departures.
The Flybus provides transportation from the airport to major hotels and central destinations in Reykjavik for about $10 one way, at the rate of 73 krona to the dollar. Flights arrive around 6:30 A.M. and hotels in Reykjavik try to have rooms available in the morning.
 
Where to Stay
Many hotels outside of Reykjavik and Akureyri, a city in northern Iceland, are open only May through September. We stayed in boarding schools converted for summer guests, and in hotels belonging to the Key and the Foss hotel chains. The rooms were modest and clean, and all had private baths. Service was usually competent and friendly.
The year-old Key Hotel Myvatn, on Lake Myvatn at Myvatnssveit, (354) 464-4455, was the most upscale hotel on our tour, with spacious rooms with streamlined Scandanavian decor and minibars. It has 37 rooms, with doubles costing $163, including breakfast. The restaurant has views of the lake. The hotel closes Sept. 1. Reservations: (354) 511-6030, fax (354) 511-6031.
The Fosshotel Vatnajokull, on Route 1 between Skaftafell Park and Hofn, (354) 478-2555, sits on the edge of a water meadow, which borders the ocean beach. Mountains and the Vatnajokull glacier are across the road. The hotel's 26 rooms were small, clean and simply furnished. Doubles are $149, including breakfast. It is open till early October. Reservations: (354) 562-4000, fax (354) 562-4001.
Hotel Vik i Myrdal, Route 1, Vik, (354) 487-1480, fax (354) 487-1302, offers 21 small, clean rooms in a building that hugs a mountain base. Doubles cost $102; breakfast is $9.50. It is fully staffed June through August, and will open at other times for groups.
 
Where to Eat
In the countryside, food service is limited to convenience stores, the dining rooms in hotels and small family cafes. Most villages offer both a hotel and either a convenience store or cafe. Summer hotels will provide meals for those who are not hotel guests, but a drop-in customer would have a limited selection.
Coffee, bottled water, juice, soda, packaged pastries, hot dogs, sandwiches, snack foods and creamed soup were lunch staples. Soup, bread and coffee, the lunch we ate most frequently, cost about $10.
Although we did not pay directly for dinners outside Reykjavik, I estimated that a three-course meal averaged $35 a person, including tax. Tipping is not customary in Iceland, but neither is a tip refused. Alcoholic beverages would be additional.
In Vik, we ate at the Esso station convenience store on Route 1, (354) 487-1230, and other evenings, in the hotel dining room. At the Esso, a three-course dinner of smoked puffin, fried redfish and rice, and cheesecake cost about $25, with tax. A glass of wine is about $6.
 
Things to Do
The Blue Lagoon, near Grindavik, can be reached from Reykjavik by a 40-minute ride on a public bus, which costs about $15. Admission to the Blue Lagoon, open daily 9 A.M. to 10 P.M., is $8.20 for three hours of bathing; $11 for six hours. Towels and bathing suits can be rented at the new spa, which opened just last month, for about $3.50 each. Day tours that include the Blue Lagoon and other sites of interest will take passengers to the airport or back to Reykjavik. They cost about $50 and can be booked at many hotels; (354) 426-8800, fax (354) 426-8888, www.
bluelagoon.is.
Reservations can be made for boat trips on the Jokulsarlon glacial lagoon from Fjolnir Torfason, (354) 852-0631. The cost is $20.50 for a 40-minute ride. The lagoon is off Route 1, east of the Skaftafell Park. MARGUERITE McGLINN

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
An Entertainer, Unapologetically

BYLINE: By BARRY SINGER; Barry Singer's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about Joe's Pub, a club at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.

 BODY:
CLAIBORNE CARY has nothing to apologize for. In an age of cabaret performance often practiced as some rarefied art form, she is unabashedly an entertainer, one who likes to raise a ruckus.
Rude jokes and raw schtick are in no way beneath her, and as a singer Ms. Cary, now in her 60's, flat out likes to swing. All of which leaves her on the contrarian fringe of today's cabaret universe, where the notion of entertainment seems to get shunned somehow as lacking in serious purpose. 
 "It can get lonely," said Ms. Cary, who is in the midst of a monthlong return engagement at the somewhat less than mainstream Danny's Skylight Room on West 46th Street in Manhattan. "There aren't many people who aspire to be fun anymore. Not in a serious way."
A two-time winner of New York cabaret scene's top honor, the MAC Award, Ms. Cary is still a favorite within the industry but a name popularly recognized only by a few. Since arriving in New York from Lone Tree, Iowa in the 1950's as an aspiring dancer, she says has most definitely "been around": singing and dancing on Broadway and off and working the great cafes -- and also the not so great -- of the city.
Barely more than five-feet tall, she nursed little hope initially of making it as a Broadway chorus girl. Yet the choreographer Bob Fosse cast Ms. Carey in 1957 for his new show "New Girl in Town" over the vehement objections of that production's director, George Abbot.
"They were running up and down the aisle of the 46th Street Theater, screaming at each other," Ms. Cary recalled recently over lunch at a restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "Abbot wanted another long-legged lady, but Bobby wanted me."
With characteristic capriciousness, however, Ms. Carey quit dancing for good immediately after "New Girl in Town" closed. "I just didn't want to be in the chorus anymore," she said. "I started doing parts and singing; I'd always listened to singers, especially Peggy Lee. Also Lee Wiley. And Anita O'Day."
At first there were gigs at tony Manhattan nightspots like the Blue Angel and Julius Monk's Upstairs at the Downstairs. Then came rock-and-roll and the near-death of cabaret in the 60's, followed by voice-over work, commercials and television, as well as two marriages and a son. Finally, some 10 years ago, Ms. Cary abandoned the city for Los Angeles. "A nasty little town," is all she will say about her experience there. Her long-planned, permanent return to New York is now imminent.
Onstage, she remains an extraordinary amalgam of musicianship and standup comedy: her pitch sure, her sense of time, both musically and comedically, effortless. Though her voice possesses the razorblade tone and ironic attack of an Elaine Stritch, her singing can be surprisingly expansive, even lyrical.
She shapes her sets into melodramatic narratives with well-chosen song juxtapositions: Irving Berlin's "Say It Isn't So" opposite John Wallowitch's "I Live Alone Again"; Cy Coleman and Joe McCarthy's "Why Try to Change Me Now" sung against Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler's "As Long as I Live." The potential effect could be bathetic but rarely is; Ms. Cary's wit and sense of survival bend the songs to her will.
"I cut right to the bone," she said. "I've learned that I'm better being funny between songs, rather than just doing funny songs; funny songs quickly get not so funny. Maybe that's another reason I'm nowhere, though, professionally. I'm trying to swing and be funny. Who else ever managed that?"
On her latest CD, "Claiborne Cary Live," she leads off tackling George and Ira Gershwin's "The Man I Love" at a ferocious clip. The result is not just exhilarating but revelatory. "I used to sing all of these songs much more slowly," Ms. Cary tells her audiences. "But I had more time then."
"How do I exist?" she asks. "Or, at least, subsist? I play a lot of private parties. And I don't work much. That helps."'
Her point is well taken. With few club owners these days paying performers anything at all beyond a small percentage of the door, the hard costs of cabaret -- salaries for musicians, up-front expenditures for arrangements and advertising -- largely come out of the singers' own pockets.
"You've got to save up for these gigs," Ms. Cary said wearily. "Let's face it, if I was looking to make a decent living, I'd have gone into computers by now."
Cabaret's persistent inability to provide her with financial security would surprise at least one person, Ms. Cary maintains.
"My mother viewed show business as a sure guarantee of economic freedom for her three daughters, both from the Depression and from men. (One of Ms. Cary's sisters is the actress Cloris Leachman.)
" 'Maybe you'll have your own money someday,' Mother would constantly say," Ms. Cary recalled. " 'Maybe you won't have to get married; maybe you'll just read and travel.' She'd call us in to watch her scrub the floor. 'Girls, come here and look,' she'd say. 'Don't ever do this.' "
"And," Ms. Cary added with the impeccable timing of a lifelong entertainer, "I never have."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
The Wonder of It: The West Just So

BYLINE: By RICHARD B. WOODWARD; Richard B. Woodward is photography editor-at-large for DoubleTake magazine.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
CARLETON WATKINS would rank among the great enigmas of late 19th-century American art even if his life weren't so mysterious and sad. The pictures he made of scenic glories in the West during the 1860's and 70's have been the sublime standard for generations of landscape photographers. Ansel Adams, for one, worked in his long shadow.
A fine Watkins photograph is about as fine as a photograph gets. There is nothing hit or miss about where he chose to aim his camera. His so-called mammoth prints, developed from 18-by-22-inch glass plates, often combine an eerie clarity with a bold massing of shapes that verges on analytic geometry. As the rigor of his compositions is startling for the time, so are his later studies of domesticated trees and fruits. A romantic's sense of wonder was matched by a classicist's restraint. Contrary to the practice of many painters in the West, then and since, Watkins surveyed nature without trumpery. By printing the facts he didn't need to elaborate myths. 
 The exhibition of his work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (through Sept. 7, then moving to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Oct. 12) offers pristine examples of Watkins the magnificent. His prints of Yosemite Valley are front and center. The power of persuasion in these images was such that Congress preserved the valley as a sanctuary in 1864; and for a while print sales to the public gave Watkins a comfortable living.
But the show's curator, Douglas R. Nickel, also highlights many lesser-known pictures in order to ask questions about the puzzling maturity of the work. Nothing in the Watkins biography -- what little we know of it, anyway -- explains how a former carpenter and bookstore clerk, born in 1829 in Oneonta, N.Y., came to possess such expressive gifts. How did a bumpkin who spent his adult life in the northern California backwater produce some of the most forward-looking pictures of the 19th century?
In looking for clues, Mr. Nickel examines the innovative ways of seeing pioneered by the Victorians, specifically the invention of stereography. An early form of 3-D that became a craze in the 1850's, it was, in Mr. Nickel's judgment, the most important and pervasive visual technology the 19th century produced, excepting photography itself. A series of booths at the end of the show lets viewers experience -- with the aid of computer software coupled to wireless goggles, both courtesy of StereoGraphics -- what the thrill was all about. The show and catalogue (which has been published by Abrams)are rightfully subtitled "The Art of Perception."
Like most field photographers of his time, Watkins also made stereographs for the home market, some 6,500. Mass marketed as cards that fit into a binocular hand viewer, they heightened the drama of perception. A street scene could become a stage in a stereograph, with sharp divisions between foregrounds and backgrounds, and figures cut out from both like silhouettes.
Watkins exploited the stereograph's displacing qualities with glee. In a shot of San Francisco, the streetcars look like toys in a child's pop-up book. In another, of a ferry and its passengers, he has arranged the people in layers, like ducks in a shooting gallery. An 1878 image of lily pads on water reflecting a grid of windows in the background offers the viewer no clear way to resolve a pictorial riddle. Both the subject and its reflection seem to exist in the same plane. As a study in flattened perspective, it rivals a Degas.
Watkins was clearly involved with the theatrics of space. He put together multipanel photographs of cities, or of mountaintops, that look down and across from high cliffs. Not only do these cinematic panoramas convey the appropriate awe at the width of the horizon; they can also bring on a dose of vertigo. Even the mesmerizing detail in some of Watkins's enormous plates, as Mr. Nickel says, force the viewer's eyes to spiral around the print and study it, rather than take it in at a glance.
At the same time, Watkins was also making careful documents of his time. His pictures of the Columbia River in 1867 show how the Northwest was really won -- not on any battlefield, but in mining camps and lumber mills, where the day-to-day harvesting of minerals and timber produced the raw materials for exportable wealth. However much he may have manipulated space with his triptychs and wide-angle lenses, Watkins stayed grounded in the economic reality of his employers, primarily mine owners and the railroads. A respect for the material world can be found throughout his work. All his life he photographed trees as if he knew they were essential for both life and culture. It is possible to examine a dozen Watkins prints and, except for the train tracks and rare steam engine, find little or no metal parts. The houses in a panorama of Portland, Ore., appear to be entirely built of wood, with stumps of felled trees prominent in the foreground. Even the dams at this time were hewed out of timber.
People hardly figure in Watkins's work, except as puny yardsticks for measuring the loftier stature of nature. The five men standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of Grizzly Giant, the wizened sequoia in Yosemite's Mariposa Grove, are barely visible beside the massive base of its trunk. Almost no one in his pictures exhibits traits of personality other than endurance in the face of vaster forces.
The less grandiose trees he photographed in the 1870's may be his most intimate work. They are like character studies. The buckeye tree in a California front yard shades a cabin like a floppy hat. His 1878 view of a house in a larch grove is as plain and mournful as a Willa Cather novel.
Seven detached figures stand in the shadows. The subject of the picture appears to be neither the people nor the trees, but the uneasy struggle to establish a home. A photograph of a box of peaches on its side from 1887-88 is shocking in its simplicity. In arranging the fruits so that their cleavage is unmistakable, Watkins even seems to be telling a harmless dirty joke.
That Watkins produced this majestic and diverse body of work with little or no formal esthetic training is still hard to fathom, as is his rapid and tragic decline in popularity. The Yosemite pictures made him famous and employable. He was praised by Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. By 1871 his studio in San Francisco was the grandest in the West.
But in the late 1870's his fortunes reversed like a train rolling backward down a mountain, and he never really found the brake. He was a wretched businessman. In 1874 he lost a studio he had opened in Yosemite, as well as the copyright on his plates of the park, to bankruptcy. At 50 he married a woman 28 years younger, only to find that he could barely support her. The market for stereographs dried up through saturation. Watkins's meticulous skills were less and less in demand. He suffered from arthritis and blindness.
In 1895-96 he lived with his family in a boxcar -- they couldn't afford a house -- until his childhood friend, the railroad baron Collis Huntington, deeded him a ranch. As a final blow, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed the glass-plate negatives in Watkins's main studio and, in effect, wiped out a life's work. In 1910 he was committed to the Napa Hospital for the Insane, where, six years later, he died. He is buried on the grounds in an unmarked grave.
The strangest puzzle may be how late recognition for Watkins has been in coming. Beaumont Newhall's standard history of photography didn't include a Watkins photograph in its first four editions. Finally, in 1982, Watkins made the grade. Only in the last 25 years, thanks in part to the advocacy of scholars like Peter Palmquist, has Watkins been considered the finest American photographer of the 19th century.
His contemporaries didn't regard him as anything special, either. They never saw him as unusually modern in his picture making but rather as an exceptional craftsman. That also seems to be how Watkins saw himself.
One of the few remarks we have from him is second-hand -- he left no diary or articles, and gave no interviews -- from the photographer John Hillers, who had brought him prints to review. "I have little advice to offer," said Watkins. "You are a clean worker in which lies the great secret of photography."
Although scholars have found that there is a great more to it -- and to him -- than that, the bedrock of Watkins's remarkable artistry, even after as excellent a show and catalogue as this, can still seem more submerged than exposed.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Quirk After Quirk in Side-by-Side Festivals

BYLINE: By JESSE MCKINLEY

 BODY:
IN the fractious world of Off Off Broadway, it was bound to happen. The Fringe has developed a fringe.
Beginning Wednesday, the downtown theater scene will be witness to the opening of two simultaneous festivals, each based on the Lower East Side and each purporting to represent the rich variety among the city's littlest and least-known theater troupes. 
 This year's newcomer is the Pure Pop Theater Festival, which will kick off just hours after the first show of the New York International Fringe Festival, now in its third summer.
Pure Pop's organizers promise to match the Fringe quirk for quirk, with programming that includes a rarely seen temperance play ("Ten Nights in a Barroom" by William Pratt), an 18th-century Japanese epic ("The Battles of Coxinga" by Chikamatsu Monzaemon) and several shows with titles not suitable for a family newspaper. All in all, Pure Pop promises to stage nearly 60 productions over seven weeks (through Oct. 3), at sites ranging from the Queens Theater in the Park to Theater 4S, a 15-seater in an East Village apartment.
For its part, the Fringe will present some 150 productions in 12 days, through Aug. 29, an ambitious schedule that includes theater, dance and performance art. Here, too, some of the titles suggest a deep immersion in the odd: "Urinetown," an original musical, and "Jinkies," a series of Scooby Doo episodes based on the television cartoon. There is also a revival of the Robert Wilson-Tom Waits-William S. Burroughs rock opera "The Black Rider," which was staged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1995.
Does downtown really need all this? Aaron Beall, the founder of Pure Pop, answers: "Nobody's saying to Lincoln Center, 'Hey, too many festivals, guys! Too much creativity! You've got to stop it! Why do you need the Mozart? You just did Schubert! Enough with the Mendelssohn!' "
Pure Pop and the Fringe have a shared history. Mr. Beall (pronounced Bell) was a founder of the Fringe, but earlier this year he had a falling out with a co-founder, John Clancy, and left to start Pure Pop. (Mr. Beall is also the founder of Todo Con Nada, a storefront theater on Ludlow Street, and Mr. Clancy is also the artistic director of the downtown theater group Present Company).
Mr. Beall's departure led to rumors -- and news reports -- of a vitriolic crisis in the heart of the city's Off Off Broadway community. But Mr. Clancy and Mr. Beall, who are both 35, say there is little animus between them. They ascribe the fight to personality differences and some grumbling over dividing box office receipts. Each man's company lost money on the two previous Fringe festivals.
"When times are tight, a little bit of money gets to be very important," Mr. Clancy said at the Theatorium, the Fringe's headquarters and mainstage on Stanton Street. "But Aaron and I are getting along."
What the two men can also agree on is that their festivals represent only a part of what is going on Off Off Broadway, which many on the scene say is in the midst of a period of remarkable popularity, economic growth and structural change.
"I think there's an influx of extraordinary people working in the scene right now," said the playwright Mac Wellman, a stalwart of downtown theater. "And a lot of them don't want to make it in the traditional way."
Indeed, many in the new generation of theater artists and downtown producers have begun to exhibit the professional trappings of larger institutions: press agents, marketing plans and six-figure annual budgets. The Fringe and Pure Pop are no exception: the Fringe has a budget of $180,000; Pure Pop about a third of that. Mr. Beall, in particular, is something of a media hound, talking up his festival with the showy optimism of a circus barker. "It's the beginning of festival season," he said recently, smiling over a plate of sushi near Todo Con Nada. "You got to make the scene."
While Mr. Beall was with the Fringe, he aggressively promoted the festival in radio and television interviews; with Pure Pop, he has taken to dyeing his hair -- blue, most recently -- for effect. He is also pushing Pure Pop in interviews and on the Internet as the first season in a "99-year plan" to save Off Off Broadway from what he complains is invasive real estate development.
Mr. Beall's fears aside, much of downtown theater is blooming. Critical praise has begun to follow young companies like Elevator Repair Service and playwrights like Richard Maxwell, the author of "House." That play toured Europe this summer after good reviews in New York; Elevator Repair Service's "Total Fictional Lie" will tour five American cities this fall and winter.
At home, Target Margin's acclaimed 1998 production of "Mamba's Daughters" was the headliner at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., in May. The chamber musical "Running Man," a March production at HERE in SoHo, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, while the winner, "Wit," had its New York premiere at the 99-seat MCC Theater on West 28th Street.
Commercial success stories have been more hit and miss. Downtown shows like "Shakespeare's R&J," which began at the tiny Expanded Arts theater on Ludlow Street, had a long commercial run Off Broadway, as did "Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde," which began on Off Off Broadway. On the other hand, last season's commercial transfers of the Adobe Theater Company's "Duet!" and Premium Bob's "Manhunt" were not successful in larger auditoriums.
Downtown theater isn't even always downtown anymore. "Three Virgins," developed by the experimental company Collapsable Giraffe, reclaimed Show World, a former sex superstore on Eighth Avenue near 42d Street, as a theatrical space.
Such activity has jumped the rivers, too, spreading to hot neighborhoods like Dumbo in Brooklyn, where the experimental troupe Gale Gates et al. has its own 40,000-square-foot performance space. An additional large performance space and gallery, Smack Mellon, has opened in an old spice factory.
While the technical definition of Off Off Broadway is any theater with less than 100 seats, the term is also emblematic of the artistic standards of a movement that was born in the early 1960's. Those criteria -- being noncommercial, experimental and, in the words of the director Richard Caliban, "off the radar" -- are still embraced by a majority of downtown theater artists. But the term has also had its less flattering associations.
"To me, when I started, it seemed Off Off Broadway was synonymous with bad," said Jeremy Dobrish, the artistic director of the Adobe Theater. "It was like, 'I'm going to go, it's going to be hot, it's going to be cramped, the people won't know what they're doing, it will be pretentious and alienating, and I'm not going to have a good time." But, he said, downtown theater in New York is "different now," more like "the independent film scene."
Conversations with some 20 downtown theater artists supported the notion that changes were afoot, though some said the reasons might be more personal than professional.
"I think we were all just sick of playing for our friends," said Jim Findlay, the co-artistic director of Collapsable Giraffe. "I'd rather have an audience of 25 people I don't know than 40 friends."
Another factor that has had an effect is dwindling Government support. "This generation of artists came up not expecting to get a grant," said Mark Russell, the executive director of Performance Space 122 in the East Village. "All these guys came of age after the N.E.A. Four and the Karen Finley episode. You say Karen Finley, and they have a blank look on their faces. It's like Kennedy getting shot. They don't remember it." (In 1990, Ms. Finley and three other performance artists had their Federal grants revoked by the National Endowment for the Arts after conservative Congressmen objected to using government money for what was deemed by some to be obscene art. )
The new climate, Mr. Clancy said, has made Off Off Broadway more self-sufficient: "The 1990's are really a time when people started thinking in a businesslike fashion -- if you're going to keep your doors open, you're going to have to earn money. And part of that is understanding that you're in the service industry. and that that goes not only for the art but also the conditions." In short, cramped basements and creaky folding chairs are out; air-conditioning and comfortable seating are in.
But does all this spit and polish mean that downtown theater has lost its edge? One elder statesman said he had found indications of trouble. "I haven't seen anyone walking out angrily like they did from my work," said Richard Foreman, the experimental director. "That's a bad sign."
Young downtown types scoff at the thought that they have gone soft. And, to be sure, gratuitous nudity, violence and simulated kinky sex can still be found in a number of shows. Some say, though, that the content of downtown theater work has become more populist -- more easily accessible and less cynical. But part of that, said David Latham of the Premium Bob troupe, has to do with "shock fatigue."
"Who hasn't seen someone urinate onstage?" asked Mr. Latham.
Even without a Finley-style controversy, directors agree that Government grants for small companies have diminished during the 1990's, while private support has improved and corporate support has dwindled.
David Herskovits, the artistic director of Target Margin, said the losses in corporate support have been "particularly disgraceful," considering the money being made in the 1990's.
But what of the boom? Has there been a trickle down?
Off Off Broadway producers are divided. Some say that New York's economic resurgence has caused nothing but headaches, raising rents and production costs. Dixon Place, a performance space on the Bowery, recently announced it would have to move because its rent had been increased; other theater spaces and companies are still operating hand-to-mouth.
"What Off Off Broadway means," said Jeff Sugg, a lighting designer, "is you still ask if you're getting paid."
Others say the boom has made downtown fashionable and safe again, a comfortable place for monied audiences and producers to seek out new work.
Then there are the peripheral benefits. "There are literally 175 new condos being built next door to us and they were expensive," said Michelle Stern, a co-founder of Gale Gates. "So we have an audience literally right next door that walks by every day."
The influx of young people into the city is also being felt. "Broadway is always talking about trying to get a young audience, but I go to see one of these shows at HERE, or the Ontological, or the Flea, and I feel like I'm clubbing," said Stephen Nunns, a director and an editor for American Theater magazine. "It's the most beautiful audience I've ever seen."
The roster of popular downtown theater spaces has expanded in the last few years. Newer ones like Access Theater in TriBeCa and the Present Company's Theatorium on the Lower East Side are home to a steady stream of work of their own as well as that of renters. The same is true of theaters like HERE, the SoHo Rep and the Workhouse Theater (now known as the Flea Theater). Of the older performance spaces, P.S. 122 on First Avenue and Ninth Street, the Ontological at St. Mark's Church and Second Avenue, the Ohio Theater and the Performing Garage, both on Wooster Street in SoHo, are still vibrant breeding grounds for young artists.
And look at them come. "More and more training schools churn out more and more actors who arrive in New York City," said Mr. Beall of the Pure Pop Festival. "And it becomes harder and harder for younger theater artists to carve out a spot."
Which is where, ironically, the Fringe Festival comes in. The Fringe's role is to "provide access and opportunity to talent without reputation and without resources and without cash and without experience," said Mr. Clancy. But some larger companies, he added, have also begun to look at the Fringe as a place to present work in its early stages.
At the same time, Mr. Clancy acknowledged, most of the better-established companies have little motivation to perform at his festival, where several companies share the same theater and where turnaround time between different shows can be as little as 15 minutes. "For a company like Elevator Repair Service," he said, "is this going to serve them? I don't know."
John Collins, the artistic director of Elevator Repair Service, said: "All these festivals are working at the very basic level, and though I probably shouldn't say this, some of it can be really awful stuff. But that's a great kind of evidence that companies are still generating raw material, and the festivals keep trying to give the work a chance."
For their part, those involved in downtown theater seem to respect the Fringe. "I asked someone about the Fringe and they said, 'It's cheap, and we get a venue for our play,' " Mr. Herskovits said. "And I said, "Fantastic. That's all you need.' "
Not, of course, that they don't have a few suggestions: more international programming for one, and oh, yes, more good stuff. Mr. Clancy said he's working on it.

HEADLINE: FILM;
When the Spice of Choice Was Sin

BYLINE: By J. HOBERMAN; J. Hoberman is senior film critic for The Village Voice.

 BODY:
"I WISH to join the Legion of Decency, which condemns vile and unwholesome moving pictures. I unite with all who protest against them as a grave menace to youth, to home life, to country and to religion." So began a pledge written in the spring of 1934 by the Archbishop of Cincinnati, John T. McNicholas. Distributed in Roman Catholic churches across America, the petition garnered some four million signatures within a month.
Racy and insolent, populated by dynamic, street-smart criminals and glamorous "fallen women" in scanty lingerie, set in Art Deco penthouses and skid row dives, predicated on breezy wisecracks and slangy double-entendres that confounded censors and offended less cosmopolitan audiences, the Hollywood movies of the early 1930's were a different world. Or were they? "I condemn absolutely those salacious motion pictures which, with other degrading agencies, are corrupting public morals and promoting sex mania in our land," the Legion of Decency pledge continued. 
 Adopted four years before the Legion began its crusade, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America Production Code had proscribed undue exposure, indecent dancing, lustful kissing, obscenity and explicit adultery, seduction or rape, not to mention "sex perversion," "white slavery" and "miscegenation." But the Code was not truly in force, having gone into effect just as the movie industry was stunned by two surprise developments, one technological, the other economic. Movies became "talkies" even as hard times battered a business previously imagined depression-proof.
Two years after the stock market crash, Warner Brothers and Fox were suffering heavy losses. Universal had discharged hundreds of its employees. RKO was already in receivership. Paramount, which would declare bankruptcy the following year, was selling off its theaters. Weekly movie attendance was 60 percent of what it had been before the Depression began. By the summer of 1932, a third of American moviehouses had gone dark, and exhibitors were experimenting with exploitation angles ranging from double bills to dish giveaways to bingo games. Producers were desperate and, as demonstrated by "The Joy of Pre-Code: Sex, Booze and Red Hot Jazz, 1930-33," a 44-film series starting on Friday at Film Forum 2, they pushed the weakly enforced Code to its limits and beyond.
For anyone brought up on the movies of the 1940's and 1950's, those of the early 30's can be a revelation. Sinners escape punishment and virtue is not necessarily rewarded. Crime sometimes pays and marriage vows are frequently flouted. Self-interest is a near-universal principle. Fast-talking, tough-acting James Cagney became Warner Brothers' top star by hustling his way up from the streets, but he was scarcely the only tiger in the urban jungle. The now-forgotten Warren William ("Skyscraper Souls," "Employees Entrance"), oiliest of alpha males and caddish personification of ruthless capitalism, abused the men and seduced the women lucky enough to be working but unfortunate enough to be working for him.
Women acted out as well. If the former factory worker Joan Crawford was kept by the Park Avenue lawyer Clark Gable in MGM's enormously successful "Possessed" (1931), the more proactive Jean Harlow wrecked her boss's home, then married and betrayed him in the 1932 comedy "Red-Headed Woman." In "Female" (1933), Warner Brothers' biggest female star, Ruth Chatterton, ran an automobile plant and satisfied her sex drive with a succession of handsome young employees. Marlene Dietrich sold her body to support her sick husband in "Blonde Venus" (1932). That movie lost money for Paramount, but the studio struck gold with Mae West -- even if Will Hays, the mostly ineffectual head of the producers' and directors' Code, did manage to keep them from titling her second vehicle "It Ain't No Sin."
"Baby Face" (1933), which opens the series on a bill with the luridly expressionist Edward G. Robinson vehicle "Two Seconds" (1932), is a crude, still-powerful morality play in which Barbara Stanwyck systematically sleeps her way to the pinnacle of economic power. Dreamed up by the Warner production boss Darryl Zanuck in the wake of MGM's "Red-Headed Woman," the movie single-mindedly tracks Stanwyck's climb from a gritty Pennsylvania steel town, where she is pimped by her father in his speakeasy, to control of a New York bank. Each new conquest celebrated by a honkytonk chorus from "St. Louis Blues," Stanwyck is a femme fatal as inexorable as the Depression itself: her discarded men lose their jobs, their fortunes and, in two cases, their lives.
Bruce Goldstein, the director of repertory programming at Film Forum 2, calls "Baby Face" the quintessential pre-Code movie, although he singles out the moment in the 1932 "Call Her Savage" when an amorous Great Dane jumps Clara Bow as "the most astonishing pre-Code shot." Mr. Goldstein organized his first pre-Code series 11 years ago. "I don't think anyone had ever done one before," he says. "The period was completely overlooked. They never showed these films on television when I was growing up. Not one of them is a 'classic' and that's why it was a discovery for most people." Film Forum's "Hollywood Before the Code" not only clicked at the box office but also won national publicity.
Within the year, Mr. Goldstein said, revival houses in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco ran similar programs, while MGM Home Video issued a collection of pre-Code movies. The forthcoming series is Film Forum's fourth, and interest in the period continues to grow. Two books are scheduled for publication this fall, Thomas Doherty's scholarly history, "Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930-34" and Mark A. Vieira's lavish coffee-table volume, "Sin in Soft Focus."
Initially, the pre-Code movies were attacked for their amoral violence. The 1931-32 gangster cycle drew most of the heat -- even Al Capone professed to disapprove, telling reporters that movies like "Public Enemy" and "Little Caesar" were "doing nothing but harm to the younger element of the country." By 1932, the studios were cranking out "bad girl" movies. Variety, which attributed their popularity to the female audience, would estimate that 80 percent of the 440 pictures released during the 1932-33 season had some sort of "sex slant." Nevertheless, some movies were more scarlet than others, and "Red-Headed Woman" in particular sent studios stampeding down the primrose path.
AN Irving Thalberg project, written by Anita Loos to relaunch Harlow at her new studio, "Red-Headed Woman" was as much throwback as innovation. The irresistible vamp who haunted the American screen 15 years earlier in the exotic form of Theda Bara was resurrected as a gum-chewing stenographer. Sound brought silent movies down to earth, and Harlow embodied the triumph of the vulgar, seducing her married prey on his living room sofa with his photograph pinned to her garter. As comic as she is steamy, Harlow's two-timing golddigger maintains audience sympathy even when she petulantly shoots her estranged husband. Nor does the movie see fit to punish her. The bad girl winds up in Paris, mistress to a marquis, with a handsome chauffeur in tow.
"Red-Headed Woman" inspired Warner Brothers to make "Baby Face" and Fox to adapt Tiffany Thayer's risque "Call Her Savage" as the comeback vehicle for the erstwhile "It Girl," Clara Bow, after sound and scandal short-circuited her career. (Plodding as cinema and racist in its implications, this sordid saga of a half American Indian vixen is best known today for its often anthologized scene of two men dressed as French maids entertaining the patrons of a Greenwich Village speakeasy.) Paramount adapted William Faulkner's sensational "Sanctuary" in 1933 for the "The Story of Temple Drake" (thrill-seeking Southern belle slips into degradation after she is raped by a gangster and dumped in a New Orleans brothel), while embarking on a protracted struggle to bring Broadway's bawdy sensation, Mae West, to Hollywood. Hays managed to delay West's screen debut but failed to prevent it. Released in early 1933, "She Done Him Wrong" grossed $2 million in less than two months, returning 10 times its production costs in North America alone.
In many cases, pre-Code advertising promised more sex than the movies themselves delivered. (For "Baby Face" -- "She Had IT and Made IT Pay.") The strategy ultimately backfired. It was a movie billboard that so offended Denis Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia that he called for a boycott of all movies. The first selective boycotts had been organized by the Detroit diocese during the summer of 1933. With the Legion of Decency pledge promoted from the pulpit and Mae West pilloried in the Hearst press, the crusade gathered momentum over the next 10 months. "Hollywood is in the most serious crisis of its history," The Los Angeles Times reported in June 1934. With the creation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration, which sought to regulate film exhibition practices, the studios were worried that the Federal Government might then try to police movie content as well. Once the Bank of America's chairman, A. H. Giannini, threatened to link continued financing to Production Code Administration approval, the industry buckled.
That summer, Hays had appointed the hard-nosed and well-connected Catholic journalist Joseph Breen to enforce the Code. (As Mr. Doherty points out, pre-Code is a misnomer; the correct term should be pre-Breen.) From then on, as the screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz paraphrased the Code for his peers, the hero and heroine have to be virgins, while the villain can have sex with anybody he wants, "cheating and stealing, getting rich and whipping the servants." He added, "But you have to shoot him in the end." By 1935, Hollywood had passed from inspired disorder into the golden age of regulation.
Did the Code improve American movies as well as morals? Mr. Doherty concludes his detailed and fascinating study by stating the "inconvenient truth" that Hollywood's "most vivid and compelling motion pictures" were produced "under the most severe and narrow-minded censorship." And yet the early, free-wheeling 30's churned up a remarkable number of enduring celluloid archetypes, ranging from gangsters and gold diggers through Dracula and King Kong, to such pop icons as W. C. Fields, Mae West, the Marx Brothers, Betty Boop and even Mickey Mouse. Moreover, individual filmmakers as distinguished as Ernst Lubitsch, Josef von Sternberg and Busby Berkeley produced their finest work during the pre-Code period.
There is something to be said for crisis as a stimulus to popular art. Similarly, the transformation of movies to talkies served to break existing rules for narrative filmmaking, even as the Depression pushed producers towards wild experimentation. Taken as a whole, the movies of the early 30's constitute a distinctive American idiom. The strongest pre-Code movies are as rowdy, pungent and oddball as the Sunday funnies or the country blues. Tawdry gems like the electric-chair flashback "Two Seconds," the declasse daisy-chain "Blood Money" -- a madam loves a bail bondsman who loves a masochistic debutante who loves a bank robber -- or the tropical, "No Exit"-like nightmare "Safe in Hell" are hard-boiled beyond belief and almost kabuki in their economy of means.
Indeed, thanks to their Depression-induced frugality and the exigencies of the double feature, pre-Code movies are admirably terse. Perhaps even more wondrous than their convoluted, down-and-dirty narratives is the seemingly lost art of squeezing such shenanigans into a highly satisfying 70 minutes.

HEADLINE: Perfect Together, New Jersey and Kitsch;
From the Diners to the Rest Stops, There She Goes Again, Miss America

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
WELCOME to New Jersey, the kitsch capital of the world, from Lucy the Elephant to the Joyce Kilmer rest area.
Salt water taffies and Silver Stream-like diners. 
 Trenton makes the world takes.
From Sinatra's Hoboken to Steel Pier's diving horse.
From Miss America to Elsie the Cow.
A traipse through the trivia, from Lindbergh to the Hindenburg and from Hoffa to the mafia.
It's enough to make Jimmy sit up, claw his way out of end zone at Giants Stadium and growl, "Cheez, can't a guy get any rest here?"
So you get in the family minivan, pop in a Bruce Springsteen tape, and don't stop until you climb your way into the Berkshires -- an area with its own cachet born of places like Tanglewood, Jacob's Pillow and Alice's Restaurant -- and there it is dominating a shop window in Great Barrington, Mass.: a huge poster of the late, lamented Palisades Amusement Park.
Arghh.
The beautifully framed reprint of a 1909 poster shows the small figures of people in silly-looking turn-of-the-century-garb taking trolleys to the summit to spend a day on the rides.
"I have sold more of that poster than of any single poster we have in here," said Margaret Wheeler, an owner of the shop. "It's been remarkable."
Not bad, considering that it sells for $165 framed and $32 unframed. But the amusement park is just one part of Jersey lore that has spawned an entire industry of Jerseyana -- books that rhapsodize about Jersey diners and the New Jersey Turnpike, beer mugs and magnets that display lighthouses and recordings like Dave Van Ronk's whimsical "Garden State Stomp" whose only lyrics are New Jersey's eclectic place names ("Allamuchy, Hacklebarney, Rockaway, Piscataway . . .")
New Jersey downright abounds in tchotchkes, whether they're found in concession stands down the shore or gift shops along the turnpike and the Garden State Parkway or even in bookstores.
Maybe only Florida and California -- and the operative word is maybe -- have cultures that mass-produce as much kitsch. But many of the people there have migrated from New Jersey. You don't believe that? The next time you're in a Chinese restaurant or a delicatessen in Boca Raton, stand up and ask how many people remember Syd's in Newark.
The outpouring of books alone about everything from the archetypal to the arcane in New Jersey has boomed enough in recent years to have set back several forests in the Pacific Northwest well into the next millennium. There are, for example, "Palisades Amusement Park: A Century of Fond Memories," "Jersey Diners," "Roadside New Jersey," "New Jersey Trivia," "New Jersey Firsts: The Famous, Infamous and Quirky of the Garden State" and "Murdered in New Jersey."
In some Barnes & Noble stores -- like the palace on Route 17 South in Paramus -- the display of books and magazines devoted to New Jersey is lavish. But even in the smallest shops the browser can find a healthy selection on history and geography, day-tripping, gardening, golfing, canoeing, hiking trails and motor routes, and shopping and weekend visits.
What is it about the state that has set off an unquenchable interest in things Jersey and created this huge cache of kitsch?
Cultural anthropologists -- from vaunted institutions of higher learning to neighborhood bars -- say New Jersey has been drawing a lot of attention of late for a variety of reasons. They include the resurrection of a popular marketing slogan, "New Jersey and You, Perfect Together," from the days of Gov. Tom Kean; a prosperous economy; the Presidential aspirant in basketball shoes, Bill Bradley; the latest concert tour of the quintessential Jersey spokesmen, Boss Springsteen and the E Street Band, and "The Sopranos," the highly rated television show about mob life in which New Jersey locations give a gritty but not unappealing view of life in the land of the exit ramps and jug handles.
But one answer right from the get-go -- ironic for a state accused of having an identity crisis -- is personality.
Yes, personality, says the gourmand Michael Stern, who traverses the countryside with his wife Jane. Together, they report on what they eat for Gourmet Magazine and "The Splendid Table" on National Public Radio. Mr. Stern says New Jersey -- unlike many states -- including his home state of Connecticut, has a strong personality.
"There's kitsch from the Jersey Shore," he says. "There's diner kitsch. There's Jersey Turnpike kitsch. Then there's the whole horsy part of New Jersey, which has its own kitsch.
"I admire New Jersey the way the class wallflower admires the person who has a million friends and has a colorful personality," he says. "New Jersey has a colorful personality, and that explains why it has so much, from the tackiest kind of kitsch to the very cultural type of New Jersey artifacts."
But not so fast. Mr. Stern acknowledges that this can work against the state, too.
"It's a mixed blessing because New Jersey is the butt of a lot of jokes," he says. "But it's only the butt of jokes because it has a personality. Nobody makes a joke about New Hampshire because there's no popular cultural identity there."
Year after year, punch line after after punch line, New Jersey kitsch absorbs the negatives and almost revels in the things that people used to ridicule, like the turnpike and such famous murders as the slaying of Charles Lindbergh's young son, the case of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, or most recently the murder of little Megan Kanka, which spawned Megan's Law requiring sex offenders to notify the authorities when they move into a neighborhood.
"I'm from New Jersey/I don't expect too much/If the world ended today/I would adjust," is the refrain from the song by John Gorka, "I'm From New Jersey," that in confronting some of the negative images of the state head-on becomes a paean to the malleability of its people.
Dave Van Ronk's "Garden State Stomp," although nothing more than a quirky compendium of Jersey place names, taken all together becomes something more, something almost celebratory of their uniqueness.
The magazine "Weird N.J.: Your Travel Guide To New Jersey's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets" gleefully reports the offbeat and nutty, leaving the more salutary to a proliferation of other magazines, "New Jersey Monthly," "NJ The Magazine, for New Jersey," "New Jersey Life, Town & Country Living at Its Best," "New Jersey Country Roads" and "Outdoor New Jersey."
"I think we in New Jersey looked around one day and discovered the New Jersey joke is still alive but it's in hibernation," says Michael Aaron Rockland, head of American Studies at Rutgers University in New Brunswick who has written books and several articles about New Jersey, including why New Jersey is so often the butt of jokes.
"What I think I've seen in recent years is a growth in Jersey pride, kind of in a sense a New Jersey renaissance," Mr. Rockland says. "You used to apologize about coming from New Jersey, Now you brag about it, although we don't go as far as the people from Texas."
Once, Mr. Rockland says, T-shirts like, "New Jersey: Only the Tough Survive," were everywhere. That was in the 1970's, when, according to Cliff Zukin, director of the Star Ledger-Eagleton Poll at Rutgers, New Jerseyans had a low opinion of their own state compared with how people in other states felt about theirs.
"Years ago we used to see things like that," says Tommie Sanders, vice president for operations at Host Marriot Services operations in New Jersey and New York City, which manages the rest stops along the turnpike and the parkway.
"But we don't sell stuff like that anymore," Mr. Sanders says. "We sell a lot of 'You and New Jersey, Perfect Together' type of shirts."
Got a problem with that? Just walk into the gift shop in the Cheesequake service area of the Parkway (milepost 125), the busiest of all, and there is a shirt on display that waxes almost Biblical about the state: "His orchestration by the Sea -- A mesmerizing symphony. Jersey Shore."
It's almost enough to make a guy from Perth Amboy hunger for a veggie burger. Well, maybe not.
A display case nearby features the usual hats and shirts -- but also an adult nightshirt and a teddy bear in a T-shirt, all emblazoned with "New Jersey." And on a wall of shelves beyond that is more colorful apparel praising the state, including a T-shirt that reads: "Someone who loves me very much went to the Jersey shore and brought me back this shirt."
The shore -- down the shore, to be precise -- all 127 miles. Atlantic City and Cape May inns are prominent motifs: shot glasses and beer mugs and a coffee mug with a display of Jersey lighthouses called "Beacons of Light at the Jersey Shore;" key chains with an ace of spades to lament or fondly recall a trip to the tables, and enough refrigerator magnets modeled after Cape May's Victorian houses to make the Earth implode at the poles.
A far cry, you might say, from the classic postcard that showed a mosquito and the words: "New Jersey State Bird."
"I'm from Florida," said Mr. Sanders, "and when I first came up here, nobody wanted to buy anything from New Jersey. They wanted souvenirs of New York and Pennsylvania."
Now, he says, "We sell replicas of New Jersey lighthouses, when we're not running out of them."
David Ryan, general services manager for the New Jersey Highway Authority, who oversees the service areas, estimates that in the last five years the amount of New Jersey merchandise sold in the souvenir shops has doubled and maybe even tripled.
"People are traveling more and, as they travel more, they get to understand what New Jersey has to offer and appreciate it more than they used to," Mr. Ryan says.
But long before there was rebirth in New Jersey, there was an older, industrial New Jersey captured in Americana in the form of Nipper the dog and the Campbell soup can immortalized on canvas by Andy Warhol.
Nipper originally sat in a tower atop the Camden building that was home to the Radio Corporation of America and its predecessor, the Victor Talking Machine Company, leaning toward a gramophone and listening to "his master's voice." It was a beacon displaying a well-known commercial logo and a symbol of industrial Camden.
As for Warhol, according to a brother, the artist's love affair with Campbell's had its roots in their Pittsburgh childhood, when it was the family's favorite soup. Nonetheless, the Campbell Soup Company was always a bit leery about having him involved with the brand.
So when did New Age New Jersey become respectable -- or at least popular, like the bad boy in the T-shirt and jeans all the girls would like to spend a weekend with down the shore? Mr. Zukin of the Eagleton Poll says New Jersey began to get a better sense of itself and cast a different national image with the creation of the Meadowlands Sports Complex and and the advent of gambling in Atlantic City.
And that good feeling continues today with a prosperous economy, the creation of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark and the growth of minor league baseball in parks throughout the state.
"These are sort of little icons popping up," Mr. Zukin says.
But as strong as the kitsch industry is in New Jersey, Mr. Stern insists it is not the leader, despite the turnpike, Jersey mosquitoes, Jersey diners, Stewart's Root Beer stands and the jokes about Jimmy Hoffa being buried under a goal post in the Meadowlands.
"If I had to identify the kitsch capital of America it would not be New Jersey," he says. "It would be Florida, and it has been that way for decades. I think California has slipped as far as having that aura that produces the postcards and tacky souvenirs to hang on the wall."
Helping to enhance New Jersey's image is the wide range of books extolling everything from its geology to, as one book title puts it, "funky adventures."
Not surprisingly, Rutgers University Press is the largest publisher of books about New Jersey, with about 80 new titles a year, said its director, Marlie Wasserman.
Of those, said Ms. Wasserman, 70 percent are scholarly and 30 percent are regional books that "celebrate the state."
Twenty years ago, she said, regional books made up only 5 percent of the publisher's total output. "It's a jump in so-called coffee table books, but it's because we decided to make it happen," Ms. Wasserman says. "We made it a major goal."
Okay, but why? "Our main purpose is to disseminate knowledge," she explained. "Notice the use of the word 'knowledge' rather than 'scholarship.' Knowledge includes scholarship -- knowledge of trails and roads and butterflies and the general history of the state as well as the academic."
Two of the publisher's most popular books that have sold well nationally are "Jersey Diners" by Peter Genovese, a reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark and "Palisades Amusement Park, N.J.: A Century of Fond Memories," by Vince Gargiulo, a graphic artist. "Diners" has sold 9,000 copies since it was published in 1996, and "Palisades Park" 11,000 since it came out in 1995.
That is a significant number says Christopher Kerr, a freelance sales representative for Parson Weems, a company that represents university presses, considering the average press run of a book is from 3,500 to 5,000. The sales figures also give some indication of the increased interest in things New Jersey.
Things New Jersey and diners -- they're almost synonymous terms. And though the diner was not born here, Mr. Genovese writes, New Jersey has far more than any other state -- 570 by his last count -- in part because three of the nation's four diner manufacturers are situated in the state.
"I also like to think there is something innately New Jersey about a diner," he writes. "Diners are colorful and kitschy, and in New Jersey, which Rutgers University professor Michael Aaron Rockland calls the roadside pop architecture capital of the world, they have found a home."
What's more, in addition to the 570 diners serving ham and eggs and meatloaf and malteds, the older ones are finding new homes in Europe, thereby spreading New Jersey kitsch abroad. The former Beach Haven Diner is now open for business in Barcelona; the Excellent Diner, formerly of Westfield, is now serving cups of joe in Aalen, Germany.
Mr. Genovese is no stranger to New Jersey kitsch. In 1994 he came out with "Roadside New Jersey," also published by Rutgers Press, which deals with roadside pop architecture including Lucy, the three-story metal and wood elephant in Margate that was born in the last century as an inn and is now a museum.
Former Governor Kean could well have coined the phrase, "New Jersey and Kitsch, perfect together." Ask Mr. Gargiulo, who says that since the publication of his book "Palisades Amusement Park, N.J.: A Century of Fond Memories," he has been inundated with letters and E-mail from all over the country.
"If I had to attribute it to anything, it's probably two factors," says Mr. Gargiulo, who is founder and director of the Palisades Amusement Park Historial Society. "One is the craze for nostalgia and remembering happier times, and the other is a love and devotion for the state."
Margaret Wheeler, who with Holly Hamer operates Mill River Studio in Great Barrington, said that most of the people who buy the Palisades Park poster are from New York and New Jersey. "Everyone who comes in to buy it has a story to tell about how they went there as children or had a first date there or met a husband or wife," says Ms. Wheeler, who used to live in Summit.
The New Jerseyfication of America is not just a matter of perception. Don Linkey, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey of Princeton, an independent, nonprofit organization that provides information on trends and issues affecting New Jersey, says there appears to be a growing interest in the state.
Mr. Linkey says he bases this on the sales of "The New Jersey Almanac," which the institute publishes. Since the almanac's publication in 19xx, it has sold out it first press run of 430 copies, and 600 copies of expanded second edition went on sale in the spring.
The book is crammed with facts and statistics about things like New Jersey taxes but also touches on such Garden State esoterica as the icon that spawned a hockey team, the Jersey Devil, and tons of books, mugs and sweat shirts. "There seems to be a strong interest in memorabilia," Mr. Linkey says.
Don't want a mug, a book, a sweatshirt, some decals, a lighthouse keychain? No interest in a collection of diner photos, pictures of boardwalks, jetties, fishing boats or garish gamblers? Then how about a CD called "Sounds for the Soul" that came out earlier this year with songs about New Jersey or by New Jersey artists, including "My Hometown" by Bruce Springsteen, "Jersey Girl," by Tom Waits, Mr. Gorca's, "I'm From New Jersey," Mr. Van Ronk's " Garden State Stomp" and "I Like Jersey Best!" sung by John Pizzarelli Jr.
Despite a spotty distribution network, including Barnes & Noble and the Internet, the CD quickly sold out 1,000 copies and is now in a second life with another 1,000.
The driving force behind the CD was Jane Roberti, a social worker from Edgewater who assembled a group of volunteers and managed to get permission to use the songs free of charge with the proceeds going to five New Jersey charities.
"People who live here are proud of the record and the state," Ms. says Roberti. "The interesting reaction was that people said they wanted to hear more and said, 'Let me tell you what other songs there are and maybe you can do it again.' "
As when a generation ago, Simon and Garfinkel were "counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike" while trying to unscramble the mysteries of 1960's America.
Despite the songs by such heavyweights as Bruce Springsteen and Tom Waits, the most popular cut turned out to be a commercial for the Palisades Amusement Park by Gladys Shelley that was broadcast incessantly on the radio, urging everyone to "come on over."
But when it comes to this latter-day love affair with New Jersey, there is more than just nostalgia at work. Consider the HBO hit "The Sopranos," a prime-time series about an organized crime boss who is undergoing psychoanalysis when he is not seeing to the family business.
David Chase, its creator, writer and sometime director, has insisted that all exteriors be shot in New Jersey. The result has been that New Jersey, in all its grittiness and beauty, has become as important a character as the actors on the screen.
Mr. Rockland, who co-wrote "Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike," said New Jersey has long had the same gritty down-to-earth image as the turnpike, which has always fascinated artists who are alternately repelled by and attracted to it.
No one captures this dichotomy better than Bruce Springsteen.
"I think Bruce Springsteen is a major figure in the New Jersey renaissance," says Mr. Rockland, "He didn't sing silly songs about wonderful and perfect New Jersey. Quite the contrary, he took those raunchy aspects -- which 'Saturday Night Live' and Woody Allen put down -- and made them attractive. Turnpike riding on a wet night beneath the refineries' glow out where great black rivers flow -- images of hell, but it's also one that's exciting. He said it's so bad, it's good."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Obstructions to New Rental Projects Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
ON Sept. 14, a referendum will be held in New Canaan. If it succeeds, the voters will have blocked a $5 million appropriation meant to cover the cost of moving the town's public works garage to a landfill area, thus scuttling plans for a fully approved 104-unit apartment complex by Avalon Bay Communities of Alexandria, Va., that is to be constructed on the garage site.
In New Canaan and three other southwestern Connecticut towns -- Darien, Wilton and Orange -- grass-roots opposition to Avalon's luxury rental communities seems to reinforce recent decisions by state courts. 
 Elsewhere in Connecticut, in the towns of Glastonbury, Newtown and Bridgewater, state courts have upheld local planning and zoning commissions' decisions to deny various developers' applications that conformed to Connecticut's affordable-housing law. The applications were rejected primarily because of a shortage of sewers and of potable water.
The law is intended to provide housing for people of moderate means in towns where zoning regulations and land costs preclude almost all housing for lower-income families. On average, well under 3 percent of the housing in Fairfield County's affluent towns qualifies as "affordable housing," a proportion that falls far short of the 10 percent goal that the state has set for all 169 towns statewide.
Under the 1989 law, developers are allowed to build more densely if one-quarter of their projects are priced below market rates, leading many critics of development to believe that developers use the law to benefit themselves, building large, out-of-scale projects.
Such critics contend that densities ranging from 100 to more than 300 units per complex can overwhelm services in towns with small populations accustomed to single-family homes on one-acre lots. But density is the key to making a project economically feasible.
Antipathy toward rental housing -- the only housing that Avalon builds -- and the word "affordable" persists. To many critics, "affordable housing" is an invitation to undesirable transients with no vested interest in the town. The law requires that affordable units remain so for 30 years.
Nonetheless, Avalon has been notably successful at winning court cases and building formulaic but elegant apartment compounds, with swimming pools, gymnasiums, clubhouses and other amenities residents can use without charge.
One of the largest developers of rental apartments in the state, Avalon has built four market-rate complexes in Stamford and two in Danbury, cities in which the amount of low-cost housing exceeds 10 percent of the total. Under the affordable-housing law, Avalon has built one complex each in the upscale towns of Wilton and Trumbull.
Nationwide it has built or owns 137 apartment communities containing 39,739 units in 16 states.
Samuel B. Fuller, regional vice president in the company's Wilton office, said that residents of other states have tended to accept affordable housing without the protracted legal battles that the company has encountered in Connecticut. "Connecticut is by far the worst," he said. "People are much more afraid of any kind of new development."
The dispute between New Canaan and Avalon began more than five years ago, when Avalon's application to build housing and some retail stores on a three-acre downtown parcel next to the railroad station was rejected, revised and rejected again. Avalon sued New Canaan under the affordable-housing law, saying the town had failed to provide compelling reasons for the denials.
Avalon won that case and prevailed on appeal, but after the town approved the project, a citizen-led referendum to condemn the site for use as a commuter parking lot was passed. Rather than fight an injunction obtained by Avalon to halt condemnation, a land swap was negotiated.
Avalon and the town agreed to exchange the Mill Pond public works site for the downtown parcel in 1997. New Canaan got the commuter parking space it wanted downtown, and Avalon got a suitable construction site as well as a 99-year lease-back on a small portion of the downtown site. It expects to build a 15,000-square-foot building there for its Connecticut headquarters and other offices. The town agreed to bear the $5 million cost of moving the public works buildings to the landfill area.
John M. Potts, a Democratic candidate for First Selectman in the coming election and an opponent of development on either site, calls the swap "giving away the store."
IN an agreement made outside the provisions of the affordable-housing law, Avalon agreed to set aside 21 apartments at Mill Pond for town employees, using a state formula in which the area's median income of $94,300 is the basis for computing eligible incomes and rents. The lower rents, deemed "affordable" by the town, would be $1,508 to $2,800 a month for one- to three-bedroom apartments. Market-price rents would range from $1,700 to $3,100 a month.
Save Mill Pond Park, the name of a citizens' group spearheading opposition to the development, "is a misnomer," said John Cannavino of the Stamford law firm of Cummings & Lockwood. He has represented the town during the years of litigation. "The pond and park areas will not be lost," he said, noting that Avalon's plan will not disturb them. The existing garage, salt storage building, unpaved parking area and dump site for construction debris will be replaced by apartments, landscaping and a public nature trail around the pond, he said.
Richard P. Bond, the Republican First Selectman, who is up for re-election in November, said he supported the Avalon project.
"My position is that we should go ahead with the exchange of property," he said. "It is the most beneficial solution for the town. We are not in the hands of the courts to make a decision on condemnation or to establish the price." The cost of moving the garage, he said, would be half that of condemnation.
Avalon cannot set a date to break ground on the property until it changes hands. Mr. Fuller said that if the referendum passed, the swap would be canceled and Avalon would proceed with its original plan to develop the downtown site.
Mr. Potts and many other town residents opposed the town's adoption of a new zoning category, large-lot apartment development, which was suggested by Avalon for the Mill Pond site. The new designation allows the developer to build higher-density apartments. The critics believe that other developers working under the affordable-housing law will apply the designation to any 5-acre lot with 100-foot frontage on a state road where sewers and public water were available.
"Untrue," said Hiram Peck, New Canaan's Town Planner. "The standards limit where the zone can be located -- on a very small portion of state roads that run through town. There are few potential parcels for which it is applicable." His office is revising New Canaan's long-range plan and zoning regulations, including limiting the expansion of sewer and water districts into residential areas to discourage housing developments.
In Darien, a citizens' movement supported by the Board of Selectmen is focused on condemning a site where Avalon plans to build 189 apartments, some affordable, on 32 acres near the railroad station. Avalon obtained an injunction to halt the action until briefs are filed in State Superior Court in Stamford next month.
Darien's lawyer, John Wayne Fox, recently obtained permission from Superior Court to make test borings on Avalon's property for environmental reasons, despite the fact that the town's environmental protection agency had already approved the project.
Jay Sandak, a lawyer for Avalon, objected, saying the town had no right to enter the property until it had determined a public purpose for it, had had it appraised, and had formally stated its intention to condemn. A decision is expected within the next few weeks.
In the town of Orange, voters recently approved a referendum to condemn a 30-acre parcel under contract to Avalon, where 168 units, including 25 percent at affordable rents, had been proposed. An injunction prevents any action until a Superior Court judge in Middletown makes a decision. The court is also considering Orange's rejection of Avalon's application for residential zoning approval at the site. The area is zoned for light industrial and residential development, said Timothy Hollister, another lawyer for Avalon.
Late last month a public hearing at Wilton High School broke into guffaws and catcalls when Avalon officials presented a proposal to build 119 housing units, some at affordable rents. Speakers objected to the location off Route 7, where traffic is heavy, and to the density -- more tightly packed than anything else in town. The hearing is to continue on Sept. 13.
John Scott of Scott Kinney Partners in Westport, a market research and real estate planning firm, spoke at the hearing on behalf of the developer. "After doing this for 25 years, I've concluded that the public doesn't like change in any form," Mr. Scott said in a telephone interview later. "There is a groundswell of anxiety today, which relates to overcrowded schools and stressed services. I find that hearings have become more belligerent. We are seeing elected commissioners who have always been able to put down an unruly audience but now tend to reflect the popular attitude of 'no growth.' "
Undaunted, Avalon continues to expand its presence in Connecticut. In Stamford, the 195-apartment Avalon Corners opened this month, and Greyrock Towers, with 306 units, is scheduled to open in 18 months. A schedule for 306 apartment units to be built on the site of the former Burdick School in Stamford has not yet been determined. In addition, Avalon has applied for permission to build 306 apartments in Newtown.

HEADLINE: Dogfight Over a Must-Win Contract

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: PALMDALE, Calif.

 BODY:
HERE in the Mojave Desert, in huge hangers guarded by armed sentries and high fences, the Government and its two biggest defense contractors are engaged in a high-stakes, high-risk experiment aimed at building a fighter aircraft that will dominate the skies and protect the nation's security for decades to come.
The project is still in its early stages, with the competing airplanes given the code names X-32 and X-35 and workers admonished not to utter a word. 
 But at the end of what the Pentagon promises will be a "winner-take-all" contest, either the Boeing Corporation or the Lockheed Martin Corporation will land what should be the biggest military contract ever. For both companies, this is a must-win competition: The winner will collect nearly a third of a trillion dollars -- and the loser could be out of the military aircraft business altogether.
For now, the companies' competing teams of engineers, test pilots, computer experts and factory workers are at work here, where the scrub soil gives way to an outpost of chain motels and fast-food restaurants, preparing for a flyoff early next year.
After that, and another year of testing and analysis, the Pentagon will make its pick. The winner will build a Joint Strike Fighter in three versions: one able to fly off carriers for the Navy, another to land on ground for the Air Force and a third that can hover into hot spots for the Marines. Nearly 5,000 of these planes are expected to be made, to replace nearly all the fighter planes flying today.
"This plane is the future," said Richard Aboulafia, director of aviation for the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Va. consulting firm. "It will be the fighter plane for all the services. It will be the fighter plane for all the world."
More than an airplane, the Joint Strike Fighter is an unprecedented test of cutting-edge technology, of how the Pentagon does business, of how wars will be fought. And it has profound implications for both the domestic military-industrial base and the nation's security well into the 21st century.
Faced with an increasingly skeptical Congress -- just last month, the House voted to delete funding for the Air Force's new F-22 fighter from next year's defense spending bill -- and a history of eye-popping cost overruns, the Pentagon decided it needed a fresh approach to procurement. And it is starting with the largest contract it has.
The order is a tall one: Design a single-engine, single pilot fighter that can be used by all three services and sold to overseas allies. It must fly faster than the speed of sound, be invisible to enemy radar -- and be produced for the bargain-basement price, by fighter aircraft standards, of around $30 million an airplane.
In building this plane, the Pentagon for the first time is making cost as important as performance. Boeing and Lockheed are being told not to build the best plane they can, but the best the Government can afford -- both in terms of its initial price tag and in maintenance costs over time. Rather than being the Cadillac of the air, the Joint Strike Fighter is designed more as a Chevrolet -- but with a Saturn-style attention to innovation and cost control.
"This program is about building an affordable fighter plane," said General Michael A. Hough, the Pentagon's director of the Joint Strike Fighter program. "It's the real deal. The country is going broke trying to pay for the latest airplane. We want to build it like your car -- just put gas in it and go."
The program is an attempt to break one of Augustine's Laws, a not entirely satirical calculation developed by Norman R. Augustine, the former Lockheed chief executive, that says the price of military aircraft is growing so fast that by the year 2054, the nation will be able to afford only one airplane.
THE Joint Strike Fighter will replace a generation of planes, some of which are 30 years old: Lockheed's workhorse F-16 and Northrop-Grumman's A-10 attack planes for the Air Force; the Marines' Harrier short take-off and vertical landing planes, built by Boeing and British Aerospace; and the Navy's carrier-based F-14 from Northrop and F/A-18 from Boeing. It is designed to work in tandem with the F-22, a far more expensive ($80 million) and sophisticated two-engine plane designed to eliminate enemy aircraft in initial air-to-air combat. The Joint Strike Fighter is designed to follow as part of a "hunter-killer" team, dropping bombs once the F-22 clears the skies.
"We needed to replace older and outmoded aircraft for all three services, and we could not afford to develop three different planes," said Darleen Druyun, the Air Force's top acquisition executive. "So it made sense to make a family of vehicles -- three planes with the same motor, the same avionics and 60 to 80 percent common parts, but with variations for all three services."
The comparison with earlier aircraft development programs is stark.
"In the past, I threw the requirements over the fence and a plane came back, and we didn't think about costs," said George K. Muellner, a retired Air Force general who once headed several acquistion programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter program, and is now a Boeing employee.
Still, for all the Pentagon's sentiments, questions remain.
* Can a plane that is three variations on a theme -- 80 percent the same for all, and otherwise modified to meet each service's special needs -- actually work? Or will it be a compromise that satisfies no one -- like the F-111, a Vietnam-era plane for all three services that was both costly and wildly unpopular.
* Will the Pentagon really stick to it's "winner-take-all" strategy, an approach that some analysts say would most likely leave the Defense Department with only one tactical aircraft supplier? Or will the military -- or Congress -- feel that the work must be split to keep two military aircraft makers in business, even if this increases program costs and reduces efficiency gains?
Everyone involved is mindful of the fate of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which was cut from the Joint Strike Fighter program and, as a result, forced to merge with Boeing in 1997 -- in spite of rosy statements at the time from Harry Stonecipher, then McDonnell's chief executive and now Boeing's president, that "this does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business."
* Can the Pentagon really shed its old, expensive ways? It says it wants an aircraft designed and produced using the best commercial practices to simplify the plane and lower costs over its operating life. But will the military begin to tinker and increase the price tag?
For instance, if the F-22 program is canceled or drastically reduced from the 339 planes now on order, would the Joint Strike Fighter's capabilities be upgraded in ways that could make it more expensive? Just this month, Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, warned that cancelling the F-22 could lead to a costly redesign of the Joint Strike Fighter.
* Are Boeing and Lockheed up to the task? Boeing has already been forced to drastically redesign its plane to provide better control on carrier landings, trading a swept-wing design for a more conventional one. Lockheed, meanwhile, has had few design changes, but has faced cost overruns in the $100 million range and been forced to scramble its plans for next year's demonstration tests to stay within budget.
* Will the plane sell? Plans call for the Air Force to buy 1,783 planes, the Marines 609 and the Navy 408, along with 150 for Britain's Royal Navy, which has invested $200 million in the program.
The Pentagon estimates that other countries will buy an additional 2,000 planes. But European countries might decide instead to support European offerings -- the French Rafale, the Swedish Gripen or the British Eurofighter -- even with their higher price tags and lower performance capabilities. And Congress, in another round of budget-cutting, could cut back on Joint Strike Fighter purchases, raising the price for each plane.
"In theory, the Joint Strike Fighter is a good idea," said Eugene Carroll, a retired two-star admiral, who is deputy director of the Center for Defense Information, a Washington nonprofit organization that has been critical of military spending. "So far, it's retained an air of common sense that we are looking for in an era when we are not facing a high-tech major power."
But Mr. Carroll sounded a note of caution: "If we can build this meat-and-potatoes airplane, let's press on. But let's not do the same thing to it that we've done in the past and get the requirements jazzed up so much its goals can't be met."
IN a setting that seems lifted from the "X-Files," the two companies are building competing "concept demonstration models" to show the Government early next year. Spy planes and space shuttles are designed in utmost secrecy here, but it's hard to hide the Joint Strike Fighter program. On the highway coming into town from Los Angeles, there's a huge billboard of a fighter zooming over the motto: "Boeing, the Best. JSF." Leaving town, you come upon Lockheed's billboard -- its fighter with the single word "Imminent."
Inside two huge hangers -- one at Lockheed's Skunk Works, the other at Boeing's Phantom Works -- each company is making a pair of airplanes, one of which will be reconfigured during the Pentagon's flyoff to demonstrate the requirements for different services. Right now, they are only carcasses of titanium and composite, electronics and wires. But by year-end, they will become airplanes -- at a cost of about $500 million for each pair. The Government's total tab for the development process is about $2.2 billion, including $832 million to Pratt & Whitney for the engines for all the planes.
The real question here is just how serious the Pentagon is about "winner-take-all." Can the Pentagon come to the desert, hand one company a golden prize and leave the other empty-handed?
The Pentagon says yes. "I've been ordered to pick a winner," said General Hough. "I don't know how you can have two winners."
Officially, both companies take the Pentagon at its word, though observers argue that the nation cannot afford to be reduced to a single supplier of tactical military aircraft. Or, they say, political pressures will be such that both companies will get some business. That, though, could sharply escalate the costs of the aircraft.
"If you split it down the middle, you lose economies of scale," said Loren Thompson, a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., research group. "But if you get a tactical aircraft monopoly, the presumption is you would get less innovation, higher prices and lower performance."
Yet the Air Force's Ms. Druyun says a winner can be picked without harming the nation. "We're always concerned about the industrial base," she said. "But when I look out and see what will be there in 2010 and 2015, it is still apparent that there will be a viable industrial base in the fighter aircraft business."
Lawrence Korb, a military analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations, said the project was so large that no matter which company won, the other would get plenty of subcontracting work. "It's not a winner-take-all, but a winner-will-do-better program," said Mr. Korb.
There is, however, a critical difference between being a prime contractor and being a subcontractor. The prime has control over the project. It gets the most money. And, since it is where all the engineering, design, computer and high-end action is, it is where all the creative and talented people want to work.
"The guy who gets the money is the guy who makes the decisions," said Harry Blot, Lockheed's deputy program manager for the fighter. "If you lose, you may make as many parts as you want, but you won't have the design authority. It's interesting work that keeps engineering teams together."
Mr. Meullner of Boeing, the former Air Force acquisitions head, questioned whether the Government "has the guts" to pick just one producer.
"I'm hoping it will be winner-take-all," he said. "Our defense budget cannot sustain two production lines."
So far, Wall Street has not focused on the contest. The final payoff is at least a decade away -- an eternity for Wall Street. And the market's conventional wisdom is the program will be split: Lockheed will build the Air Force version and Boeing the Navy and Marine planes.
"There is no clear indication as to which way the program is going," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with J.S.A. Research in Newport, R.I. "So there's nothing of this program reflected in either company's stock."
For the military, the focus is much clearer. Driving the program is the Marine Corps, which wants its own new plane not dependent on Navy carriers for takeoffs and landings. The Navy, happy with the F-18, and the Air Force, going all out for the F-22, were more reluctant converts. The key in getting them on board, according to Mr. Muellner, was to minimize "scar penalty" -- the price that one service pays for the requirements of another.
So, with careful planning, the Air Force and Navy got what they wanted -- a stealthier plane with more range than existing fighters. And in Congress, where both the Air Force and the Navy have taken their share of hits of late, the leathernecks command great respect.
"The Marines have impressive powers of outlasting their doubters in getting the things they want," said Wolfgang Demisch, a managing director at Wasserstein Perella and Company. "And they really want this plane."

Chart: "A Storied Lineage"
The Joint Strike Fighter is intended to take the place of a line of celebrated aircraft manufactured over the last quarter-century. Unlike its predecessors, the new plane is not supposed to be the best that its manufacturers can build, but the best that the Pentagon can afford.
 
F-14 Tomcat
The first fighter to feature a swingwing, which gives the plane greater speed and maneuverability, it replaced the F-4 Phantom II. The Tomcat was designed to carry long-range Phoenix missiles with which it can attack six planes simultaneously.

A 1970's act to preserve faltering newspapers seems only to delay the inevitable end.

BYLINE: By Felicity Barringer 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the 1970's? When sideburns, bell-bottoms and Government regulation were in fashion? When 62 million copies of the country's 1,748 daily newspapers circulated every day? When Congress, saying it wanted to insure a diversity of editorial viewpoints, passed a law making it easier for some financially troubled newspapers to stay afloat?
The Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 fits the media world of 1999 about as well as a pair of 1970 bell-bottoms fits its original owner. And recently many of the original rationales for the law were stood on their heads by the proposed $660 million sale of The San Francisco Chronicle to the Hearst Corporation, owner of its archrival, The San Francisco Examiner. 
 San Francisco's joint operating agreement was one of 25 or more that came and went over the years, first without Federal sanction (the prototype agreement was signed in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1933) and, after 1970, with the Government's provisional blessing.
The structures varied, but the basic principle was the same. Competing newspapers would share certain costs -- like printing and distribution -- and split certain revenues, like advertising and circulation dollars. Newsrooms and editorial pages remained separate, ideally providing diverse viewpoints.
The demise of the San Francisco agreement leaves 12 joint operating agreements from York, Pa., to Honolulu. Agreements, and newspapers, have died in places like St. Louis. For some years, many of those who study the industry -- on Wall Street and in universities -- have asked out loud if the agreements served their stated purpose of insuring multiple editorial voices. (Longtime opponents, like Bruce B. Brugmann, the publisher of a weekly newspaper, The San Francisco Bay Guardian, argue that J.O.A.'s, as they are known in the business, never insured anything but publishers' profits. Mr. Brugmann called the sale of The Chronicle the "assassination of a newspaper."
But Donna Patterson, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's antitrust division, tends to think the 1970 law did some service. "I guess historically it's been a success," she said, "because it's preserved voices longer than they would otherwise have been preserved."
Hearst officials refused to comment. But another publisher, Dennis Hetzel of The York Daily Record (circulation 43,000 every morning), which is in a joint operating agreement with the York Dispatch (circulation 40,000 every afternoon and 93,000 on Sunday), said the newspapers' nine-year-old joint operating agreement had freed him to invest more in the newsroom, which competes fiercely with the newsroom of The Dispatch. "Both newspapers are better," thanks to the business cooperation, he said.
Others, like Mr. Brugmann, argue that the agreements make tame, hand-fed creatures out of businesses that had been aggressive business competitors. "The publishers just don't want to compete," he said.
Did the law lengthen the life of some troubled newspapers? "No one can say for sure," said Stephen Barnett, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. But joint operating agreements, he said, "have clearly had the effect of crippling the weaker paper." When the agreements end, those weaker papers tend to end with them.
Stephen Lacy, a professor of journalism at Michigan State University, sees today's situation as the outcome of economic forces, not misguided regulation. "The inevitable is happening," he said. "The forces that create the one-paper town were not overcome by the Newspaper Preservation Act." Instead, he said, the act just prolonged the dying of the weaker newspapers.
In San Francisco, the end of the joint operating agreement is widely expected to leave the town with one daily. Who will to buy an afternoon newspaper with a circulation one-quarter that of its morning rival, without having the printing and distribution capacity, or being willing to spend millions to develop it?
Perhaps Veronis, Suhler & Associates, a New York investment bank, will find a buyer for The Examiner -- maybe a small local publisher. If it does, there will be no joint operating agreement to shelter the new owner from the rigors of competition, as The Chronicle and The Examiner have been sheltered since 1965. (Their joint operating agreement was established before Congress shielded most such arrangements from antitrust action.)
The terms of the San Francisco agreement also made it likely that, once The Chronicle's owners decided to sell, Hearst -- the company with the most incentive to eliminate one newspaper -- would be the most likely buyer. It had the right of first refusal, according to one person who has seen the agreement, and its $660 million bid came four days before other companies' bids were formally due, pre-empting potential rivals.
Other factors aiding Hearst had nothing to do with well-meaning economic regulation. As a privately held company, Hearst has no stockholders to answer to, while most other potential bidders did. And Wall Street, in recent years, has frowned on newspaper companies that make expensive acquisitions.
But in the world of 1999, does the loss of a newspaper matter as much as it did in 1970, when the scores of cable channels and hundreds of Web sites did not exist?
The new media landscape and the growing competition for advertising dollars, make it harder for a weak newspaper to survive, and make its survival less urgent, Mr. Lacy believes. "I'm not sure I'd call the Newspaper Preservation Act a failure," he said. "Just a nonsuccess. People back then did not realize that this would not make a difference in the long run."

HEADLINE: G.M. Expects Tougher Stance In Union Talks

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation has signaled to Wall Street that it expects the United Automobile Workers to make a stronger push for wage increases in this year's contract talks with Detroit's auto makers.
That would mark a shift from previous negotiations in the 1990's, when the union sought relatively benign wage increases in exchange for job security. It means auto makers may have to give workers more of their growing revenues to insure labor peace, a change that has some on Wall Street fearing a possible inflationary effect on the United States economy. 
 At a recent meeting with about 40 major investors and analysts, John F. Smith Jr., the chairman of G.M., said the U.A.W. felt it missed out on this decade's real wage growth and would probably place a higher priority on wage increases this year, according to investors who attended the meeting.
G.M. declined to comment. "It's our policy to negotiate with the union behind closed doors, which means we don't intend to begin negotiating in the public, with the media or analysts," a spokesman, Tony Cervone, said on Friday.
The U.A.W. did not return phone calls for comment. But the strategy expected by G.M. is in line with the collective bargaining resolution the union approved last May, arguing that its members deserve a larger share of the profits that G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. are making on United States sales. The auto makers are on track to set an annual record for earnings in 1999.
The wage pressures come as G.M. and the Toyota Motor Corporation are making plans to build a new vehicle at their joint venture in Fremont, Calif., to replace the Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Prizm. The replacement would be a cross between the Toyota Corolla and a sport utility vehicle as demand fades for traditional small cars. Michael E. Robinet, an auto consultant in Northville, Mich., called the new vehicle "a taller version of a small-car wagon."

Death Gambles and the Neighborhood Loses

Temptations from heaven are as perilous as those from hell, a clever peasant discovers in "Tiene la Muerte Atada" ("They've Got Death Bound Up"). This is the wittiest, most lyrical and colorful free summer show the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater and Pregones Theater have ever presented in their annual series. This year it is running in parks in all five boroughs of the city and at several New Jersey sites, through Aug. 29.
This operatic comedy has a distinctly Uruguayan spirit. The playwright, Hugo Bardallo, spices a medieval folk tale with dialogue so funny and subtle that he packs into one hour more humor and irony than would seem possible. He is an honored master of murga, a Mardi Gras theatrical genre involving commedia dell'arte, song, dance, music based on Latin American and African rhythms thrummed out on drums and cymbals, and high-pitched choruses that seem to be sung, with hilarious effect, directly through the nose. 
 For this production the composer Pablo Zinger has written melodies based on these traditions as well as on the waltz, tango and samba, including a few solos that have to compete with waves of laughter they extort from the audience. And the director, Nelson Landrieu, a well-known New York actor who, like Mr. Bardallo and Mr. Zinger, is a native of Uruguay, whips all this into a choreographed musical storm that one wants more of, even if it ends, as it did the night I saw it, with a roll of thunder from above echoing the last drum beats. (I would sit through a shower for more of this any evening.)
In the story, Jesus and St. Peter (Francisco Martinez and Bill Blechingberg, respectively) visit the peasant Gonzalez (Pietro Gonzalez), the most honest man alive, and offer to grant three wishes. He is cunning enough to ask that he can cancel out anyone else's actions whenever he wants, that he will get a warning when death is coming and that he will always win at gambling.
When a luridly seductive Death (Alicia Kaplan) does approach, bearing her official God-approved snuffer's license, he tricks her into a crap game. She loses, and he ties her up. Nature is instantly upended. With no one dying and Gonzalez able to prevent every mischief, civil order and the economy collapse and the whole countryside is up in arms against him, beginning with his greedy sister (Ana Campos). Neighbors summon the cigar-puffing local witch (Gladys Perez), who appears to have inconvenient extra feet, to hex him, but she concludes he's possessed by the Devil, against whom she is helpless.
Meanwhile Gonzalez proves obstinately impervious to seduction by a rural Lolita. In a fine bit of slapstick with a useless nose, a would-be suicide draws a crowd of would-be helpers, all impotent while Death is bound. A wimpy choir of whiny angels ducks and cowers, scandalized by the breezy way Jesus talks to the Creator He calls "Papa." Finally, Satan (Juan Villarreal) dances in and, having failed to free Death on his own, joins St. Peter in a wonderfully ridiculous duet that persuades Gonzalez to untie the great equalizer and promise God to live out his earthly life by earthly rules and to keep his nose out of the Divine dispensation.
Three musicians (Norby Di Bella, Fernando Freire and Wilson Melgares) are part of the action more often than part of the background. The seven actors each take several roles, changing masks and costumes so swiftly onstage that you often wonder where some of the characters came from. Everyone can dance, beautifully or clumsily as called for, and everyone sings well (or, in the case of Mr. Gonzalez, rasps as clear as a cracked bell).
The fun is infectious, and the performance is a tickling sendup of the tradition of Latin American theater, which has an innate tendency toward the grandeur of opera. If you don't understand Spanish, sit next to someone who does; the action is always transparent, but you will miss half the merriment if you do not catch at least some of the sharp lines and lyrics.

HEADLINE: Japanese Mark War Anniversary With Less Reticence

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The young would-be soldiers in spotless uniforms hoisted vintage rifles and marched smartly in the scalding heat today. Occasionally a few veterans of World War II would join them at the head of their formations, withered and bleary-eyed but still bolt erect.
Loudspeakers blared out everything from prayers of peace to right-wing calls to arms on this day of commemoration of the end of that war. But for most of the former combatants who gathered at the Yasukuni Shrine, the Shinto monument to Japan's war dead, today was simply a day for honoring lost comrades, catching up with old friends and reminiscing. 
 Driven in part by the perceived growing threat of a missile attack from North Korea, from the rising sense of insecurity in East Asia and from a general weariness with war guilt 54 years after World War II ended, Japan has broken out of its reticence about the country's military past, just as it has begun pushing to build up its feeble defenses.
Just last week the Government won ratification of bills that make the country's rising sun flag and its national anthem, a hymn to the Emperor, the legal symbols of the nation for the first time.
The Government has also said that it will soon seek changes in the country's so-called peace Constitution to let Japan cooperate more fully with the United States in regional military operations, and to organize its own "collective self-defense." Others say the Japanese Air Force must be given the authority to strike back in case of attack by North Korea.
But for the dwindling remainders of an older generation -- men in their 70's or older who were the last Japanese to fight a war -- all of these ideas are, if anything, way overdue, although many disapproved of the way younger Japanese men paraded about in uniform today.
Looking back, their view of the world is a bittersweet mixture of yearning for the power that Japan once enjoyed and both pride and resignation over the station this country has attained.
Eight Government ministers attended the ceremony at the Yasukuni shrine today, and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Emperor Akihito went to a ceremony elsewhere, where they made routine anniversary statements of regret.
Seeking to do away once and for all with a lingering national shame over Japan's militarist past, Hiromu No naka, the most senior aide to Mr. Obuchi, recently proposed that the country's worst war criminals somehow be dissociated from the more than two million ordinary soldiers with whom they were enshrined here. That would allow Government ministers to come here without embarrassment.
"Somebody has to assume responsibility for the last war," Mr. Nonaka said recently, explaining his controversial proposal. "We want to have the Class A war criminals take the responsibility and have them enshrined somewhere else."
Among the veterans here today, almost to a man, any discussion of the past involves an evasion of history's harder facts and yet a grudging acceptance of the way things have turned out in the end.
"What is a Class A or a Class B criminal?" asked Taro Yamada, 77, a former pilot whose unit was training to fly kamikaze attacks when the war ended. "We certainly didn't decide.
"Nonaka is a cheater for playing around with such issues. Government officials should not be worrying about the feelings of other countries. They should simply come to the shrine to pay their respects as everyone else does."
Like scores of other war veterans on this blistering day, Jiro Takeda, a former Imperial Army engineer, took refuge in the cool shade of the shrine's cherry trees.
"Who do you think the Class A criminals sacrificed themselves for?" he asked, as cicadas cried piercingly and white pigeons flocked on the ground nearby.
"For the country, of course," he quickly volunteered.
Through conversations like these, a view emerges of a generation of men who, naturally enough, love their country deeply but have only rarely managed to look history in the face.
"The last war was fought to make things better," said Kanjio Suzuki, 67, who was training for combat as a young teen-ager when the fighting ended. "They say that we attacked, but the truth is that we were forced into war. If you look at Taiwan or South Korea, they have become good countries because of our good administration. We educated those people."
Almost no one in this crowd seemed prepared to acknowledge that Japan was still widely loathed by many Asians for a militaristic past marked by war atrocities, sexual slavery and economic exploitation.
"As a result of our efforts, Indonesia, Burma and Malaysia were liberated," said Takashi Matsui, 71, who saw action in those countries as a pilot. "If not for us, they would still be colonized."
Nearby, another man, a bemedaled 80-year-old who wore the uniform of a sergeant but declined to give his name, said: "The idea was to prosper together with the other Asian nations. It was natural for us to take a leadership role, even if our military sometimes went too far."
If few of these grizzled veterans could find fault with their country's past, many seemed deeply ambivalent about Japan today. For men like these who fought with extraordinary tenacity against the United States in the briefly brilliant -- and then disastrous -- campaign known to the Japanese as the Pacific War, it is still hard to swallow Japan's very much junior partnership with the United States in today's world.
Nonetheless, for even the bitterest among them, the famous capacity for compromise among the Japanese seems to have reconciled them to the nearly irreconcilable.
One after another, these men said that if they hated relying on the United States for Japan's defense, they recognized the prosperity that the relationship had brought their country and believed that in today's world there was little choice.
"My hope is that Japan can take charge of its own affairs one day and not just be the kind of place that catches the flu when America sneezes," said a 71-year-old naval veteran who would give his name only as Noguchi. "Most of all I'd like to see Japan take up its own defenses. But with all of the constraints binding us today, that just seems impossible."

HEADLINE: William R. Stott, 91, Ex-Official At Standard Oil of New Jersey

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
William R. Stott, who rose from selling petroleum products in Pennsylvania to the highest executive levels of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey before beginning a second career as a venture capitalist and consultant, died on Wednesday. He was 91.
Mr. Stott, who did business with such well-known figures as the shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, had been ailing for a year, his son Michael A. Stott said. 
 In the heyday of America's postwar industrial might, the oil industry, along with automobiles and steel, formed the base of economic and political power, and Mr. Stott learned the intricacies of the business as a rising sales executive with Standard Oil. He coordinated marketing for the company, negotiated for control of foreign refineries and traveled frequently to Europe and Latin America.
Mr. Stott was named a vice president of Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1960 and an executive vice president in 1961.
In 1968, three years after his fellow executive, Michael L. Haider, had been promoted to chairman, Mr. Stott left to form Harbill Associates, a venture capital partnership, in association with Harry W. Knight.
In the early 1970's, he served as a consultant to the Pittston Company, which was then engaged in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to win Federal approval of a new oil refinery in Eastport, Me. He was also a director of Pittston, the Bank of New York, the Urban National Bank and the Foreign Policy Association of the United States.
Mr. Stott's wife, Irene Kearns Stott, died in 1987. In addition to his son Michael, Mr. Stott is survived by another son, William R. Stott Jr.; two daughters, Betsy Kimmerle and Susan Stott; 17 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Ernesto Melo Antunes, 66; Led 1974 Portuguese Coup

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Lieut. Col. Ernesto Melo Antunes, a Portuguese Army officer who was an architect and ideologist of the almost bloodless coup that overthrew his country's longtime conservative dictatorship in 1974 and led to the return of democracy, died on Tuesday in his home in Sintra, outside Lisbon. He was 66.
He had cancer, the Portuguese national news agency Lusa reported. 
 Major Melo Antunes, as he was at the time of the coup, was a Socialist and the chief architect of the political goals of the Armed Forces Movement, which gave rise to the coup that ended four decades of dictatorial rule in Portugal.
The military coup was unusual in that its goal was to have Portugal become a democracy -- and that is what happened, after the ouster of the country's unpopular last dictator, Marcello Caetano.
The dictatorship was begun in 1932 under Antonio de Oliveira Salazar and maintained by Mr. Caetano, beginning in 1968.
As the Spanish national radio put it after the death of Colonel Melo Antunes, "He was one of the military officers who led the so-called Armed Forces Movement, the core of the revolution of the carnations," as the coup is sometimes called because joyful soldiers slipped red carnations into the barrels of their rifles.
And Mario Soares, a Socialist who served two terms as President in the post-coup era, said, He had "had enormous influence in the Revolution, despite being a discreet figure of scarce words."
Major Melo Antunes became a member of the Council of the Revolution, which was established to supervise the restoration of democracy and ceased operations in 1982. He became Deputy Prime Minister for a time when a new Government, heavily dominated by the armed forces, was formed in July 1974, after a post-coup, almost entirely civilian Government had fallen apart less than two months after taking office.
He went on to be Foreign Minister in 1975 and 1976, and from 1982 to 1989 he headed the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
In 1975, he became the first representative of the new Government of Prime Minister Jose Batista Pinheiro Azevedo to visit Washington since it took power in Lisbon a month earlier after removing left-leaning leaders.
After he met with President Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, the White House announced an $85 million package of emergency economic aid for Portugal, and Major Melo Antunes said that he was "grateful for the support and sympathy President Ford has shown for the efforts that the present team in Portugal is doing to establish true democracy in Portugal."
By late 1975, he was not only Foreign Minister but also the leader of the left in the military, because the extreme leftists had been purged. He told reporters at that time that the main danger to the revolution came from members of the former privileged class trying to win the support of certain elements in the military.
In the beginning, he said, all the Portuguese people seemed to agree with the socialist program of the Armed Forces Movement. "But when the program began to be carried out, the more privileged classes began to react against the loss of privileges and organize themselves against the revolution," he declared.
While he was Foreign Minister, he made it clear that he believed that the military should retain a central role in politics "to guarantee the revolution."
He also was the chief of a commission that supervised the end of Portugal's colonial rule in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and the Cape Verde Islands.

HEADLINE: Pork Producer Settles Suit As Pollution Rules Tighten

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: UNIONVILLE, Mo.

 BODY:
With hog manure fouling streams in the rolling countryside of northern Missouri, the giant pork producer Premium Standard Farms has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a suit accusing it of violating the state's Clean Water Act.
The agreement with the company, which processes two million pigs a year in six Missouri counties, is the largest environmental settlement with any hog-producing operation in the nation and illustrates the tightening restrictions facing the big producers. The agreement was reached two weeks ago. 
 With pigs now raised in virtual factories, the settlement by Premium Standard in the suit by Attorney General Jay Nixon of Missouri comes as states are starting to monitor livestock production as they would a smokestack industry.
In neighboring Kansas, the State Health Department has recently announced that it was requiring farms with more than 10,000 animals to line their waste pits with plastic, a measure intended to keep manure out of groundwater and from contaminating drinking water.
Several states have issued moratoriums on the expansion of giant hog farms. Dozens of counties around the nation have passed measures designed to limit or exclude big hog farms. Nebraska has kept the hog factories out by banning all corporate farming.
There are few issues as contentious in the American countryside as the corporate hog industry, in which the manure of thousands of pigs is concentrated in lagoons and then sprayed over fields. The process can create a terrible odor for miles. And when spills occur, the manure seeps into streams and kills fish. Premium Standard Farms was accused of several spills, including one near here that killed fish and threatened groundwater.
While most attention on big hog operations has focused on the offensive odor, water pollution caused by the manure poses the biggest threat, environmentalists say. The Sierra Club has labeled big hog operations as one of the most serious environmental threats. The giant hog farms have degraded some 35,000 miles of rivers and streams in 22 states, said Ed Hopkins, a spokesman for the Sierra Club.
"Hog operations are still classified as agricultural," Mr. Hopkins said, "but they have turned into industrial sites."
When Premium Standard Farms sprayed animal waste on fields, it was technically doing the same thing farmers have always done, but in much larger amounts. In small amounts, in the style of family farmers, the manure serves as fertilizer for crops. But the concentrated manure from the hog factories is much too strong for crop fertilizer.
Under the agreement with the state, Premium Standard Farms must treat the waste before it is spread on the land, to guard against contamination.
Many politicians in Missouri and other states have labeled the big hog producers as threats to the environment and the rural economy. Those producers, meanwhile, say environmental rules are being used as a weapon to keep out an emerging industry that does not fit with the rural tradition of the family farm.
Mark Drabenstott, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City and an expert on the rural economy, said the hog industry had largely chosen to expand in the West, including the Oklahoma Panhandle and Utah. As scrutiny of hog operations has intensified, Mr. Drabenstott said, the differences in regulations among states has become smaller.
"The industry is going to go where it feels welcome," Mr. Drabenstott said. "These days, the discussion is not so much whether we go to Iowa or Missouri, it's do we stay in the United States or do we go to Mexico?"
Big hog producers have started raising some pigs in the western provinces of Canada and are said to be considering doing the same in Mexico, he said.
Tougher regulations come at a time when hog prices have ranged from poor to catastrophic. The low prices have driven many smaller farmers out of business and have also hurt the big producers. Prices for hogs at meat processors, recently 35 cents to 40 cents a pound, have rebounded considerably from a low of fewer than 10 cents a pound last December. The rising prices have been fueled, in large part, by expectations that the economy is improving in Asia, a major importer of American pork. But even at the higher prices, most farmers are barely breaking even, Mr. Drabenstott said.
Charlie Arnott, a spokesman for Premium Standard Farms, said the state had been justified in "holding us accountable" on water pollution. But Mr. Arnott said the debate over large-scale hog production in the American countryside was often driven by emotion and nostalgia.
Mr. Arnott said the increases in technology, along with the global nature of markets, had changed the face of agriculture. But he said the big-scale hog producers were helping people survive in the countryside.
"What everybody is interested in is a quality rural way of life," he said. "It isn't the same as the old style of agriculture. But there are a whole lot of people in northern Missouri who now are able to live in the country, send their kids to a rural school and enjoy the neighborly quality of life," because of the 2,400 jobs created by the hog producer.
Jason Siemer, a 27-year-old barber, had left his depressed hometown of Princeton nearly a decade ago, but as economic conditions improved in the region he returned and went into business. His father, who had gone broke in farming, now drives a truck for Premium Standard Farms.
To the younger Mr. Siemer, a little odor of hog manure is worth the benefit of jobs. He said the water pollution was being exaggerated for political reasons.
"This was a ghost town not long ago," Mr. Siemer said. "Now I look out my door and I see a restaurant, an insurance agency, a gas station."
But in the view of Terry Spence, 52, a cattle farmer and a sharp critic of the big hog factory, the countryside is being sold down the river. He said the state did not win a settlement nearly large enough from Premium Standard Farms.
"I have grandchildren," Mr. Spence said, "and I don't like them to be outside when this odor gets so bad. This is not the typical farm smell. Animals have always roamed the land. But when you compound it like that, it's terrible. It isn't farming. Call it something else."

HEADLINE: New Face of Terror Crimes: 'Lone Wolf' Weaned on Hate

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

 BODY:
After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, law enforcement officials began struggling with a big unanswered question: Were domestic terrorist attacks by white supremacists, both actual and thwarted, isolated events, or the work of a cohesive underground movement?
Federal and state investigators, including undercover agents, have painstakingly searched the evidence in a growing list of bombings, shootings and robberies. But they maintain that there is no evidence of an organized effort among the disparate assortment of violent right-wing groups and individuals scattered across the country. 
 Instead, top-level law enforcement officials and experts on terrorism say, what has emerged is a new style of "leaderless resistance" -- long urged by white supremacist leaders -- of very small cells, pairs or individuals, called lone wolves, acting independently. Hate groups, often using the Internet, provide the philosophical framework. Individuals with few or no tangible connections to these groups do the killing.
Buford O. Furrow Jr., the angry, unemployed white supremacist who the police say scouted several Jewish institutions before shooting five people in a Los Angeles Jewish community center last week, may be the latest example.
The police are not yet saying whether Mr. Furrow fancied himself a lone wolf, part of something larger, or whether, as some suggest, he was just a deeply disturbed loner susceptible to the influences of the violent right. But the actions he has admitted to have focused attention on what officials say is a new and particularly dangerous tactic of supremacists.
"We've moved into the era of the solo act," said Mike Reynolds, an analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a private nonprofit group based in Montgomery, Ala., that tracks the activities of hate groups around the country.
The notion being preached in pamphlets, on telephone lines and on white supremacist Web sites is that of the romantic, heroic loner who fights his own private war, committing violent acts against the Government, Jews and racial minorities. A warrior working alone, supremacist leaders say, cannot be betrayed or infiltrated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a fate that has befallen some hate groups.
"Good hunting, lone wolves," said a telephone message put out on Aug. 3 by Tom Metzger, the leader of White Aryan Resistance, or W.A.R., a white supremacist group based in California.
Mr. Metzger was deploring the demise of Proposition 187, a California referendum barring illegal immigrants from receiving government services. A Federal court found much of the proposition unconstitutional, and last month Gov. Gray Davis agreed to drop an appeal of that ruling. Mr. Metzger, in his phone message, said: "Today, California ceased to exist as an Aryan-dominated state. W.A.R. releases all associates from any constraints, real or imagined, in confronting the problem in any way you see fit." He then called for a second civil war.
Mr. Reynolds, of the law center, was among the first to take note when three white supremacists who had bombed a bank, a newspaper and an abortion clinic in Spokane, Wash., in 1996 called themselves Phineas Priests.
The idea that men who feel they are called by God should commit independent acts of terrorism was put forward by Richard Kelly Hoskins, a former member of the American Nazi Party, in a 1990 book, "Vigilantes of Christendom," which argues that God forbids any mixing of the races. Mr. Hoskins cited Phineas, who in the Old Testament slew an interreligious couple and was rewarded by God with an everlasting priesthood. Mr. Hoskins broached the idea in an earlier book, "War Cycles/Peace Cycles," an anti-Semitic treatise found in the van abandoned in Los Angeles by Mr. Furrow.
When Mr. Furrow was arrested, he told the F.B.I. he wanted the shootings at the community center to be "a wakeup call to America to kill Jews," officials said.
Terrorism experts point out that advances in technology, in particular the Internet, have fueled the activities of loners, making it easy for them to communicate and gain access to extremist philosophers.
"It puts them all in the loop," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, which monitors 2,100 hate sites on the Web. "They feel linked up. They're not alone. It makes them part of a greater thing. It's their ticket to the world."
Brian Jenkins, an adviser on issues of crime and terrorism to the president of the Rand Corporation, a nonpartisan research organization, said an important consequence of the new technology was the disappearance of hierarchy.
Mr. Jenkins sees a move away from groups modeled after the military, like the Red Brigades, the ultra-left-wing organization responsible for dozens of terrorist attacks in the 1970's and 80's, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro of Italy.
"We've moved into a realm where we are obliged to speak of universes of like-minded fanatics," Mr. Jenkins said, "from which emerge small galaxies of conspirators, or in some cases, simply individuals who mentally incorporate the belief systems, whether it's racism or anti-Semitism or religious fanaticism, of the broader universe, but are not receiving orders in any formal sense of the term."
The danger has increased, Mr. Jenkins said, "because they are virtually impossible to identify in advance."
The worst terrorist act on American soil, the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, was committed by two people, according to the F.B.I. Found in the belongings of Terry L. Nichols, convicted in that bombing along with Timothy J. McVeigh, was a well-thumbed copy of "Hunter," a novel by William Pierce, the head of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, who also wrote "The Turner Diaries," which prosecutors said was a virtual blueprint for the bombing.
"Hunter" dramatized the idea of the solitary white warrior and was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, a serial killer who shot interracial couples and also wounded the civil rights leader Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and the publisher of Hustler magazine, Larry Flynt. Mr. Franklin, who has admitted to or is suspected in 17 murders, is on death row. His first known attack was the bombing of a synagogue in 1977.
The danger of terrorists operating alone or in pairs became a major concern to law enforcement after the bombing in Oklahoma City, particularly in cases in which the attackers had ready access to weapons or explosives and could operate far outside the mainstream, without jobs, home addresses, telephone numbers or credit cards.
Historically, the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies geared to identifying and thwarting criminal organizations, like the Mafia, have had far less ability to investigate political groups or their leaders, whose speeches and writings, while inflammatory, are constitutionally protected.
"There is no way to track these people without a massive invasion of privacy," said Paul Bresson, an F.B.I. spokesman in Washington. He added, "Neither the American public nor the F.B.I. wants that."
Federal guidelines adopted in the aftermath of abuses committed in the civil rights and antiwar era bar the F.B.I. from spying on hate groups or infiltrating them unless they have grounds to suspect a group plans to commit a crime.
Within these guidelines, Federal agencies have used undercover agents to thwart a number of attacks planned since the Oklahoma bombing, offering evidence of just how much easier it is to investigate a group, as opposed to keeping track of individuals.
Arrests have been made in groups of from 3 to 12 members on charges of planning to blow up Government and other buildings. Undercover work stopped a plot to bomb the F.B.I.'s national fingerprint records center in West Virginia and another plan, in 1997, to attack an open house at Fort Hood on the Fourth of July.
But recent hate crimes and acts of terror, the experts say, demonstrate the difficulty of intercepting a lone terrorist and the devastation that can be wreaked by one or two people.
Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and his brother James Tyler Williams, 29, arrested in connection with the July 1 shotgun killings of a gay couple near Redding, Calif., are also suspects, the police say, in fires that caused nearly $1 million in damage to three synagogues in Sacramento, Calif., on June 18.
Another supremacist, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, who went on a shooting attack against blacks, Asians and Jews in Illinois and Indiana over the Fourth of July weekend, killed two people and injured nine before killing himself.
Another loner, Eric Robert Rudolph, a fugitive who disappeared into the Carolina woods, is charged with four bombings that left two people dead, including a police officer, and 124 injured. These attacks included the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta in 1996, the bombings of an Atlanta abortion clinic and of a nightclub with a gay clientele in 1997, and the bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., last year.
Extensive files from the Internet about Mr. Rudolph were found among the possessions of David Copeland, an engineer who was charged with three nail-bomb attacks on ethnic minorities and homosexuals in London in April. Three people were killed and more than 100 were injured.
Chip Berlet, the president of Political Research Associates, a company based in Somerville, Mass., that tracks extremist groups, said the approaching millennium has focused "a confluence of demonization, scapegoating and conspiracy theories. For people with an ideology that is apocalyptic, the struggle between good and evil is approaching."
Hate groups in this country, Mr. Berlet said, are grounded in a narrative in which "hardy white male middle-class people are being squeezed by secret elites above who manipulate their lives, while down below are lazy, shiftless parasites that are picking their pockets. They feel squeezed from above and below."
Mr. Furrow was for a time associated with the Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations. The group espouses the Christian Identity theology, which teaches that people of color were created before Adam and are, therefore, like beasts of the field, and that Jews are the product of a union between Eve and Satan.
The language of Christian Identity "not only demeans minorities and Jews," said Gail L. Gans, director of the Civil Rights Information Center of the Anti-Defamation League, "it sets them up as targets. When you've erased someone's humanity, it makes them easier to shoot."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Taking Aim at the Symbolism of the Holocaust

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

THE HOLOCAUST IN AMERICAN LIFE
By Peter Novick
373 pages. Houghton Mifflin Company. $27. 
 In his vexing new book, "The Holocaust in American Life," Peter Novick proposes to look at such questions as why has the Holocaust "come to loom so large" in contemporary American culture, what its cultural visibility says about American Jews and American society at large and what consequences its heightened place in our collective memory has on our thinking and our foreign policy.
In addressing such issues, Mr. Novick, the author of "The Resistance Versus Vichy: The Purge of Collaborators in Liberated France" and a founder of the University of Chicago's program in Jewish studies, takes a willfully contrarian attitude toward the Holocaust and those he dismissively refers to as "Holocaust-memory professionals." He argues that there are no "useful" lessons to be drawn from the Holocaust, and he suggests that the high level of Holocaust awareness in American society stems in large measure from decisions made by Jews who "occupy strategic positions in the mass media" -- remarks that echo assertions made by revisionist historians who play down the Nazi crimes of World War II.
Throughout this book, Mr. Novick contests the view that the United States should have done more during World War II to help the Jews, arguing that such "guilt talk" has simply provided useful leverage in persuading Americans that they have a continuing obligation to support Israel. He argues that the question of Allied bombing of the railway lines to the Nazi concentration camps "can be dismissed immediately," because "massive experience" taught us that "bombing rail lines was hardly ever effective," and adds that there were "dim practical possibilities" for other rescue attempts of the Jews.
As for the question of why the United States did not ease its restrictive prewar immigration policy to allow more Jews sanctuary, he writes that America was "still not out of the Depression, with unemployment still high" and that "anti-immigration sentiment was so strong in Congress and among the general public that to open the question for debate seemed likely to worsen rather than to ease conditions; better to leave bad enough alone."
For the first 20 years or so after World War II, Mr. Novick observes, the Holocaust was "hardly talked about": survivors were encouraged not to look back but to look forward to building new lives, and the upbeat, universalist Zeitgeist of those postwar years made the Holocaust "an inappropriate symbol of the contemporary mood." In addition, he says, the cold war -- which taught that the Soviet Union, not Germany, was the new enemy, and totalitarianism, not Nazism, the great evil -- made "the Holocaust the 'wrong atrocity' " for purposes of galvanizing this new thinking.
In the 1960's, all this began to change, as the Eichmann trial raised consciousness of the Holocaust "as an entity in its own right, distinct from Nazi barbarism in general." The anxious prelude to the Six-Day War of 1967 fed fears of a renewed Holocaust among American Jews -- fears heightened further during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which left many with the image of an isolated and vulnerable Israel.
"After 1967, and particularly after 1973," Mr. Novick writes, "much of the world came to see the Middle East conflict as grounded in the Palestinian struggle to, belatedly, accomplish the U.N.'s original intention. There were strong reasons for Jewish organizations to ignore all this, however, and instead to conceive of Israel's difficulties as stemming from the world's having forgotten the Holocaust. The Holocaust framework allowed one to put aside as irrelevant any legitimate grounds for criticizing Israel, to avoid even considering the possibility that the rights and wrongs were complex."
While concerns about Israel's security declined in the 1980's and 90's, Mr. Novick says, the Holocaust became more of a focal point for American Jews during those same years because it "offered a substitute symbol of infinitely greater moral clarity" than the problematic Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At the same time, he suggests, the rise of identity politics and the "culture of victimization" made it acceptable, even fashionable, for American Jews "to embrace a victim identity based on the Holocaust." In fact, in his view, the Holocaust became "virtually the only common denominator of American Jewish identity in the late 20th century" as assimilation and intermarriage led to a thinning sense of Jewish commitment among the young.
It is Mr. Novick's startling contention that while "there's nothing wrong with the affirmative lessons the Washington Holocaust Museum attempts to teach," such lessons "seem, if not useless, hardly necessary." He argues that the very extremity of the Holocaust and "the extremity of the circumstances in which it unfolded" seriously "limit its capacity to provide lessons applicable in our everyday world," adding that "an unintended consequence of our making the Holocaust our central symbol of atrocity" may in fact be a "desensitization" to other cases of mass death.
In support of this theory, he notes that the Persian Gulf war was motivated by geopolitical considerations, not moral outrage, and that the 1994 Rwandan genocide elicited "not the slightest will in American political circles for any U.S. intervention." He does not address the Kosovo crisis at all (though his book may have well gone to press before NATO air strikes began).
Although Mr. Novick has some useful things to say about the dangers of dwelling in the memory of oppression, although he can be eloquent on the sectarian use of the Holocaust as an easy moral touchstone, such observations are completely overshadowed by this volume's deliberate cynicism. Mr. Novick writes that survivors' memories "are not a very useful historical source." He glibly tosses around phrases like "the gold medal in the Victimization Olympics" and "Jewish moral capital." And he asserts that for Jewish organizations intent on capturing the attention of a younger generation, "the Holocaust looked like the one item in stock with consumer appeal."
This flippant tone reflects Mr. Novick's determination to not merely demystify the Holocaust, but to diminish its place in the collective imagination. While he argues that Hitler would triumph if Jews were "to tacitly endorse his definition" of them "as despised pariahs by making the Holocaust the emblematic Jewish experience," the words of the scholar Emil Fackenheim remain a potent warning of the real dangers of forgetting the past: "We are commanded to remember the martyrs of the Holocaust, lest their memory perish," he declared in 1967. "We are forbidden . . . to deny or despair of God . . . lest Judaism perish. . . . To abandon any of these imperatives, in response to Hitler's victory at Auschwitz, would be to hand him yet other, posthumous victories."

HEADLINE: Dutch Concern to Buy Nielsen Media Research

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Seeking to control the collection of raw data that companies use to decide when and where to advertise, VNU N.V., the Dutch publisher of Billboard magazine and The Hollywood Reporter, announced today that it would acquire Nielsen Media Research Inc., the largest television audience measuring company in the United States, for $2.5 billion.
Nielsen Media Research is relied on, sometimes begrudgingly so, by television networks and advertising agencies as the main source for determining how many households watch certain television programs. 
 The acquisition is part of a strategy by VNU to expand to American-based media companies that specialize in marketing to businesses, rather than to consumers. VNU has gone on a shopping spree in the United States over the last five years, buying 50 marketing and publishing companies.
The Dutch concern is paying a 15 percent premium for shares of Nielsen based on Friday's closing price, offering $37.75 a share. The company will assume $200 million in debt in addition to the $2.5 billion payout. VNU said it would sell new shares to help pay for the acquisition. Shares of VNU rose 3.5 percent, to 36.7 euros, in Amsterdam. In New York, Nielsen Media rose $4.50, to $37.3125.
Analysts praised the deal, commenting on the efficiencies that the purchase should create. They added that the high margin and relatively stable revenue stream should fuel growth for the company. Analysts also said that Nielsen's emerging Internet metering business held much promise as a high growth area.
Nielsen is in a joint venture with Netratings Inc. to track surfers on the World Wide Web. Nielsen has a 14 percent stake in the company, which tallies how many times an advertising banner is clicked along with demographic information. Nielsen has an option to increase its stake to 47 percent, and executives said VNU would like to get a majority stake in the Internet business and consider taking the company public. Its closest competitor, Media Metrix Inc., has a $650 million market value.
Although Nielsen is the leader in measuring television audiences, television network executives contend that the company under-reports viewers. Nevertheless, ABC, CBS and NBC recently abandoned an experimental measuring system called Smart (for Systems for Measuring and Reporting Television), run by Statistical Research Inc., that was supposed to compete with Nielsen.

HEADLINE: B. F.Goodrich to Cut Jobs and Close Plants

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug. 16

 BODY:
The B. F. Goodrich Company, the No. 1 United States maker of aircraft landing gear, said today that it would close plants in New Jersey and Connecticut and cut 275 jobs as it digests its $2.2 billion purchase of Coltec Industries.
Goodrich will eliminate about 150 jobs at its Naugatuck, Conn., plant by April; those workers are employed in the Goodrich aerospace unit's sensors and integrated systems group. The company, which is dealing with overcapacity at the plant, plans to close its Lewis Engineering and Delavan Process Instrumentation business, acquired from Coltec last month. 
 About 125 positions at B. F. Goodrich's plant in Cedar Knolls, N.J., which makes special-purpose motors and actuation systems for the aerospace industry, are expected to be cut by the end of the year. The plant's production, and some design engineering jobs, will be moved, the company said.
B. F. Goodrich, which employs about 27,000 people worldwide, had 1998 sales of $3.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Commerce Dept. Seeks to Close Government Information Service

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
For almost 50 years a small agency of the Commerce Department has done business in the resale of Government documents and reports. Now the department is proposing to shut down the service, saying it is no longer viable because of the wealth of free information on the Internet.
The announcement of plans to close the agency, the National Technical Information Service, comes just three months after the Clinton Administration rejected its plan to begin a fee-based Internet search service designed to help people more easily find and buy the Government documents the agency sells. 
 On the same day that the service, usgovsearch.com, was announced, the Administration halted it. And last Thursday, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said he would ask Congress to close the service and transfer its extensive archives to the Library of Congress.
"This way, the American people can find the documents they want via search engines that currently exist -- and the more powerful ones being created -- and download them for free," the statement from the Commerce Department said. "We will propose legislation to Congress next month to achieve these ends."
Although the agency sells some of its reports for thousands of dollars each, the increased use of the Internet by Government agencies to make free documents available to the public has resulted in declining sales, Mr. Daley said. He pointed to a recent report from the Commerce Department, "The Emerging Digital Economy II," which is available free on the department's Web site but costs $27 if requested through the information agency.
The decision was lauded by advocacy groups that have pushed the Government to post more reports and public information on line.
"We think this is great news," said Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit organization based in Washington. "We think that this shows that the Commerce Department is really looking at the Internet and realizes what it can mean for public access to Government information."
The agency has 250 employees, who Mr. Daley said would be put on a priority list for re-employment within the Government if Congress approves the plan to close the service.
The agency was turned into a self-sustaining agency during the Reagan Administration, meaning it was charged with financing itself through its sales. Mr. Daley said the agency had not operated at a profit since 1993, and from 1995 to 1998 registered more than $5 million in operating losses.
The plan for a fee-based Internet search service was intended as a joint venture with Northern Light Technology, an Internet database company in Cambridge, Mass., which was going to split the profits with the Commerce Department agency. It has since begun the service on its own.

HEADLINE: Increasing Foreign Aid Would Help Prevent Wars, Clinton Tells V.F.W. Convention

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Aug. 16

 BODY:
In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, President Clinton said today that American troops would have a better chance of being spared fighting in war if Congress would spend more money on foreign aid.
"We're cutting the very programs designed to keep our soldiers out of war in the first place," he said. 
 The President said foreign aid, which amounts to less than 1 percent of the Federal budget, had been declining since 1985.
Calling the cutbacks shortsighted, Mr. Clinton said, "The costliest peace is far cheaper than the cheapest war."
Mr. Clinton won big applause and a standing ovation from the veterans, who gathered here to mark the 100th anniversary of their organization. The warm greeting was notable for a President whose avoidance of service in Vietnam upset many veterans during the 1992 campaign, and this was the first time that he had addressed the annual gathering.
"Standing by our military and standing by our veterans means more than preparing for war," he said. "We must work with equal determination to prevent wars."
Describing the military as "only one arrow in our quiver," Mr. Clinton said the nation must do more to promote world stability. Conditions around the world will be safer, he said, "if Congress will invest only a tiny percentage of what we spend on defense in avoiding war."
In particular, he called for spending to rebuild Yugoslavia in the aftermath of the NATO bombing campaign over the situation in Kosovo. But he said that it would require nothing "as ambitious as the Marshall Plan," and that European countries should bear the heaviest costs.
Without efforts to promote stability in the Balkans, he said, "make no mistake -- there will be another bloody war."
He also said America should help pay for highly trained Russian weapons scientists to "turn that expertise to peaceful projects." Otherwise, he said, those scientists, now earning less than $100 a month, might be tempted to market their expertise to groups or nations that would threaten world peace.
Mr. Clinton is expected to ask Congress in September for an additional $2 billion to $3 billion for Kosovo peacekeeping and other foreign policy initiatives, Congressional staff members said.
But he is still likely to veto a measure that will come out of a House-Senate conference in September on foreign aid. Although the House and Senate bills passed this summer differ in their details, both reduced the Administration's overall request by nearly $2 billion, to about $12.7 billion.
The House withheld $500 million that the Clinton Administration had requested to help peace negotiations in the Middle East; the Senate withheld $350 million. Both chambers eliminated $241 million for reducing nuclear weapons threats in Russia.
Mr. Clinton noted that President Truman stood before the veterans in 1949, when the group was marking its 50th anniversary, and similarly called for building better relations with other countries as a way to avoid war.
"Harry Truman said, 'Peace, with freedom and justice, cannot be bought cheaply,' " Mr. Clinton said. " 'It can only be assured by the combined efforts of the multitudes of people throughout the world who want a secure peace. We must keep them our friends, if the world is to be a decent place for our children and their grandchildren to live.' "
Mr. Clinton repeatedly thanked the veterans for their heroism in battle and their determination to do their duty. "If you ask who has been most responsible for making this the American century," he said, "that answer would be America's servicemen and women." He also thanked the group for supporting the involvement of American troops in Kosovo.
More than half of the world's people now live under freely elected governments, he said. Tens of millions of people around the world live in peace, he added, because so many thousands of American veterans "rest in peace," after giving their lives in battle.
The President said the military was facing a harder time recruiting and keeping its best troops, largely because the strong economy offered so many appealing options to young people.
He also said military leaders would face hard choices about expensive equipment. But he said that the military must remain strong and that people who join the service should be treated fairly.
He noted plans for new veterans' hospitals and cemeteries. And, in his only reference to Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Gore had pledged to keep the American military strong in the years to come and to improve conditions for troops. "We know there is more to do," the President said.
The biggest threats to peace in the 21st century, Mr. Clinton said, are likely to be ethnic rivalries, terrorist groups and the spread of nuclear and biological weapons. He added that financial vulnerability around the globe could touch off violence.
Mr. Clinton also defended the role of the United States in the United Nations, saying Washington was obligated to pay its fair share of dues.
The Senate has approved authorizing more than $800 million in back dues, but the House has not passed financing to cover the payments. Conservative Republicans have balked at paying the dues, and last year they saddled the legislation with anti-abortion provisions that led Mr. Clinton to veto the bill.
The overdue amount is also in dispute, with the United Nations arguing that it is owed $1.6 billion and the Administration saying the arrears are closer to $1 billion.
When dealing with a foreign crisis, like the one in the Balkans, Mr. Clinton said today, it is far better to have the help of other countries than to carry the burden alone.
The President also said it was a disgrace that so many American veterans had become homeless. "They should be brought back into the society they did so much to defend," he said.

HEADLINE: Philip M. Klutznick, 92, Builder And a Leader in Jewish Affairs

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Philip M. Klutznick, a Chicago real estate developer, investor and philanthropist who was long prominent in Jewish communal affairs and served as Secretary of Commerce in the Carter Administration, died on Saturday at his home in Chicago. He was 92.
Mr. Klutznick was national president of B'nai B'rith, the service organization, from 1953 to 1959 and president of the World Jewish Congress, an umbrella organization of Jewish communities in 64 countries, from 1977 to 1979. 
 Mr. Klutznick served at various times as chairman of the American Housing Committee for Israel, president of the American Friends of the Hebrew University at Jerusalem and president of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture. He was also active in raising money for the United Jewish Appeal -- serving for a time as its general chairman -- and for many other Jewish institutions and charities.
"He is considered by many to be the leading Jew in the U.S.," Rabbi Seymour Siegel, director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, said in 1985. But Mr. Klutznick's views on Middle East issues were sometimes controversial.
Mr. Klutznick was Secretary of Commerce in 1980 and 1981, after being nominated by President Jimmy Carter to succeed Juanita M. Kreps. By then Mr. Klutznick had wide experience in business and finance and in Democratic fund-raising.
He was also a strong supporter of President Carter and had defended him against criticism among Jews during the tense negotiating in 1978 that led to the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
Mr. Klutznick and other moderate American Jews created a controversy by meeting in Washington with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt in 1978 after some members of the organized leadership of Jews had declined to do so.
Other Government posts that Mr. Klutznick held included commissioner of the Federal Public Housing Authority from 1944 to 1946. President John F. Kennedy named him United States representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations with the rank of ambassador in 1961 and 1962. Mr. Klutznick was also a member of several American delegations to the United Nations General Assembly.
Mr. Klutznick was the founder and head of the Urban Investment and Development Company in Chicago, which later became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company.
Born in Kansas City, Mo., he attended the University of Kansas and the University of Nebraska and received a law degree in 1930 from Creighton University in Omaha. He worked as a lawyer and became involved in housing construction.
During World War II, the Roosevelt Administration put Mr. Klutznick in charge of building houses for defense workers in the eastern United States. In this capacity he was involved in the building of Oak Ridge, Tenn., where major work was done on developing the atomic bomb. After the war, he was active in building suburban shopping malls and other projects in the Chicago area.
He married Ethel Riekes in 1930, and she died in 1996. He is survived by four sons, Robert, of Boulder, Colo., Samuel, of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Thomas and James; a daughter, Bettylu Saltzman, of Chicago; 13 grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
I.M.F. UrgesIndonesia Leader to Act Quickly in Bank Scandal

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund insisted today that President B. J. Habibie of Indonesia order a quick and thorough investigation of a banking scandal that has threatened to undermine the fund's $40 billion bailout of the nation's economy.
The I.M.F. said in a statement that its first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, phoned Mr. Habibie on Saturday, seeking the Indonesian leader's pledge of a full inquiry. 
 The scandal, which has strong political implications for Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation, as it prepares for a presidential election in November, began when an audit showed that a newly nationalized financial institution, Bank Bali, had paid nearly $80 million in commissions to a company controlled by a close political ally of Mr. Habibie.
Today, the Treasury Department joined in expressions of concern over the Indonesia developments. "We are concerned about the allegations and strongly support the I.M.F.'s call for a full, transparent investigation backed by independent auditors of the reported irregularities," a senior Treasury official said.
Among those also implicated in the scandal was the No. 2 official at the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, a Government body established last year at the I.M.F.'s insistence to oversee the rescue of Indonesia's banking industry.
Opposition politicians say they fear that the so-called commissions were intended for use by the ruling Golkar political party in the fall election campaign to help keep Mr. Habibie in power. The payments were supposedly made to a finance company in exchange for helping Bank Bali collect debts from two other banks that had already been taken over by the Government.
Mr. Habibie, the former Vice President, rose to the Indonesian presidency last year after his predecessor, President Suharto, stepped down after more than three decades in power, in the face of public protests over cronyism and repression.
Mr. Habibie and party officials have denied wrongdoing in the Bank Bali case. Still, disclosure of the payments has startled foreign investors and caused the already battered currency, the rupiah, to lose nearly 15 percent of its value in the last week. The scandal broke as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
"The I.M.F. has followed reported developments in the Bank Bali case with increasing concern," a spokesman, Vasuki Shastry, said. "The I.M.F. has emphasized that a satisfactory resolution of the Bank Bali case requires a thorough and independent investigation to be completed as soon as possible."
Mr. Habibie, he said, "assured the I.M.F. that a full investigation is being undertaken in order to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion."
The restructuring agency, its reputation hurt by the scandal, has announced that an independent auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, will review the tens of millions of dollars paid to a finance company controlled by the deputy treasurer of Golkar, the political party of both Mr. Habibie and Mr. Suharto.
Mr. Habibie was already facing a hard campaign after his party's second-place finish in Parliament elections in June. The bank scandal has underlined opposition accusations that Golkar is using public money to help finance his campaign.
Indonesian police authorities have named 10 people as suspects in what they describe as an embezzlement and fraud investigation of Bank Bali, including four officials of the bank and the deputy chairman of the revamping agency, Pande Lubis, who has not responded publicly to the charges. In Parliament today, opposition lawmakers threatened to call for a confidence vote against Mr. Habibie's Government if the President did not act swiftly in dealing with the banking scandal.

HEADLINE: In a Tidy Town, Tiny Flags Make Waves;
Neatness Counts in Stratford, Where Deli Fights Order to Furl Old Glories

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: STRATFORD, Conn., Aug. 11

 BODY:
Michael Reekie has a thing for American flags, especially miniature ones the size of school notebooks. "I buy them by the case," he said proudly.
He also strings them up by the case, so that the front of his Corner Deli, on Nichols Avenue here, looks like a cross between a patriotic used-car lot and an Independence Day float. "These are not offensive in any way," Mr. Reekie, 34, said with some annoyance, as he sat under 99 miniature cloth flags fluttering above the deli's front door. "It's a string of American flags." 
 He is annoyed because, offensive or not, around here his little flags are illegal.
"They fall under banners-slash-streamers," said Gary Lorentson, Stratford's Planning and Zoning Administrator. And, as he pointed out, according to section 16.7 of the town code, banners and streamers are strictly prohibited, as are sidewalk sandwich boards, strobe lights, signs made of "nonrigid material" and anything else that flutters, flashes, spins, buzzes, wags or otherwise moves faster than an ice floe.
In Stratford, even whirling barber poles are against the law.
This blue-collar town of white church steeples and wood-frame houses has its reasons for all the tough rules. Nestled between Long Island Sound's north shore and the western bank of the Housatonic River, Stratford, now in its 356th year, is intent on distinguishing itself from down-market neighbors Bridgeport and Milford.
Like its neighbors, Stratford's economic lifeblood is manufacturing; most of its 49,000 residents have long ridden the fortunes of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, whose plant here builds the Army's Black Hawk and Comanche helicopters. And, like principals that require their pupils to wear uniforms, local officials believe neat appearances beget self-esteem.
"That many flags, no matter how you arrange them, could be very chaotic," said Mr. Lorentson, a tall, thin man who wore a Winnie the Pooh tie on Tuesday. "It's not a matter of patriotism, it's just clutter."
The town feels so strongly about removing Mr. Reekie's miniature flags -- or banners, depending on which side you are on -- that it dispatched gravely worded letters, fined him $70 (which he refuses to pay) and will soon haul him into court.
He can't wait to tell all this to a judge.
"I'm not taking any American flag down, you can't make me," said Mr. Reekie, a Stratford native with moussed blond hair and tattoos crawling up his arms. "My lawyer told me I could legally burn them," he added derisively, "but don't show them, don't show any pride in your country."
Since the town ordered his flags removed about three weeks ago, local folks have lined up behind Mr. Reekie.
Behind his deli counter, he keeps a handwritten petition with 315 names on it, demanding that Mr. Lorentson back off. He has a card from the National Association of Naval Veterans in neighboring Bridgeport, expressing support. A local Vietnam veterans group even called this week to ask whether they could hold a flag-filled demonstration outside his deli.
None of this fazes Mr. Lorentson, who has presided over Stratford's strict zoning laws since 1984.
"I can take it," he said wearily. He can also dish it out: In a typical year, he and his staff send about 400 official warning letters -- an average of one for every 123 residents -- to people who have put up illegal signs or violated other zoning laws.
Residents have fought zoning laws in the past, and won. In 1985, town officials ordered a local Christian group to stop gathering in a local house not zoned for use as a church. The city lost that case in Connecticut Superior Court, Mr. Lorentson said.
Four years ago, on the advice of the town attorney, Mr. Lorentson backed down and changed a prohibition on displaying political signs out-of-season to a mere "recommendation," after one resident refused to remove a candidate's placard from his lawn, months before the fall election. Most times, though, people simply comply with the zoning laws.
Then there is Mr. Reekie, whose deli has become a libertarian cause celebre.
"I'd rather be driven out of business than cave in to these people, it ain't right," he said, then corrected himself: "Isn't right."
Other local business owners have their own thoughts on Stratford's advertising rules.
"The zoning here stinks," said Michael Pantano, 53, who owns a car dealership on Barnum Avenue, the town's main commercial strip. He tried many times to put up something to attract business -- streamers, banners, sidewalk signs, you name it -- but each time a town zoning official came by, sometimes within hours, and order it removed.
"I hung a banner once -- 'We Finance' -- they told us to take it down," Mr. Pantano recalled. "I've tried streamers running from the building to the cars, they told me to take them down. I cannot put anything on cars, I can't even put advertising on the antennas. If I had known that coming in here 13 years ago, I wouldn't have bought this property."
One evening a few years ago, a town zoning official drove by Mr. Pantano's dealership at night, noticed a sign -- "Buy Here, Pay Here"-- illegally stationed on the sidewalk, and removed it himself. Mr. Pantano had to drive the quarter-mile to the Town Hall the next day to get it back. "I feel like we're in Russia," he said.
Now, his dealership is a model of zoning compliance: no signs, no banners or streamers, just eight large American flags flapping -- legally -- above a row of used cars.
Down the street, at Laurel & Harley Motorcycle Accessories, owner Dennis Conroy said his one American flag posted outside was all he could do to attract attention to his little shop.
"I've had people say they drove by here for three or four years and never knew I was here until they saw a motorcycle out front," he said. He does not know Mr. Reekie, but he sympathizes with him. "He's probably in the same boat I am," he said. "He's just a corner store trying to catch a customer's eye."
If Mr. Reekie hates Stratford Town Hall -- and he does so much that he recently started a campaign to change the Town Manager's job into an elected office -- he has his reasons.
In January 1997, he was fined $53 for refusing to take down a flashing neon beer sign from his deli's window. Later that year, he was warned that a three-by-three-foot banner he had put up announcing fresh cappuccino required a permit.
"Real offensive, right?" he said, unfurling the banner, made to resemble an Italian flag. "I bought a $6,000 cappuccino machine; do you know who I can advertise it to now? No one. It's sitting in my garage."
It did not end there. Last year, Mr. Lorentson's deputy came by to tell Mr. Reekie to remove a small sidewalk sign advertising his supply of Beanie Babies. "You can't make a living in this town," he said.
For his part, Mr. Lorentson said he was indifferent to Mr. Reekie's banners-slash-streamers.
"We're just enforcing laws," he said. And yes, he said he enjoys seeing real American flags displayed on homes and businesses around town and even displays one himself at home on occasion.
But not right now. "The holder broke."

HEADLINE: Paying More for Water

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert A. Stavins's argument that the way to avoid squandering water is to price it in accordance with classic economic principles is cogent but addresses only part of the problem (Op-Ed, Aug. 14). 
 In some cities with older infrastructures, much of the water leaving reservoirs and pumping systems never reaches consumers. This water is presumed to be lost because of huge leaks in the distribution system. Public investment, not scarcity pricing, is the only way to stop such losses.
Moreover, sometimes regulation is required, especially when large consumers are insufficiently motivated by economic incentives. I once worked for a laboratory that used large quantities of water for cooling, after which the water was dumped into the sewer system. A closed-loop recirculating system would have paid for itself in a few years, but management refused to pay for it. Only when regulatory officials threatened to cut off the water did the company conserve water -- and save millions of dollars a year.

HEADLINE: Crunching a Few Numbers For Clintons' Dream House

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Since the first days of her house-hunting tour through the hamlets of Westchester County, Hillary Rodham Clinton has worried that she and her husband may not be able to afford the seven-figure showplace homes they have inspected.
The President and Mrs. Clinton are the least affluent couple to occupy the White House since Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter lived there 20 years ago and have not owned their own home since 1983. 
 At the same time they are viewing million-dollar-plus houses, the Clintons are also deep in debt. They owe a battery of lawyers $5.5 million, a sum that far exceeds their assets of about $1.5 million.
While the Clintons are weighing whether to place bids on Westchester properties, the administrators of the Clinton Legal Expense Trust are mailing out appeals for donations and expressing concern that they will not be able to erase the debt before the President leaves office.
Yet an analysis of the Clintons' finances shows that the First Family can still afford to buy a property in the price range of the ones they toured on Sunday, from a $1.7 million seven-bedroom, house in Edgemont, N.Y., to a 4.14-acre property in Rye Brook, N.Y., that is listed at $2.3 million.
Friends and supporters said today that the Clintons had not decided whether to buy or rent a home but that they seemed to be leaning toward making an offer and applying for "a super-jumbo mortgage." And it appears that banks and mortgage lenders would be willing to lend them a lot of money.
If Mrs. Clinton wins election to the Senate from New York in November 2000, her annual income will be $129,619, or 35 percent less than the President's $200,000 annual salary.
When he leaves office in January, 2001, President Clinton could become his family's predominant bread-winner for the first time since the early 1980's. His friends say he has strong potential to earn millions of dollars from book deals, speaking engagements and, possibly, serving on corporate boards.
"He'll do great," said James Carville, a political strategist and a close friend of the Clintons. "His book advance alone will be enough to pay off the balance of a large mortgage."
Other former Presidents, including Gerald Ford, have served on corporate boards. Former President Carter has done well as an author. Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush earned high speaking fees abroad, including a $2 million fee paid to Mr. Reagan by a Japanese corporation.
If Mrs. Clinton loses or abandons her bid for the Senate, she, too, would be in demand. She has already written a best seller, and several publishing executives have said they think her memoirs could fetch more than the President's. Corporations would probably compete for her service on their boards, family friends say.
Mortgage experts say that a couple with an annual income of $500,000 can easily qualify for a mortgage for a home costing $2 million. Of course, most couples do not have the Clintons' legal debts, but then those who have such debts do not have a legal defense fund raising contributions to erase them. But mortgage experts said that most lenders would not penalize the Clintons for their enormous debts unless a civil lawsuit were filed to recover it, which is highly unlikely.
"If they wanted to do 80 percent financing on a $2.2 million house, there will be banks lining up to offer the Clintons a mortgage, as long as there are no judgments or liens filed against them," said Melissa Cohn, president of Manhattan Mortgage Company, a broker for luxury homes.
Ms. Cohn said that banks would certainly also consider Mr. Clinton's future earning potential after he leaves office. "They'll be more than willing to gamble on his ability to earn solid income because of who he is," Ms. Cohn said. "And they won't hold it against him that he is about to become unemployed."
To come up with the cash for a down payment, the Clintons could sell part of their blind trusts. The biggest part of their assets -- worth more than $1 million but less than $5 million -- is a blind trust of securities held in Mrs. Clinton's name, according to a 1998 financial disclosure report filed by the President. The President also has a blind trust estimated to be worth $100,001 to $250,000, his disclosure report says. But most mortgage brokers said that the Clintons would not be required to put down a large down payment.
If the Clintons put down a 20 percent down payment of $440,000 on a $2.2 million house, a 30-year mortgage, at a fixed rate of 8.75 percent, would mean the monthly payment would be $13,845, said Seth Cohen, managing director of Home Mortgage Acceptance Corporation in Manhattan.
Mr. Cohen estimated that the Clintons would also owe about $25,000 a year in property taxes and about $500 a month on insurance. "That comes to a monthly nut of about $16,645," Mr. Cohen said. He said that the Clintons would need to earn about $525,000 a year to qualify for that mortgage. Based on the Clintons' 1998 income, the couple would qualify now for such a mortgage.
One possible way that the Clintons could meet a high monthly mortgage payment, before they left the White House, would be to sell $150,000 or $200,000 worth of securities and keep the money in an interest-bearing checking account, supporters said. Each month, the couple could write a check drawn on that account to meet the high monthly payments until the President's term expires and he begins to earn a higher income.
The Clintons estimated their net worth to fall somewhere between $1.2 million to $5.57 million in their disclosure report released in May. The report requires only a range of figures rather than precise numbers, but White House aides said the trust was worth slightly more than $1 million.
The Clintons' adjusted 1998 gross income of $504,109 came from the $200,000 salary Mr. Clinton receives as President and $200,318 from securities from a blind trust they sold shortly before they paid $850,000 to settle the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against Mr. Clinton. They reported a $5,236 deduction for self-employment, as well as $16,665 in taxable interest, $16,736 in dividends, $1,329 in a state income tax refund from Arkansas and $74,289 in royalties from Mrs. Clinton's best-selling book, "It Takes A Village." In Mr. Clinton's years in the White House, the family's adjusted gross income on their Federal income tax forms went from a high of $1.065 million in 1996 and a low of $263,900 in 1994.
Mrs. Clinton herself has worried aloud about whether a multi-million dollar home is within her family's reach. She pronounced a $3.8 million house beyond their price range. "If I can afford it, I'd buy," the first lady told reporters last month, "but I probably will end up renting."
But in recent days, friends say the Clintons have felt more confident because of the expectation that the President will soon be earning a much larger income.
Worry over the magnitude of their legal debt has also receded. "It's not like a Mastercard," Mr. Carville said of the still-unpaid legal fees. "There's no interest, and the lawyers are not going to sue the President."
According to their 1998 disclosure report, the Clintons owed $1 million each to the Washington law firms of Williams & Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slater, Meagher & Flom. The Clintons also reported owing $100,000 to $250,000 to the Little Rock, Ark., firm of Wright, Lindsey & Jennings and $250,000 to $500,000 to Mayer, Brown & Platt. The Clintons' legal defense fund, which can go only to pay certified legal bills, has already paid $5 million to their lawyers.

Drought-Related Aid For Small Businesses

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Small New Jersey businesses that depend on farmers devastated by the drought will be eligible for Federal disaster loans, the Federal Small Business Administration announced yesterday.
The disaster declaration by the business agency follows similar action taken by the United States Department of Agriculture to help farmers. 
 Under yesterday's declaration, low-interest loans will be available to small agriculture-dependent businesses and small agriculture cooperatives that have suffered economic losses as a result of the dry, hot conditions, said William E. Leggiero Jr., who heads the agency's Niagara Falls Disaster Assistance office.
The declaration includes all 21 counties in New Jersey. Similar loans are available for businesses in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Vermont.
Some businesses that depend on the sale of goods or services to agricultural growers and producers have been unable to pay bills or meet expenses because their customers cannot spend money.
Examples of eligible businesses include farm supply stores, equipment stores, nurseries and trucking companies that haul agriculture products. Other businesses, such as diners, gas stations and grocery stores, whose primary customers are farmers, could also be eligible.
Eligible businesses may qualify for loans of up to $1.5 million. The loans are not available to farmers or businesses not dependent on agriculture.

For Brewers, Money Can't Buy Victories

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
The Minnesota Twins are making progress before their very eyes. In last place for 12 consecutive weeks, one week short of half the season, the Twins are now in third place in the American League Central, holding their largest lead over the fourth-place team. This is a team that has 9 rookies on its 25-man roster and has had as many as 12.
"They have a better understanding of what to do and what needs to be done in the ball game," Tom Kelly, their patient manager/teacher, said. 
 Lack of progress, on the other hand, has taken a toll in Milwaukee. Under Phil Garner and Sal Bando, the Brewers were not moving forward and some other teams were, most notably the Cincinnati Reds, the Oakland Athletics and the Philadelphia Phillies. All three have lower payrolls than the Brewers do, and all three are contending for playoff spots, the Reds and Athletics especially.
"Absolutely I'm aware of what they're doing," Wendy Selig-Prieb said yesterday. As president and chief executive officer of the Brewers, Selig-Prieb was disappointed that the team had not advanced last year and was not showing any progress this season, either. General Manager Bando and Manager Garner shared her disappointment and understood her desire for change.
In 1996 and '97, the Brewers did not quite reach .500 but were closing in on it. Last season they regressed, finishing with a 74-88 record. Last Thursday, the day Garner and Bando were relieved of their duties, they had a winning percentage (.464) that would compute to a 75-87 record for a full season.
"We believed we were ready to take things to the next level here, and it hasn't happened," Selig-Prieb said. "We did a significant increase in our payroll after the '97 season in anticipation of taking it to the next level. When that didn't happen, I concluded we needed to make changes."
The Brewers went from a $22 million payroll in '97 to $37 million and then $41 million this season. The Reds, with a $30 million payroll, were tied for first place in the National League Central at the start of play last night. The Athletics, at $22 million, were only a game off the A.L. wild-card pace. The Phillies, at $30 million, had slipped eight games back in the N.L. wild-card race but were eight games closer to the lead than the Brewers.
The Twins are paying their inexperienced crop of players $16 million for the season. They are not prepared to make a significant increase in their payroll because, unlike the Brewers, they are not close to moving into a new ball park and reaping the economic windfall it usually generates. "I think those teams are a little bit further along than we are," Kelly said of the Reds and the Athletics. "They're somewhat stronger than we are, physically stronger. They hit the ball over the wall. We can't do that. We've got to nickel and dime all the time."
The way Selig-Prieb sees it, the Brewers escalated their payroll from nickels and dimes to quarters and half-dollars, and victories have been as rare as $2 bills.
"We've been aggressive in raising our payroll and in the amateur draft," she said. "In order to build a winning team I believe you have to be aggressive in every area. This is the approach I want to see us take organizationally, an aggressive approach."
In seeking a general manager, the Brewers would do well to find someone who would work in the style of Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager. Strapped by payroll constraints, Bowden scours every avenue of player procurement each winter and usually comes up with an interesting mix of players. One baseball official has referred to his style as razzle-dazzle.
In her search for a general manager and a manager, Selig-Prieb will also cast a net wide enough to take in minority candidates.
She is in a pivotal position. Her father, a k a the commissioner, has directed teams to notify him of their lists of candidates for vacancies at high- and middle-level positions. If they can't identify minority candidates, Bud Selig has told the clubs, he will help them. Selig-Prieb doesn't need help; she has been involved in high-level discussions about baseball's need to increase the number of members of minorities in decision-making jobs. "I feel it's the right thing to do," she said. "I think it's not only the right thing to do, but it's a good thing to do. Our process will be very, very inclusive."
Selig-Prieb is not saying the Brewers automatically will hire a black or a Hispanic person as general manager or manager or both, but others believe the chances are good that a member of a minority group will fill one of those positions. Among members of minority groups currently employed in baseball, the No. 1 candidate for a general manager's job is Omar Minaya, the Mets' senior assistant general manager. If Bob Watson, the Yankees' former general manager, is ready to jump back into the fire, he would also be a high-ranking candidate.
Managerial candidates could include Don Baylor, who was the Brewers' hitting coach in 1990 and '91; Willie Randolph, who was popular in Milwaukee when he batted .327 for the Brewers in 1991, his one season with them, and Chris Chambliss, who, like Randolph, has been overlooked in recent years by teams interested in hiring whites only.
To Selig-Prieb's credit, the Brewers will not be one of those teams.

HEADLINE: Welcome to College. Now Meet Our Sponsor.

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY

 BODY:
Starting today, when students at Appalachian State University check their E-mail or course outlines on line, they will be looking at advertising from dozens of companies including Amazon.com, Dell Computer and an apartment-locator service called SpringStreet.
Something similar will be happening soon at Villanova University, the University of Memphis, the University of Oregon, the University of Idaho and more than 500 other institutions that have signed up commercial companies to run campus Web sites and E-mail services. 
 "Christmas '98 was the first 'E-Christmas'; we think this is the first 'E-back-to-school,' " said Chad Muir, chief executive of Campus Pipeline, a company that says it has agreements to provide Web services to 420 colleges and universities, including Appalachian State, at little or no cost.
While at many universities students continue to use Web pages that the universities have created and paid for themselves, at these 500 institutions advertisers will be paying the bills. And the placement of advertising on what some regard as the purest area of the Internet -- the educational domain -- has spurred a heated debate.
The issue is what place advertising should have in the college environment, real or virtual, particularly in public institutions. Some educators are alarmed at what they see as a crass commercial intrusion, yet administrators and others say that faced with financial constraints, they have little choice.
"There is no place for commercial advertisements within the precincts of any school that takes its educational mission seriously," said Scott Rice, an English professor at San Jose State University who is researching the effects of commercialization on education.
Jeff Williams, director of information-technology services at Appalachian State, said he had heard such arguments. But that is not stopping Appalachian State -- a public institution in Boone, N.C. with 12,500 students -- from adopting the advertising model and avoiding the need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to create the Web sites on its own.
"Some people will say that it's not ethical to advertise," Mr. Williams said. "Given our druthers, we'd rather not ourselves. But it's a pretty attractive model. We'll live with it."
Mr. Williams has rolled out the program by instructing 2,500 first-year students at Appalachian State to log into the system this week. They will be among the first in the country to experience such advertising-based pages on a university Web site. Each page includes a square advertisement -- what the company likes to call a sponsorship -- in the top right-hand corner.
A page labeled Campus Central has information about campus events as well as paid advertisements -- not labeled as such -- that link to businesses offering textbooks, financial aid information, educational testing services, auctions and housing. A Web Shopping section will provide additional links to on-line retailers.
Campus Pipeline will also try to learn more about what is essentially a captive audience. When students first log into campus Web sites, they will be asked to fill out an optional form about their interests. If they do, they will receive product pitches in their E-mail.
Faculty members at Appalachian State are just learning of the deal -- and several are voicing concerns about both commercialization and student privacy. "We're throwing our freshmen to the wolves," said Andrew Koch, an associate professor of political science. "The university has become a shill for the corporate community."
"This tells volumes," he continued, "about the university, its funding, and the business mindset that has taken over."
But as campuses struggle with the costs of technology -- and the constant need to upgrade it -- such deals are becoming more and more attractive, administrators say. Creating an internal Web service, known as an intranet, that seamlessly pulls information from multiple data bases around campus could cost as much as $2 million for a midsize public university, if not more. Public universities, especially, are finding it difficult to pay such costs while many are facing tightening budgets.
Campus Pipeline, a start-up company based in Salt Lake City, began approaching colleges late last year. It has investments from Sun Microsystems, Dell Computer and McKinsey & Company, among others, and says it intends to bring 100 of its 420 clients on line by the end of the fall term. In addition to advertising revenue, it plans to earn commissions on student purchases from Web sites to which it provides links.
In addition to Campus Pipeline, at least one other company, called YouthStream, is offering similar services, and says it has signed up more than 100 colleges and universities. YouthStream, based in New York City, has opened a site called MyBytes.Com, which provides students with on-line calendars, materials to supplement their classes, financial-aid information, and Web pages for courses if professors choose to use them. Each page includes an advertisement or a link to an electronic shopping area.
Some students are expecting to be practically awash in promotions as soon as they log in to their college's Web site. "I don't see anything wrong with it, unless it gets out of hand," said Ken Greene, a junior at the University of Memphis. "That's all the Web is, is lots of advertising."
But the concept is a striking departure for most institutions of higher education. Academia, after all, is where the Internet grew up, and for years, as the Web has become increasingly commercialized, colleges have kept their distance, priding themselves on creating an on-line presence that is free of promotion.
This summer, however, colleges have been bombarded by pitches from companies that are eager to gain electronic access to the Internet-loving student market. Many are approaching athletic departments, hoping to strike deals to promote apparel or soft drinks on pages about sports teams. Policy makers at some colleges are even being approached by administrators on their own campuses who want to provide Web links to on-line stores like Amazon.com, so that the college can take in commissions.
"The academy is not a billboard community," said Margaret A. Miller, president of the American Association for Higher Education. "But it is also the case that the academy is subject to the same economic strains as the rest of the world." The result, Dr. Miller said, is that the costs of technology create a "blurring line" on the issue.
At Appalachian State, Mr. Williams said, "There is no way we could have done it ourselves." As one of Campus Pipeline's first colleges, Appalachian State has not yet had to pay anything for the services. Other colleges and universities may have to pay for installation, which could cost as much as $32,000, but that sum administrators say is still far less than the cost of designing and maintaining a system.
Besides, Mr. Williams said, colleges like Appalachian State do not have much choice. Students now expect to be able to fill out financial-aid forms and register for classes on line. Colleges that do not offer such services may lose their ability to attract students.
A similar approach was taken almost a decade ago by Channel One, a program started by the Whittle Communications company that supplied middle schools and high schools with television sets and paid for them with commercials. It is still derided by some educators as a means of pushing advertising in front of captive students.
In this latest example, the executives of the Web-based companies see their approach as nothing more than a continuation of a trend that has already become a big part of higher education. Public and private universities of all sizes have already turned over dining services to Marriott, student unions to Taco Bell, copying centers to Kinkos. "Schools are increasingly getting out of specialized services that they would rather outsource," said Harlan Peltz, YouthStream's chief executive.
Yet many educators say they want a line to be drawn, particularly when it comes to spaces -- on or off line -- where students are supposed to be learning and exploring.
Thomas Ehrlich, a former president of Indiana University, said he was troubled by the idea of advertisements on sites where professors hold on-line office hours or post syllabuses. "I think that is much too intrusive," said Mr. Ehrlich, who is now a fellow at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
Other colleges with large endowments, like most Ivy League universities, have declined to have commercially sponsored Web sites. Many of them say that they have the resources to create on-line services like admissions and registration without outside help. That may lead students at less selective colleges to be exposed to a barrage of advertising, while students at elite colleges are insulated from it.
"You create a different set of haves and have-nots, so to speak," said Jose-Marie Griffiths, chief information officer at the University of Michigan, where the idea of having commercially sponsored Web pages was rejected.
For those that have signed up, protecting students' privacy has been a large concern. As Campus Pipeline and YouthStream collect information about students, university administrators say that they want to make sure that the information is not sold or traded to other companies.
Susan Hilton, an assistant director in the computing center at the University of Oregon, said that her campus had been working with Campus Pipeline to whittle down the list of questions it asks students and to keep the information confidential. "That took a while to make that point," she said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 18, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about universities that have signed up commercial companies to operate campus Web sites referred incorrectly to an agreement between the University of Oregon and one such company, Campus Pipeline. While the university has agreed to test Campus Pipeline's software with a small number of students, it has not contracted to adopt the software fully or have the company run the campus site.

HEADLINE: LEADERS IN BOSNIA ARE SAID TO STEAL UP TO $1 BILLION

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
As much as a billion dollars has disappeared from public funds or been stolen from international aid projects through fraud carried out by the Muslim, Croatian and Serbian nationalist leaders who keep Bosnia rigidly partitioned into three ethnic enclaves, according to an exhaustive investigation by an American-led antifraud unit.
The antifraud unit, set up by the Office of the High Representative, the international agency responsible for carrying out the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace agreement, has exposed so much corruption that relief agencies and embassies are reluctant to publicize the thefts for fear of frightening away international donors. 
 The report names several officials linked to the governing nationalist parties that it says profited from the fraud. Even though the Office of the High Representative has dismissed 15 officials or prevented them from holding office, most retain authority.
In one incident cited in the report, 10 foreign embassies and international aid agencies lost more than $20 million deposited in a Bosnian bank, but only the Swiss Embassy has publicly acknowledged its losses.
The antifraud unit, which requires special security measures and does not make public who is working for the organization in Bosnia, is now investigating 220 cases of fraud and corruption. It documents the current cases in a 4,000-page report that has not been released to the public. Its contents were made available to The New York Times.
Organizations as diverse at the Office of the High Representative, the United Nations and the United States Agency for International Development, all dedicated to rebuilding the country, have lost tens of millions of dollars, the report says.
The widespread corruption is viewed by many here as a severe blow in the long, frustrating struggle to build a democratic Bosnia, a country that has received $5.1 billion in international aid since the end of the war in 1995. The corruption has also played a pivotal role in driving away foreign investment, seen as the only way to free Bosnia from dependence on foreign assistance.
The missing funds were supposed to have been used to rebuild Bosnia's roads, buildings and schools, as well as to provide municipal services in towns throughout Bosnia.
Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, along with other senior nationalist leaders, has dismissed the allegations of official corruption made by the international investigators. While conceding that corruption takes place, the President disputes the scale of the charges, denying that as much as a billion dollars has been misappropriated as stated in the long and detailed report.
Mr. Izetbegovic has repeatedly denied the charges, most recently in a local press interview. "It would be nonsense to claim that there is no corruption, or that it is irrelevant, in a country that has just come out of the war," he said, adding that Bosnia is a country "which does not have established borders, where joint institutions are still not functioning, and which has at least two armies and two police forces."
The Dayton agreement, which was signed by Muslim, Croatian and Serbian warring factions in 1995, called for the creation of a single state and the return of two million refugees and displaced people to their homes. But Bosnia remains partitioned into three antagonistic ethnic enclaves.
Serb-held Bosnia continues to operate as a separate entity. The internationally created Muslim-Croat Federation has no authority and has been unable to raise revenues. The two million refugees and displaced people have not gone back to their homes. And the Office of the High Representative, the chief civilian international agency in Bosnia, has been reduced to promising money and aid projects to towns and cities that say they will allow some refugees to return, promises that are usually never kept.
"Dayton stopped the violence, but it did not end the war," said Jacques P. Klein, the chief United Nations representative here, "and the war is still being fought bureaucratically through obfuscation, delay and avoidance by a group of leaders who do not want to lose power. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a patient on life support assistance -- political, military and economic."
International donors say the endemic fraud is making it harder to justify continued aid levels. Without the huge infusions of money, it is unlikely that the Muslim, Croatian and Serbian enclaves will be able to continue to pay pensions and salaries and reconstruct the country. The Sarajevo Government, for instance, has asked the World Bank for loans to make pension payments.
"Time is running out," said James Lyon, director of the Crisis Group, an independent research organization. "The international community has no enforcement mechanism. The international administrators beg, plead, cajole and in some case engage in what looks like bribery, promising cities infrastructure projects if they allow some refugees to return. This tactic might work if we continue the present aid levels, about a billion dollars a year, over the next 20 years. But as aid declines, what will make these people even promise to comply?"
Tuzla, a Muslim city, is one case study of widespread corruption that infects many local governments, the report says. The investigators' report charges that $200 million was missing from this year's budget, in addition to $300 million missing over the last two years.
Tuzla's schools were painted four times last year alone by the city government, although they were rebuilt and painted by international aid organizations as well. Tuzla officials paid two or three times the normal price for such work and sold many of the cans of paint on the local market, the auditors found. Many of the schools, meanwhile, still lack heat.
In the town of Sanski Most, heavily damaged during the war, municipal funds are being used to build a horse racing track, much to the consternation of aid agencies, the report said.
The report charges the town's Mayor, Mehmed Alagic, with 358 counts of corruption. The charges include the theft of $450,000 in relief aid from Saudi Arabia. That money was supposed to be used to provide feed and farm equipment, but the report alleges that the Mayor gave the money instead to his brother to start a bank. The Mayor has denied the charges and accused the Office of the High Representative of mounting a campaign against him.
The most sensitive case under investigation by the antifraud unit concerns the Bosnia and Herzegovina Bank, or BiH, in Sarajevo. The bank took in tens of millions of dollars from international agencies and 10 foreign embassies. The money, the investigators say, was lent to fictional businesses or given as personal loans to friends by the two owners.
The bank has now collapsed. The collapse underscores a near-total failure to establish a viable banking industry. Of the some 50 banks in Bosnia, Western diplomats say, only 6 are solvent.
The Agency for International Development, which has not made its losses public, had at least $4 million in the BiH bank, according to Western diplomats. At least half of the $20 million lost by international organizations deposited in the bank was to have been used for reconstruction projects, the investigators said.
"Our fear is that once the extent of the theft is known, international donors will get disgusted and walk away," said an official at the Office of the High Representative, who asked not to be identified.
AID has also filed suit in Bosnian courts against 19 Bosnian companies, which have failed to repay loans worth more than $10 million. The loans, ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, are part of a $278 million revolving credit established in 1996 by AID to help kick-start the economy. The agency, unable to collect $1 million in loans from Hidrogradnja, one of Bosnia's largest companies, is trying to seize its assets.
The rampant corruption has discouraged foreign investment. Most foreign companies, including McDonald's, have refused to set up operations after demands by officials to pay bribes and do business exclusively with local party officials. Other companies -- like the Italian construction company Aluveneto and Gluck Norm, Germany's largest maker of door and window frames -- have pulled out with heavy losses, complaining of interference from the state, an inability to collect debts and demands by officials for kickbacks and bribes to stay in business.
Volkswagen is also considering pulling out of Bosnia, according to European diplomats. Volkswagen officials would not comment. The German Government pushed hard to get the company to reopen its heavily damaged plant in the Sarajevo suburb of Vogosca. Volkswagen did so on condition that the Bosnian Government buy official cars from the plant. Not only has the Government reneged on its promise, forcing Volkswagen to go to court, but the state company in partnership has also refused to pay the $1 million it promised to invest.
The money-losing Volkswagen plant does only final assembly on car bodies shipped from the Skoda auto works in the Czech Republic. Sixty workers assemble about six cars a day from the kits. Few sell, in part because of the thousands of stolen cars brought into the country from Europe by local gangsters.
The used car market in Stolac, which convenes every Sunday in the Croat-controlled part of Bosnia, has one of the largest collections of stolen vehicles in Europe, according to the international police.
On one recent Sunday, some 400 cars, most with forged registration papers and German, Swiss and Italian license plates, were being sold for large wads of German marks. The gangs that bring the cars into Bosnia oversee the sales.
The Office of the High Representative has outlawed the market. It pressed in January to have the market's organizer, Jozo Peric, arrested. But the local Croatian court released him a few days later and dismissed the charges. Now Mr. Peric is in hiding. When federal tax officials showed up last year to try carry out an audit, they were beaten so badly that they were hospitalized.
Officials of the Office of the High Representative and Western diplomats say one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in Bosnia is Bakir Izetbegovic, the son of President Izetbegovic. He controls The City Development Institute, in charge of determining the occupancy rights of 80,000 publicly owned apartments in Sarajevo. The apartments, many of which belonged to Serbs or Croats before the war, have been given to members of the governing Muslim-led Social Democratic Party. Others who want occupancy rights must pay Mr. Izetbegovic $2,000, said several Bosnians who have paid the fee.
Mr. Izetbegovic owns 15 percent of Bosnia Air, the state airline, and takes a cut of the extortion money paid out by local shopkeepers to Sarajevo gangsters, the diplomats said. Mr. Izetbegovic has consistently denied any involvement in such activities.
When foreign aid agencies or even the Office of the High Representative try to turn to Bosnian courts for redress, they run up against an overwhelmed and corrupt system.
The Agency for International Development is moving against several large state-owned companies. But creditors are rarely able to collect. The Tuzla courts, for instance, have a backlog of more than 30,000 cases of organized and violent crime. There were 1,050 convictions last year, and in most of the cases, those convicted were released on parole.
Even when laws are passed to try to contain the fraud, politicians have blocked or ignored them. For instance, last year the Bosnian Assembly passed a law to allow the Government to tax the oil and gas trucked in from Croatia. The revenue was expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But when the law appeared in the official gazette, the articles stipulating the taxation were inexplicably missing. The Croatian mafia that brings in the oil and gas continues to pay no taxes. Although the case is in a Sarajevo court, diplomats say the judges, fearing retribution, are afraid to try it.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 20, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
The opening paragraph of a front-page article on Tuesday about an international investigation of widespread corruption in Bosnia referred incompletely to the losses estimated at $1 billion.
According to the anti-fraud unit of the Office of the High Representative, which is the international agency helping to carry out the 1995 peace agreement for Bosnia, at least $20 million of that total was in foreign aid from a variety of countries. But the vast majority of the money was either stolen from Bosnian public funds or lost through Bosnian officials' failure to collect taxes, either through corruption or mismanagement. These specifics appeared later in the article.
Those conclusions, among others, were drawn from thousands of pages of case files prepared by the Federation Financial Police, a Bosnian law-enforcement agency supervised by the Office of the High Representative. Two American members of the anti-fraud unit of the Office of the High Representative discussed the case files with a correspondent for The Times and read from them during an interview.
The article also referred imprecisely to a file of 4,000 pages that dealt with Tuzla. The jurisdiction covered was the Canton of Tuzla, not the city, which is part of the canton.
Through an editing error, the article also characterized the tax revenues of the Muslim-Croat Federation incorrectly. It indeed raises revenue, but falls short of its budget.

HEADLINE: A Crisis Without A Reform

BYLINE: By Jeffrey E. Garten; Jeffrey E. Garten is dean of the Yale School of Management.

 BODY:
At this time last year it seemed as if the global economy was hanging by a thread. Russia was defaulting on its debt, the first emerging market to do so since the Asian crisis had begun. The world's largest hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, was hemorrhaging badly and would soon require a $3.5 billion bailout. And the Federal Reserve was preparing to lower interest rates to keep the world financial system from imploding.
What a difference a year makes. 
 Or does it? Yes, the American economy is still booming, Europe is gaining some steam, and even several emerging markets like South Korea and Mexico seem to be on the mend. It would be easy to conclude that what President Clinton, in a speech last fall, called the worst financial crisis in 50 years was vastly overblown. It's a short jump from that to believing that whatever big problems existed have been more or less fixed. But this line of reasoning would be seriously flawed.
The fact is that although millions of people in emerging markets have suffered horribly -- losing their jobs, going bankrupt, sinking into poverty -- the crisis wasn't long enough or deep enough to result in the kinds of corrective measures that would result in a less risky global economy. Indeed, little of a fundamental nature has changed, and in some respects the environment is more fragile today.
Let's review why this August looks so much better than a year ago. The Fed's exquisitely timed interest rate reductions last summer and fall were, collectively, the turning point in the crisis. But we had a lot of luck, too. The Asian crisis hit when our economy was in exceptionally good shape, breaking records for price stability and job creation in the midst of a long consumer-led boom that was simply too powerful to derail. And Wall Street trusted Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, Mr. Rubin's deputy and eventual successor as Treasury Secretary.
We were also lucky that foreign money returned to Asia with lightning speed. This was in marked contrast to the 10 years it took for bankers to resume lending to Latin America during the debt crisis of the 1980's. Finally, the International Monetary Fund played a role with its austerity packages, but in reality, soon after most emerging nations agreed to belt-tightening, they started to return to their old free-spending ways.
None of these developments were accompanied by fundamental reforms. The cries for "a new financial architecture" were forgotten even before there was any echo. "Crony capitalism" in emerging nations is alive and well. While leaders of these countries understand the need for sound banking regulation -- the lack of which was a cause of the crisis -- it will take many years to reach Western standards. The same goes for bankruptcy laws and other necessary foundations for modern capitalism.
There have been no big changes on the global level, either, and last year's debates have lost their intensity. Should short-term speculations by foreign investors in emerging markets be controlled? Should private lenders be obligated to help bail out the countries to which they lent too much?
Last winter, I interviewed 20 top officials on Wall Street and in Washington to get their views on what caused the financial debacle and how to deal with it. They didn't agree on much, except on one point: we are in for a series of financial crises over the next several years. Why? The global system is no stronger than its weakest links. And there are plenty of them, from Japan, with its sky-high debts, to the tension-ridden emerging countries that are trying to move from closed to open societies. The executives pointed to widening regulatory gaps as the movement of money outpaced governments' ability to supervise the system.
No one I interviewed would even dare guess when and how the next crisis will arise. But the most worrisome set of circumstances relates to the United States, which for the last few years has been single-handedly supporting the world economy. Perhaps recent tremors in many public Internet-related companies -- 40 percent of which were trading below their initial offering price earlier this month -- are telling us something about the sustainability of our soaring market. Or, could it be that the recent downward pressure on the dollar -- stemming from our soaring trade deficits, or the fact that American investors are moving big money to Europe and elsewhere -- is a sign that something is amiss? There is also the bond market, where prices have been dropping and rates moving up.
Most important, a weak dollar and a tightening labor market may cause the Fed to increase interest rates for a second time this summer when it meets on Tuesday, or perhaps at its next meeting this fall. If this trend continues, it could spook the market rather than steady it, and stifle consumer confidence. A receding tide could expose many problems that have been camouflaged by our sustained growth, like enormous consumer debt or the continued growth of risky, unregulated hedge funds.
 There are also some glaring weak spots abroad. For the past few years China helpfully kept its currency steady, becoming a big island of stability among emerging markets. But now it is flirting with devaluation, a move that could jeopardize the fragile recoveries of its neighbors by undercutting the prices of their exports. Argentina, until recently a pillar of strength in South America, is projecting negative growth of 3.5 percent this year. These are not huge economies. But remember that the last crisis began in Thailand.
The point is not to add up everything that could go wrong, but to recognize that globalization implies that everyone and everything is more closely connected than ever before, but on a foundation that is still shaky.
Of course, like last year at this time, our luck may hold. But it's like playing Russian roulette with some additional bullets loaded in the chamber.

HEADLINE: Tiffany Posts 70% Increase in Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Tiffany & Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 70 percent, higher than expected, on strong sales of luxury goods in the United States, Asia and Europe.
Shares of Tiffany rose 13 percent, gaining $6.3125 each, to $53. 
 Net income rose to $23 million, or 31 cents a share, from $13.5 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier. That beat the 24-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Revenue rose 24 percent, to $307.1 million.
United States sales rose 23 percent as high consumer confidence encouraged shoppers to splurge on items like crystal, china and jewelry, ranging from diamond engagement rings to silver bracelets. Increased sales in Asia and Europe also helped earnings.
Sales in United States stores open at least a year rose 12 percent, while catalogue and direct marketing sales rose 5 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Rallyon Moderate Rise in Consumer Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds rallied sharply yesterday after a Labor Department report showed that consumer prices rose in July at the level that Wall Street had expected. Investors signaled their relief that prices had risen only moderately, making it likely that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee would raise short-term interest rates only slightly when it meets next Tuesday.
The 30-year Treasury bond gained 1 2/32, to a price of 101 20/32, dropping its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 6.01, down from 6.08 percent Monday and its lowest level in three weeks. 
 "Economic data released today did not deter market participants from the expectation of a quarter-point Fed tightening move," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. He said the increase "could well incorporate a rise in the discount rate in addition to the lifting of the Federal funds rate target." The Federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans, while the discount rate is what the Fed charges member banks.
As expected, the Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of a percent last month, led by a rise in energy prices.
"The bond market rallied on the news mainly in relief that the C.P.I. increase did not exceed expectations," Mr. Fine said.
Other reports issued yesterday showed strength in the housing sector and in factory production. Combined with recent strong data on jobs, wages and auto sales, they point to continued strong economic activity.
Bond traders said yesterday's market gains fed on themselves as the day's economic reports soothed what had been overblown fears of an aggressive raising of interest rates by the Fed next week and in the months ahead.
"We saw a lot of buying after the C.P.I. number and very little selling," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla. "The fact that there was no follow-through buying in equities was also a definite positive for bonds."
Elsewhere in the market, supply was a factor as the Treasury sold $10 billion of new one-year bills at an auction that was weaker than expected and DaimlerChrysler priced its $4.5 billion global offering through underwriters led by Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith Barney.
The global sale came in three parts. The company sold $1 billion of a floating-rate issue due in 2002 and priced to yield 27 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered rate. Another $1.5 billion of five-year notes were priced to yield 6.935 percent, or 115 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security. And $2 billion of 10-year notes were priced to yield 134 basis points more than a comparable Treasury. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
It was DaimlerChrysler's first United States dollar-denominated global issue to be used to refinance older debt, and it attracted a broad range of investors, of which 15 percent were international, mostly European and some Asian. Insurance companies and mutual funds were large buyers of the securities, which came in with a strong name, global presence and a good credit rating. Investor demand drew about $9 billion in bids.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 52-week bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Price . . . 95.000
High Rate . . . 4.94%

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Output Rises In Brazil for A 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Brazil's economy showed fresh signs of recuperation today in a Government report indicating that the broadest measure of economic activity expanded for the second consecutive quarter.
The gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.93 percent in the second quarter. In the first three months of 1999, the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 percent. 
 Although the report showed that output growth weakened compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, today's figures still reflected a gradual recovery from a recession caused in part by an outflow of investments from many developing countries.
Industrial companies -- like Embraer S.A., a leading manufacturer of small passenger jets -- led the recovery with growth of 2 percent, according to Brazil's statistics agency. A plunge early this year in the value of the Brazilian currency has benefited big exporters like Embraer by making their products more affordable and competitive in overseas markets.
"Industry showed a lot of muscle in the second quarter, making it apparent this isn't a recuperation based on fluctuating agricultural fortunes," said Masaru Nakayasu, the chief economist here with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
Yet while companies like Embraer are doing well, many other Brazilian businesses are struggling.
"We're seeing real growth, but you have to put it into perspective," said Marcelo Allain, chief economist at Banco Inter-American Express. "The economy is emerging from a very weak period in the second half of last year."
There are many signs of continued economic distress. For instance, companies seeking to secure financing in international markets, where interest rates have been lower than in Brazil, are facing the worst borrowing conditions in five years. According to the Brazilian Association of Investment Banks, international borrowing by Brazilian companies fell to $6.4 billion in the first half of this year from $17.1 billion a year earlier.
"Aside from some minor exceptions, I don't see strong demand for primary issues out of Brazil and the rest of Latin America," Carlos Novis Guimaraes, head of Latin American investment banking at Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.
The country's financial markets are reflecting a general feeling of anxiety over the course of the economy, Latin America's largest.
The Brazilian currency, the real, has come under renewed pressure, weakening 4 percent so far this month. And the benchmark Bovespa stock index has declined 13 percent in the last month. Today, the index fell 1.92 percent, as the gross domestic product figures were overshadowed by concern that political infighting in the capital, Brasilia, could delay congressional approval of budget cuts.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares Up for3d Consecutive Session, and Dow Gains 70.29

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a third consecutive session yesterday, led by Citigroup and other financial-sector issues which gained because of optimism that inflation is not picking up.
Investors still expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point when policy makers meet next Tuesday. But a report yesterday that the Consumer Price Index rose a seasonally adjusted three-tenths of 1 percent in July showed no unexpected increase in inflation. 
 "The trend is now back up" in the stock market, said Robert Bloom, chief investment officer for Friends, Ivory & Sime, which manages $4.3 billion in assets. "There's still no sign of troubling inflation numbers out there," suggesting that the Fed will not have to raise interest rates more than that quarter-point this year.
The Fed last changed the overnight lending rate on loans between banks June 30, raising it a quarter-point, to 5 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 70.29 points, to 11,117.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.39 points, to 1,344.16. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 25.94, to 2,671.22. Three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
Major stock indexes are down from their July 16 closing highs because of investor concern that the Fed will raise rates several times in the coming months to stem inflation. Such increases could raise business costs and reduce earnings, thus making stocks less attractive investments.
With rate fears abating, though, yesterday's rally lifted the Dow to within 93 points of its high.
"Today's number wasn't a positive surprise; it was right in line" with forecasts, said Robert LaFleur, chief investment strategist for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, which oversees $230 billion. Investors, he said, would not bid stocks higher until they knew how much interest rates would increase.
Trading was comparatively light. Roughly 691.5 million shares traded on the Big Board, less than the three-month daily average of 727 million.
Citigroup rose 1 5/16 a share, to 47 5/8; American Express gained 4 3/8, to 140 1/4, and Bank of America climbed 2 1/8, to 64 5/8. The prices of some financial stocks already reflect expected declines in earnings, Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said.
He said that Citigroup, Mellon Bank and Wells Fargo were among his top picks. Mellon gained 7/8 a share, to 34 1/8, and Wells Fargo rallied 1 3/8, to 41 3/8.
Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 5 3/4, to 104 1/2, after the company, the No. 2 computer maker, reported a profit that was a penny more than the analyst consensus of 80 cents a share but short of the most optimistic forecasts.
Several retailers' stocks fell, despite earnings reports that were better than expected. Home Depot Inc. lost 15/16 a share, to 63 1/16, after posting a profit of 44 cents a share, up from 31 cents a year earlier and surpassing the consensus estimate of 42 cents.
Limited Inc. fell 7/16 a share, to 44 3/8. The apparel retailer said it earned 26 cents a share before extraordinary items, double the profit in the quarter a year earlier and matching analyst estimates.
With the retailers' reports today, 475 of the companies in the S.& P. 500 have posted second-quarter results. Operating profit for the companies in the index grew 14.6 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the first quarter of 1997, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings.

HEADLINE: Hoping for Repeat Success, Auto Makers Build a Hybrid

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Pickup trucks are popular and auto makers cannot build sport utility vehicles fast enough, so three auto makers have separately come to the same conclusion: it is time to start building sport utility pickups.
At an annual convention here to show dealers the offerings for the new model year, the Ford Motor Company introduced the Explorer Sport Trac, to go on sale in January. Like similar vehicles planned for next year by the General Motors Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company, the Sport Trac has the passenger compartment of a four-door sport utility vehicle but also has a short, open truck bed in back. 
 New classes of automobiles come along rarely, and it is a particularly unusual example of parallel automotive evolution for three companies to try to create the same new market at the same time. The coming proliferation of sport utility pickups is a sign that the light truck market is starting to resemble the car market, in which auto makers are forced to bear the cost of designing dozens of vehicles of various shapes and sizes to compete in ever-smaller market niches.
Joseph C. Collins Jr., Ford's brand manager for sport utility vehicles and minivans, said that 21 new sport utility vehicle models would be reaching the market in the next year and a half, so Ford had to come up with new designs like the Sport Trac to distinguish itself. "We're going to have a plethora of S.U.V.'s in the marketplace, and that's a problem and a challenge," he said.
Ford dealers here were enthusiastic about the new vehicle, saying it would appeal to people who perceived pickup trucks as too plain but still wanted to be able to carry big objects like chairs or camping equipment. "I can name 10 customers off the top of my head who are willing to buy this truck," said Laura Martin, a Ford dealer from Bremen, Ind., who attended the convention.
But auto analysts say that sport utility pickups are not different enough from sport utility vehicles and pickups to prompt Americans to flock to dealerships. "It isn't going to expand the market the way the Explorer did" when Ford introduced it in 1990, said James Hall, the president of industry analysis at Auto Pacific Inc., a market research firm based in Santa Ana, Calif. "It'll parasite sales from compact pickups and sport utilities."
Sport utility vehicles have become the lifeblood of the auto industry in recent years, with profits of $5,000 to $15,000 each, because they can be built cheaply like pickups but are in such demand that they can be sold with big markups. As more models crowd the market, these margins are starting to fall but remain far higher than for any other types of automobiles. The auto industry hopes that it can charge the same markups on sport utility pickups as on sport utility vehicles, in which case profit margins would actually improve for customers who switch to the new vehicles from pickups.
Sport utility pickups, like normal pickups and sport utility vehicles, will be regulated as light trucks, so they will be subject to more lenient fuel economy, pollution, safety and tax rules than cars. As is the case for many sport utility vehicles, Ford decided to produce the vehicle in 1996, before criticism of sport utility vehicles over safety and pollution concerns began to emerge.
Because most sport utility vehicles are essentially pickup trucks with fancy interiors and more sporty exteriors, the new sport utility pickups are not as expensive to design as new vehicles would be. The Sport Trac, for example, combines two Ford vehicles that already share a common underbody: the Explorer sport utility vehicle and the Ranger pickup.
The Sport Trac has more rear seat room than a Ranger, but only a four and a half foot bed, not the Ranger's six-foot bed.
The Sport Trac will be the first high-volume sport utility pickup on the market. Nissan has been working on a similarly sized sport utility pickup that will combine two of its vehicles that also have a common underbody, the Xterra sport utility vehicle and the Frontier pickup. According to industry consultants, G.M.'s Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac units are working on combinations of a Suburban sport utility vehicle and a Silverado pickup. G.M. refuses to discuss the vehicles yet for competitive reasons.
The first sport utility pickup to reach the market will be yet another Ford Motor product, the Lincoln Blackwood, a combination of a Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle and an F-150 pickup. The Blackwood, which will come with a wood-lined bed and is expected to sell for $40,000 or more, is scheduled to go on sale later this autumn but is purely a niche vehicle, with Ford only planning to build a few thousand each year.
By contrast, the Sport Trac is likely to cost closer to $23,000, although no price has been set yet. Ford will market the Sport Trac to men and women in their 30's with outdoor life styles, said Jan Klug, Ford's marketing and advertising manager for Ford brand cars and light trucks, people who, "want to be able to throw all the stinky stuff in the back and have the people in the front."

ASIA
 
INDIA: NUCLEAR DOCTRINE -- India should adhere to its nuclear arms policy of "retaliation only" while building "credible minimum deterrence" with the ability to fire its weapons from the land, air or sea, according to a recommendation by the National Security Advisory Board. The 27-member panel was asked by the Government to suggest a "doctrine," or set of strategic goals, to guide a nuclear buildup. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: SUHARTO EXAMINED -- Former President Suharto underwent medical tests as doctors tried to find the cause of his intestinal bleeding. Mr. Suharto, left, who is 78, was in power for 32 years until pressed to step down last year. He was hospitalized on Saturday with an ailment his doctors say is not related to a minor stroke that he suffered last month. (AP) 

CHINA: MOVE TO BLOCK SECT LEADER -- Beijing asked Britain to bar entry to the leader of the outlawed spiritual movement Falun Gong after he was reported to be planning to attend a conference in Britain later this month. Britain responded that it had no grounds for action against Li Hongzhi, who is based in New York, and that any visa application would be judged against normal British immigration laws. (Reuters)
 
SOUTH KOREA: DOG ON THE AGENDA -- A group of lawmakers introduced a bill to legalize sales of dog meat, arguing that this would allow the Government to oversee slaughtering methods and hygiene. Dog meat was banned during the 1988 Olympics in Seoul out of concern for the country's image, but enforcement has been lax. Samuel Len (NYT)
 
SOUTH KOREA: NORTHERN MISSILE THREAT -- Foreign Minister Hong Soon Young plans to visit Japan on Sunday to discuss joint measures to deal with North Korea's apparent preparations to launch a long-range ballistic missile. North Korea fired a missile a year ago that flew over Japan and into the Pacific, and fears have mounted that it is planning to test-fire another one. Samuel Len (NYT)
 
AFGHANISTAN: U.N. CRITICISM -- Secretary General Kofi Annan strongly condemned the forced displacement of civilians in Afghanistan as a result of the latest offensive by the Taliban militia. The United Nations refugee agency in Geneva said almost 20,000 civilians had fled the fighting and had poured into the capital in recent days, raising the number displaced by the two-week-old offensive to 100,000. (Reuters)
 
EUROPE
 
GERMANY: MEMORIAL FOR JEWISH LEADER -- Ignatz Bubis, the German Jewish leader who died last week and was buried in Israel, will be honored with ceremonies in his home country, including a memorial service to be attended by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. Mr. Schroder had come under some criticism in Israel for not attending Mr. Bubis' funeral in Tel Aviv. (AP)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: PLEA TO SINN FEIN -- The Irish Republican Army would be considered in breach of its 1997 cease-fire if it is proven that its gunmen were behind recent killings, the province's security minister, Adam Ingram, said. His comments came as Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam met with officials of the I.R.A.'s political wing, Sinn Fein, before her ruling on whether I.R.A. actions warrant expelling Sinn Fein from the peace effort. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: DRUG SUSPECT -- Federal authorities announced the arrest on Sunday of a former federal police commander, Oscar Benjamin Garcia Davila, who is accused of leading drug-trafficking operations in Quintana Roo state for the powerful Juarez cartel. Officials said Mr. Garcia was a liaison between the cartel and Quintana Roo's former Governor, Mario Villanueva Madrid, a fugitive wanted on drug charges. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
CHILE: ECONOMIC PLAN -- In an effort to ease the worst recession of the decade, the Government is putting final touches on a $90 million economic stimulus package to create 63,000 jobs in the next four months. It will be the second jobs program announced in the last two months. Unemployment has risen from 6.1 percent to 11 percent during the last year. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
SUDAN: FACTORY TO BE REBUILT -- The owners of El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, whose plant in Khartoum was destroyed by American cruise missiles last year, said they will soon begin building a new factory. The United States said the plant was producing chemical weapons and had ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi accused of masterminding the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Sudan denied the charges. (AP)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: BOMBING TOLL PUT AT 19 -- United States warplanes bombed Iraqi missile sites after Iraqi forces aimed artillery pieces at the planes during a routine patrol of the northern no-flight zone, American officials said. The Iraqi military said American and British warplanes attacked sites in both northern and southern Iraq, killing 19 people and injuring 11 others. (AP)
 
IRAQ: MYSTERIOUS TRAFFIC -- Kuwait said it impounded a ship loaded with baby products being exported from Iraq, raising questions about what is happening to aid for Iraqi children. Kuwaiti officials said the goods included baby powder and bottles, as well as cottonseed for animals. Unicef said it doubted these were goods it had distributed in Iraq, but an Iraqi official told The Associated Press that they were donations being returned because they were of poor quality.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Are thecash levels of emerging-market mutual funds telling a cautionary tale?

BYLINE: By Richard A. Oppel Jr. 

 BODY:
CURRENCY problems and a bank scandal in Indonesia. A political and economic mess in Russia. Military tensions in China. Dwindling interest in Latin American stocks.
The world's emerging markets are showing some small signs of stress. After soaring a collective 40 percent in the first half of the year, their stock markets have fallen 7 percent more recently, leaving investors to wonder whether the rally is over. 
 One other gauge also gives pause.
Mutual funds that invest in emerging markets now have the lowest levels of cash on hand in the three years that records for these funds have been kept. At the end of June -- the most recent reading -- the funds had cash equal to just 3.9 percent of their assets, or less than $700 million, according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund trade group.
Cash was probably further depleted as investors pulled about 2 percent of assets out of emerging markets funds in the four weeks ended last Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services, a fund tracking company in Arcata, Calif.
The redemptions suggest that fund managers have little money left to invest in stocks and to fuel a rally in emerging markets, and that they may even have felt pressure in recent weeks to sell stocks to meet investor redemptions.
The lack of cash "by itself is disturbing to me," said Henry Kaufman, the former Salomon Brothers chief economist who is now president of Henry Kaufman & Company, an economic forecaster in New York.
For many years mutual fund cash levels were considered an important contrary indicator of market performance, playing off the historic inability of portfolio managers to time the market. When cash levels were low -- meaning fund managers had put all their investors' money into stocks -- poor market performance often followed. Conversely, high levels of cash often signaled a market turnaround.
But many fund managers today are loath to go heavily into cash, no matter their instincts. Even acclaimed managers like the former Fidelity Magellan skipper Jeffrey N. Vinik and Foster S. Friess of the Brandywine Fund were harshly criticized for moving their funds into cash and missing out on strong gains in the stock market.
So, although cash levels remain important to managers, they have become less useful as market indicators. The United States stock market has risen even as cash has remained low at stock funds for three years running. The Investment Company Institute says cash levels at the average equity fund have ranged from 3.9 percent to 12.9 percent the last 30 years and now stand at about 5 percent.
But cash levels in emerging-markets funds have swung wildly while their domestic counterparts have held steady. Lately, those sharp moves have tended to move inversely with the performance of the Morgan Stanley Capital International emerging-markets index.
In September 1997, for example, cash in emerging-markets funds plunged to 5 percent, and the Morgan Stanley index subsequently fell by 25 percent in four months. In January 1998, cash increased to 11.5 percent, and the index rose by 15 percent. A few months later, in April, the index turned down again, though this time cash was at about 8 percent. But cash peaked at 14.3 percent of assets at the end of last August, right at the beginning of a major rally in the emerging stock markets.
Cash levels of funds within certain categories, like emerging-markets or small-cap funds, are still a valuable contrary indicator, Mr. Kaufman said, even if overall industry measures have proved less useful.
Moreover, he sees reasons other than plunging amounts of cash to be concerned about emerging markets. Given indications of improvement in the economies of Japan and other developed nations, these countries may begin to "reassert their demand for credit at a time when United States monetary policy may be tightening," Mr. Kaufman said, referring to concerns that the Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates later this month.
"That does not bode well for emerging countries," he said.
But the cash situation does not bother Arjun Divecha, who manages $1.3 billion in three Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Company emerging-markets funds, including two of the best performers in the category for the last year. "Those kinds of things are important in the short term, perhaps, but they have no bearing looking out five years," Mr. Divecha said. He added that emerging markets had been driven higher this year because of investments by locals -- not Americans.
Long term, Mr. Divecha said, emerging markets, particularly in Asia, should do well as the national economies improve and as more companies revamp and adopt shareholder-friendly policies. In the near future, however, the emerging markets will more likely track the domestic stock market. "If the U.S. market continues to pull back," he said, "they will be affected."

HEADLINE: Campaigning For Top Job At Unesco

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 17

 BODY:
An iconoclastic Egyptian working at the World Bank has begun a public campaign for the top job at Unesco, in defiance of the secrecy that now surrounds the choice.
The candidate, Ismail Serageldin, has a Harvard Ph.D. and has written books on topics as diverse as Shakespeare and biotechnology. He is being supported by a lengthening list of Middle Eastern intellectuals and some American scholars who would like to see Unesco get more international recognition. 
 Mr. Serageldin, an architect by training and now a vice president of the World Bank, has proved that he can give a higher profile to global scientific issues. In other words, he is good at publicity, a rare talent in the United Nations.
Americans will have no influence in the election of a new director general because the United States left the organization under President Reagan and has never rejoined.
Unesco -- officially the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization -- is based in Paris and has 2,500 employees there. It chooses a director general in a secret ritual worthy of Byzantium: officials will not release the names of candidates, thought to be 11. Mr. Serageldin is one of those but has the disadvantage of not being put forward by his home country, Egypt.
The cutoff date for nominations is Sept. 6, and in later weeks Unesco's board will meet to pick a nominee to send to the general membership for approval, also in secret.
In the informal system of geographic rotation that prevails, Asia -- a term that in this case encompasses countries from the Middle East to the Pacific -- is claiming the job, a six-year appointment. The two regional countries most actively promoting their candidates are Japan and Saudi Arabia.
The Japanese are as open as Mr. Serageldin about their nominee, Koichiro Matsuura, the Japanese Ambassador in Paris and a former director general of Tokyo's Economic Cooperation Bureau, which handles development issues worldwide. Something of an insider, he is chairman of Unesco's World Heritage Committee, which selects and tries to preserve important natural sites, architectural treasures and monuments.
The Saudis, by contrast, have been busy behind the scenes on behalf of their nominee, a diplomat and poet, Ghazi Al-Gosaibi, who is now Ambassador in London. To the distress of Mr. Serageldin and his backers, the Saudis have lined up most of the Arab world, including Egypt, behind Mr. Al-Gosaibi.
Mr. Serageldin openly called on Middle Eastern intellectuals to protest. "The writers, authors, intellectuals should be heard," he said in an interview. "I tell them, write to your leaders." His backers say that Saudi Arabia, with its cultural restrictions and lack of a free press, is hardly qualified to lead in the world of ideas.
Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League envoy who now directs the Center for the Global South at American University in Washington, said he supports Mr. Serageldin because the independent Egyptian has a wide intellectual range. He is also well known in Washington.
"Whoever gets elected has to bring back the United States, because that is a major, major resource and also because it is a bridge between the global North and South in education, culture and so on -- the most revolutionary country in technology, communications and science," he said.
In 1984, Unesco -- at that time mismanaged, corrupt and toying with a New International Information Order that would have hobbled journalists -- was jolted by the withdrawal of the United States, Britain and Singapore. By 1987, it found a reforming director general in Federico Mayor of Spain. He improved management, even some of the sharpest critics say. Two years ago, Britain returned to the organization, which now has 185 members.
The Clinton Administration also decided to return, but President Clinton backed away after Unesco drew hostile criticism from Republicans, some outraged that an organization of foreigners had dared to designate American landmarks as World Heritage Sites or natural regions as important biospheres without consulting Congress.
"This was another case of the Clinton Administration not wanting to have a fight," said John Bolton, executive vice president of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a former Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations in the Bush Administration.
Mr. Bolton opposes rejoining Unesco, saying it has not reformed enough. In any case, he said, the rest of the world has given up on American participation and no one is interested in Washington's views.

HEADLINE: Lender That Helps Immigrant Cabdrivers to Be Acquired by Larger Company

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Freshstart Venture Capital Corporation, one of the last remnants of the Nixon Administration's black capitalism program, agreed yesterday to be acquired by the Medallion Financial Corporation, the largest lender to taxi medallion owners in the city.
As a Specialized Small Business Investment Company, Freshstart is licensed to make most of its loans to economically disadvantaged borrowers. In return, investors who bought Freshstart shares using gains from the sale of other securities could defer capital gains taxes as long as they retained their Freshstart stock. 
 Although Federal officials had expected that these specialized lenders would help African-Americans, Freshstart made most of its loans to immigrant cabdrivers.
Since its founding in 1982 the company has made several thousand loans to immigrant cabdrivers, said Zindel Zelmanovitch, Freshstart's president.
But rising interest rates were squeezing the company, which borrows money and then lends it to cabdrivers at higher rates.
"Freshstart just never took off," said Neil Greenbaum, one of the largest brokers of taxi insurance in the city and a major shareholder in Freshstart.
Most cabdrivers rent a medallion, sometimes for as much as $115 per day. But those who bought their own medallions have benefited from the city's policy of tightly limiting the number, since the price rose to $232,000 in 1997 from $28,000 in 1970, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
Since 1997, however, the prices have fallen slightly, and the current price is $215,000 to $220,000, Mr. Zelmanovitch said.
Medallion prices have been depressed by rising insurance costs as well as a police policy of increased attention to cabdrivers, who face more fines for motor vehicle violations. Their liability insurance, for example, now must cover $300,000 per accident, up from $15,000.
Medallion has been somewhat insulated from the recent rise in short-term interest rates because it has the financial strength to issue its own notes to investors, said Andrew Murstein, the company's president and a third-generation medallion financier.
In the last three years, Medallion has acquired 11 other small finance companies that specialized in loans to cabdrivers, minority radio station owners and other niche commercial lending markets.
Mr. Murstein said he has been diversifying Medallion Financial's commercial loan base. Freshstart "adds different elements to our portfolio because we are more of a wholesale lender to taxi fleets and they have a good book of loans to individual taxi owners."
Freshstart shares closed yesterday at $4.50, up 62 1/2 cents, while Medallion Financial closed at $18.785, down 25 cents.

HEADLINE: Data Show Inflation Is Still in Check, Easing Worries About Rates

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The United States economy may be rocking and rolling, but inflation remains remarkably well behaved.
That was the main message from a fresh batch of Government data on consumer prices, industrial activity and home building released yesterday. The new evidence further soothed investors who have been worrying that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates more than a quarter-point next week to slow the economy. Bond and stock prices rallied. 
 The Consumer Price Index -- a broad measure of inflation that reflects the prices of imports and services as well as those of domestically produced goods -- rose just three-tenths of a percent last month after registering no increase at all in May and June, in line with forecasts. Better still, most of the increase reflected another big rise in cigarette prices and higher energy costs, which were widely expected and raised everything from gasoline prices to airline fares.
Best of all, the so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, was up only two-tenths of a percent in July, despite the jump in transportation and tobacco prices. That core rate has been creeping up more slowly than at the same point last year, 1.7 percent compared with 2.4 percent.
"We knew energy was going to be up," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. "There's nothing here that looks alarming."
At the same time, two highly cyclical sectors of the economy, manufacturing and housing, continued to expand briskly last month. Industrial production, which had been merely inching up earlier in the summer, surged seven-tenths of a percent in July. While the nationwide heat wave accounted for heavy energy use and a bumper crop of air-conditioners and fans, overall manufacturing output rose robustly, by six-tenths of a percent, despite a drop in car production. And construction of single-family homes and apartments, which cooled in June as mortgage rates climbed higher, rebounded sharply last month.
"What that's telling you is that even the interest-sensitive sectors aren't cooling off with higher rates," said Roseanne Cahn, chief equities economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "The pickup in manufacturing is plenty strong, too."
Yesterday's reports bolstered investor sentiment that the Fed would not raise the overnight bank lending rate, known as the Federal funds target rate, more than a quarter of a percentage point. In the wake of a strong jobs report earlier this month, there had been speculation on Wall Street that the Fed might raise the rate by as much as a half-point. But a report on Friday showing a modest increase in prices at the wholesale level in July combined with yesterday's figures eased those concerns. Even a quarter-point increase is no longer regarded as a sure thing.
"It's 50-50 whether there will be a tightening this month," Ms. Latta said. "If I had to put money on it, I guess I'd put my money on an October tightening. But it's such a close call."
At the moment, the inflation picture is one of crosscurrents. On one hand, a number of the forces that clearly helped hold inflation down in the past are fading. The slump in Japan and Europe, which drove down world prices for energy and other raw materials, seems to be over. The strong dollar, which made imports a bargain for Americans, has lately been weakening. The wholesale shift by employers to health maintenance organizations, which drastically slowed the rise in health care costs, is almost complete. At the same time, as Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has emphasized again and again, the United States labor market remains extraordinarily tight, with unemployment at a 30-year low and job growth strong.
Rapid productivity gains are, however, holding down production costs and there is very little indication that strong demand is giving corporations much leeway to pass cost increases on to consumers in the form of higher prices. While an earlier report by the National Association of Purchasing Management showed that most manufacturers say they are paying higher prices, few report that they are receiving higher prices.
One exception, of course, is energy, which posted the biggest increase in July since April, 2.1 percent. As a result, transportation costs also leaped. Gasoline prices jumped 4.3 percent in July, and air fares surged 6.5 percent. Another exception was tobacco prices, which surged 3.3 percent. The price of imports -- about one-fifth of everything American consumers buy -- are also going up.
But the prices of other goods are falling or rising more slowly than in recent months. Food was up just two-tenths of a percent in July. Housing costs, which account for nearly 40 percent of consumer outlays, rose just one-tenth of a percent in July, half the June rate. Medical care costs rose three-tenths of a percent, a bit slower than in June. And, despite the dominance of imports, clothing prices continued to fall in July, dropping a hefty nine-tenths of a percent.
The lack of pricing power is not preventing businesses from producing more. The July gain in industrial production was the biggest monthly advance since March. Excluding cars, manufacturing output was up nearly a percentage point. American factories are pumping out lots of big-ticket items for American homes, including appliances, home computers and, of course, air-conditioners. But they are also churning out a lot more business equipment, especially computers, which are up 15.2 percent from a year ago, but also heavy industrial gear.
"The slump in manufacturing that we saw early in the year is over," Ms. Latta said. "Exports have been deteriorating, so this indicates very strong domestic demand."
The biggest surprise in yesterday's numbers, given that mortgage rates recently climbed to 8.15 percent, was the jump in new housing. After dipping in June, housing starts rose 5.7 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.661 million units, soaring in the West and posting solid gains in the South and Northeast. The rebound was particularly surprising given that contractors nationwide have been reporting shortages of both labor and building materials. And even more so because mortgage rates have lately climbed over 8 percent to their highest level in two years.
Ms. Latta pointed out that many buyers were rushing to lock in deals because they expected rates to move even higher while others were switching to adjustable-rate mortgages.
"That means that the rise in rates doesn't have as big an impact as you might think," she said.

HEADLINE: AT&T's Planned Mediaone Deal Poses Testfor U.S. Cable Policy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
As two Federal agencies review the AT&T Corporation's $58 billion bid to buy Mediaone Group, they face the central question of whether the combination is, in essence, too large to block.
AT&T executives say the acquisition is needed to establish a cable network so vast and powerful that it will provide high-speed Internet service, cable TV and telephone service that can compete with the regional Bell companies. Those companies have so far kept newcomers from challenging them in their local phone markets. 
 But three consumer groups said today that the cost of opening the local markets was not worth the price and urged the Government to kill the deal because it would permit AT&T to dominate both the cable television industry and the market for high-speed Internet service.
In papers filed at the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department, the groups asserted that the proposed acquisition would violate a raft of antitrust and telecommunications rules intended to limit concentration of ownership in the cable and other industries.
"Regulators should never accept a massive concentration in one market as a condition for increasing local competition in another," Mark N. Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America, said. "This merger breaks all the rules."
AT&T's deal for Mediaone, the fourth-largest cable operator, is quickly becoming an important new test case of antitrust policy. It has also prompted a re-examination of the current cable ownership rules, rules that have been suspended for seven years because of litigation between regulators and the industry.
While AT&T has recently set out to have some of those rules rewritten, consumer groups maintain that the deal would enable AT&T to dominate two markets. "This merger will result in inflated cable and broadband Internet service prices for consumers and thwart the development of vibrant competition in these markets," the three groups -- Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America and the Media Access Project -- wrote in a letter to the Justice Department today.
In response, AT&T executives reasserted the central argument they made in May when the deal was announced: By growing so quickly, the company will benefit millions of telephone customers nationwide by using the newly acquired cable lines to break into local telephone markets that have been dominated by a handful of Bell companies fiercely resistant to competition.
"It's an extreme stretch to suggest that there's any antitrust issue here," said James W. Cicconi, general counsel and head of government relations at AT&T. "There is no competitor to the services we are offering that is being taken out here. Far from it: the whole purpose is to provide local competition."
"We will be providing competition where it doesn't now exist," he said.
Federal communications guidelines prohibit a single company from holding a 5 percent active interest or 10 percent passive interest in companies whose wires come close to 30 percent or more of the nation's homes.
But seven years ago, a Federal judge threw out some of those rules in a case in which AT&T is not involved, and the F.C.C. voluntarily stayed the enforcement of those guidelines. That case is now on appeal, and agency officials say they are reviewing cable-ownership rules, a review they hope to complete before deciding about the AT&T deal.
Consumer groups have contended that after the merger with Mediaone, AT&T's cable market penetration would reach 57 percent of the nation's households. Executives at AT&T, which completed its acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable operator, earlier this year, have said they think the market penetration would not be anywhere near that level. But they have also told analysts they think it would be more than the 30 percent permitted under the rules that have been suspended.
The company has asked the F.C.C. both to raise the 30 percent threshold and to change its ownership attribution rules so that a small ownership interest in a cable company would count less than it now does.
At the Justice Department, Federal antitrust rules written during the Reagan and Bush Administrations generally make any proposed merger suspect if it increases an economic index used by the Government by 50 to 100 points.
But an analysis by the three consumer groups says that the AT&T-Mediaone deal would raise the index, the Hirschman Herfindahl Index, in many markets by 700 to 3,000 points, even including proposed spinoffs that AT&T has already announced.
"AT&T's proposed acquisition is a blatant blatant violation of our nation's antitrust laws and our nation's competition laws," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union.
Mr. Cicconi of AT&T disputed the consumer groups' figures. He also said they had distorted the true size of the market and failed to recognize that AT&T competes with other high-speed Internet services offered by the regional Bells and with satellite broadcasting companies.
To block a merger on antitrust grounds, "one has to show that market power is being used to constrain competitors, which clearly is not the case here," Mr. Cicconi said.

HEADLINE: Study Warns Against Grand Transit Plans

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
With huge investments in new subway lines under consideration by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, an analysis released yesterday by New York City fiscal experts finds that such improvements may not be within the transit agency's financial reach because of looming budget deficits.
The analysis, by the city's Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan research group that advises the City Council and other elected officials, challenges a widespread assumption by transit advocates and some public officials who say a strong city economy, booming tourism and robust growth in ridership have paved the way for large new infusions of cash into the subway system. 
 Whatever fiscal basis now exists for that optimism, the report says, will be squashed if the city economy sours. Because increased ridership on the subways and buses has been fostered, in part, by fare discounts, it says the amount of money raised from customer fares has declined.
The system's economic health is being propped up by borrowing and the economic windfall of a burst in tax revenue, resulting from the strong economy, that flows to the M.T.A. from such sources as property transfer fees and real estate taxes. But if the economy worsens, lower tax collections could reverse the transit system's fortunes, leading to deficits, service cuts or fare increases, the city's economic analysts said yesterday.
"People might have the impression that it should be easy to add service and expand the subways," said Douglas Criscitello, director of the Independent Budget Office, which was created as a fiscal watchdog as part of the revisions to the New York City Charter in 1996.
"However, potentially large operating deficits over the next few years mean that additional revenues or operating budget savings would be needed to enhance the system," he said.
The report says such operating deficits will not occur immediately -- it forecasts that New York City Transit, the arm of the M.T.A. responsible for buses and subways, will continue to benefit from its tax windfall and end 1999 with a surplus of $49 million to $91 million.
But from 2000 through 2003, the report predicts, the tax receipts dedicated to pay for bus and subway operations will fall off, leading to a deficit that could reach $890 million in 2003, even without major investments in new subway lines.
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the M.T.A., declined yesterday to respond to the details of the study, other than to say that its forecasts "may be exaggerated" in both their optimism for a 1999 surplus and their pessimism over deficits in the future.
"Nobody here has been expecting that we would run a surplus ad infinitum," he said, adding that uncertainty over the economy and tax revenue was being taken into account by the M.T.A.'s planners.
Although the report is not the first to cast doubt on the financial prospects of the transportation authority -- similar warnings have been made for a year by Wall Street analysts -- it comes at a critical time for the M.T.A. By October, the agency is expected to unveil a five-year spending plan, which many transit groups and riders are hoping will provide for the first large-scale subway construction program in decades.
Among the proposals under study by the M.T.A. are a new Second Avenue subway, costing $3 billion or more. Another project, paid for through a combination of funds from the M.T.A. and Federal subsidies, would extend Long Island Rail Road service through a new Manhattan tunnel to Grand Central Station. Other projects on the list include an expansion of subway lines in Queens to La Guardia Airport, and extension of the No. 7 Line from Times Square to the far west side of Manhattan.
Although the study may dampen enthusiasm that the M.T.A. can afford all, or any, of the proposals, some experts said it merely underscored the need for greater commitments of financial support to mass transit from the city and state.
Even as the amount of money raised through customer fares on the city's subways and buses has declined, the report says riders continue to pay for a greater share of their service than people using mass transit systems in other big cities.
It says subway and bus fares cover 66 percent of the New York City Transit budget. That contrasts with the mass transit systems in Washington, where fares account for 50 percent of the budget; in Chicago, where they cover 46 percent; and in Boston, where they cover 29 percent.
The study was requested by Councilman A. Gifford Miller, who represents the Upper East Side and has been an advocate of several proposals for subway expansion, particularly a new Second Avenue line.
Although the conclusions reached in the study seem to shed doubt on how the such projects can be financed, he said it underscored the need for government support. "The bottom line is that we are not going to meet the needs of an expanding economy and mass transit system unless the city pitches in, and challenges the state and Federal government to do so as well," he said.

HEADLINE: Robbery String Linked to Man By an Odd Scar

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
An upper Manhattan man was arrested yesterday in connection with 23 armed robberies in the Bronx, upper Manhattan and Harlem after what officials described as "good, old-fashioned detective work."
The man, Anthony Stevenson, 38, was arrested on robbery and gun charges stemming from five Bronx robberies after several victims picked him out of lineups, said Capt. Geryl McCarthy, the head of the major crimes section of the Bronx Detective Bureau. 
 The lead that eventually cracked the case came after the most recent robbery, on Thursday, when a witness spotted several numbers of the license plate of the getaway car, Captain McCarthy said. Detectives looked up the motor vehicle records for more than 100 cars with the same few numbers that were registered at addresses near the robberies.
As they narrowed the list down to drivers with dark-colored sedans, they checked whether any of the registered owners matched the description of the robber, the police said. Then they checked whether any of those people had arrest records.
They came up with Mr. Stevenson, whose mug shot was on file because he was charged with fare-beating in Harlem in April, Captain McCarthy said. The photo strongly resembled a police sketch of the robbery suspect that had been drawn with the help of victims, she said. Both showed a half-moon-shaped scar under the suspect's eye, she said.
When the police went to Mr. Stevenson's apartment in upper Manhattan on Monday night, she said, they found a .380-caliber handgun whose serial number had been defaced. They then brought him in for questioning, and he was arrested today after being placed in several lineups.
An investigator said Mr. Stevenson told detectives that he had been unemployed since 1990 and had begun his armed robberies after he lost his welfare benefits. He told them he needed to support a child, who does not live with him.
Captain McCarthy said that the police estimate that Mr. Stevenson stole a total of $3,000 in the robberies. Most of his targets were Chinese restaurants, she said.

HEADLINE: Wildlife Agency Objects To Cranberry Bog Plan

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 17

 BODY:
New Jersey cranberry growers and Federal environmental regulators have reached agreement for the first time on a plan to expand the state's cranberry bogs into sensitive wetlands. But today, officials of another Federal agency said the proposal, released without much fanfare last month, was objectionable to them.
The draft agreement between Federal environmental regulators and the growers seeks to end nearly five years of feuding among regulators, environmental groups and farmers over attempts to set guidelines for an increase of up to 300 acres in cranberry growing areas statewide. 
 Twice in that time the Federal Government has rejected other proposed expansion plans, buoying environmentalists but sinking the growers' efforts to maintain New Jersey's status as the third-largest cranberry growing state, after Massachusetts and Wisconsin.
But the United States Fish and Wildlife Service says the expansion guidelines "are by far the most environmentally damaging" proposals that have been offered in those five years. And the agency is calling for a more detailed study of their impact on water quality, wildlife and rare and endangered species.
Ed Henry, a spokesman for the wildlife agency, said the proposed agreement contradicted the Environmental Protection Agency's statutory goals of no net loss in wetlands, its mandate to avoid all wetlands impacts whenever possible and the requirement that there be mitigation and replacement when such avoidance is not possible.
If it receives final approval, the draft agreement will take effect on Jan. 1. The agency's objection sets the stage for a battle pitting it against growers, New Jersey officials who have long supported the compact, a 3,500-acre industry that pumps $25 million a year into the economy, and officials of the Federal environmental agency.
The wildlife agency also contends that, according to a recent aerial survey, the very group of growers with whom Federal regulators had been negotiating terms for expansion had illegally expanded their bogs even as the talks were going on.
Federal and state environmental officials said they were still reviewing the charges of illegal expansion, and acknowledged that there was a significant difference of opinion between themselves and the wildlife agency over the conditions under which expansion should be allowed. But, one Federal official said, the environmental regulators would hold firm on the new conditions for expansion. Mario Paula, an environmental scientist in the agency's New York regional office, said the agreement satisfied requirements that expansion have "minimal adverse impact."
Joseph Darlington, a cranberry grower in Browns Mills, applauded the draft agreement, saying: "What they came out with was probably the best that cranberry growers could hope for. I think we will all accept this because it looks at the bigger picture and balances out the economic, human and environmental factors."
Under the plan, growers would be allowed to expand 300 acres at a rate of 60 acres per year so that any environmental problems that resulted could be detected and dealt with quickly. The growers had originally sought a quicker pace of expansion, starting with 100 acres in the first year.
The agreement would also place stricter requirements on clearing forested wetlands and even stricter barriers on forested wetlands where the rare Atlantic white cedar predominates. Even then, the growers would have to mitigate that loss by replacing those wetlands and forested growth on an acre-for-acre basis elsewhere in the state.
The E.P.A.-endorsed agreement, however, lets stand the Fish and Wildlife Service's nearly absolute veto power of any expansion that can be proved to adversely affect anything covered by the Endangered Species Act. While several species of plants, frogs and turtles included on the list of federally protected life forms thrive in the wetlands of New Jersey, exactly how and whether they will be affected by the expansion of cranberry bogs is not yet known.
But Mr. Darlington noted that this veto power might prolong the impasse on any expansion by shifting the battlefield from the E.P.A. to the Fish and Wildlife Service.
"In one way, I understand E.P.A. deferring to them on endangered species, but our experience with Fish and Wildlife is that they have made a crusade of opposing expansion and are unwilling to listen," he said. "The chance of getting a permit to expand is about zero when an endangered species is involved."
As for the claim by the Fish and Wildlife Service that some farmers have illegally expanded their growing area, State Department of Environmental Protection officials noted that one of the parcels had received approval for the expansion after a nine-year process in which the wildlife agency had been involved. The other major parcel is the subject of a state enforcement action.

HEADLINE: Legal Pioneers Seek to Raise Lowly Status of Animals

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
More than a generation after civil rights and environmental lawyers took their battles to the courts, there are now lawyers who say they are following in those footsteps on behalf of clients with names like Freckles and Muffin and Rainbow.
Fighting for creatures like performing orangutans and dogs used in experimentation, the lawyers are creating a new field of animal law with far more ambitious goals than traditionally weak anti-cruelty laws. They are filing novel lawsuits and producing new legal scholarship to try to chip away at a fundamental principle of American law that animals are property and have no rights. 
 These lawyers are more than brief-writing counterparts of animal activists who throw paint on fur wearers.
And they are influenced by developing scientific and ethical scholarship showing animals to have far higher levels of cognition and social development than previously believed.
This summer, the fledgling field of animal law took an important step toward legitimacy when two of the country's most prestigious law schools, Harvard and Georgetown, announced that they would offer courses in animal law for the first time.
The animal lawyers have also gained a handful of court victories in recent years, the most important of which was a Federal appeals court decision last year that gave a human zoo visitor the right to sue to get companionship for chimpanzees. And since 1994, legislatures across the country have given these lawyers a potent new tool by sharply upgrading animal cruelty crimes to felonies from misdemeanors.
"We have created a field of law," said Joyce Tischler, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, an organization based in Petaluma, Calif., with an annual budget of $3 million. "We've learned our trade, and now we are focusing on the next steps."
Critics ridicule animal law as the latest example of absurdity in the legal system. They see it as an attack on the economic system's reliance on animal products that could wreak havoc in the courts.
"Would even bacteria have rights?" asked Richard A. Epstein, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. "There would be nothing left of human society if we treated animals not as property but as independent holders of rights."
The animal lawyers say the idea that animals are mere property evolved centuries before modern notions of some animals as sentient beings with perceptions and even emotions. The lawyers have been moving on many different fronts to establish precedents that they say could provide a foundation for direct attacks on the property status of animals.
In civil cases involving veterinary malpractice or pet deaths, some lawyers have won verdicts and settlements of $15,000 or more. Lawyers have also had success in battling what they call execution orders, the sort of routine euthanasia that occurs when dogs bite people.
In Washington, D.C., two lawyers who had worked in Ralph Nader organizations started a firm specializing in animal law six years ago. The firm, Meyer & Glitzenstein, now with five lawyers, handles complex cases involving animal issues, like filings with Federal agencies concerning standards for the treatment of circus elephants.
Yesterday, the firm's lawyers announced an important victory in a legal battle that had gone to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The organizers of an annual pigeon shoot in Hegins, Pa., canceled the event. The animal lawyers were seeking an injunction to stop the shoot, which has taken place for 65 years, on grounds of animal cruelty.
Last year, a groundbreaking ruling was issued in a case that involved an apparently lonely chimpanzee named Barney. In its decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit gave a zoo visitor the legal standing to sue the Government to try to force it to issue regulations assuring chimpanzees group living arrangements and appropriate amenities.
The suit involving Barney (and a female monkey named Samantha who was alone in a cage near Barney's at the Long Island Game Farm Park and Zoo) was filed under amendments to the Federal Animal Welfare Act that had received little judicial interpretation. The amendments, passed in 1985, said conditions of confinement must assure "the psychological well being of primates."
Valerie J. Stanley, a lawyer who worked on the case, said the law "does not mean you throw them a toy and you give them an orange once a month." The decision has been widely viewed as giving people new powers to challenge the living conditions of animals that are publicly displayed.
The suit is still being fought in Federal court, but Barney was shot to death by a zoo employee in 1996 after he escaped from his cage, bit someone and uprooted a sign, which he threw at a merry-go-round.
Some lawyers say they are in the field to advance their ideology, but some note that it is an area of legal practice that could be profitable. The lawyers in private practice charge fees to human clients, like pet owners. Some groups, like the Animal Legal Defense Fund, pay salaries to staff lawyers. And lawyers for industry groups that battle the animal lawyers say millions of dollars are available from animal welfare groups to pay for work that advances their goals.
Critics of the animal law movement, including livestock groups and representatives of pharmaceutical companies that rely on animal experimentation, say such rulings are an alarming foot in the courthouse door for advocates of animal rights.
"If the goal is to use the courts to put us out of business," said Steve L. Kopperud, president of the Animal Industry Foundation, a livestock and poultry group, "they've got a pretty effective tool. I look at this as an abuse of the system."
Lawyers concerned with animal issues say civil rights and environmental lawyers faced ridicule, too. In interviews, several of them noted parallels with those who began the fights for integration and clean air.
The new legal field, for example, has a single scholarly journal, Animal Law, which has been published for five years by the same law school that published the first environmental law journal 30 years ago: Northwestern School of Law of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore.
Animal Law serves as a manifesto for lawyers in the field. Steven M. Wise, a Boston lawyer who is to teach the course this spring at Harvard Law School, has argued in articles in the journal that rights to bodily integrity and liberty should be given first to chimpanzees and bonobos because they are so similar to people. Mr. Wise, who once listed a captive dolphin named Rainbow as the plaintiff in a suit against an aquarium, is one of a group of perhaps 30 lawyers across the country who spend most of their time on animal issues. Hundreds more, including lawyers at some of the country's largest law firms, handle animal cases on a volunteer basis.
Mr. Wise, who taught animal law this summer at John Marshall Law School in Chicago, said the legal work now being done on behalf of animals was paving the way for change.
"It is a long-term strategy," he said, "to show that animals are not just things for our use."
One example, he said, is a case he is handling in a Massachusetts appeals court on behalf of the owners of seven pet sheep who were killed by two dogs owned by a neighbor.
Because animals are property under American law, damages are generally limited to their market value. But in some cases lawyers have persuaded courts to award added damages for loss of companionship or for the emotional distress of the owner when a pet is killed.
The case of the dead sheep, Mr. Wise said, could help establish that market value is not adequate compensation. The sheep owners, a childless taxidermist and his wife, Mr. Wise said, were attached to the animals. "I am talking about people who let the sheep in the house and baked them muffins," Mr. Wise said.
The strategy of lawyers practicing animal law has included a campaign to increase the criminal penalties for animal cruelty. In 1994, all but six states regarded such violations as misdemeanors, punishable by small fines and short jail terms. Now 27 states make violations felonies, with fines up to $100,000 and prison terms up to 10 years.
Lawyers often provide prosecutors with legal assistance to make such prosecutions stick. In one case, involving cruelty to turtles, lawyers provided a veterinarian as an expert witness. The veterinarian testified that elevated heart and respiration rates showed that turtles do suffer.
Anti-cruelty laws typically declare that people cannot be prosecuted for standard farming practices, like beef slaughtering. But there have been some felony prosecutions involving malicious mistreatment or torture of farm animals.
Last month in northeastern North Carolina, a district attorney, Frank R. Parrish, announced the state's first felony animal cruelty indictment. The case, which involved workers at a hog farm, was taken to a grand jury after an animal welfare group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, gave Mr. Parrish videotape that it had secretly recorded.
Members of the group and their lawyers said the tape clearly showed hogs being beaten and skinned alive.
The farm workers, who face sentences of up to 15 months in prison if convicted, have not yet entered pleas. But the manager of the farm, Fred Cunningham, issued a statement saying that the farm was committed to humane practices and that scenes on the tape "seem certain to be staged."
Neither the farm nor Dr. Cunningham, a veterinarian, face charges.
Some lawyers say cases like the one involving the hog farm are legal milestones. But even among animal lawyers there are sharp disagreements over strategy.
Prof. Gary L. Francione, who teaches animal law at Rutgers University, said in an interview that animal lawyers should be much more aggressive than they are.
Professor Francione, once a law clerk to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the Supreme Court, said they should, for example, file suit on behalf of gorillas, asserting that "they should be declared to be 'persons' under the Constitution," with constitutional rights.
For the moment, most animal lawyers are adopting a more incremental approach. The Animal Legal Defense Fund, for example, has a staff lawyer who spends her time studying precedents that could be used on behalf of animals, including the legal steps taken in the emancipation of slaves.
Although there are similarities to other legal movements, the animal law movement has differences, too, some animal lawyers say. For example, several lawyers, like Ms. Tischler of the defense fund, said they no longer ate animal products.
"My commitment," she said, "is I don't eat my clients."

HEADLINE: The Fairness of Women

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alejandro Gertz Manero, Mexico City's chief of police, explains his decision to turn the city's notoriously corrupt traffic enforcement over to female officers by saying simply, "I trust them more" (Week in Review, Aug. 15). 
 Mr. Gertz need not rely solely on vague intuitions or anecdotal evidence to rationalize his policy. A growing body of work in the social sciences is finding that women are more likely than men to exhibit "helping" behavior, vote based on social issues, score more highly on "integrity tests," take stronger stances on ethical behavior and behave more generously when faced with economic decisions.
While it is unclear whether the relative honesty of women is biological or environmental, it certainly appears that women really are the fairer sex!

New Jersey Jobless Rate

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The New Jersey unemployment rate dipped to 4.8 percent last month, State Labor Department officials said yesterday in Trenton. It is the first drop in the state jobless rate since February. Employers in the state created about 5,500 jobs during July.
"All the indicators, in both the state and nation, show the economy's strong," State Labor Commissioner Mel Gelade said. "Inflation fears have calmed, all sectors seem to be adding jobs, and more people are coming into the job market. It's a healthy, strong economy." 
 The 4.8 percent unemployment rate was slightly below the 4.9 percent recorded in June. The rate had steadily risen since it reached 4.1 percent in February, the only month during Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's time in office that the state rate has been lower than the national rate.

A New Accent on Business

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
The State University of New York at Stony Brook has created a new position typically reserved for corporations: vice president for economic development. The job entails fostering relationships between the university and local businesses, said Shirley Strum Kenny, Stony Brook's president.
Yakov Shamash, dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, will assume those duties as well as oversee two on-campus sites, one focused on software and one on anything from technology to lyme disease vaccines. The sites are incubators for 36 startup companies at which undergraduate and graduate students will work as interns or employees. 
 "We have many projects that we collaborate with the business community," Dr. Kenny said, "and economic development is giving a real push to this endeavor and making it one of our top campus missions, right up there with education and research. To be a great university we must be a great local university. It's really all about getting new industries on Long Island." ABBY ELLIN

HEADLINE: ON THE RECORD: Governor Bush on Crime;
Bush's Law and Order Adds Up to Tough and Popular

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Law and order has always been part of George W. Bush's politics.
Just as his father, George Bush, benefited from televised images of the furloughed murderer-rapist Willie Horton to attack Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 race for President, Mr. Bush ran for governor of Texas in 1994 with a series of grainy black-and-white commercials depicting a man abducting a woman at gun point in a parking garage and, a moment later, a police officer draping a blanket over the woman's body. 
 Asserting that his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann Richards, was soft on crime, Mr. Bush promised to get tougher with criminals. That stand helped him win, and an examination of his record over the five years he has been Governor shows he has been consistent in pressing a law-and-order agenda. Mr. Bush has presided over the nation's largest prison-building program and a record number of executions. At the same time, breaking ranks with many law-enforcement officials, Mr. Bush has signed laws expanding the right of Texans to carry guns and has opposed gun-control legislation.
"For Governor Bush, gun control is not yet part of crime control," said Bruce Elfant, the Travis County constable, one of the officials who have come to see gun control as important as fighting drugs and gangs in the battle against crime.
In a conservative state where being "Texas tough" is high praise, Mr. Bush's positions have been popular.
"The reason Ann Richards was ousted was her opposition to the right to carry handguns and being soft on crime," said State Representative Suzanna Gratia Hupp, a Republican from Lampasas, expressing a view shared by Republicans and Democrats alike. "George W. Bush is a real Texan, someone who is very down to earth and tough on crime."
How Governor Bush's record on criminal justice, particularly gun control, will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for President. In Texas, experts on criminal justice are studying another question: whether his policies are responsible for the state's drop in crime.
Mr. Bush declined several requests for an interview on criminal-justice issues. But his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said his initiatives, especially those toughening punishment for juvenile offenders and making convicts serve longer terms, had produced a 20 percent drop in the Texas crime rate. "Governor Bush believes in tough laws and long sentences to keep criminals off the streets," Ms. Hughes said.
But according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, crime had already fallen 25 percent under Governor Richards, from 1991 to 1994, as she began the state's multibillion-dollar prison-building program.
"I always thought it was utter nonsense for Bush to attack Richards for being soft on crime, when she presided over this huge prison buildup," said Steve Martin, a consultant on prisons for Federal courts and a former chief counsel for the Department of Criminal Justice.
Since Mr. Bush took office in 1995, crime rates have also fallen as much, or more, in most other states as they have in Texas. This has led governors and mayors across the country to take credit, even as many experts point out that the widespread decline in crime rates makes it less likely that any one policy can be credited. Longer prison sentences are one factor in the overall decrease, experts say, but so are an improved economy, a decline in the use of crack, new police strategies and changing attitudes among young people.
Even many of Mr. Bush's Democratic opponents acknowledge that Texas is a strong law-and-order state, where politicians must appeal to a conservative electorate. But they question the Governor's assertion that he is a "compassionate conservative" when it comes to criminal justice.
"In order to hold statewide office here, you have to appeal to a very conservative electorate," said State Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston. But Mr. Ellis went on to say, "There is no compassion on the Governor's part when it comes to law and order."
 
On Guns
Battling Crime, Not Firearms
By nature, friends here say, Mr. Bush prefers to avoid taking stands on difficult issues. He is neither an ideologue nor confrontational, they say. But perhaps more than on any other issue, events in Texas have pushed him into defining his position on guns.
The first step came in his race against Governor Richards, when he pledged to support the concealed-weapons bill. When, as Governor, he signed the bill into law in 1995, he declared, "This is a bill to make Texas a safer place."
The bill had been championed by the National Rifle Association, but was opposed by the police chiefs of Texas's largest cities, who were concerned that the law would lead to more violent confrontations between individuals armed with guns and a greater risk to police officers.
Texas is one of 31 states that allow people to carry concealed weapons, though lately public opinion in other states has been shifting against the policy. In Missouri last April, in the only referendum ever taken on the issue, voters rejected a proposal to allow concealed weapons. After the shooting rampage by two students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., on April 20, lawmakers in both Colorado and Michigan abandoned bills to allow concealed weapons.
Opponents of the Texas bill had predicted it would lead to a rash of shootings. Supporters said it would sharply cut crime. Neither seems to have happened.
A study by the Violence Policy Center, a gun-control advocacy group, found that since the Texas law took effect, 15 people with concealed gun permits had been charged with murder or attempted murder and 103 with assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. But that is a tiny proportion of homicides and other violent crimes in Texas. Similarly, there is little evidence that people with concealed guns have prevented many crimes.
"In Texas, people have carried guns for a century," Tony Fabelo, the director of the Texas Criminal Justice Policy Council and Governor Bush's top criminal justice adviser, said in seeking to explain the law's limited impact. "Now they just carry guns with a license."
This spring Mr. Bush was pushed into further defining his position on guns when the National Rifle Association, in response to the filing of lawsuits against the gun industry by a number cities and counties, began urging state legislatures to pass laws barring such suits. No Texas city suggested it was considering such a lawsuit, but the Legislature passed a law barring cities in the state from suing the gun industry and Mr. Bush signed it.
Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Hughes, said the Governor signed the bill because "he does not believe that manufacturers of a legal product should be held liable for criminal misuse of the product."
Fourteen states, mostly in the South and West, have adopted such legislation. After the Littleton shootings, lawmakers in Colorado, Florida and Michigan withdrew similar bills, and Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona, a Republican, vetoed one.
Mr. Bush went against the police chiefs of the state's seven largest cities this spring by opposing a bill to require background checks on all prospective firearms buyers at gun shows. According to the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, gun shows are the leading source of guns for criminals and juveniles in Texas.
The bill requiring background checks died in committee on April 20, a few hours after the killings in Littleton, which were carried out with guns bought at gun shows.
Under Federal law, only licensed dealers at gun shows are required to conduct background checks on buyers. Other people can sell guns at the shows without even asking for identification. Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Hughes, said the Governor thinks that there should be background checks on buyers at gun shows but that the loophole should be closed at the Federal level. Congress has debated the issue this year without result.
Some states have acted to tighten gun-show sales: California has a system for checking the background of buyers at the shows, and last year Florida voters approved an initiative authorizing its cities to require background checks on buyers at the shows.
Despite his policies on gun control, the amiable Mr. Bush has remained popular with the police. "I know the Governor," said Police Chief Ben Click of Dallas. "We run together. He is a very nice, sincere person and I like him a lot."
But in states where voters favor gun control, Mr. Bush can expect challenges on the issue. Last month in New Jersey, a small group of gun-control advocates demonstrated outside a hotel where Mr. Bush was speaking at a fund-raising event. Afterward, Mr. Bush defended his record supporting gun owners' rights and predicted it would not hurt him. "That's what elections are for," he said. "But I'm proud of my record."
 
On Prisons
More Inmates For Longer Terms
Under Mr. Bush, Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the country, with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or parole, a point of pride to many Texans, said Mr. Fabelo, the Governor's top criminal justice adviser. The state's prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents, second only to Louisiana's 736. By contrast, Minnesota, with the lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people.
The enormous buildup of the Texas prison system had actually begun by the time Governor Richards took office in 1991.
In 1989, the state's prisons had 41,000 beds, and the buildup was far advanced when Mr. Bush became Governor. When the buildup is completed next year, the prison system will have 150,000 beds.
The Bush Administration says the total cost will approach $3 billion while some of the state's leading Democrats put the figure at $10 billion.
In any event, Mr. Bush has enthusiastically supported the growth of prisons, unlike California, where politicians have begun to question the state's prison-building program. Republicans there worry about higher taxes to pay for new prisons, and Democrats say the program has taken money away from the state college and university system.
In Texas, the money spent to build prisons is cutting into spending for public education, one of Mr. Bush's priorities, said Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research organization in Austin.
"There has been a definite trade-off," Ms. Castro said. State spending for public schools was 36.4 percent of the budget in 1999, compared with 41.3 percent in 1989, while spending for prisons was 7.8 percent, up from 5.2 percent, she said.
Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Hughes, said that to cope with the growing number of inmates who will be released from prison, the Governor is counting on programs like a voluntary Christian boot camp pioneered by Charles Colson, once the special counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, and who served a Federal prison term on Watergate-related charges. The program includes Bible study as well as courses on personal responsibility, parenting and financial management.
"I'm absolutely convinced this program will work," Mr. Bush said after visiting a pilot project near Houston. "The best recidivism program is a changed heart."
One of Mr. Bush's major planks in his race against Ms. Richards was a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of skyrocketing teen-age crime, and as Governor, Mr. Bush has transformed the juvenile justice code. One result: a tripling of the number of young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission's juvenile prisons, to 6,000.
"If George W. Bush can do for the United States what he has done for Texas, no one can lick his boots," said Hal Gaither, a Bush adviser and a Dallas Juvenile Court judge, who describes himself as "the most conservative man in Texas."
The major change under Mr. Bush, Judge Gaither said, was switching the main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison system in which punishment is emphasized. Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14, increasing the maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile prisons.
The new code does provide flexibility, Judge Gaither said. Juveniles given long sentences can either be sent to an adult prison when they turn 16, or they can have their sentence reduced if their behavior has improved. Many of these changes have been enacted in other states.

On Death Penalty
Leaving Appeals To Higher Power
Mr. Bush has also been a strong supporter of the death penalty. He has presided over a record 98 executions as Governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker, a born-again Christian whose death-row conversion led to calls for clemency from the Rev. Pat Robertson and other religious leaders. The appeal from the Christian Right gave Mr. Bush "maneuverability" to commute Ms. Tucker's sentence without offending conservative supporters, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which opposes the death penalty.
But in one of his most publicized moments as Governor, Mr. Bush chose not to intervene, saying: "In every death penalty that comes to my desk, I ask this question: Innocent or guilty? And I will tell you of all the death penalties we have had in our state, I am confident that those that have been put to death have been guilty."
Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms. Tucker's religious conversion, Mr. Bush said, "I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher authority."
This month the Tucker execution again became an issue because of a profile in Talk magazine that quoted him as mocking Ms. Tucker's plea for her life. Campaign officials have denied the profile's characterization of the Governor, saying his comments were misread.
Mr. Bush did halt the execution of Henry Lee Lucas, who had received several life sentences in a series of killings, but who, evidence showed, had been nowhere near the scene of the crime for which Texas was about to execute him. Mr. Bush commuted the sentence to life in prison.
Americans support the death penalty by a large majority, with 71 percent in favor and only 21 percent opposed, according to a Harris Poll released in July.
Given the frequency of executions, some Texas legislators introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally retarded. Five such inmates have been executed in Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
After the bill passed the State Senate, Mr. Bush announced his opposition, saying, "I like the law the way it is right now," with juries having the right to make the decision. The bill died in the House.
In another measure to deal with the number of executions and the growing number of inmates, the Texas Senate and House unanimously passed a bill this spring to create a state public defender system, guaranteeing that indigent defendants be assigned a lawyer within 20 days of arrest. Defense lawyers are now appointed by elected local judges, often from among their campaign contributors, leading to charges of cronyism, delays and incompetence.
Mr. Bush vetoed the bill. "While well-intentioned," he said in a statement, the bill proposed "drastic changes" that would have lowered the quality of representation and posed a public danger by requiring the release of defendants who were not assigned a lawyer within 20 days.
The Houston Chronicle, in an editorial, said Mr. Bush should have signed the bill, since virtually alone among the states "Texas has no system at all" for public defenders. When lawyers appointed by judges are competent, the paper said, they have an ethical conflict, since the judges who pay them want a speedy trial, not an aggressive defense.
Senator Ellis, who sponsored the bill, said Governor Bush had given in to lobbying by judges who did not want to lose their patronage system. "One can be a proponent of the death penalty, as I am," said Senator Ellis, "but also sane enough to realize we need a real public defender system."

Two Worlds (Well, at Least One) Still Spin at Spoleto

BYLINE: By Anne Midgette 

DATELINE: SPOLETO, Italy

 BODY:
At 8:30 the piazza in front of the cathedral here is empty. Late sun strikes gold from the high bell tower, but the square is steeped in silvery shadow, and the air is so unseasonably cool that the musicians playing on the steps of the Teatro Caio Melisso are comfortable, rather than sweltering, in their formal tails.
Only a few people are sitting in the chairs in front of them. Across the square a couple of cocktail drinkers watch from the handful of tables huddled in front of the restaurant Tric Trac. The musicians finish, to a scattering of applause, and the Teatro Caio Melisso prepares for a performance of "Les Porteurs d'Eau" by the Theatre Talipot from Madagascar that only a few dozen people will attend. 
 "The first week of the festival is always slow," says the sculptor Robin Heidi Kennedy, a local resident, red velvet glowing from the empty seats around her.
In a town like Salzburg or Bayreuth, using the words "slow" and "festival" in the same sentence might imply the kiss of death. But in Italy one expects invited guests to come a little late. And the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, while it has moved far from the kind of informal happening it was when the Italian composer Giancarlo Menotti founded it in 1958, still offers something of the casual intimacy that characterized it when Jerome Robbins and Luchino Visconti were fixtures, and young musicians named Yo-Yo Ma and Jacqueline Du Pre or luminaries like Sviatoslav Richter made impromptu appearances in the noontime concerts.
Established though it be, Spoleto, which ran this year from mid-June to mid-July, still relies on a personal touch, announcing noontime programs at the last minute, or loading audiences for the series Music in Secret Umbria into buses and driving them out for a picnic and concert in Romanesque churches nestled in the hills, like a good host showing the area to out-of-town guests. Mr. Menotti, creator of "Amahl and the Night Visitors," holds the unofficial title of most-performed living composer. Still, the German newspaper Rheinischer Merkur is not alone in assessing him as "cleverer as a festival founder than as a composer."
Today the mainstream classical-music world looks askance at his operas, condemning them as popular and facile (even as American opera companies seek out new narrative, tonal works to lure the audiences that used to flock to Mr. Menotti's pieces). His festival, on the other hand, is an acknowledged institution, unusual in Europe for its equal emphasis on music and theater, film, art and dance.
The 1999 program included a new monologue by the Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo, a theater piece by the French film director Eric Rohmer, a concert by the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet (who played here at earlier stages of his career) and Mr. Menotti's staging of Prokofiev's seldom-performed opera "War and Peace."
"Spoleto was started to prove that the arts could turn the economy around in a small, depressed town," Mr. Menotti said over lunch recently. A village that used to boast but a single hotel now has a full complement of pensione and ristoranti for the annual influx of guests; and more and more well-heeled foreigners are buying and restoring houses in the area.
Mr. Menotti has changed his economic outlook as well. Now 88, the man who once said he wanted to live out his old age in a cottage by the sea resides during the year in a full-blown castle in Scotland, with his adopted son, Francis, his son's wife and their two sons, Claudio, 12, and Cosimo, 8.
The Italian press has called Mr. Menotti the Sun King of Spoleto: a benevolent but all-powerful ruler with a whim of iron. But the second of his "two worlds," the United States, countered monarchy with democracy in the best American tradition at Spoleto's American colony in Charleston, S.C., founded in 1977. When Mr. Menotti tried to designate Francis as his heir, the board of Spoleto U.S.A. rebelled, and the elder Mr. Menotti finally cleared the field in 1993 and retreated to Umbria, severing ties with the Charleston festival altogether.
Italy has no problem with dynasties: Francis Menotti has served as the festival's president since 1993, and this year he officially took over as artistic director. Born Francis Phelan in Pennsylvania, a former professional ice skater and actor who used to appear in Menotti works (like the play "The Leper," which was written for him), he was adopted in 1974, at age 36. He proclaims himself dedicated to continuing the festival in his father's spirit while solidifying an organizational structure that has been dependent on Giancarlo Menotti's whim.
Testimony to the weather vane changes of his decrees are the short tenures of some of the festival's artistic and music directors. Thomas Schippers, who served a long tenure as artistic and then music director until 1975, was followed by a string of short-termers: Massimo Bogianckino, Romolo Valli, Rafaello de Banfield. "Four or five years," Mr. Menotti has said, "then I think that we should get some new view in here." This year was the first for the newest director, the British conductor Richard Hickox.
In conversation Mr. Menotti bubbled with charm and anecdote, opinions about the evils of modern stage direction, and concern about how to fit the huge cast and chorus of "War and Peace" onto the diminutive stage of the Teatro Nuovo. Still, he would hardly have undertaken the Herculean task of staging the work had the scheduled director not pulled out at the last minute. In any event, the co-director, Roman Hurko, did most of the heavy lifting, with Mr. Menotti presiding over an occasional rehearsal.
The staging hardly won raves: reviews described it as naive, rudimentary and even "in an antiquated Bolshoi style." Yet the ensemble was roundly praised, and Mr. Hickox, who had devoted considerable time to auditioning the students who play in the Spoleto Festival Orchestra, was hailed for creating "a vibrating cosmos of tender lyricism." The event made a good case for revivals of an opera that the expert on Russian music Richard Taruskin calls "Prokofiev's masterpiece." Opening night of "War and Peace" was sold out.
Festival regulars often wax nostalgic about Spoleto's glory days; and there is no question that the festival, like its founder, has lost some of its energy. Yet the Festival of Two Worlds prevails.
"That the festival has hardly lost its freshness is demonstrated by the program of this 42d edition," said the German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung. "Where else in Europe can you find such a constellation" of different shows and events?

HEADLINE: The Sound and the Fury: Beating Back the Beep

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
THE computer first beeped almost 50 years ago. It hasn't stopped since. And now it's not alone.
Pagers beep. Answering machines beep. A.T.M.'s beep. Elevators beep. Phones beep. We have warning beeps, ready beeps and attention beeps. There have been private and public beeps and beeps heard around the world. The beep has even entered the vernacular, courtesy of the answering machine ("Leave your message after the beep . . ."). American society has been inundated by peppy beeps. 
 The beep originally served as an alert. And for a long time, only high-tech things beeped, like satellites and computers. But today the most mundane things -- from children's toys to pens -- do so.
"There are moments of my day where I think: If hear another beep, I think I am going to shoot the device," said Cindy Mason, a computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, who added that sometimes she hears more than 100 beeps in an hour.
With its democratization over the last 40 years, the beep has moved from cutting-edge chic to downright tacky. And it may be headed for the scrap heap if sound designers have their way. "The time has come for the beep to die an honorable death," said B. J. Fogg, a researcher at Stanford University.
A small army of researchers, engineers and programmers has declared war on the beep, which, they say, has overstayed its welcome.
"Beeps have become like the little boy who cried wolf," said Bruce Tognazzini, a human-computer interaction designer for the Healtheon Corporation. "They are often ignored even when they might have been useful. Having a computer that constantly emits the identical sound whether it is just happy to see you or is on fire and about to explode is akin to having a housemate that is similarly afflicted."
But the beep continues to hold its ground. "The downfall of the beep is only in fiction," said Bill Buxton, chief scientist for Alias/Wavefront, a software subsidiary of Silicon Graphics, and a foe of the beep. "In the real world, the beep is still thriving."
The sheer irritation caused by the beep is one reason for its longevity. Research has shown that humans are bothered by sounds that are sudden, high-pitched and short.
"If you wanted to design an annoying sound, you can't do much better than a beep," said Bill Gavin, a researcher at the Royal College of Art in England. Dr. Fogg described a beep as "a poke in the ribs, a simple but annoying method for gaining attention or compliance."
Computer historians say that modern computer beeps evolved from typewriter carriage return bells. Piercing beeps were substituted as alert signals for the familiar ring of the bell. Today the program code to make a computer beep is still called the bell character.
Why a beep, as opposed to a buzz or even a ding? The answer is dictated by economics. "Beeping is cheap," Dr. Gavin said.
A beep requires only two mechanical parts: an energy source and something to vibrate. Beep sound waves are produced by the rapid oscillation of on and off electrical pulses, in either a square form or a sine wave form. In contrast, more complicated electronic sounds require many more components.
The 1957 launch of the Russian Sputnik satellite ushered in a new era of celebrity for the beep. At the height of the cold war, American television and radio stations continually broadcast the satellite's taunting signal as it blazed over United States soil every 96 minutes.
"The sound was something very remote, very powerful and very frightening" said James Katz, a Rutgers University professor who was 9 years old at the time. "After all, it was a man-made entity in space over the United States. The beep made it much more real."
In the 1960's, beeps became most strongly associated with high-powered mainframe computers, and for engineers and technicians, they were a comforting and familiar sound. But when computers breached mainstream workplaces, the beep began to lose its luster.
"Bankers are very sensitive about not making mistakes, so the beep gave the users an incredible psychological stress," said Giordano Beretta, who worked as a bank computer support technician in the 1970's. "If you use a beep to signal a problem, people hate it because they feel socially responsible for making a mistake." Mr. Beretta said he was regularly asked to disable beep features on the computers.
When bar code scanners were first introduced, many library and supermarket employees often felt that beeps represented management's measuring of their efficiency.
Even appliances not designed to beep will chime in the chorus given the right electrical impulses. In 1987 a utility company in Dallas conducted an experiment using electrical transmission lines to carry digital signals. As a result, all the electronic appliances around the house of John Feagins began emitting a series of soft beeps every few seconds.
"I'd hear it out of the TV speakers," recalled Mr. Feagins, who was a physics student at the University of Texas at the time. "I'd hear it out of the radio speakers. I'd hear it out of the stove. It was everywhere in the house."
Despite his complaints to the utility, the beeping continued on and off for about a year. "I got aggravated enough to unplug everything, because otherwise I couldn't sleep," Mr. Feagins said.
Some have argued that the proliferation of the beep has a cultural basis.
"For some reason, Americans believe that the device needs to shout at you -- hence the loud beep," said Richard Giordano, a computer science lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The French, on the other hand, believe that the user should not be distracted from solving the problem, that the device should indicate the problem to the user in a calm manner and not get in the way of solving the problem."
That is why French nuclear power stations are much quieter than American ones, Dr. Giordano said.
Getting rid of the beep is not simply a matter of eradicating it; the beep has to be replaced with something else. Specialists who work in "human factors" laboratories are looking to create sounds that are less sharp and richer in timbre.
"It's a pity people don't use chimes and bells more often," lamented John Murray, a human factors specialist at Exponent Failure Analysis, a consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
There are three main approaches to the design of information tones. One is the earcon, an audio equivalent of an icon, which uses different rhythms, pitches, timbres and melodies to communicate different messages. Increasing a sound's tempo, for example, makes it seem more urgent. A paralinguistic approach gives computers a library of nonspeech tones used in human spoken communication (like "uh-oh"). Finally, audio icons use caricatures or simulations of naturally occurring sounds -- like a burp -- that carry specific associations.
The current trend is for high-tech companies to have their own trademark sound -- a logo for the ears, like America Online's "You've got mail" and the ICQ instant messenger's peppy "Uh-oh!"
Apple's Macintosh computer was the first serious desktop assault on the computer beep. Instead of using the simple grating tones, users could choose from a host of alerts ranging from a quack to the sound of a droplet. One Macintosh sound, called sosumi ("so sue me"), was a pointed taunt at the Beatles' Apple Corps company, which threatened legal action to prevent Apple Computer from releasing music under the Apple name.
The Windows platform also comes with a standard litany of sounds to choose from. Screen savers and other programs let users substitute sounds, from Homer Simpson's "D'oh!" to the "Star Wars" theme song.
Despite the enmity it faces, the beep is still healthy, thanks especially to answering machines and to personal pagers, which made beeps mobile (much to the dismay of many churches and theaters).
But pagers also contributed to the beeper backlash. Pagers were originally the domain of an elite few who had to be reached immediately, like doctors. "A loud ring on such a device let certain louts know, who might otherwise have remained unaware, that the pagee was someone of money and distinction," noted Mr. Tognazzini, of Healtheon.
When pagers became commonplace, their beeps became scorned rather than respected. As a response to customer complaints, companies introduced vibrating pagers, dealing the beep a major blow.
"Vibration was huge," said Karen Holmes, a marketing manager at Motorola. "Consumers just loved it."
Audrey Glassman, author of a book on techno-etiquette, says that pagers should always be kept on vibrator mode while in public. She adds that the only reason pagers still have a beep mode is "so that we don't have to call them vibrators."
The pager beep was displaced not only for reasons of etiquette but also for practical reasons. Mono-frequency beeps are unnatural to the ear, and psycho-acoustic research has shown that human ears have great difficulty determining the direction the sound is coming from, which is why it often seems difficult to find a misplaced pager or cell phone in a room or to identify whose phone or pager is sounding.
To Dr. Buxton, of Alias/Wavefront, this is evidence that the beep's days are numbered. "When people start designing devices that demonstrate subtle, well-designed sounds are less intrusive and more effective than the beep, the beep will be shamed out of existence," he said.
But it's not going quietly. Even without a sound card, today's desktop PC's can still belt out a primitive trill, which Eric Isaacson, a technical writer at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories in Pullman, Wash., discovered much to his dismay.
After Mr. Isaacson installed Windows NT on his office computer, the machine suddenly began beeping loudly enough for officemates 10 feet away to hear. For four weeks, the support technicians at his company could not figure out how to make it stop.
"At first I just got a little irritated when it beeped at me," Mr. Isaacson said.But the situation soon escalated. "Later," he said, "I started making it beep on purpose, after it beeped at me first -- kind of the 'I'll show you' attitude. This progressed to the point of my stabbing at the keys to make it beep, taking out my frustrations on the poor keyboard."
Finally, through an on-line news group, he found a way to silence the beep. "Now my beep lets out not a peep," he said.
 
Et Tu, Captain?
Where No Beep Had Gone Before
 LIKE an aging movie star, the beep has seen its glory days in Hollywood fade over the last 30 years, paralleling its fall in the public sphere. The 1960's television series "Star Trek" and its later offshoots provide a case study of how the beep has fallen from high-tech symbol to low-tech annoyance.
In the original series, which ran from 1966 to 1969, the beep was a star. Machines on the bridge of the starship Enterprise emitted a constant backdrop of beeping and booping to accompany the plot line. During the height of the 1960's space race, beeping was considered cutting-edge chic.
In recent "Star Trek" incarnations, however, the beep makes only cameo appearances. Gurgling, swishing and speaking have taken its place. The banishment of the beep was a conscious decision by the producers of the pilot of "Star Trek: the Next Generation" in 1986.
"We pulled up the sound of the bridge from the original series," said Peter Lauritson, who has worked as a producer on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," as well as the later series "Deep Space Nine" and "Star Trek Voyager." "It was a loud, constant, harsh environment. In contrast to that, we tried to make things softer and calmer."
Like the electronic interface designers of today, the "Star Trek" producers tried to serve the esthetic thresholds of humans. The "Star Trek" characters live aboard the ships for years on end, Mr. Lauritson said. "The reality is they wouldn't be able to take it," he noted.
"We tried to keep the sounds fairly gentle and minimal until something needed to be said with the sound. We were hoping it would convey sophistication, that things had advanced."
In "Star Trek: The Next Generation," the sound designers aimed for a so-called pastel range of electronic sounds that were muted and subtle. But then they realized even the harsh beeps and boops had a necessary role. As a result, the background sounds in "Deep Space Nine" and "Star Trek Voyager" aimed for a more "primary" sound palette, with harsher electronic noises.
"We originally went overboard in making things so sophisticated that it was boring," said Mr. Lauritson. "We had to start backing off of that a little bit to get a little more life into the scene."
The beep's prestige has diminished as it has become more mundane. "I think that the beeps and the boops sounds in the earlier days were kind of a futuristic signature," Mr. Lauritson said, "whereas now, they're kind of everywhere."

HEADLINE: Too Many Phones, Too Little Service

BYLINE: By CATHERINE GREENMAN 

 BODY:
IN case you haven't noticed, this country's 300 or so wireless telecommunications companies are eager for phone users to cut the cord on their wired phones and go completely mobile.
Leading wireless carriers like AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS, Bell Atlantic Mobile and BellSouth are encouraging "bucket plans," in which subscribers pay flat monthly rates for as much as 1,500 minutes of cell phone time. 
 According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade group based in Washington, the pricing plans, which in many cases are better than long distance rates for wired phones, are working. The group estimates the number of cellular phone users in this country to be near 77 million, with more than 37,500 people signing up for wireless phone service each day. And these users are talking more than ever before.
But for every college-bound student who has just purchased 1,000 minutes a month of talk time, there is a cell phone user out there like Stephanie Rudolph Soderberg, a New York City resident who signed on to AT&T's Digital One Rate plan more than a year ago. When asked if she was satisfied with her cell phone service, she replied: "What service? I have no service."
Mrs. Rudolph Soderberg said that every time she tries to call her husband, Bob Soderberg, an electrical engineer who works mostly outdoors in the city, she hears a fast busy signal, indicating that the call cannot be completed because there is too much traffic on the phone network.
"I take it very personally," she said. "I'm starting to think it's me, maybe something about my body that obstructs calls."
While no one knows the precise number of calls that are not completed, fade in and out or get cut off midconversation, such incidents are increasingly common complaints among wireless users. And they raise an important question: As successful as wireless companies have been in attracting subscribers, what are they doing to keep them happy?
In cities like New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, where cell phone use is among the highest in the country, incomplete or disconnected calls often occur because there are too many conversations for the limited number of channels within a wireless carrier's network. Buildings also greatly interfere with the transmission of cell phone signals. In less populated suburban and rural areas, transmission failures occur because the wireless networks have yet to be fully built, leaving holes in coverage areas.
The simple solution to these problems is to increase the number of cell sites -- the antennas and base station equipment that send and receive cellular signals. And wireless carriers, responding to the complaints of cell phone users, have, in fact, escalated the construction of cell sites. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association estimates that as of December 1998, there were more than 65,000 cell sites in the United States, a 28 percent increase over the previous year.
Jane O'Donaghue, a spokeswoman for AT&T, whose digital wireless network had difficulty sustaining the initial demand brought on by the carrier's Digital One Rate calling plan, said the company would spend more than $2 billion on its wireless infrastructure in 1999. At Sprint PCS, which has 11,000 sites in 280 markets, Tom Murphy, a spokesman, said the company would spend more than $1.5 billion on coverage and capacity this year.
"The big fix is for the carriers to go out and spend the money on building cell sites" said Matt Hoffman, an analyst with Dataquest, a research company in San Jose, Calif. "But they also have to factor in how much that will improve coverage. They can try and cover you in an elevator, but you could also wait until you get downstairs. How much adding a cell site will increase customer satisfaction is tough for the carriers to grasp."
Even with huge expenditures on infrastructure, wireless companies face an uphill battle to achieve better service coverage. There are a number of obstacles to overcome. The low signal strengths inherent in the newer digital wireless networks, for example, are the source of a slew of coverage problems.
A wireless phone works by transmitting and receiving radio signals to and from the nearest cell site. As the user travels from one cell to the next, the system hands off the signal so that service is uninterrupted. Every wireless carrier has a designated chunk of the radio spectrum, which it divides into cells. A typical cell in an urban area will handle about 100 channels, depending on the wireless technology being used.
Even though channels can handle more than one call simultaneously, if there are too many subscribers in a given cell at one time, the result can be a fast busy signal. If a subscriber already on the phone travels into a cell that is at capacity, the result can be a disconnected call.
Most cell sites cover transmissions in an area from 2 to 10 miles in diameter, depending on the terrain and other factors. Because the signals are transmitted at relatively low power (as low as 0.6 watts in digital wireless phones), channels can be reused in other cells without concern that there will be interference. A carrier with a limited number of channels can theoretically take on more subscribers by building more cells and reusing the channels.
Because the zeros and ones of a digital signal take up less space on a channel than do analog signals, digital wireless represents a boon to a channel-hungry wireless carrier. A digital cell can handle up to 10 calls per channel, several more calls per channel than an analog cell.
But some digital signals transmit at higher frequencies than analog signals and are more susceptible to energy loss as they travel between points. As a result, it takes more towers to carry the signals. That is a likely explanation for why digital wireless subscribers experience the most dropped calls while they're driving. The digital signal becomes weakened as the driver moves out of one cell, and it is not strong enough to be picked up immediately by the neighboring cell site.
Sometimes, however, it is not signal strength that is the problem, but the lack of digital cell sites. Although the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association estimates that 70 percent to 75 percent of the land area of the United States has wireless coverage, there is greater coverage for analog systems than for digital. Many wireless operators use the analog network as a fallback for digital customers.
But even when there is an analog cell in the area to default to, it's generally easier to hand off calls between digital cells than it is to hand off calls between digital and analog cells. A digital-analog handoff involves moving to a separate system as the signal is transmitted at the carrier's switching network. And if the analog transmission fails, the signal cannot be transferred back into digital mode.
In addition, wireless providers use different digital technologies that don't always hand off seamlessly between cells, particularly when a call is being relayed out of a cell in a subscriber's home coverage area and into the cell of another carrier, during a process known as roaming.
"We'd be so much better off if we had a couple of nationwide networks handing calls off to each other," said Nancy Gohring, wireless networks editor at Telephony, an industry trade magazine.
Radio frequency engineers at companies that manufacture base station equipment, like Lucent Technologies and Motorola, are constantly working on software upgrades to ease compatibility. Industry experts say the next generation of digital wireless will have a standard interface to improve the way different systems hand off calls to one another.
Kent Olson, an analyst at the Strategis Group, a telecommunications information services company based in Washington, estimates that it costs between $140,000 and $180,000 to build a cell site. In any urban area, there is usually a high density of sites to accommodate a large number of users.
Wireless providers are looking for more economical ways to build their networks. One alternative to building a cell is to extend the signal by stringing a series of devices known as repeaters in areas between cells. Repeaters can amplify and extend a signal up to 10 or 20 miles. More and more, wireless carriers are also installing micro cells, which have lower power and fewer channels, in areas that are difficult to penetrate, like buildings and tunnels.
Repeaters and micro cells are cheaper, but they will not solve all coverage problems.
"Some structures will still be almost impossible to penetrate, given the high frequency and low power of the digital signals," said Richard Wong, a network engineer for Telus Mobility, a cellular provider in western Canada.
Another economical alternative to building more cell sites is to lease channels on another company's existing cell site, something that wireless carriers are becoming much more flexible about. Such consolidation is also a response to community zoning regulations, which often prohibit the construction of new towers.
Over the last couple of years, many carriers have sold their cell sites to companies including the Crown Castle Corporation, based in Houston, and Pinnacle Holdings, based in Sarasota, Fla. These companies then lease the space to the carrier that used to own it, and to one or two others.
"With only two players in the market, there weren't the current issues with real estate and zoning," said Mr. Olson, of Strategis. "Now, with five or six players in each market, the carriers are much more likely to share tower space."
With the new generation of digital phones allowing limited Web access and E-mail already here and expanded wireless data services on the horizon, mobile phone use will only increase. Will a time come when the digital wireless network fills up entirely?
"The potential for that exists, but it's not any kind of a reality at this point," said Mark Desautels, managing director of the Wireless Data Forum, a Washington-based trade organization. The Federal Communications Commission, he said, "has the ability to shift spectrum and allot additional bandwidth should that become necessary."
And despite the current coverage problems, experts believe that the carriers will be able to build themselves out of it.
"The good news is that this, too, shall pass," said Tom Wheeler, president and chief executive of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. "It took 75 years before wire line phone service had the same kind of coverage that the wireless carriers have achieved in a much shorter period. It's not where it should be, but it's moving at lightning speed and improving every day."
 
Too Much Static?
Staying Loud and Clear
Here are some steps you can take to improve your wireless service:
* Study and compare various carriers' coverage areas, which are viewable on maps in cell phone stores and on carriers' Web sites. Or talk to wireless phone users who use the different services available in your area. "For most people, usage tends to be fairly predictable, so it's possible to do a little research and to subscribe to a carrier with the strongest signals in your area," said Sam Simon, chairman of the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a Washington-based consumer group. Sign up with a carrier that offers a 30-day trial period so you can switch carriers if you have service problems.
* If your phone has an extendable antenna, pull it out. Like the antenna on a transistor radio, it will improve the reception. If you experience coverage problems indoors, move close to a window or, if possible, go outside to improve the signal.
* Consider buying a car antenna if you make a lot of calls while driving. They
are available for under $100 at electronics stores and at Internet-based wireless phone dealers like those at www.point
.com and www.cellwest.com. Because they are mounted to the exterior of your car, the antennas can prevent the signal interference sometimes caused when making calls from inside. Most car antennas connect to your phone by a cable, which is unplugged when exiting the car.
* Don't forget the analog mode. Most digital wireless phones are capable of being switched to analog by pressing a function key. If you're in an area where your digital service is spotty, you can try switching for better reception. But be aware that you run the risk of being disconnected during the transition.
* Move around. When outdoors, moving just a couple of steps or waving your phone around in the air can improve the signal. Check the signal strength bar on the screen before dialing a phone number. It will help you avoid having to hit the resend button. CATHERINE GREENMAN

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
WHEN Thomas G. Nelson was teaching English in Malaysia last year, he was able to keep up with old friends and family in his hometown in Kansas every week by using his computer to read The Marion County Record, the local weekly newspaper, on line.
He could find out about high-school friends celebrating their anniversaries, check out the wedding announcements of people he remembered as babies and see how the local sports teams were faring. One week, his father was featured in an article on refinishing furniture. 
 He would joke with his family in Burdick, 20 miles northeast of Marion, that he would get the news on line a day or two before they would get it in their mailboxes.
"With the computer, you felt like you weren't missing out," said Mr. Nelson, 46, who is now back in Burdick. "You know everybody in town."
On-line news is not the exclusive territory of major daily newspapers anymore. In the last few years, small community daily papers and weeklies have been setting up Web sites and getting into the on-line news business.
While many just sample the waters by putting up a simple Web page with a few local stories, sports items, classified advertisements and obituaries (the most popular item), others have hired extra staff members, put display advertising on line and set up large community news operations.
Like many of their bigger counterparts, these smaller papers generally are not making profits yet from their on-line ventures. But many editors and publishers interviewed said they believed it was essential that small-town America get its news and advertising on line from them before someone else takes that market out from under them.
"We had to stop viewing ourselves as a newspaper company and view ourselves as an information company," said Mark Hamilton, who publishes the The Iowa Falls Times-Citizen (www.iafalls.com), a twice-weekly publication with a circulation of 4,000, and put the paper on line three years ago. "This is important for small towns."
But the game can be expensive, and many small newspapers that are already operating with tight budgets and small staffs are choosing to go slowly.
"Just like the large papers, small papers' on-line operations run the gamut," said Peter M. Zollman, principal partner in the Advanced Interactive Media Group , a Florida consulting firm. "Some are making money, some are losing their shirts, some aren't doing it because they are afraid they will lose their shirts."
Going slowly and not using much staff time or financial resources seems to be the game plan of most weeklies and dailies with circulations under 30,000.
"Everyone who has any sense is doing only that, because the economics of publishing will not sustain a large investment," said Eric Meyer, assistant professor of journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and managing partner in Newslink Associates, a research and consulting firm for on-line publishers. Mr. Meyer also owns the 3,500-circulation Marion County Record (www.marionrecord.com), with his father, Bill, who is the publisher and editor.
While it is not known exactly how many of America's 1,500 daily papers and 7,200 weeklies are on line, Mr. Meyer estimates that the figure includes more than half of the dailies and at least 1,000 of the weekly papers.
Studies show that Americans still prefer delivery to their doorstep, he said. But competition from large dailies trying to compete for suburban and small-town circulation, and races against other small publications, have pushed many small papers onto the Web in the last four years, Mr. Meyer said.
"They believe that they will be left behind if they don't go on line," he said.
In Aspen, Colo., both daily papers have gone on line. The Aspen Daily News (www.aspendailynews.com), a free, 12,500-circulation daily, set up a Web site three months ago in "an effort to distribute our content without printing more papers," said Darin Miller, general manager of the newspaper. The Aspen Times, which has a circulation of about 15,000 and charges for only the weekend paper, has had a weekly version on line (www.aspentimes.com /weekly.htm) for about three years and a daily one (www.aspentimes.com) for a year, said Andy Stone, the paper's editor.
Some papers that go on line eventually decide to abandon the effort. About 100 newspapers in each of the past three years have made that decision, Mr. Meyer said.
The Griffin Daily News, a 13,000-circulation daily in Georgia, went on line in late 1995 and took the Web site down in the summer of 1997. The paper plans to go back on line this summer with a simpler site that will include less content, said Alan Turner, the publisher.
The Rochester Sentinel (www.rochsent .com), a 4,800-circulation daily in rural Indiana, has gone the route of many small dailies, with a less labor-intensive and expensive Web site. Each day the site includes a new photo, the main local news story, weather, obituaries and classified ads. The paper's publisher, Sarah Overmyer Wilson, said it probably costs about $250 a month for server space and to pay an employee who comes in about one hour a day to update the site.
"It's profitable from a commitment standpoint," Ms. Overmyer Wilson said. "We've made many friends by having it, and friends can be currency, too."
While many small papers look at their Web presence as a public service, said Steve Outing, a consultant, they may be losing advertising revenue by not taking advantage of the potential to be a dominant information and commerce site for their area.
"Its tough for them, because they don't have much in the way of resources and they don't have much staff to throw at this," said Mr. Outing, who runs Content Exchange, an employment service for the on-line publishing industry.
The sites that are successful, he said, are often those that have more than just the newspaper. Sites like Town Online in Massachusetts are handbooks for small towns where users can find the news and also learn where to go to get a dog license or find Web pages on nonprofit community groups.
The Community Newspaper Company, based in Needham, Mass., publishes more than 100 papers, including The Metro West Daily News, as well as weeklies and shoppers. It began its Town Online Web site in the summer of 1996 (www.townonline .com). The site provides newspapers as well as guides to more than 200 towns and communities in eastern Massachusetts.
At Thomson Newspapers, executives decided to build the commerce side of the on-line business before turning to news content. Thomson, which includes about 60 daily newspapers in the United States and Canada, started looking into Internet strategy in 1995, said Jonathan R. Sheer, vice president of electronic products for Thomson and chief executive officer of Thomson Interactive Media. By June 1998, all the papers had an on-line presence, but only about 10 percent carry daily news content.
"The greatest risk to us is advertising migration, not reader migration," Mr. Sheer said. "It's commerce, community and content, in that order."
Mr. Sheer said he wanted to build an advertising base first, then add community information, and add the news content last. Newspapers need to "take people from the real world and direct them to the on-line world," he said.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Americans continue to spend more than they earn, and this worries a lot of people. The personal saving rate was negative 1 percent in June, according to recent data. In fact, the saving rate has been negative for the last seven months.
While high saving is almost always better than low saving, the current trend should be viewed in light of three facts. First, while Americans are saving less as individuals, as a nation we're saving more. Second, the reason many people save so little is that gains in the market have reduced their need to save. Third, home equity loans and other tax provisions make it easier for families to meet their financial goals without high saving. 
 Our personal saving rate has been falling for about 15 years and turned negative in 1998. Yet during the very years that personal saving has been lowest -- from 1996 on -- the economy has expanded faster, and for longer, than at any time since the 1960's.
In fact, the rate at which people save contributes to economic growth only as part of the nation's total saving rate: how much individuals, government and business save altogether. Here the news has been good. For most of the 1990's, this total figure has been rising, reaching a healthy 17.1 percent in the first quarter of 1999. And healthy national saving has been a boon to business investment, which recently recorded its sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases, a record.
The Government deserves some credit. After a decade of large deficits that were dragging down the measure, budget surpluses now contribute to national saving. This has helped the Federal Reserve maintain moderate interest rates, fueling strong growth and productivity gains. This further bolsters national saving by increasing both business saving (retained earnings) and state and local government surpluses.
Today most people save for specific purposes: to buy a home, send their children to college, weather a bout of unemployment, and eventually retire. With Americans' net worth up by more than half since 1994 and capital gains (realized and unrealized) at their highest levels in history, millions of Americans can achieve their saving targets without putting aside more money.
Changes in tax laws also help. Home equity loans are a ready source of money. The new tax deduction and credit for college costs, as well as tax incentives for 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s, also reduce pressure to save.
It's helpful to understand what the personal saving rate measures. The Bureau of Economic Analysis first adds up everyone's regular income -- wages and salaries, interest, dividends and rents -- and then subtracts all their spending. This focus on how much people put aside each year is an important measure. But it doesn't cover all forms of saving. It treats all spending equally, from a wager in Atlantic City to a tuition bill, even though education costs and many other large purchases are also investments.
Further, the measure does not include capital gains, because such "income" simply represents changes in the price of existing assets. (Next year, there will be a new measure of household wealth that does include capital gains.)
Still, tens of millions of families today don't own stock and can't afford to save very much. To help them, the President has proposed plans like Universal Savings Accounts, hoping to encourage more personal saving where it's most needed.
To help everyone, we have to maintain a strong national saving rate, which means resisting large tax cuts that would end the budget surpluses that support business investment and growth.

U.S. Group Seeks Motor-Scooter Maker

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The Vespa, the perky little Italian motor scooter, was immortalized by Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in the 1953 American film classic "Roman Holiday." So there seems to be some poetic justice in the news today that a group of United States investors is close to a deal to spend about $650 million to acquire a controlling interest in Piaggio Veicoli Europei S.p.A., the Italian group that manufactures the Vespa.
The announcement of talks by officials of Piaggio and the Texas Pacific Group, based in Fort Worth, came in response to a report in Corriere della Sera, an Italian daily newspaper. The news ends a period of speculation about the future of Piaggio, which invented the sputtering two-wheelers after World War II. 
 For Italians, the surrender of the Vespa appeared to signal the loss of yet another of the nation's industrial icons.
"Let's hope they keep the same characteristics," said Stefano Malatesta, a 32-year-old Rome musician, who drove his first Vespa at 14 and now owns his seventh, a white 125cc BX model.
The puzzling over Piaggio's prospects began after the death in December 1997 of Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, the company's 33-year-old chief executive, after an eight-month struggle with abdominal cancer. Mr. Agnelli, an offspring of the family that controls the Italian auto maker Fiat, was credited with the strategy that returned Piaggio to profitability last year after several years of losses. The death in April of Mr. Agnelli's mother, Antonella Bechi Piaggio, a major Piaggio stock owner, is said to have encouraged the search for a strong new shareholder to insure direction and capital for the company's future.
Abel G. Halpern, managing director of Texas Pacific Group Europe, would say only that "we are in serious discussions" for Texas Pacific to acquire a controlling share. A Piaggio executive referred to "advanced discussion."
An agreement would result in the second major recent investment in the Italian two-wheeled-vehicle market for the group.
In 1996, Texas Pacific took over Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A., the icon of Italian motorcycle making. Managers hired by Texas Pacific overhauled Ducati's manufacturing plants, rebuilt the bike's image and, on the model of Harley Davidson, or maybe Gucci, opened exclusive Ducati stores, including one on 42d Street in Manhattan. Fresh models were rolled out by a new chief designer, Pierre Terblanche.
In September, Sotheby's Chicago showroom is expected to auction a one-of-a-kind Ducati, the MH900e, designed by Mr. Terblanche, and collectors are expected to bid at least $500,000.
Federico Minoli, Ducati's chief executive, was quoted today as saying that "our company is not involved" in the talks. But a Piaggio executive noted that with a Piaggio deal, Texas Pacific's portfolio would cover virtually the whole range of motorized two-wheelers, from tiny 50cc Vespas to Ducati's monster bikes.
Analysts said the Ducati experience must have influenced Piaggio shareholders.
"Texas Pacific is specialized in buying into a company when it is underperforming its potential," said Michael Millman of Salomon Smith Barney. "They are sure to have a vision when they come to Piaggio."
Neither Texas Pacific nor Piaggio would say how much money would change hands if a deal is struck. But people close to the financing said the price would be roughly $650 million. In a straw vote at a meeting of Piaggio's major shareholders earlier this month, a majority agreed to the sale, which could be formally concluded soon after Italians return from their August holidays.
No immediate management changes are expected at Piaggio, people close to the discussions said.
Piaggio, which is based in Pontedera, near Pisa, made aircraft engines until 1946 when it came up with the Vespa -- Italian for wasp, and so named because of the pinched shape of the vehicle's body and its buzzing noise -- as an economical means of transportation for Italians just emerging from wartime.
By the mid-1990's, a combination of aging products and tough competition by Japanese leaders, including Honda, caused Piaggio to suffer two years of losses. Piaggio's comeback began under Mr. Agnelli. In 1996, he began a new generation of Vespa, with a bulbous retro look evoking the original model, which was introduced 50 years earlier. As sales revived in Europe and beyond, Piaggio reported a profit of $5.4 million in 1998, against losses of $28 million the previous year. Revenues rose 4 percent in 1998, to $1 billion.

Carnival's Cunard cruise line plans to spend $12.5 million to stress a touch of class.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
WHEN the Carnival Corporation and a group of investors paid $500 million for the Cunard cruise ship line a little more than a year ago, some cruise industry executives wondered why. After all, just a few years earlier, when the Walt Disney Company was looking to enter the cruise business, a Disney executive told a British newspaper: "We have no interest in Cunard or the QE2. It is seen in the industry as something of a liability."
While lacking in diplomacy, that assessment was basically correct. Even though Cunard's flagship, Queen Elizabeth 2, was the most famous cruise ship afloat, both the ship and the company had been adrift for several years. The low point occurred during a trans-Atlantic voyage in December 1994, when the newly renovated QE2's pipes exploded, toilets erupted and passengers were on the verge of rioting. That embarrassment cost the ship bookings and cost Cunard $13 million to settle the claims of angry passengers. 
 But Carnival executives were confident that in buying Cunard, whose 158-year-old pedigree and name were unequaled among people who wanted to travel in style and were willing to pay for it, they were buying "a brand equity." Within months they merged Cunard with the company's other upscale brand, Seabourn Cruise Line, and during the next five months, through the end of the fiscal year ended last Nov. 30, Cunard wound up with a modest profit of $35 million. While that was not a bad first step, Carnival, which last year made more than $1 million of profit a day, has larger long-range ambitions for its acquisition.
Cunard plans to spend $12.5 million on a worldwide all-print advertising campaign that will get under way by month's end and run until December 2000. The campaign will appear in 14 newspapers in the United States, from New York to California, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Washington Post, USA Today and The Miami Herald; in nine upscale magazines including The New York Times magazine, Travel & Leisure, Conde Nast Traveler, Gourmet, and Forbes FYI and five travel trade publications. The same campaign will also appear in Australia, Asia and Europe.
Dubbed the "Continuum Campaign," the Cunard ads do not seek to be all things to all cruise line passengers, but to recapture the elegance and mystique of ocean travel -- of the time, as one ad puts it, "when gentlemen on Queen Mary dressed for dinner, and passengers wore T-shirts under their clothing."
Under the motto "Advancing Civilization Since 1840," and with at least several ads headlined, "Those who worship change simply don't understand tradition," the ads speak to "timeless elegance" and a "gracious atmosphere," while turning up their collective nose at "a world of mass production and glitz."
"The campaign's tone is reminiscent of a bygone era -- where civility and manners were traits of ladies and gentlemen, and Cunard was the only way to cross," said Dorn Martell, senior creative vice president of Tinsley Advertising of Miami, which has the account.
The new ads blending Cunard's rich history and past advertising appeals are based on extensive research. To achieve historical authenticity, Tinsley researched the Cunard archives at the University of Liverpool and in the Maritime Museum in Liverpool, Cunard's original home port. "The backgrounds of every ad contain the actual technical drawings of ships like Aquitania, Oregon, Queen Mary and Royal George," Mr. Martell said. "The illustrations are gleaned from sources like the original brochure for Lusitania and photos of classic maritime architecture like the Palladian lounge from Aquitania, all melded with contemporary images from the QE2."
Larry Pimental, the chief executive of Cunard and Seabourn, views this as the perfect time for ads in this style. "While most of the cruise industry is trying to differentiate itself from the formality of classic cruising," he said, "we feel there is a niche for us where people still desire the graciousness and elegance that has always been our tradition."
In addition to the QE2, Cunard's fleet includes the 700-passenger Caronia, which is expected back in service in November after being refurbished, and a new ship that is being billed as the world's biggest ocean liner, planned for introduction in about three years. The Caronia, formerly the Vistafjord, is a single-stack liner and the third Cunard ship to bear the Caronia name.
The overall cruise market reached a record 5.4 million passengers last year and is expected to continue growing as long as the economy remains healthy. The luxury cruise segment, generally thought to be about 15 percent of the market, is also expected to grow, although competition from luxury resorts will be more intense than ever. To counter that threat, Cunard is lowering its rates an average of 20 percent next year, while hoping that its reputation, tradition and new ad campaign will fill more berths as it sails into the new millennium.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Hathaway Bond Holdings Rise

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. increased its bondholdings in the second quarter, as its chairman, Warren E. Buffett, moved to invest almost $10 billion from a cash hoard that had soared since early last year, according to a regulatory filing.
Berkshire, the Omaha holding company controlled by Mr. Buffett, disclosed that its cash on hand dropped to $4.2 billion on June 30, from $14.2 billion three months earlier. Berkshire said its investments in fixed-income securities rose by about $9.3 billion, to a total of about $30.4 billion, in the same period. 
 Berkshire's quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission did not say what kinds of fixed-income investments were purchased, leaving questions about whether the company bought short-term debt to squeeze extra interest income from its excess cash or whether Mr. Buffett was buying bonds in a bid to repeat a successful 1997 bet on the future direction of interest rates.
Berkshire's filing to the S.E.C. said investments in securities with fixed maturities soared to $30.4 billion as of June 30, from $21.1 billion on March 31. In the same period, the total value of Berkshire's stock portfolio dropped to less than $39 billion from about $39.7 billion three months earlier.

HEADLINE: Group Seeking 2d Ave. Subway Takes Issue With M.T.A.

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Sending an early salvo in what promises to be an impassioned debate over the proposed Second Avenue subway, a small cadre of elective officials and transportation advocates yesterday denounced a decision by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to consider an abbreviated version of the project.
The group, including Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, and Eliot L. Engel, the Bronx Congressman, called a news conference to criticize what it called a short-sighted approach to the Second Avenue project, one of several large subway construction proposals under review. 
 "The M.T.A. has proposed mere tokens," said Mr. Green, referring to an environmental impact statement released on Monday in which the agency said its most ambitious option for the Second Avenue project would be to build a new subway line under the avenue from 125th Street to 63d Street, combined with a street-level trolley that would extend south to lower Manhattan.
That option, costing an estimated $3.6 billion, falls far short of what many people on the East Side of Manhattan and in the Bronx had been hoping the M.T.A. would promote -- a new subway running from Co-op City in the Bronx to lower Manhattan.
"We expect the M.T.A. to offer bold solutions to big problems," the group said in a letter to E. Virgil Conway, the chairman of the M.T.A. and a close adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki. Without building what it called a "full-length line," the group said, the M.T.A. would undermine the city economy "because we are plagued by an inadequate transportation system."
The group's protest was orchestrated before a phalanx of television cameras in front of the M.T.A.'s Madison Avenue headquarters, and came against a backdrop of widespread calls by community groups, Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney, the Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, and others to include, or at least consider, the ambitious vision of a "Bronx to Battery" subway line as part of a five-year capital spending program. The M.T.A. must submit that plan to the State Legislature before the end of the year.
But the M.T.A., whose senior executives have repeatedly warned of the huge expense and engineering hurdles confronting such a project, surprised few when its environmental analysis, prepared for Federal regulators, outlined smaller options.
Besides building the new line from 125th Street to 63d Street, the options included building nothing at all, but speeding up the trains on the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan. Other alternatives included new bus priority lanes on the Upper East Side and new bus routes on the Lower East Side to ease subway congestion.
The M.T.A.'s decisions are complicated by several other large projects that are being proposed as part of its five-year spending plan. These include construction of a new Manhattan tunnel that would connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal, a project backed vigorously by Governor Pataki.
Advocates of the Second Avenue subway contend that the proposed Grand Central connection will only heighten the need for new subway service on the East Side of Manhattan, because thousands of Long Island Rail Road commuters could be expected to use the already overburdened Lexington Avenue subway line.
The M.T.A., in recent years controlled largely by the Governor, will face its most difficult puzzle in choosing which projects it can pay for. Despite the strong economy, which has funneled more tax revenue than expected into the M.T.A.'s budget, a report on Tuesday by New York City's Independent Budget Office cast doubt on whether the agency could afford any of the current proposals without raising fares or obtaining new government subsidies.
Despite such financial questions, though, the group criticizing the M.T.A. yesterday said the agency was simply giving up on a much needed subway project without fully exploring its options, or seeking new sources of financial support.
"We have the benefit of a strong economy, and we are living in the financial capital of the world, so it's about time we started coming up with some fresh ideas about financing," said A. Gifford Miller, a New York City Councilman who represents the Upper East Side and who joined yesterday's protest.
Among the financial options that might be explored, he said, are reinstating a state tax on people who commute into Manhattan, with the proceeds dedicated for subway construction. In what was widely regarded as a power play to benefit suburban political candidates, a long-standing state commuter tax was thrown out by lawmakers in Albany and Governor Pataki in June.

HEADLINE: Water Costs Enough

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert N. Stavins's proposal to encourage people to conserve water by charging them more for usage sounds plausible (Op-Ed, Aug. 14). 
 However, in New York City water rates are already rising because of the increasing costs of watershed protection, filtration and infrastructure needs. Since 1986, water rates in the city have risen more than 200 percent.
Moreover, because of the city's water-metering policy, which measures water use in an entire building rather than in individual apartments, individuals have little incentive to save money by conserving water.
And, as a report by Anthony J. Blackburn, a former Harvard economist, shows, metering is hyper-regressive. Those least able to pay spend eight times more of their income on water than do the most affluent.

HEADLINE: Sale of PEC Shares To Parent Is Urged

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The PEC Israel Economic Corporation, which has holdings from telecommunications satellites to textiles, recommended yesterday that its stockholders sell their shares to the parent company, the IDB Development Corporation, at a sweetened price of $36.50 a share.
Minority investors had objected to the previous offer of $30 a share, saying it was too low. The new price is 22 percent higher than that figure and represents a 24 percent premium over yesterday's closing price of $29.50, which was up 25 cents from Tuesday. PEC Israel announced its recommendation after the close of regular trading in New York. 
 IDB, one of Israel's biggest investment companies, already owns about 81 percent of the stock of PEC Israel, which is based in New York. It would merge the company with its other investment subsidiary, the Discount Investment Corporation, to unify their portfolios and make operations more efficient.
Discount Investment, which has interests in finance, communications, software and electronics, hopes to complete the purchase by year-end. Once that happens, assuming it does, PEC Israel shares are to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Daewoo's Creditors Form a Committee to Guide Negotiations

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The Daewoo Group, the struggling South Korean conglomerate, met today with international creditors for the first time since its financial crisis erupted in mid-July and agreed to keep paying interest on $6 billion of foreign debt.
In return, dozens of foreign creditors said they would refrain from using courts to recover their money. 
 Creditors also formed a committee to guide negotiations.
Daewoo, which said it could not afford to repay its debt anytime soon, owes foreign and domestic creditors $57 billion.
The pledge to avoid lawsuits -- only one has been filed so far -- averts the possibility of more legal claims that could further delay Daewoo's debt restructuring. Daewoo needs a debt extension and access to fresh loans to insure its survival and help calm concern that similar problems may erupt at the nation's other industrial groups, known as chaebol.
"These problems will probably confront the rest of the chaebol as well," said Nasser Paracha, an executive at Dubai-based Mashreqbank, one of the creditors. "It's not just Daewoo we are looking at."
The three-hour meeting today, at the Daewoo-owned Seoul Hilton Hotel, ended with 150 representatives from 71 foreign creditors forming a committee that Daewoo said was composed of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, HSBC Holdings P.L.C., ABN Amro Bank, UBS A.G., Citibank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, National Bank of Australia and Arab Bank. Representatives of Citibank and UBS denied that their banks would serve on the committee, as Daewoo had indicated.
The meeting came after Natexis Banques Populaires S.A., a large French bank, sued a Daewoo unit to recover $10 million of debt. The Hong Kong lawsuit caused concern that similar claims would delay efforts to avert Korea's biggest corporate failure. "We hope Natexis will drop the case in the interest of everybody involved," said Song Ki Dong, an executive in the international finance division of the Daewoo Corporation, the unit that holds the largest share of the group's debt.
Foreign creditors agreed to accept Daewoo's request to form a committee to allow the conglomerate to revamp its finances in a way that is "fair and equitable" to foreign and domestic creditors. Daewoo said it would be almost impossible for it to negotiate separately with about 200 creditors.
Korean creditors are also considering whether to swap some of the Daewoo auto unit's debt for equity to help sell a stake to the General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker. The president of the Daewoo Motor Company, Kim Tae Gou, held talks in the United States this week with G.M.'s chairman, John F. Smith Jr., and other executives on a possible business alliance, including the sale of a controlling equity sale.
In return for debt extensions and new loans from domestic creditors, Daewoo agreed to sell or spin off most other assets, including the shipyards of the Daewoo Heavy Industries Company and Daewoo Electronics.

HEADLINE: 6-Month Halt Sought In the Sale of Water From Great Lakes

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
A bilateral commission recommended a six-month moratorium today on the sale of water from the Great Lakes. A study to determine whether there is enough Great Lakes' water to sell is under way and should be concluded over that period.
The recommendation came from The International Joint Commission, which helps the United States and Canada manage their border waters. The commission said a moratorium should include both the bulk removal of surface water and new removal of groundwater from the Great Lakes basin. 
 Last year a Canadian company applied for permission to ship water from Lake Superior to Asia.
The commission's recommendation was made to the United States and Canadian Governments in an interim report issued by experts at the commission who are halfway through the yearlong study of issues related to water diversion and sales from the Great Lakes. The study is intended to provide the basis for action by the two Governments.
An effort is under way in Congress to stop Great Lakes water from being exported, and Canada has announced a plan to ban large-scale exports.
Right now, according to the commission, no major diversion projects are being proposed and "there is little reason to believe that such projects will become economically, environmentally and socially feasible in the foreseeable future."
Despite an increase in the popularity of bottled water, the commission said, the amount of water from the lakes that is being used for that purpose is not significant.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stocks Slump As Investors Take Profits

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices slumped yesterday as investors took profits from the recent rally, the dollar weakened and interest-rate jitters continued.
Bond prices rose, causing the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury to flirt with a level just under 6 percent, a key threshold in market psychology. 
 After approaching its mid-July peak on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gave ground early yesterday, steadied, then stumbled again in the final half-hour to finish with a loss of 125.70 points, or 1.13 percent, to 10,991.38. I.B.M. was a prominent late casualty.
"The pullback in the dollar, certainly against the yen, has weakened stocks," said Elaine H. Yager, a senior analyst at Herzog Heine Geduld. Analysts also said some investors were cashing in profits ahead of the expiration of options contracts on Friday and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday, which is widely expected to result in a quarter-point rise in the overnight lending rate among banks.
A surprisingly strong earnings report by Dell Computer and a recommendation of eight Internet stocks by Merrill Lynch's influential analyst, Henry Blodget, helped keep the Nasdaq average in positive territory most of the day before it, too, slipped and ended down 13.49 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 2,657.73.
Investors in the bond market were buoyed by official purchases, and continued on the previous day's strong rally, pushing the 30-year issue during the day to just under 6 percent, a quarter percentage point less than a week ago, before finishing right at 6 percent. The rate on the 10-year bond, a benchmark for mortgages, eased a bit further, to 5.86 percent.
Fears that a string of interest rate increases are coming appear to be subsiding on the comforting news this week that inflation remains in check.
"The stock market continues to trade without a lot of conviction," said Richard E. Cripps, chief strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. "But seeing the long bond rally is probably the best thing" for it. Trading volume remained subdued.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.32 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,332.84, midway between the other major indexes.
I.B.M. was the biggest factor in the decline of the blue-chip Dow index, skidding 4 5/8, to 123 7/8, after changing hands as high as 129 5/8. But 20 of the other 29 stocks in the index also fell, with American Express losing 3, to 137 1/4; Johnson & Johnson 2 1/8, to 96 3/16, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing 1 13/16 , to 95 9/16.
Mr. Blodget, the Merrill Lynch analyst, recommended eight Internet stocks he saw as benefiting from this year's holiday shopping season, perhaps tripling revenue from on-line sales and advertising. He predicted the shares, which "offer a sound way to play the fundamental strength and renewed investor enthusiasm" expected in coming months, would surge 50 percent to 100 percent by year-end.
All his picks rose. Amazon.com jumped 3 7/8, to 113 1/8; America Online 1 11/16 , to 99 3/16, and Yahoo 6 3/16, to 145 1/16. His other picks were Etoys, Excite@Home, Lycos, Inktomi and Barnesandnoble.com.
A lesser factor in yesterday's session was a report that Fidelity Investments, the biggest mutual fund group, sold a net $4.6 billion of technology stocks during the second quarter, shrinking positions in America Online, as well as in Texas Instruments, Oracle and Intel.
Dell Computer, which reported a bigger-than-expected earnings gain after Tuesday's close, gained 3 7/16, to 44 9/16, yesterday, adding about as much to the S.& P. 500 performance, as I.B.M. subtracted. Only 112 index components rose, compared with 370 that fell.
Saks Inc. dropped 1 13/16 , to 17 3/16, after warning of lower profits this year; Talbots, another retailer, climbed 1 15/16 , to 32 9/16, on sharply higher quarterly earnings. Reader's Digest rose 1 3/8, to 33, after announcing tripled earnings that beat forecasts.
Hannaford Brothers soared 9 1/16, to 72 3/4, on a deal to be acquired by Food Lion, whose B shares slumped 2 11/32, to 8 13/16 .
On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,799 issues fell, compared with 1,195 that rose; 65 stocks made 52-week lows, while 51 reached new highs.
Volume of 682 million was slightly below Tuesday's 690 million.
Overseas, stocks advanced about one-half of 1 percent in London but fell that much in Frankfurt. The Bovespa in Brazil and the Bolsa in Mexico skidded 2.37 percent and 2.12 percent, respectively, while Tokyo showed little change.

HEADLINE: EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY: THE RESPONSE;
Dozens of Nations Heeding Turkey's Cries for Assistance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The United States and other nations rushed today to assist Turkey, sending teams with search equipment and dogs to sniff out survivors, as well as money.
A 70-member team from Fairfax, Va., with firetrucks, dogs and 56,000 pounds of equipment, was en route to Turkey to help battle a refinery fire that has been raging since the earthquake hit on Tuesday, a White House spokesman, David Leavy, said. 
 President Clinton "has made clear he wants a robust U.S. response to the devastation," Mr. Leavy said. And the United States Agency for International Development was making teams of people available to assist with medical, water and sanitation needs, he added.
At the request of the Turkish Red Crescent, the International Red Cross began an appeal for $6.92 million for aid.
The European Union said it was sending $2.1 million in aid and promised to give more. Britain donated $800,000, Germany provided $560,000, Ireland added $270,000, and the Arab Gulf Program for United Nations Development Organizations, based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, announced a gift of $150,000. Swiss charities promised $233,000, and the Finnish Red Cross gave $50,000.
Search dogs arrived from the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Greece and the Netherlands.
Rescue teams brought thermal imaging cameras and highly sensitive motion detectors.
A Swiss team of 98 rescue experts and 18 dogs arrived in Izmit, Turkey, where the quake hit hardest, on a chartered flight with 16 tons of equipment. "We need at least 250 teams, because that is the number of buildings that have been destroyed," said Izmit's Mayor, Sefa Sirmen.
Greece sent three C-130 military transport planes with two emergency medical teams and a 25-member rescue team with dogs, the Athens News Agency reported. Russia and Israel sent rescue teams and equipment, and Japan, Iran, Bulgaria and Romania also offered help. Canada said it would send 200 troops.
France sent a 61-member emergency team on Tuesday with six dogs, along with first aid and rescue equipment. The German Red Cross was sending dogs and surgeons, as well as moving ambulances and a field hospital from Macedonia. The Austrian Government was dispatching a 60-member search-and-rescue team.
The Israeli Army sent reinforcements for teams already on the ground in Golcuk, Turkey. The Foreign Ministry said 200 rescue and medical workers were in Turkey.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
30-Year Yield Slips Below 6% For First Time In a Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds rose for a fourth day yesterday, driving yields below 6 percent for the first time in a month, on expectations that the Federal Reserve will not need to raise interest rates more than once to try to stem inflation.
Mark Sauvigne, a bond trader at Chase Securities Inc., said, "People are getting more comfortable with the idea the Fed is going to raise just 25 basis points." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 That optimism helped the 30-year bond in late trading, after it had languished for much of the day as a 2-yen decline in the dollar sapped demand for Treasuries.
David Hoffman, who helps manage $1 billion at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Del., predicted yields would continue to come down. The 30-year bond rose 5/32, to a price of 101 25/32, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 6 percent, or just a bit below at one point. Yields on two-year notes, the most widely traded Treasuries, fell 5 basis points, to 5.63 percent.
Because Tuesday's report on the Consumer Price Index showed no inflationary threat, "a lot of people believe the Fed is going to tighten this month and that's it," said Ken Fan, a bond strategist at Paribas Capital Market.
Bonds had been gaining since Friday -- until the dollar's 3.3 percent decline against the yen this week began to hurt demand early yesterday. A weakening dollar cuts into foreign investors' profits when they sell American bonds and convert the proceeds into local currency. A falling dollar also raises inflationary fears among domestic investors.
The weaker dollar is a "problem for the market," Mr. Hoffman of Brandywine said. He sold American corporate debt and bought Swedish Government bonds.
The Fed funds futures contract for September delivery, the closest indication of expectations for where the Fed will position rates, is at 5.24 percent, or 24 basis points above the current 5 percent target for overnight lending. That suggests investors expect a quarter-point increase at the next policy meeting on Tuesday. Until recently, some had expected a series of Fed rate actions.
"We've been speculating that yields would rise in all major bond markets, and in the last couple of months that has been a good prediction," said Robert McHenry, a portfolio manager who oversees international bonds at Hartford Investment Management, in Hartford, and he has not changed his mind.
The economy is still plowing through a ninth year of expansion, having registered annualized 2.3 percent growth in the second quarter. That compares with 4.23 percent in the first quarter and, Mr. McHenry said, "although the strength is diminishing, we still believe the environment is one that favors caution. We've been short and plan to stay that way."
