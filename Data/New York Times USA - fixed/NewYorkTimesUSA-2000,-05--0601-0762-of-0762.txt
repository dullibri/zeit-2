HEADLINE: U.S. Still Pays Contractor Bills For Whistle-Blower Lawsuits

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Five years ago, the Energy Department, trying to protect workers who raised safety concerns at its nuclear weapons plants, said it would stop covering the legal bills of its contractors when they were caught retaliating against such whistle-blowers.
But witnesses and lawmakers said at a Congressional hearing today that the department was still paying those bills, sometimes without knowing it. 
 Even though the department announced a policy of "zero tolerance for reprisals" against whistle-blowing employees years ago, department officials acknowledged today that they had not written a final rule on when to withhold taxpayer dollars from financing contractors' legal defenses against such claims.
Employees of contractors, from pipefitters to senior engineers, who have called attention to on-site safety concerns, have spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees over the years, often while enduring hostile conditions at work, or unemployment, their advocates say.
In a hearing by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Representative Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat and a former labor lawyer, said the agency should praise "the enormous courage and unmeasurable contributions of whistle-blowers." Instead, Ms. DeGette said, "They can just bleed these poor individuals dry."
The subcommittee chairman, Representative Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said the department appeared to be "providing virtually no support for the whistle-blowers, while providing generous taxpayer support to the contractors fighting these meritorious claims."
The Commerce Committee chairman, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, released two agency documents on legal costs incurred by Kaiser-Hill, a contractor at Rocky Flats, a defunct plutonium plant near Denver.
The contractor was defending itself against accusations that it retaliated against a security supervisor who complained about the safety of bomb fuel stored there. The employee brought his case before the Labor Department, which ruled in his favor, and Kaiser-Hill did not appeal.
Among Energy Department repayments to Kaiser-Hill was $220,000 in legal fees incurred fighting the whistle-blower, Mr. Bliley said.
The agency said last week it had not approved any expenses and was still reviewing them. But today it said Kaiser-Hill included the costs "in general subcontractor billings that were not conspicuous to D.O.E."
The company has returned the money but is still seeking reimbursement, the department said.
The department does nearly all of its work through contractors, many on a "cost-plus" basis, in which it reimburses all costs and then adds a profit. It includes legal defense costs and, usually, the cost of any settlements imposed on the contractors.
Department officials said today that they could decline to make such reimbursements, but they could not cite a case where they had done so. Mary Anne Sullivan, the department's general counsel, said the agency had proposed to do so in some pending cases.
One witness, Tom Carpenter, of the Government Accountability Project, which brings cases on behalf of whistle-blowers, said the system encouraged contractors to drag out cases and then settle on the eve of trial. A policy of full reimbursement was "an incentive for the contractors to litigate the case," Mr. Carpenter said. "If they had to pay, they'd have a much more realistic view" of the cases against them.
Whistle-blowers complaining of retaliation take their cases to the Labor Department, Mr. Carpenter said, because its procedures allow for discovery, access to documents and company officials, whereas Energy Department procedures do not.

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE WRANGLE: THE OVERVIEW;
THE HOUSE OPENS A SPIRITED DEBATE OVER CHINA TRADE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The House opened a spirited debate today on the China trade bill, as a furious final round of horse-trading with undecided members demanding everything from gas pipelines to a weather station left supporters confident that they would eke out a victory on Wednesday.
Republican and Democratic vote counters in favor of the bill said they were within a vote or two of their targets needed to grant Beijing permanent normal trading relations and give President Clinton a crowning foreign policy triumph. About a dozen Democrats, including six Texans, announced their support. 
 But opponents insisted that the margin was still too close to call, and that the spotlight had swung from undeclared Democrats to about 10 undeclared Republicans, who were receiving a wave of phone calls from veterans groups and human rights advocates. Many in both camps predicted that the vote could go down to the wire.
"I expect the bill to pass, but it's going to be one of the most exciting 15 to 20 minutes on the floor," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, who is a supporter of the measure.
In the debate that opened this afternoon and will resume on Wednesday, supporters like Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, urged passage for economic and foreign policy reasons: "This will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and enhance our national security." Excerpts from the debate, Page A14.
Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who brokered an amendment to the trade measure that creates a human rights monitoring commission in China, said: "China's integration into the world trading system inevitably presents opportunies and challenges. We have to take advantage of benefits we negotiated with China and actively address our problems."
But foes, including Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, argued that passage would lead to multinational corporations "setting up low-wage sweatshops and dumping their pollution" in China.
Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, said replacing Congress's annual renewal of China's trade status with permanently lower tariffs would strip lawmakers of their leverage to curb China's repression of its own people. "There are 10 million people in slave-labor camps who have nothing more than a bowl of gruel a day," he said.
From the White House to Capitol Hill, both sides fanned out to intensify their lobbying. Mr. Clinton met with several wavering Democrats, and he and his cabinet members telephoned several more uncommitted lawmakers.
"We can try to move China in the right direction, and gain the benefits, or we can push China in the wrong direction and pay the price," Mr. Clinton said today in a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert.
Scores of union workers, environmental activists and human rights advocates, who attacked China as a Communist regime that flouts Western labor and environmental standards, rallied on the steps of the Capitol to oppose rewarding Beijing with a trade plum.
Many held placards reading, "No Blank Check for China," and "880,000 Jobs to China -- Could Yours be Next?" Harry Wu, a prominent human rights advocate and opponent of the measure, drew huge cheers when he declared to the crowd, "Vote your conscience, not just for profit."
But the White House and its backers were pulling out all the stops. In a move timed in part to sway a handful of Hispanic and black lawmakers, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert announced a set of tax breaks and public investments aimed at helping distressed rural and urban areas.
At least three previously uncommitted Democrats, Ruben Hinojosa of Texas, Sheila Jackson-Lee of Texas and Gregory W. Meeks of New York, said the tax breaks made it easier for them to announce their support today.
White House officials were locked in discussion with a number of Democrats over deals that have little to do with the vote on China trade.
Though administration officials insist the pork-barrel politics are far less intense than during a close vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement six years ago, the vote has prompted perhaps a dozen members to take up unrelated matters with the president and the House leadership, although most insisted that the requests were not quid pro quos.
The Texas delegation has been especially active. One big victor appears to be Representative Martin Frost. Mr. Frost, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, had been pressing the administration for help in avoiding the closure of a Northrop Grumman Corp. defense plant in Grand Prairie, Tex. The plant is the single largest employer in Mr. Frost's district.
Mr. Frost declared that he would vote yes today after Northrop Grumman indicated to its own employees that it would remain in Grand Prairie. The company said it had received assurances from the Navy that it would receive sufficient business to justify keeping the plant open, an aide to Mr. Frost said.
Two other members of the Texas delegation also tipped their hands after negotiating unrelated local-district matters with the White House. Representatives Silvestre Reyes and Solomon P. Ortiz had been pressing the administration to help arrange a waiver from Environmental Protection Agency regulations to allow the construction of a gas pipeline in western Texas.
Congressional aides said both members declared that they would vote yes after receiving signals from the administration that the matter would be dealt with shortly. The aides said the White House did not make a firm commitment that the waiver would be granted, however.
Representative Robert E. Cramer of Alabama, another Democrat, said he would favor the bill after he held discussions with Commerce Secretary William M. Daley over the fate of a National Weather Service monitoring station in Huntsville. The weather service, which is part of the Commerce Department, had indicated that it planned to close the weather tower. Mr. Cramer had been protesting the planned closure because his district often has tornadoes and relies on the weather stations for early warnings.
An aide to Mr. Cramer said today that Mr. Daley had promised to decide the fate of the weather tower shortly and that Mr. Cramer was satisfied it would be dealt with properly. But the aide said Mr. Cramer had not received a firm commitment to keep the tower operational.
Administration officials said that as the vote approached, they had the support of 68 Democrats in the House, just shy of the baseline goal of 70 they had targeted months ago. Republican vote counters said tonight that they had 148 firm yes votes, two short of their target, and were still hoping to recruit as many as eight more Republicans still undecided.
"One fear I have is that people will say, 'They have all the votes they need,' and could cause it to go down," said Representative David Dreier of California, a Republican vote counter who favors the measure.
But opponents claimed that the race was effectively even. One opposition vote counter said that the administration and the opposition could each count on 210 votes. That meant that the White House needed at least eight more supporters to assure passage.
The Democrats who declared that they would vote yes included six from the Texas delegation: Representatives Reyes, Ortiz, Frost, Jackson-Lee, Hinojosa and Jim Turner.
Others who said today they would vote yes were Allen Boyd of Florida and Mike Thompson of California.
White House officials said that they might pick up several more votes, but that pressure was now on the Republican caucus to achieve at least 148 supporters.
A surprisingly large number of Republicans remained officially undecided, and opponents claimed five successes in recruiting no votes in the caucus: J. D. Hayworth of Arizona, Howard Coble of North Carolina, Lamar Smith of Texas, Michael A. Collins of Georgia and Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania.
Many of the Republicans who said they would vote no said they would do so because they felt that it was not in the national security interest of the United States to grant China higher trade status. Mr. Smith and Mr. Collins had been expected by many vote counters to vote in favor.
John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said today that he was focusing much of his lobbying effort in the final hours on the undecided Republicans.
"I am meeting with a number of conservative Republicans that we haven't worked together with on many issues in the past," Mr. Sweeney said. "We hope to convince them to vote the right way."

HEADLINE: United Plans to Buy US Airways, Creating Giant in the Northeast

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN and DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The world's largest airline, United, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the biggest carrier in the Northeast, US Airways, for $4.3 billion in cash, which would create a carrier with by far the largest share of passengers from Boston to New York to Washington.
If the acquisition is approved by shareholders and government regulators, United will carry almost 500,000 passengers a day, have hubs in nine American cities from Philadelphia to San Francisco and employ 145,000 people. The acquisition represents the first merger of two large American airlines since a wave of consolidation in the 1980's, and analysts said United's new strength would force other airlines to consider deals as well. 
 The UAL Corporation, the parent of United, said the combination would allow millions of travelers in the Northeast -- long the company's weak spot in the United States -- to tap into its vast network of flights to the Midwest and West Coast and, on partner airlines, to Europe and Asia. The company also pledged not to raise fares on some domestic routes for at least two years except for price increases needed to cover inflation and higher fuel costs.
In addition, UAL said it intended to shed many of US Airways' routes at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington and sell them to Robert L. Johnson, a member of the US Airways board and the founder of Black Entertainment Television. Mr. Johnson plans to operate a new airline with those planes, employees and routes. But it will not include US Airways' lucrative shuttle service between Washington, New York and Boston, which United would continue to operate.
The step is intended to satisfy regulators who might become concerned about market concentration in the Washington area, where United is the largest carrier at Washington Dulles International Airport and US Airways is in a similar position at Reagan Airport.
Even after selling some routes to Mr. Johnson, United would dominate many markets in the East, from Charlotte, N.C. -- where US Airways has a hub -- to Boston. At Dulles, one of the nation's fastest-growing airports, United would fly about 62 percent of all passengers, according to 1999 airline traffic data published by Aviation Daily, an industry newsletter. At La Guardia Airport, United would jump over Delta to become the largest carrier with a 32 percent market share. In Baltimore, it would surpass Southwest and fly more than a third of travelers.
United agreed to pay $60 a share for US Airways, a rich premium over the $25.9375 that the stock closed at yesterday. United is also taking on $7.3 billion in US Airways debt. United will not lay off any of its new employees, the company said, and will instead profit from the deal by winning more of the coast-to-coast and overseas business of the passengers who now fly US Airways. United has long hoped to gain a better foothold in the East, the busiest region in the United States.
The combined company will be run by UAL's chief executive, James E. Goodwin, a career United employee who unexpectedly won the top job last year in large part because of the unions' support for him. Mr. Goodwin, 55, joined United as an accountant in 1967 and has since overseen many of its divisions.
The merger would complete a flirtation that continued on and off in the mid-1990's. The chairman of US Airways, Stephen M. Wolf, and its chief executive, Rakesh Gangwal, are both former United executives.
United backed away from a deal in 1995 after its powerful pilots' union expressed concerns about combining seniority lists.
Executives involved in the negotiations said objections from UAL's pilots might prove difficult again.
The pilots' union, which is represented on UAL's board, is likely to announce today that it opposes the transaction.
"The pilots will not be fully on board," one executive said. "Integration of seniority lists is a particularly difficult issue for the unions, and the issue exists now, as it did in 1995."
UAL employees, which own 55 percent of the company, have three representatives on its board, two of whom are representatives from the pilots' and machinists' unions. According to the corporate bylaws, approval of this sort of transaction is required from at least one of the two union representatives.
US Airways, the sixth-largest airline in the United States, has struggled in recent years even as the industry has enjoyed its most profitable years ever. With maintenance, labor and computer-related difficulties, the carrier has reported three consecutive quarterly losses. Airline analysts expect it to return to profitability this year.
Since January 1999, its stock has fallen to its current level from $62.25, leaving the company vulnerable to a takeover.
As a hodgepodge of the original airline and a group of companies it acquired in the 1980's, including Allegheny Airlines and Piedmont Airlines, US Airways suffers from high costs that come with different fleets and complicated work rules, said Glenn D. Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
US Airways also flies relatively short routes in the crowded Eastern corridor, where flights are often late and planes spend more time waiting on runways than they do elsewhere in the country. And in recent years it began to face more competition from Southwest Airlines, the profitable low-cost carrier that has started flying out of Baltimore, Providence, R.I., and other Northeast cities, driving down many fares.
United now faces the difficult task of merging US Airways' fleet and its 45,000-person work force with its own while it is in the midst of increasingly contentious labor talks with its pilots' and machinists' unions. In 1995, United became the nation's largest company in which the employees owned a majority stake after the pilots and machinists agreed to concessions in exchange for stock. That agreement expires this year, and US Airways employees are not expected to receive shares as part of the merger
Wall Street analysts said they expected both investors and regulators to approve it. Other deals could then follow, the analysts said.
"The moral to the story is that the dance commences," said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "This is the beginning of consolidation in the United States and around the world. It won't stop here."
The airline industry has enjoyed some of its healthiest profits the last three years after executives, smarting from a glut of capacity that helped cause billions of dollars worth of losses in the last recession, cut back on their purchase of new planes. Over the last year, however, capacity growth has increased again, and many unions have negotiated raises for the first time since the industry's troubles in the mid-1990's. Profits and stock prices have declined as a result.
The biggest American airlines have already paired up in alliances over the last three years, agreeing to combine their frequent-flier programs and, in the case of Continental and Northwest, sell seats on each others' flights. Northwest owns a stake in Continental.
The rationale behind the agreements is similar to United's interest in US Airways: the carriers want to be able to feed passengers from anywhere on to their more lucrative, long-haul flights.
The merger would effectively end the frequent-flier partnership between US Airways and American Airlines. It also calls into question United's and Delta's frequent-flier alliance, which United signed largely to gain access to Delta's many passengers on the East Coast. If the US Airways acquisition becomes final, United and Delta will become much more direct rivals.
A representative of the merging companies offered news of the merger yesterday to The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, on the condition that reporters not post it on the Internet until after midnight or speak to outsiders about the pending deal.
Early yesterday evening, The Financial Times of London reported the merger on its Web site, citing people in Chicago, where United is based. That story quickly led to television and news service reports.

HEADLINE: Moment of Decision: The Vote on China Trade

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Labor and the China Vote" (editorial, May 21) concedes that "some American workers will doubtless be hurt by foreign competition." You argue that American labor should make this sacrifice to help unleash the "forces of economic globalization" that supposedly offer great benefits to workers in China. 
 How would you explain these benefits to workers in Guangdong Province, who make handbags for Wal-Mart 12 to 14 hours a day, seven days a week? According to a recent study by the National Labor Committee, a human rights group, nearly half of these workers actually owed their employer money after several months of labor, because of deductions for food, housing, work permits and other items.
Linking China's trade status to the annual review of its human rights performance remains the best tool available for creating positive change in China.

HEADLINE: Moment of Decision: The Vote on China Trade

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alan Tonelson ("China's Mythic Market," Op-Ed, May 18) is right to decry the portrayals of trade partners and business objectives in the Chinese trade debate as inaccurate. But it doesn't necessarily follow that "trade agreements cannot bring widespread benefits to the United States." Framing the debate too narrowly around Chinese consumers obscures the real sources of value creation in today's economy. 
 Most of the future global opportunity is in e-business, and business-to-business transactions are assumed to account for 95 percent of that revenue, estimated at nearly $7 trillion annually by 2004. Competitive companies create this value by uniting customers and suppliers with their brand. Countries like China can help supply these companies with manufacturing, freeing the brand owner to focus capital on invention, innovation and customer satisfaction. The consumer element is but a small fraction of the whole.

 On May 14, President Jiang gave a speech calling for the Communist Party to play a more powerful role in China's private sector. Mr. Jiang specifically called for the creation of party cells inside private companies.
Despite all the talk of reform in China, between 1997 and 1999 state-owned companies increased their share of China's economic output from 44 percent to 50 percent.

HEADLINE: Florio's Style, Like Tax Rise, Remains Issue in Senate Race

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 23

 BODY:
For all the countless, impassioned speeches Jim Florio has delivered in his quest for the Democratic nomination for New Jersey's United States Senate seat, the most telling two words in his campaign are the ones Mr. Florio has refused to utter: "I'm sorry."
Both admirers and critics say it is hardly surprising that Mr. Florio is standing by the single act that has most defined his political career: the $2.8 billion tax increase he pushed through the State Legislature two months after becoming governor. 
 The tax rise, enacted in 1990, set off a tirade by angry voters.
Democrats were swept from offices across the state and lost control of both houses of the Legislature. United States Senator Bill Bradley, who had nothing to do with the plan, was nearly toppled simply because he hesitated for months before disavowing Mr. Florio's tax package. In 1993, Mr. Florio was cast into exile by a thin margin, becoming the only governor in New Jersey's modern history to be denied a second term.
The tax increase also defines the crucial question about Mr. Florio's record as governor. Was he a principled leader willing to take unpopular stands for worthy causes or an arrogant blunderer whose tin ear left him out of touch with the state he now wants to represent in the Senate?
In his campaign against Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs, leading up to the June 6 Democratic primary, Mr. Florio has gone beyond merely defending his decision to raise taxes.
Conceding only that he should have better explained to voters that a court-ordered increase in school financing made the tax increase necessary, Mr. Florio defiantly describes it as a courageous action to protect the core values of the Democratic Party.
"It's fine for Republicans to walk away from a commitment to finance education for all of our children, to comply with a court order that said there's something wrong with a child getting the quality of education that depends upon the accident of what town they live in," Mr. Florio said. "Those kind of know-nothing views about not standing up for our children don't belong in our party. They belong in the other party."
A former Navy boxer from Camden County who has spent almost all his working life in politics and has practiced law since leaving office, Mr. Florio, 62, has been emphasizing health care, Social Security and education in his campaign, while dismissing Mr. Corzine as a rich neophyte trying to buy his way into the Senate.
Mr. Florio was leading in the polls earlier this year, but that lead has shifted in the last month, as the better-financed Mr. Corzine has begun running television ads reminding voters of Mr. Florio's tax increase.
Beyond its disastrous political fallout, the tax increase raises two critical questions about Mr. Florio: Was it smart policy and what kind of governor was he anyway?
By casting the tax increase as a matter of principle, Mr. Florio hopes to remind voters of his record of activism as governor and congressman.
Those same principles, Mr. Florio says, spurred him to take on the National Rifle Association by passing the nation's first, and strongest, assault weapons ban. Mr. Florio also defeated an attempt by Republican legislators to overturn the ban, and was later granted the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award for his efforts.
As governor, Mr. Florio tightened New Jersey's environmental laws, curbing the ocean dumping that had dirtied the state's beaches and created an office of environmental prosecutor to go after polluters.
Before suburban sprawl became a major statewide issue, Mr. Florio used the governor's office to restrict development, by signing an executive order requiring that all new construction had to conform with the state development plan.
Mr. Florio also riled the auto insurance companies by eliminating the $220 surcharge state drivers paid for the risk pool to cover bad drivers, and forcing the companies to assume more of that cost.
Executives at Allstate Insurance were so upset by that move, and at Mr. Florio's other policies, that the company threatened to pull out of the New Jersey market. Mr. Florio responded by saying that Allstate was trying to frighten the state into granting the company a huge rate increase, and insisted that if it wanted to pull out of auto insurance in New Jersey, it would be required to pull out of all insurance in New Jersey. Allstate backed down.
"Jim Florio wasn't always effective at communicating with the public," said Carl Van Horn, who was Mr. Florio's chief public policy adviser. "But he was a problem solver, someone who wasn't afraid to tackle big issues, even if that meant making powerful enemies."
But the paradox of Jim Florio is that his style of leadership has often angered the very people he proposed to help. Even supporters say his single-mindedness and self-assurance can make him seem like the political world's version of castor oil -- his policies may be good for you, but they sure leave a bitter taste.
Members of the state's powerful teachers' union, who should have been pleased by Governor Florio's increase in school financing, accused him of weakening their pension system by shifting the obligation for employer contributions from the state to the local districts. His overhaul of the state's welfare system helped shrink the size of the state's dole, but also angered many Democrats because it froze benefits for recipients who became pregnant while on public assistance.
Other state employees also have disturbing memories of Mr. Florio's term as governor. At a recent A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Atlantic City, Mr. Florio reminded labor leaders of his efforts in Congress to promote workers' rights and the many picket lines he had walked with them. He singled out more than a dozen union officials in the room by name. But members of the Communications Workers of America, which represents state employees, still remember Mr. Florio's trying to back out of a contract they had agreed to in 1991.
To make matters worse, when Mr. Florio met with the union's political action committee this year, seeking an endorsement for his Senate run, Mr. Florio was anything but contrite, labor leaders say.
"He should have just come to us and said, 'Look, I know we've had our problems, but I'm a good labor guy, so let's get on with the future,' " said Jim Marketti, president of C.W.A. Local 1032. "But instead, he was all defensive, and trying to rewrite history. So a lot of what he said just seemed to ring hollow to our members."
The union did not endorse either candidate in the primary.
Even before the fallout from the tax increase, some of Mr. Florio's harshest critics were other New Jersey Democrats.
When Mr. Florio took office as governor, his advisers persuaded him to push for the tax increase early, so voters would have time to forget before re-election time rolled around. Some Democrats, both in New Jersey and outside the state, agreed with the wisdom of his move. The Star-Ledger compared the ambitious agenda of Mr. Florio's first 100 days in office to Franklin D. Roosevelt's. Mario M. Cuomo, who was then governor of New York, praised Mr. Florio's courage and said in June 1990 that he should be considered presidential material.
But all around New Jersey, Democratic legislators, county freeholders and city council members began hearing complaints that Mr. Florio's actions were arrogant, that he broke a pledge not to raise taxes and that he was pushing ahead without convincing the public that a tax increase was unavoidable.
In the end, voter anger, fueled by talk radio and hostile groups like the N.R.A., were too much. In 1993, he lost to Christine Todd Whitman by 26,000 votes, one of the slimmest margins in state history. Republicans in the Legislature declined a challenge to simply repeal the Florio taxes, but Mrs. Whitman later made good on her pledge to cut income-tax rates by 30 percent.
Despite the loss, some political analysts say his record as governor was commendable.
"There's only one worst recession since the Great Depression and he had the bad fortune to assume office just when its effects were being felt," said James Hughes, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. "He didn't have much choice but to increase taxes, and once he did, he lost the Legislature and had to be creative in order to carry out any agenda."
Others, including Mr. Corzine, assert that Mr. Florio worsened the state's economic pain by raising too many taxes too high too fast.
Many economists agree that Mr. Florio's policies made New Jersey a difficult and expensive place to conduct business. Irwin Kellner, an economist for Chase Manhattan and Manufacturer's Hanover Banks during Mr. Florio's term, said he recalled New Jersey business owners' complaining that they were overtaxed and overburdened by environmental and labor regulations.
"Even during a recession, communities compete against each other," said Mr. Kellner, now a professor of economics at Hofstra University. "The tax increases made things in New Jersey worse than neighboring states, and businesses stayed away."
Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of Virginia, whose 1980 book, "Goodbye to Good-Time Charlie," was a study of governors who lost re-election bids, said Mr. Florio was largely a product of his times. The two New Jersey governors who preceded Mr. Florio also broke their campaign promises not to raise taxes, but still won re-election. By 1993 however, the recession and the political partisanship of Washington left voters in a far less forgiving mood, Mr. Sabato said.
"He was actually quite successful with the Legislature and he achieved a great deal as governor on the environment and gun control and education," Mr. Sabato said. "But in a sense, he achieved too much. You can't achieve more than the public wants and expect to be re-elected. He tried to do so much, and it cost so much, that taxpayers said, 'Bye-bye, Jim.' "
Given the lingering resentment over the tax increase, many Democrats say that Mr. Florio's attempt to win political redemption without ever repenting shows that what was wrong with Mr. Florio as governor is what is wrong with Mr. Florio as Senate candidate.
"He's a good person, but he's so intense," said Anthony Impreveduto, a Democratic legislator who voted for Mr. Florio's tax increase in 1990 and now supports Mr. Corzine. "He's the kind of person who, if you see him at a dinner party and make small talk about your summer vacation, he wants to talk about ocean dumping."
To some, Mr. Florio's career is a lesson in how smart politics and smart policy are inseparable -- to the point that it is impossible to credit him for one without the other.
Thomas H. Kean, the governor who preceded Mr. Florio, said he, too, was forced to raise taxes when he assumed office and found an unexpected budget deficit.
But Mr. Kean said he held extensive public hearings to prepare voters for the unpleasant news, and when the bill passed, with bipartisan support, he signed it while literally holding his nose.
"I didn't smile and hold up the bill when I signed it, and I didn't push it through the Legislature without bipartisan support," said Mr. Kean, a Republican. "Jim Florio should be proud of the assault weapons ban. But his inexperience in his first year in office, and the failures it caused, made it a pretty difficult term the rest of the way."
So, given the lingering bitterness, why not apologize now?
Mr. Sabato suspects that the tax increase is such an integral part of Mr. Florio's legacy that he is wary of distancing himself from the issue.
"He can live with the political failure of losing re-election," Mr. Sabato said. "A lot of people have been crucified for doing what they think was the right thing. But if he backs away from the tax increase in any way, then history might view him as a policy failure as well, and that would take away from his reason for political being."
Mr. Florio is not nearly as philosophical in describing his motives.
"The idea of, sort of, apologizing for funding kids' education is something I'm not comfortable with," Mr. Florio said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 2000, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Wednesday about Jim Florio's record as governor of New Jersey referred incorrectly to the rarity of a defeat like the one he suffered in 1993. Mr. Florio was the second governor in the state's modern history, not the first, to lose a bid for a second term. Gov. William T. Cahill lost the 1973 Republican primary to Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr.

I am more familiar with the sort of situation in which eight small and medium-size children who are pretending to be pirates routinely pile onto a hammock, rock it vigorously to simulate high seas and dangle 16 legs through the mesh to taunt imaginary sharks.
One cannot really expect miracles from a natural cotton rope structure supported by two spreader bars and zinc-plated hanging hardware. Even the sturdy old oaks that suspend the "ship" are in peril. 
 So almost every year, I buy a new hammock, and it's always the same model (since there's nothing wrong with the product that pirate-proofing wouldn't fix): the "original Pawleys Island rope hammock," made in North Carolina and distributed nationwide. According to the manufacturer's Web site, Pawleys.com, it comes in three sizes. I buy the middle size, which can hold two adults or 450 pounds or as many as eight bloodthirsty buccaneers.
The last hammock, if I recall correctly, came from a mail-order catalog. I paid about $100 for it, plus shipping, which set me back an additional $10 or so.
"Plus shipping." In the months since buying the hammock, I have come to realize that "plus shipping" is one of the ugliest phrases in the English language. Thanks to the multitude of online retailers who offered free shipping during last winter's holiday shopping season, I have been conditioned to believe that I am entitled to this perk forever.
A lot of online shoppers share my expectations, it turns out. Last week, Forrester Research reported that 94 percent of online shoppers were concerned about shipping costs and that 44 percent had abandoned an online shopping cart after they found out how much the shipping costs would add to the total. These are, mind you, the same shoppers who for years accepted mail-order catalogs' shipping charges, which often add up to 15 percent to the cost of a purchase.
"Consumers have different expectations when they shop online, not only because the retail sites raised their expectations during the Christmas season, but also because shoppers see that they are giving the sites something in return, information about themselves," said Susy Chan, director of the e-commerce technology program at DePaul University in Chicago.
Now that she mentioned it, I did resent typing in all kinds of valuable personal information -- name, address, phone number, name of street where I grew up in case I forgot my password and needed a prompt every time I bought something online. Beyond the privacy concerns, these questions are annoyingly time-consuming. I should be compensated.
So last week, I started my search for a hammock at a site called freeshipping.com (www.freeshipping
.com), which has a search engine to point shoppers toward about a million products that the site's 125 retail partners are willing to sell without charging shipping and handling fees. Freeshipping.com's partners -- who include both well-known retailers like Cooking.com and smaller specialty retailers like Kideo.com, which sells personalized children's videos -- pay freeshipping.com a commission for sales referrals.
Freeshipping.com's founder, D. J. Vallauri, got the idea for creating the site after starting another Web site called Mustardstore.com (which he eventually sold). "I kept getting feedback from people who wanted to order a bottle of mustard that cost a few dollars and were complaining that the shipping cost a fortune," Mr. Vallauri said. "They were right."
The selection at freeshipping.com -- 10 categories, including apparel and office supplies -- is more quirky than comprehensive. "I just want people to think of this site as a first stop when they shop to see if someone is willing to sell whatever you want to buy without charging you for shipping," Mr. Vallauri said.
After I did a search for "hammock" on the home page, the site returned matches in three product categories. Although the search results were displayed in a confusing way -- many matches, were redundant, for instance -- I quickly found the model I wanted, at Ezshop.com for $95.70.
When I clicked on Buy Now, freeshipping.com sent me directly to Ezshop.com's Web site. But after I arrived, I hesitated because Ezshop.com said the item "usually ships within 14 business days." That seemed like a long time. More important, I was shopping in an unfamiliar store. The home page said Ezshop.com was located in Dallas, and it listed a phone number -- unfortunately not toll-free -- that I could call for customer service. When I phoned anyway, no one answered.
That made me uneasy. So I did some quick comparison shopping. Using search engines, I found the same model at higher prices and with shipping costs that ranged from $8.95 to $14.95 at several other online shops. One, Smith & Hawken (www.smithandhawken.com), was a store I know well. But there I would have to pay nearly 40 percent more; even on sale, the hammock would cost $133.95, including shipping and handling. On the other hand, the Smith & Hawken hammock would arrive much sooner: in 7 to 10 business days.
Was it worth it to pay extra for security? In this sort of situation, many experienced online shoppers will choose the brand name they trust, said Ms. Chan, of DePaul University. "Convenience, the time spent and knowing that the item will arrive when it is expected are more important than just getting a short-term benefit like free shipping," she said.
But brand names do not mean that much to me, not when the items offered by two retailers are identical. The only perk that I can think of that is more valuable than saving money would be something along the lines of guaranteed baby-sitting on a Saturday night. Any online retailer who offered that would earn my loyalty. Friday night would be good, too.
In the absence of such luxuries, I sent e-mail to ask Ezshop why shipping took so long and why the phone wasn't answered. Within two hours, Ezshop responded: "We seem to have had some trouble with our phones earlier today. They are now working and we would be happy to help you via phone. In regards to shipping, all items ship directly from the manufacturer, and this particular manufacturer needs this long to ship orders. Although they tend to ship much faster, normally in five business days."
I ordered the hammock from Ezshop. I hope it arrives when it's supposed to. Or else, I have been told, I may walk the plank.

Europe Refuses to Drop Ban on Hormone-Fed U.S. Beef

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 24

 BODY:
The European Union decided today to extend its ban on beef produced with growth hormones, rejecting demands by the United States and the World Trade Organization to drop the prohibition.
The decision reignites an ideologically charged battle between American cattle ranchers, most of whom use hormones to accelerate beef production, and European consumers, who generally distrust food additives. 
 Nearly three years ago, the World Trade Organization ruled that that European prohibition was illegal because it was not based on scientific evidence that hormones endanger human health.
Today, European officials in Brussels released what they described as a new review of scientific studies that concluded that one popular hormone causes cancer and that others are "likely" to pose increased health risks.
Armed with the new opinion, European trade and health officials said they would extend the ban on hormone-treated beef.
"We believe this proposal will bring us into line with the W.T.O.'s findings, and definitively resolve this dispute," said Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the European Commission's trade ministry.
American officials, who were still scrutinizing the new pronouncements today, said they were not impressed.
"We were of the view from the beginning that they didn't have the science to back them up, and we don't see any new science now," one official in Brussels said today.
The United States is currently imposing punitive tariffs of $117 million a year, an amount that the World Trade Organization says is equal to the lost American beef exports, on European products ranging from Danish ham to Italian tomatoes.
In an effort to intensify the pressure, President Clinton recently signed legislation that requires American trade officials to rotate the penalties to different industries every six months.
But there is little likelihood that the two sides will reach an accord anytime soon, in part because many Europeans have a deep mistrust of anything that smacks of genetically modified food.
Just last week, farmers from Scandinavia to Britain and Italy found themselves in the middle of a political uproar after a company admitted that it had accidentally mixed a small percentage of genetically modified rapeseed from Canada into seed shipments sold across Europe.
Genetically modified crops are common in the United States and Canada and only about 0.4 percent of the seeds mixed into the shipments that arrived in Europe appeared to have been genetically modified. Nevertheless, the slip infuriated officials in several countries and Swedish farm regulators went so far as to order farmers to destroy the questionable seeds.
The battle over beef hormones could easily become an important test case in future trade disputes based on real or perceived health risks.
Under international trade agreements, countries are only allowed to impose trade restrictions based on health concerns if those concerns are backed by scientific evidence.
American trade officials, echoing the views of American cattle farmers, have argued that there is no evidence that beef produced with hormones poses special health problems.
Among other things, they argue that growth hormones are naturally present in beef and other foods and that two pounds of hormone-treated beef have about the same amount of growth hormone as that in an ordinary egg.
European officials, prodded by persistent anxiety among consumers, have argued that there are many reasons to be worried. After protracted hearings at the World Trade Organization, the organization ruled that European officials had not made their case and deemed the ban illegal in 1997.
Today's report, from a scientific committee organized by the European Union, said there was evidence that high doses of the hormone 17 beta oestriadol had carcinogenic effects and that five other hormones might affect the development of sexual organs.
Under the legislation proposed today, the European Union would impose a permanent ban on beta oestriadol and "provisional" bans on the other five, pending the outcome of future studies.
The scientific committee acknowledged that the evidence of health risks was based on exposure to very high doses of hormones. But in a tortuous use of double negatives, it warned that there was "no compelling evidence suggesting that these effects do not also occur at low doses."
It said that continuous exposure to low doses of hormones was likely to add to long-term health risks, but said this risk "as yet, cannot be quantified."
Unlike many other trade disputes, the battle over beef hormones has little or nothing to do with protecting local producers. A recent poll, commissioned by the European Commission, found that two-thirds of 16,000 people queried said they preferred hormone-free food.
"These cases have a lot to do with ideology," said Stefan Tangermann, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Gottingen in Germany. "The real problem is that European consumers are deeply concerned about these issues, and the public expects politicians to protect their interests."

Big Japan Contractor Asks Banks to Forgive Billions in Debts

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 24

 BODY:
For the second time in just a few weeks, a large Japanese company appealed to its banks today to forgive billions of dollars in debts, intensifying pressure on Japan's stressed financial system.
The decision by the Hazama Corporation, a general contractor, to request 400 billion yen, or $3.7 billion at current exchange rates, worth of debt forgiveness is yet another sign that the bad-loan problems of Japanese banks are far from over. 
 On April 26, Sogo, a faltering Japanese retail company, astonished its bankers by asking them to write off 639 billion yen, or roughly $6 billion, in debts. That was the largest amount of debt forgiveness ever sought in Japan, where the practice is far from standard.
The shock of Sogo's request was magnified a few days later when the senior executive in charge of the retailer's restructuring plans was found dead in his home, apparently having committed suicide.
On Tuesday, the company's lenders postponed a decision on the request for debt forgiveness, although its largest lender, the Industrial Bank of Japan, has said it is willing to do so.
Sogo's outstanding debts to the Industrial Bank -- 180 billion yen, or $1.7 billion -- are roughly equivalent to a year's worth of operating profit, according to James P. Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at ING Barings here. Nor does the bank have sizable unrealized gains on its securities portfolio to offset such a write-off.
"The question of whether to forgive these debts or not is a big one," Mr. Fiorillo said.
Hazama's largest lender, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, is apparently willing to waive 90 billion yen of the construction company's loans, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily.
Changes in accounting standards are intensifying the pressure on troubled companies. In the fiscal year that began on April 1, they must value their real estate and securities holdings at market levels. The new rules also strictly limit their ability to hide their debts in the accounts of affiliates, requiring that they report their financial results on a consolidated basis.
Including Hazawa and Sogo, more than 10 large companies have asked for debt relief this year. The greatest number seeking such forgiveness have come from the construction industry, and analysts warn that many more contractors are in similarly weak shape.
Like Hazama, they took on loads of debt to finance real estate purchases in the 1980's, only to watch the value of that real estate plummet when Japan's economic bubble burst.
But whether debt forgiveness will in fact help such ailing companies regain their footing is a matter of much debate here. Unlike in the United States, where creditors of distressed companies can force radical changes on businesses in exchange for debt relief, Japanese creditors have very little power to do that.
"It would be much better if these companies went bankrupt," said Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist here. "Debt forgiveness is only going to prolong their problems."

Work visas are allowing Washington to sidestep immigration reform.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger; This column appears here every Thursday. Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. Four economic analysts -- Professor Krueger, J. Bradford DeLong, Jeff Madrick and Virginia Postrel -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
THE inscription on the Statue of Liberty is quietly being rewritten: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free; I'll also take your skilled employees under the temporary visa program, H-1B."
The H-1B visa was established in 1990 to permit foreigners with a college degree or higher to work in the United States for a renewable three-year term for employers who petition on their behalf. In 1998, the program was expanded to allow 115,000 workers, up from 65,000, to enter the United States in fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Demand for H-1B visas by employers is high, particularly among high-technology companies. This year the limit was reached just six months into the year. President Clinton and many members of Congress would like to increase the limit to 200,000 a year the next three years. 
 The expansion of temporary work visas should be evaluated in the context of overall immigration policy. But immigration reform, replacing Social Security, has become the new third rail of American politics. So instead of tackling the issue head on, Washington has come to rely on temporary work visas as a substitute for addressing the economic and social shortcomings of current policy.
The United States is in the midst of the "Second Great Migration." The first occurred between 1880 and 1924, when 26 million immigrants arrived on our shores. The second began in the late 1970's: more immigrants have come to the United States since 1980 than in the previous 60 years.
Workers admitted under the H-1B program are not immigrants, but experts in the field expect that most of them will end up staying permanently in the United States.
In addition to workers with H-1B visas, hundreds of thousands of other foreigners are admitted to work temporarily in the United States under visa categories covering intracompany transfers, individuals with extraordinary ability, registered nurses and nonprofit religious organizations. A fast-growing category is the Nafta TN visa, which offers an unlimited number of temporary visas for professional workers from Canada and soon Mexico.
In a new book, "Heaven's Door," George Borjas, a Harvard economist, proposes that the United States adopt a Canadian-style point system, in which applicants for visas are assigned points on the basis of characteristics like their ability to speak English, work-force skills, family ties, refugee status and ethnic diversity. Those whose total points exceed a certain threshold would be admitted. Going even further, Professor Borjas favors setting the threshold so that the number of immigrants entering the United States falls from about 900,000 to about 500,000 a year. The total number can be debated. If nothing else, this policy would be transparent.
Who should become an American? The question is profound, involving more than economics alone. But economic considerations obviously play a role.
Theoretically, the economics of immigration is straightforward. If more workers are admitted to the country -- as permanent immigrants or temporary workers -- the earnings of native American workers competing with them for jobs should fall. At the same time, the price of goods and services they produce should decline, and the profits of businesses should rise.
The winners are employers, consumers and the immigrants themselves. The losers are workers in the same job market as immigrants.
Economic research has not been able to estimate with any confidence the wage decline for native workers that results from immigration. Much solid research finds no effect. This suggests to me that any effect is likely to be small.
Professor Borjas's evidence indicates that the skills of legal and illegal immigrants have slipped relative to those of natives since the 1970's. A third of employed male immigrants are high school dropouts. At the same time, the labor market increasingly demands more high-skilled workers, as suggested by the long-term rise in the number of workers with college degrees and their sharply increased pay compared with that of those with high school degrees. Therefore, it would be economically beneficial to admit relatively more highly skilled permanent immigrants -- not to mention that skilled immigrants are less likely to take advantage of the safety net.
If immigration reform is off the table, it makes economic sense to increase the number of skilled immigrants by issuing H-1B visas -- through what might be called heaven's backdoor. Yet economic principles also suggest that the playing field between H-1B workers and the rest of the work force should be leveled.
American workers are protected from exploitation on the job by three defenses: exit, voice and regulation. Exit entails the ability to move to a better job if one is available; voice results from representation by labor unions and other organizations; and regulation is a labyrinth of standards enforced by government agencies.
These protections are deficient for H-1B workers.
They cannot easily switch jobs because they must find another employer willing to petition the Immigration and Naturalization Service on their behalf. Even if they manage to do that, they must wait months for a reply. H-1B workers are also unusually beholden to their employers, the ones who can sponsor them for permanent immigrant status.
They lack voice because no organization effectively represents them.
And they have less regulatory protection than other workers because the Labor Department is precluded from investigating their conditions of employment unless a complaint is filed.
Evidence suggests H-1B visa holders suffer as a consequence. Even though 70 percent of them are in well-paid computer-related and engineering fields, a 1996 report by the Labor Department's inspector general found that 19 percent of H-1B workers are paid less than the salary they were promised.
Legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas should provide protection from exploitation. This also would help native workers and improve economic efficiency.
What could be done? Permit H-1B workers to change jobs freely after they are admitted to the country. Authorize the Labor Department to conduct random investigations of their employment conditions. Finally, require the immigration service to process applications for permanent, employment-based immigration more quickly, which would reduce the need for H-1B visas in the first place.

Note: Immigrant figures for 1989-92 are adjusted for the influx of resident immigrants granted amnesty and for 1997-98 to account for a backlog at the I.N.S. H-1B visas in 1999 exceeded the federal cap because I.N.S. inadvertently issued at least 21,888 extra.

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE VOTE: THE LOBBYISTS;
With Smiles and Cell Phones, a Last-Minute Assault on the Undecided

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
By this morning it was quite clear that the China trade bill would pass, but no one on either side was taking chances.
From a stuffy conference room in the basement of the Capitol, about 50 business lobbyists were dispatched, cell phones in hand, in a final effort to nail down the votes of the dozen or so lawmakers who were still thought to be undecided. 
 A lobbyist for Procter & Gamble, for instance, was sent to see Representative Ernie Fletcher, a Republican from Kentucky. The company makes Jif peanut butter in Mr. Fletcher's district and employs 239 workers.
An official from United Parcel Service went to see Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia. U.P.S. has a hub in Newport News in Mr. Scott's district.
Representative Van Hilleary, Republican of Tennessee, had his arm twisted by a lobbyist from TRW, which has about 500 workers at an automotive plant in Morristown in Mr. Hilleary's district.
"We can't afford to get overconfident," said Johanna Schneider of the Business Roundtable, an organization of giant corporations, who was working from the room in the basement, Room HC-8.
And despite vote counts that showed them losing, the opponents of the measure were also out in force today. Scores of union members from back home were on the phone, and at least a dozen labor officials from across the country were on Capitol Hill.
Art Pulaski, president of the California A.F.L.-C.I.O., paid a final call on Representative Henry A. Waxman, a Democrat from Los Angeles, who had not tipped his hand on how he would vote.
In the end, Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Hilleary and Mr. Waxman voted for the bill. Mr. Scott voted against it.
They, and the handful of other lawmakers who were truly undecided as the vote approached, were besieged in the last few days, and the pressure peaked this morning.
"It's like a big wave hitting the shore," said Representative Vito J. Fossella, a Republican from Staten Island, who did not let on until just before the vote that he planned to support the legislation.
He said he took a call this morning from a driver for U.P.S. whom he had met at a Boy Scout function on Staten Island last weekend. He was also called by members of the food workers union. The driver favored the trade bill; the food workers were against it.
For the first time since he entered Congress three years ago, he said, he was lobbied by rank-and-file workers in financial services companies -- at the banks and brokerage houses and insurance companies -- who live on Staten Island, or in the slice of his district that is in southwestern Brooklyn, and work in Manhattan.
"I finally decided, I don't see how voting no is in America's interest," Mr. Fossella said.
For him and the others who were undecided -- most genuinely trying to weigh the national security and economic implications of the legislation as well as the direct interests of their constituents -- all the attention was exhausting.
"I finally let people know today I needed some space to breathe," said Representative John E. Sweeney, a freshman Republican from upstate New York.
He more or less decided overnight to vote for the measure, Mr. Sweeney said, but at 3 this afternoon he still had qualms and was following the debate on television in his office, "just to make absolutely sure I'm making the right decision."
As a matter of policy, Mr. Sweeney said, he concluded that "we lose a little more than we gain if the status quo remains."
"But in the end," he said, "you always vote your district."
And his district, which includes Saratoga Springs and Glens Falls along the upper Hudson River, was divided.
He heard, he said, from the dairy farmers and the apple and pear growers and small-business owners who favored the concept of expanded trade with China. And he heard from the paper workers and other union members who feared losing their jobs.
Former President George Bush called recently. So did Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. The congressman was given a special briefing by the Central Intelligence Agency. Dennis Hughes, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in New York, visited him on Tuesday.
"I've talked to absolutely everybody," Mr. Sweeney said. "It was a very hard call." He finally voted yes.
Representative Peter Deutsch, a Democrat from southern Florida, dropped out of sight today while he pondered his decision. He took no calls and held no meetings.
"I've made myself available to everybody for weeks," Mr. Deutsch said. "Today I needed to think on my own."
He especially thought, he said, about the huge Motorola plant in his district with its 2,000 workers and its hopes of selling two-way radios in China.
"There are very few values I would put above them," he said. "But national security is one of them."
Just after lunch, about three hours before the vote, Mr. Deutsch decided to vote against the bill.

HEADLINE: AIRLINE DEAL: THE PASSENGERS;
Gains Predicted for Frequent Fliers

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
If the proposal by the UAL Corporation to buy US Airways clears government and shareholder hurdles, members of the US Airways frequent-flier program could find themselves in the unaccustomed position of winners.
Even though much of the fine print has not been made public, Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman for United Airlines, which is owned by UAL, said yesterday, "By the time this deal is consummated next year, our two airlines will be one and US Airways frequent-flier members will become United Mileage Plus members." 
 "The difference," he said, "is that US Airways members will then have the opportunity to accrue miles faster, to redeem them for more places and to earn flights with our 22 airline partners."
Among those partners are the 11 members of the Star Alliance, comprising United as well as airlines from Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Singapore and Thailand -- in short, much of the world.
The US Airways alliance with American Airlines, which includes honoring each other's frequent-flier programs, remains in force. "Until the acquisition takes place," said David Castelveter, a spokesman for US Airways, "it's business as usual."
Although United promises to freeze some domestic fares for two years after the acquisition, except for increases to pay for fuel costs and inflation, some industry experts think the deal will ultimately lead to higher prices for passengers, especially in the Northeast.
"I think the merger will be a good one," said Terry Trippler, the airline writer for 1Travel.com. "But if a lessening of competition does not result in higher prices, it will be the first time in history."
Still, even outsiders agree that US Airways' frequent-flier passengers stand to benefit by gaining access to more flights and more destinations. "Except for Southwest, US Airways is the only one of the major airlines without flights to Hawaii, which is by far the preferred destination of most frequent fliers," said Randy Peterson, the editor and publisher of Inside Flier magazine. United has daily flights to Hawaii from Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
"While US Airways' frequent-flier program has always been a competent follower," Mr. Peterson said, "it has never been a leader. Now it will be aligned with a leader."
Mr. Trippler added that United's extensive routes to Asia and the Pacific and South America will also be a big plus for US Airways frequent-flier members, as will United's many more flights to cities in Europe.
Moreover, United has far fewer flights to Florida than does US Airways, so the acquisition is likely to give passengers who participate in United's Mileage Plus program a wider choice of flights and destinations to that state.
Mr. Peterson and Mr. Trippler both pointed out, however, that frequent-flier "reward" flights to Hawaii are often very difficult to get and Florida destinations are scarce much of the year.
US Airways has hubs in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Charlotte, N.C., while United hubs are in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco and at Dulles International Airport in Washington. United has already said that it will increase flights from Pittsburgh and possibly Philadelphia and Charlotte.
Furthermore, passengers to and from Washington are likely to benefit if DC Air -- the airline start-up that is expected to be owned by BET Holdings II, the parent company of the Black Entertainment Television -- becomes a low-fare carrier. BET's owner, Robert L. Jackson, has been a member of the US Airways board since 1998. The airline, which will operate from Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, will fill the void created by United's plan to sell its slots and other operations there to satisfy regulators.

HEADLINE: An Ambitious Airline Merger

 BODY:
There is a morbid expression that no one ever got rich hauling passengers. Not the railroads. Not the buses. Not the airlines.
That is the backdrop for the proposed takeover of US Airways, the sixth-largest domestic carrier, by United Airlines, the world's largest carrier. Ordinarily, a merger that decreased competition would be worrisome. But airlines are not ordinary. Though profitable over the past couple of years during ebullient economic times, they struggle year in and year out to make a decent profit. They are plagued by chronic excess capacity and gigantic losses when the economy slips. By wringing out excess costs and creating large networks that provide lots of travel options and convenient schedules, mergers can do consumers more good than harm. Whether that is true in this case will not be known until the Justice Department completes an exhaustive review. 
 United, whose employees own a majority of the company, has many international partners and domestic routes that spread out from centrally located "hub" airports. The merger gives it more routes in lucrative eastern markets and a prized asset, the shuttle route from Boston to New York to Washington. US Airways, by contrast, lacks international heft and even full national reach. Its labor costs are high and its labor relations sour. It is racking up losses even as the rest of the industry makes record profits. For this struggling carrier, United offers a lifeline. If Justice decides that US Airways cannot survive on its own and that the merged airline will offer travelers better schedules, one-stop ticketing and more attractive frequent-flier programs, then approval will follow.
But Justice has taken an aggressive stance against airline mergers, for good reason. There are often specific airports -- in this case, in Washington, Baltimore, New York and Boston -- where mergers threaten to strip travelers of competition. To solve this problem at Reagan National Airport in Washington, US Airways has announced it would turn over many of its routes to a new airline, DC Air. Justice, however, may find other pockets of diminished competition and demand further divestiture.
Travelers often blame the airline deregulation of the late 1970's, and the merger wave it spawned, for flight delays, baggage mix-ups, cramped leg room and other woes. But most of this criticism is misplaced, according to a recent study by Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution and Steven Morrison of Northeastern University. Mergers, they say, have not raised fares and have been pursued to cut costs. Indeed, average prices have fallen by more than 25 percent under deregulation.
True, travelers flying to locations served by only one airline may find themselves paying prices they consider exorbitant. There are also some troubling allegations of anticompetitive behavior, such as attempts by large carriers at their hub airports to drive smaller rivals out of business by cutting prices temporarily to punishingly low levels and then raising them when the competition is driven away. It will be Justice's task to determine whether this proposed merger is benign or threatens to jack up prices and diminish service.
Labor opposition could still derail the merger. The pilots' union at United scuttled an earlier effort to merge the two carriers out of fear that many of its members would lose seniority. Meshing the employee-owners of United with the often disgruntled, costly employees of US Airways may prove a graver threat to completing the merger than anything thrown in the way by antitrust authorities.

HEADLINE: Charitable Giving Surged Again in '99, by an Estimated 9%

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Charitable giving grew faster than the economy last year, although it did not quite keep pace with the tremendous accumulation in wealth, according to figures released yesterday.
The ebullient stock market and the prosperous economy helped drive donations to charity up nearly $16 billion, to $190.2 billion, 9.1 percent higher than in 1998 and well ahead of the 5.7 percent growth in gross domestic product, according to the figures, estimates presented by the A.A.F.R.C. Trust for Philanthropy, the nonprofit arm of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. 
 After inflation, donations increased 6.7 percent, making 1999 the fifth year in a row that they rose in "real" dollars.
And, said the philanthropy trust, which uses an economic model to estimate annual charitable contributions, donations equaled 2.1 percent of gross domestic product, the highest level by that barometer in 28years.
Fund-raising executives and others called the growth substantial. President Clinton's domestic policy adviser, Bruce Reed, who spoke at a Manhattan news conference where the trust issued its figures, referred to "a new golden age of philanthropy in America."
"The new figures are remarkable," Mr. Reed said, adding that giving in the last seven years now totaled $1 trillion.
Since 1995, charitable giving has risen 53 percent, or 40 percent after inflation. The fund-raising association's chairman, George C. Ruotolo Jr., called the rise "meteoric."
Despite last year's gains -- and huge contributions from some Internet billionaires like William H. Gates of Microsoft -- the growth in giving appears not to have kept up with the growth in wealth. Using the figures released yesterday, Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, calculated that giving amounted to 0.69 percent of the nation's wealth last year -- down from 0.71 percent in 1998, although slightly ahead of the 0.68 percent of 1997.
Daniel Feenberg, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and member of the fund-raising association's advisory council on methodology, suggests that another yardstick to measure charitable giving is its relation to personal consumption. He too used the figures released yesterday, and calculated that donations last year equaled 3 percent of personal consumption expenditures, up slightly from 1998 and a significant jump from the 2.5 percent in 1995 but still below the 3.3 percent of the late 1960's.
"There has been steady growth over the past five years, but we are still not back to the historic peak," Mr. Feenberg said, although he cautioned that the association figures on which he was basing his calculations were only estimates.
Giving by foundations last year rose at more than twice the rate of individual giving, spurred by a law that requires them to give away at least 5 percent of their assets each year. (They are allowed to average their assets over several years to even out their spending.)
The bullish equity markets, which provided most foundations large gains in their endowments, forced them to increase their giving sharply. Grants by noncorporate foundations jumped 16.5 percent, to $19.8 billion from $17 billion.
The Foundation Center, a New York-based group that gathers data on foundations, reported that the number of them had also been surging in recent years. By the end of 1998, there were 46,832 foundations, up from 23,770 in 1982. (The center does not yet have figures for 1999.)
In contrast with the extraordinarily robust growth of foundation giving, personal giving -- which accounts for about three-quarters of all donations -- was up 7 percent last year, to $143.7 billion from $134.1 billion.
The A.A.F.R.C. Trust said philanthropic giving by individuals amounted to 1.8 percent of personal income last year, the same as in 1998 but up from 1.5 percent in 1995. The last time personal giving was above the 1.8 percent level was 1973, when it reached 1.9 percent.
After personal giving and donations by noncorporate foundations, the two remaining categories of charitable contributions are bequests and corporate giving, both of which had a good year. Bequests rose $2.8 billion, to $15.6 billion, while corporate giving climbed $1.4 billion, to $11 billion.
Religious charities remained by far the largest recipients of charitable giving by Americans, receiving nearly $82 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from 1998.
Education organizations, including universities, were the second-largest recipient, with $27.5 billion, an 8.5 percent increase.
The sharpest gain in percentage terms was to organizations focused on international affairs, like Doctors Without Borders and the United Nations Foundation, although the total still remained relatively small. Donations to these groups rose 24 percent, to $2.7 billion.
Environment and wildlife organizations also enjoyed a strong increase, 11 percent, to $5.8 billion.
The charitable giving data released yesterday is available on the fund-raising association's Web site (www.aafrc.org). A more detailed picture of charitable giving in 1999 will be contained in the association's book "Giving U.S.A. 2000," which will be available on disk in June and in book form in September.

HEADLINE: From the Trade Debate: Democracy and Economics, Idealism and Politics

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the House debate today on the trade bill that would grant permanent normal trading relations with Beijing, as transcribed by The New York Times.
 
THE MINORITY LEADER, RICHARD GEPHARDT OF MISSOURI -- This debate is testament to what makes the United States the greatest country that's ever existed in the history of the world based on the ideals of freedom: freedom of expression and freedom and liberty of religion and political speech.
These ideals are what cause me to finally be against this bill. 
 This debate would not happen in China. This freedom of expression that we are exercising on this floor and outside this building and in rooms all over this country in the last days would not happen in a country like China. In fact, if you insisted on speaking against the policy of the government, you would be arrested. . . .
Some would argue that this is just about trade. I would remind them that our greatest export is not our products and our services. Our greatest exports are our ideals and our values. Getting acceptance of these ideals is also vital for trade. A country that fails to respect basic rights of people will not respect the rule of law. And without the rule of law in China the rights of our businesses will not be accepted.
China has not obeyed the agreements that they have made with us on trade. We've been promised access; we haven't gotten it. We've been promised protection of intellectual property; we haven't gotten it. Our trade deficit is now $85 billion with China, the highest of any country in the world. We export more now to Singapore, a nation of 3.5 million people, than we export to China, a country of 1.3 billion people. The track record is poor on compliance with treaties. Let's not reward them before we get them to comply. . . .
 
THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, J. DENNIS HASTERT OF ILLINOIS -- While there is one bill being debated here today, there are actually two debates going on, two questions that have to be answered: one, is granting this status to China in the best interests of the United States and the American people? And two, is granting this status good for the people of China. I believe the answer to both is yes.
Among other things, this debate is about American economic security. American negotiators have reached a tough but fair agreement for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. It is, in fact, a one-sided agreement, China gets nothing from us they don't already have. And we get lower tariffs and easier access for our exports going to China. And who makes those exports? American workers do.
Regardless of whether we grant normal trade status to China, the Chinese market is opening. Someone is going to have the opportunity to sell to this vast new market. The question is who will be there when the door opens? Will it be the United States or will it be Europe and Japan? There will be new and larger markets for farm commodities and manufactured goods in China. Who will produce those products: American farmers and American workers or European farmers and European workers? This vote today is about whether American firms set the ground rules and standards for business in China.
The potential for American economic growth is huge. If we pass this legislation, U.S. agricultural exports to China would increase by $2 billion every year. That means American farmers will be selling more corn and more wheat and more citrus and more soybeans. Last year, the wireless telephone market in China was $20 billion. By 2003, that market will be up to $45 billion. Our high-tech firms would thrive in the Chinese marketplace.
It's clear that passing this legislation is in the best interest of American economic security and that's why Alan Greenspan supports it. And that is one reason why we should vote yes. . . .
 
DAVID BONIOR, DEMOCRAT OF MICHIGAN -- We're told we need this trade deal to open up the vast markets for American goods. But these Chinese workers can't even afford to buy the products they make themselves. How are they going to buy our cars? Our cell phones? Our computers?
You can have free markets without free people, but it doesn't often come to a good end -- Chile's Pinochet, Indonesia's Suharto. We should have learned the lessons of Nafta -- jobs lost in food processing, in consumer products and high tech, 100,000 good auto worker jobs lost forever since Nafta.
And where are those men and women today? Oh, they're working. They're working in nursing homes, at gas stations, at convenience stores, and making a fraction of what they once earned. And the jobs they used to have? They're now performed by workers making pennies on the dollars in Mexico's economic fire zone called the Maquilladora.
But harsh as life can be in Mexico, China is far worse. It is a police state. . . .
The advocates of this trade deal tell us that prosperity is a precondition for democracy. And with all due respect, they're wrong. They have to grow together. . . .
 
CHARLIE NORWOOD, REPUBLICAN OF GEORGIA -- Every year, every year I've been here, we are asked to approve normal trade for China based on existing and potentially other progresses with these three concerns in mind: jobs, bombs and Bibles.
We are told every year that if we'll just extend normal trade for one more year, that jobs in this country will not be adversely affected. My district has lost manufacturing jobs to cheap Chinese labor every year I've been in Congress. And there are others of you who fit in that category. This is not just cheap labor, my friends. This is also slave labor.
We are told if we just will extend normal trade for one more year we won't have to worry so much about Red China dropping nuclear bombs on us because they're going to be much friendlier. Our relationship is going to be greatly improved.
Yet every single year that I've been in Congress, China has increased its nuclear arsenal with technology stolen from us and increased its threats to use them against American cities if we dare oppose their invasion of our allies.
We are told that if we extend normal trade relations for just one more year, the human rights in China will surely get better. The Christians will not be jailed for having Bibles, and Muslims will not be jailed for having the Koran, the Tibetans won't be jailed for simply following their traditional religion.
Yet every year that I've been in Congress, persecution of anyone in China who believes in a higher authority has gotten much worse. All of these things, all of them are worse after five years of what we have described as normal trade relations with China. . . .
 
THOMAS M. DAVIS, REPUBLICAN OF VIRGINIA -- I rise in strong support of this rule and for the resolution.
You know, for America this agreement is a one-way street. Our markets are already open to the Chinese. If there's going to be job loss, we've seen it in terms of some of these low-wage markets that have already moved to the Pacific Rim and to China and these other areas.
What this does for the first time, and by adopting P.N.T.R., China's markets are now going to be more accessible to American companies, American products: 1.2 billion Chinese. America only has 5 percent of the world's consumers. China is the largest -- second-largest -- economy in the world; 100 million Chinese today making $40,000 a year annually. A middle class that is burgeoning and growing, and this is going to increase the pressures for democratization inside of China.
China already joins the W.T.O. regardless of what we do here today. That already happens. The question is: Are American products, are American corporations, are American workers going to get the W.T.O. preference by our granting P.N.T.R. and does America get the benefits of the World Trade Organization tribunals for resolving trade issues that we don't get if we just go on to an annual basis? Under P.N.T.R. the answer is yes. . . .

HEADLINE: AIRLINE DEAL: THE OVERVIEW;
The Anatomy of a $4.3 Billion Airline Deal

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
As United Airlines officially announced its proposed $4.3 billion acquisition of US Airways yesterday, the two companies began confronting the obstacles and challenges that they will have to overcome.
To capture US Airways, a prize Wall Street analysts said was a nearly perfect strategic complement, United needs to run a gantlet of federal regulators, rank-and-file members of its unions and its competitors. 
 "If I had to bet, I would bet this thing is doable," said James Higgins, an airline industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "But it is not going to be pretty getting there."
James Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of United's parent, the UAL Corporation, is mindful of the challenges but optimistic about UAL's ability to deal with them.
"In my opinion, there are two major hurdles," said Mr. Goodwin, who will run the combined company. "The first is to get US Airways shareholders to approve this transaction. I don't think that is a major hurdle. The real work ahead of us is the regulatory work, which revolves around the Department of Transportation, the Department of Justice and the European Union. Our real challenge will be there."
Skepticism was apparent on Wall Street.
Befitting a stock that has received a takeover offer that was about 130 percent above its closing price on Tuesday, shares of US Airways soared yesterday but settled well below the $60 a share that United agreed to pay. US Airways closed at $49, up $23.0625.
Shares of UAL and those of its main rivals declined. UAL fell $7.1875, to $53.1875. The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines and the company most threatened by the merger, slipped $2.5625, to $30.0625. And Delta Air Lines lost $3.6875, to $51.50.
Assuming United can meet all the challenges, it will then find itself encumbered with huge amounts of debt -- $7.3 billion in debt and lease obligations from US Airways alone -- obligations that could threaten its financial viability if the economy were to slide into recession sometime in 2001, the year the airline has said it expects the deal to close.
"The probability of this transaction being consummated is materially less than 100 percent," said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber. "The probability of a significant and swift competitive response is 100 percent."
Yesterday, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, United's biggest rivals, chose not to comment on the proposed combination.
But analysts said the competitive reaction from within the industry might be swift and could come in several forms.
They said the most obvious counterattack would be if American topped United's offer for US Airways.
"If you want US Airways, you better step in quickly," said Glenn Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "And I don't know why AMR's attitude about US Airways would have changed."
Mr. Higgins said that American, which considered a run at US Airways in 1995, would be "permanently marginalized" if United were able to complete the transaction.
Analysts said that United did not appear to fear a higher bid. Part of that has to do with the $60-a-share price, a figure most consider to be generous, if not rich. In addition, United attached a fairly low breakup fee of $160 million, which is not likely to scare off a would-be suitor.
Julius Maldutis, global aviation analyst at CIBC World Markets, said that in the wake of the transaction, "AMR, Continental Airlines and Northwest will have to make some strategic moves."
The risk to United-US Airways, he said, is if all the carriers decide to make moves in short order.
"The only thing that can queer the United deal is if there are a number of mergers that are proposed that leave us with three major carriers," Mr. Maldutis said. "If that were to happen, then the Justice Department and the Department of Transportation would have a major migraine."
Antitrust experts said yesterday that they expected the proposed acquisition to be under review for many months by both the Justice Department and the Transportation Department, a process that could last into the next administration.
The review would involve an examination of every market where the two companies have a presence. Because it is not known who would be leading the antitrust division at the Justice Department, it is impossible to predict the results of that review.
But experts and securities analysts expect that at the very least the two companies may have to shed assets beyond just their holdings in the Washington area.
Moreover, regulators most likely will consider what might happen next.
"If this succeeds, which is by no means certain, it could trigger further industry consolidation," said Philip Baggaley, a managing director at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. "The regulators will have to be thinking about follow-on combinations, as well as the UAL-US Airways merger."
As an opening move, UAL and US Airways have agreed to sell significant parts of routes that operate in and out of Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington. But Washington has more than one airport. United and US Airways, which rank No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in terms of market share at Dulles International Airport, may have to give up more.
"The Washington, D.C., area is glaringly anticompetitive," said Mr. Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin. "I firmly believe the fix they are proposing is highly inadequate."
Mr. Goodwin said that Robert L. Johnson, a US Airways board member and the founder of Black Entertainment Television, had agreed to pay more than $100 million for the assets at Reagan Airport.
Mr. Johnson, who has no experience operating an airline, will have a fleet of 37 planes operating out of the airport. Ten of those, 737-200's, will be leased from United.
Chicago is another city where United may be forced to give ground, Mr. Baggaley said.
"The biggest competitive impact outside the direct overlap would be in Chicago," the Standard & Poor's analyst said, "where both United and American have hubs."
While regulators scrutinize the deal, Congress will also be watching closely.
In a joint statement, Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, and Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, said: "The proposed merger between United Airlines and US Airways will require very careful scrutiny. If this action precipitates a wave of consolidation in an already consolidated industry, it is hard to see how that result will be good for consumers."
Senator DeWine is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, business rights and competition. Senator Kohl is the panel's ranking member.
Then there is labor.
Objections from United's pilots in 1995 were a big factor behind the airline's decision to back off a combination with US Airways.
As part of the most recent deal, United has agreed to retain virtually all 45,000 US Airways employees. Job security will probably be popular with that carrier's unions. But seniority questions will probably be important issues for United's unions, particularly the pilots.
Mr. Goodwin said he was optimistic the company's unions would support the deal. But yesterday the pilots, whose representative on United's board voted to reject the takeover, were far from enthusiastic.
Rick Dubinsky, chairman of the master executive council of the pilots union, issued a statement expressing "deep disappointment" that the company had agreed to buy US Airways without reaching "full agreement" with the pilots on "all issues."
Complicating matters further, contract negotiations with the pilots and United's machinists will be conducted over the summer.
"Labor integration issues are a real risk," said Mr. Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin. "I am not sure that union leadership is the question, but the rank and file. The risk is you can't make everybody happy. And this is an industry where it doesn't take much operational disruption to screw up earnings."
Objections from its pilots was only one reason United backed away from a 1995 deal for US Airways. The company was also worried about the effect a purchase would have on its balance sheet and credit rating.
The carrier has long coveted an investment-grade rating for its bonds. And over the last four years it has slogged toward that goal.
But its bonds are now rated BB+ by Standard & Poor's, one notch below investment-grade status.
That is almost certain to change if the US Airways deal goes through. As part of the deal, United will assume $1.5 billion in US Airways debt and $5.8 billion in lease obligations. And it will also borrow $3 billion of the $4.3 billion in cash it has agreed to pay to US Airways shareholders.
"Effectively, all of the $11.6 billion of the acquisition price would represent increased financial obligations of one sort or another," Mr. Baggaley said. "We have calculated that would raise UAL's debt-to-capital ratio from 71 percent to 81 percent and weaken other credit measures."
Standard & Poor's said yesterday that it had placed UAL on credit watch with negative implications, and US Airways on credit watch with positive implications. Moody's Investors Service took similar action.
The combined debt of the two airlines, including off-balance sheet leases, is $28 billion, Mr. Baggaley said, a number that exceeds 1999's combined revenue of $26.6 billion.
Riding with that much debt could be a real risk in the event the economy sours next year or in 2002.
"A downturn would make them more vulnerable, no question," said Michael Mulvaney, a managing director who follows the airline industry for Moody's.

HEADLINE: Judge Suggests U.S. Remedy For Microsoft Is Inadequate

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case raised serious questions today about the government's plan to break up the company, seeming to suggest that he did not think the plan went far enough.
The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, praised a brief submitted by a group of computer industry executives -- including many of Microsoft's rivals -- that called for breaking the company into three parts instead of two, as the government has proposed. He called it "an excellent brief, excellent brief." 
 With an uncharacteristically determined manner, the judge also bluntly rejected Microsoft's request for months of additional hearings on the remedy for its antitrust violations, telling stunned Microsoft lawyers near the end of the day, "I am not contemplating any further process."
Judge Jackson asked the government to submit a revised version of its remedy proposal by Friday, modified in small ways to reflect answers to questions he asked in court today. And he gave Microsoft 48 hours after that to comment on the form, not the substance, of the revised proposal.
Then, two years and six days after the landmark antitrust suit was filed, Judge Jackson formally closed the proceedings, saying: "The matter is submitted. Thank you, counsel." His ruling on a remedy could come as soon as next week.
On April 3, Judge Jackson found Microsoft in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The next day, he told lawyers for both sides that he wanted to conclude the proceedings quickly. After the government put forward its breakup plan on April 28, Microsoft responded with a request for six months of preparation followed by a new trial.
Microsoft officials were surprised and upset by the decision to close the record today. A few minutes after the hearing adjourned, William H. Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, said: "We had sought to have our day in court on remedies, but the judge has decided not to do that. So this case will now be decided at the court of appeals, and we will be raising issues of procedure in our appeal, as well as issues of fact and law."
The Justice Department had no comment.
Almost as soon as the remedy hearing opened this morning, the judge asked questions suggesting his state of mind, though he never explicitly said his ruling would call for a breakup of the company or anything else.
The government's proposal would create one company for Microsoft's operating systems and another company that would hold everything else, including applications software, like the word processor Word and the spreadsheet program Excel, and Microsoft's Internet properties.
Soon after Kevin O'Conner, an assistant attorney general from Wisconsin who represents the 19 states that are partners in the government's suit, began describing merits of the plan, the judge interrupted, saying, "The effect of a bisection will in effect be to create two separate monopolies, with no incentive to interfere with each other's profitability."
He noted that one outsider's brief he received in recent weeks had made that point. He was apparently referring to a plan proposed recently by several prominent academic economists to split Microsoft into five companies, including three competing operating-system companies.
Later, the judge asked David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, about another supporting brief, submitted by the Computer and Communications Industry Association and the Software and Information Industry Association. It proposed dividing Microsoft into three companies, including one that would sell only Internet Explorer, the company's Web browser.
"Rather than reorganizing Microsoft into only a Windows company and a single applications company," the brief said, "the court should supplement plaintiffs' proposed final judgment by separating the Internet Explorer product and personnel into a third, independent company."
Mr. Boies did not criticize the idea in court and said it might hold merit, but added that the government was trying to reduce the complexity of its proposal.
Judge Jackson said: "You talk of the simplicity of implementation of your proposals, but they are anything but simple. I don't think" Microsoft "will be willing to cooperate." He then wondered aloud why the government plan gave Microsoft the responsibility to determine how the company should be divided.
Mr. Boies responded, "We give them the opportunity to do it first, but if they come back with something that simply doesn't meet our requirements, the government will have to do it." The judge nodded.
When Microsoft's turn came to promote its own proposed remedy, the judge asked no questions. And to Microsoft's request for a delay, the judge told a company lawyer: "I find it somewhat ironic that your client believes its travails will end at the court of appeals, and yet wants to spend more time in this court."
John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, insisted that he found the idea "that we would have some final resolution today really incredible." When another company lawyer made the same point, the judge snapped, "This case has been pending for two years." Later Mr. Warden complained that the government's remedy proposal had been pending for less than a month.
Officials familiar with the government position say Microsoft has known since abortive settlement talks in March 1999 that the government might seek to break up the company. A specific breakup proposal was put on the table during court-sponsored mediation talks early this year. Microsoft refused to discuss the idea at either juncture.
Along with the breakup plan it submitted to the judge, the government proposal includes several temporary rules to alter Microsoft's conduct while the breakup would be carried out. Mr. Warden complained that one of them, requiring Microsoft to divulge technical information on Windows to other software companies, was "confiscatory." It would require Microsoft to turn trade secret over to "all of our fiercest competitors" as well as "pirates and counterfeiters," he added.
A short time later, responding to Microsoft's complaints, the judge remarked: "I ask you if forfeiture is not a traditional, equitable remedy."
As their day in court seemed to be slipping away this afternoon, Microsoft's lawyers hurriedly entered into the record an "offer of proof," which included summaries of testimony that the company would have hoped to offer in further hearings on a remedy.
Among the 16 academic experts, Microsoft executives and others cited in the 35-page brief were William H. Gates, the company's chairman, and Steven A. Ballmer, the president and chief executive. Microsoft said both would have come to testify. In Mr. Gates's printed declaration, he said the company was working on "a new vision of the future," specifically "making the Internet more useful by creating the first Internet-based platform for software developers." But Mr. Gates added that the "project will be doomed to failure at the outset if Microsoft is split along the arbitrary lines proposed by the government."
Microsoft said the declarations were not ready when it filed its response to the government plan this month. It said it wanted to enter them into the record now so the court of appeals would see them.
Whatever Judge Jackson's comments and actions today might bode, investors did not seem disheartened. Microsoft's stock closed up $2.375, at $65.5625.

HEADLINE: Opening China to Goods and Ideas

 BODY:
By approving legislation that permanently normalizes trade relations with China, the House opened the way yesterday for a more stable and productive relationship with that country. President Clinton and the Republican leadership also won an important victory for the principle of bipartisan leadership in foreign policy. The Senate is expected to endorse the China trade bill soon. Congressional approval, however, must be seen as a first step toward broadening relations with the Chinese and pressing them to open their country to democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
In the end, the vote was more one-sided than many had predicted. The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and his deputies Dick Armey and Tom DeLay were more successful than the president in bringing along their party faithful, many of whom were persuaded by the business interests lobbying furiously until the very end. Gov. George W. Bush and a raft of respected Republican former presidents, cabinet members and officeholders helped. On the Democratic side, Mr. Clinton got only 73 votes against a tough campaign waged by unions and by the House Democratic leadership. 
 Lawmakers who favored the bill essentially bet that by competing in the global economy, the United States can advance the cause of liberty around the world and help shape international commercial forces to everyone's advantage, including American workers and Chinese democrats. They correctly judged that increased trade with China would not only expand the sale of more American goods there but also widen the circulation of democratic values.
Passage of the trade bill will not diminish the need for vigilance over China's human rights problems. Mr. Clinton struck the right note after the vote when he pledged to use China's accession to the World Trade Organization as a way of monitoring environmental and labor standards in China, as well as the rule of law and freedom of expression and religion. He gave appropriate credit as well to Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Douglas Bereuter of Nebraska, who crafted legislation for a commission to monitor Chinese human rights as a way of bringing skeptics on board.
It will take vigorous action to continue the pressure on China on these issues. There is understandable skepticism about the position that simply trading with China and opening it up to foreign investment will produce a more open society. But a striking number of experts on China, and many in the dissident community in China, have argued persuasively that creating wealth in the private economy, along with more avenues of communication, will strengthen those Chinese in a position to demand a pluralistic and democratic society.
The world will now be looking to China to honor its trade obligations, including the lowering of barriers to foreign investment and goods. But in the years ahead as China takes its place among the world's economic and political powers, it must also treat its own people with dignity and respect. The measure of yesterday's House action, and Mr. Clinton's handling of China, should not just be the future state of the Chinese economy but the state of Chinese society.

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE VOTE;
Rounding Out a Clear Clinton Legacy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
With his victory today on trade with China, Bill Clinton has finally defined his imprint on American foreign policy: the president who cemented in place the post-cold-war experiment of using economic engagement to foster political change among America's neighbors and its potential adversaries.
It is a path he chose in 1993, when 10 months into his presidency he defied his party and pushed through the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. At the same time, he reversed course on China, despite his 1992 campaign criticisms of his predecessor for "coddling dictators," and concluded that denying China trading rights as a weapon to change its behavior was a policy doomed to failure. 
 Today, eight months from the end of his presidency -- and with even fewer Democrats on his side -- he convinced a Congress skeptical about trade and even more suspicious about China that normalizing trade relations was the best bet for encouraging political reform in the world's most populous nation.
And he persuaded them that rejecting the trade bill would bolster hard-liners in Beijing who are convinced that America's secret agenda is to contain China's power, economically and militarily.
It will be years before anyone knows if the economic roll of the dice behind today's vote, or the strategic one, will pay off. On paper, the accord promises vast new openings for American agricultural goods, telecommunications equipment and Internet providers, among others. But history suggests that as soon as China's tariffs come down, new bureaucratic barriers will magically appear.
As in the Nafta debate, the economic benefits were undoubtedly oversold. China is already at work on ways to slow the promised influx of American competitors in its market, at least until it can figure out what to do with the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of workers, mostly in state-owned industries, whose livelihoods are threatened by the country's promise to open its markets to the world.
But in the end, Mr. Clinton ultimately prevailed because he was able to sell a long-term vision of how America could use its economic power to change, and perhaps undermine, the nature of one-party rule in China. And his opponents in the floor debate -- both those who feared the loss of American jobs and those who fear China's rising power -- offered no real alternative, no convincing strategy of how America would expand its presence in China or attempt to open up its political system.
"This was never a fight about the nature of the problem in China. It was a fight about the nature of the solution," Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, said in an interview this morning as the final House debate was getting under way. "It's about whether we best deal with China in a punitive way or by a combination of promoting internal change and external validation of that change."
That Mr. Clinton won the China argument at all is remarkable. Few countries evoke such deep emotions in Congress and among political activists.
"More people are imprisoned today for their beliefs than at any time since the Cultural Revolution" in 1966-76, said Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat and long-time opponent of trade relations with China.
While it is impossible to verify Representative Pelosi's count -- the number of political detentions in China is kept secret by the government in Beijing -- administration officials do not deny that the crackdown on the Falun Gong religious group has sent imprisonments soaring.
Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican and defense hawk, charged that America's trade with China was simply building up Beijing's nuclear capacity, and compared Mr. Clinton's engagement policy to Neville Chamberlain's failed effort to moderate Germany's behavior in the 1930's. "You don't make a liberal by hugging a Nazi," he said.
But in this debate, Mr. Clinton's approach to trade was as divisive as his approach to China. Despite America's incredible prosperity, trade policy still runs like a huge geologic fault through the Democratic party. For seven years now Mr. Clinton has argued endlessly that international economic development ultimately offers economic opportunities for workers in the world's most innovative economy.
Yet he has convinced few.
Labor unions fought fiercely against him -- and a pained Al Gore -- arguing that "economic engagement" was simply a code word for moving American jobs to China.
Just compare today's vote tallies with the battle over Nafta. In 1993, when the American economy was just crawling out of a recession and unemployment had yet to fall, Mr. Clinton got 102 out of 258 Democrats to vote for the free trade accord with Mexico and Canada -- or 39 percent.
Today he persuaded far fewer Democrats: 73 out of 211 voting on the bill, or 35 percent. In one of the great turnabouts of modern times, it was the House Republicans -- who impeached Mr. Clinton last year -- who saved his foreign policy legacy today, voting overwhelming for the China deal 164 to 57.
The decline in Democratic support is all the more notable since this may have been, in President Clinton's words, the "most one-sided trade deal in history." While Nafta required huge openings of the American market -- threatening American tomato farmers and car-parts makers -- the accord to usher China into the World Trade Organization put all the market-opening obligations on Beijing. China got no reciprocal trade openings, just an agreement to let them into the organization that sets the rules for world trade.
"This is one of the conundrums that all of us have had to wrestle with," said Gene Sperling, the head of Mr. Clinton's National Economic Council who helped negotiate the deal struck with China in November, an accord that Congress indirectly approved today. "Despite the growth in our economy, despite the record-low unemployment, you see nothing but increased anxiety about globalization, technology and trade. It's everywhere."
In the end, though, Mr. Clinton's success in twisting arms had little to do with the bill's economic merits. He won over the undecided using a bit of Lyndon Johnson-style vote-buying -- one congressman got a zip code for a small town, and two others got a natural gas pipeline near El Paso -- and a large dose of Richard Nixon's geostrategy.
Like Nixon and all the presidents who followed him, Mr. Clinton has become an engagement enthusiast. And while economic interdependence was the course advocated by George Bush, Mr. Clinton has become a far more articulate proponent than Mr. Bush ever was.
So if he leaves office with a Clinton Doctrine, it is this: Doing well for American business can, under the right conditions, do good for the cause of liberalization and democracy in authoritarian corners of the world.
"We know that trade alone will not bring freedom to China or peace to the world," Mr. Clinton said late this afternoon in the Rose Garden, before celebrating what clearly will be one of the last legislative victories of his presidency. "We will have more positive influence with an outstretched hand than with a clenched fist."
 It is a doctrine Mr. Clinton has subscribed to only when it is politically convenient -- Cuba, for example, is still a notable exception.
Now the hard part -- making the leap from economic openings to political progress -- will be left to Mr. Clinton's successor.
China's record of compliance with trade accords is poor (though Europe and the United States don't do much better). There is little doubt that, once a member of the World Trade Organization, Beijing will use its clout there to work against the international regulation of labor and environmental rights that Mr. Clinton says are so necessary.
And while China's intelligentsia sees the pressure to open China's markets as a huge lift to economic and political reform -- and to the country's embattled chief reformer, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji -- the opposition to true market opening will be fierce.
China's real political constituencies are its wildly inefficient, often bankrupt state-owned enterprises. As foreign competition pours in, many will go belly up. When the workers demonstrate, the country's insecure officials may well decide to crack down, with echoes of Tiananmen Square that would inevitably inflame American opinion.
"No one said this would be an easy path or a short one," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, who led the China negotiations. "There will be setbacks, lots of them. But we've tried the other means of effecting change in China and they have failed. This has a chance, a good chance."

House Approves Trade Bill Granting China Privileges
By a surprisingly wide margin of 237 to 197, House lawmakers granted China permanent normal trading privileges after months of fierce lobbying that pitted business against organized labor.
The vote virtually assures the end of the annual review of China's trade status, a ritual that Beijing considers humiliating but opponents say maintains leverage over improving human rights. The Senate is expected to endorse the measure as early as next month but may question some of the amendments the House added to the bill. Page A1. 

Judge Questions Microsoft Remedy
The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case raised serious questions about the government's plan to break up the company, seeming to suggest that he did not think the plan went far enough. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rejected Microsoft's request for months of additional hearings. A1.
 
While Microsoft's lawyers pleaded with the judge not to break up the company, William H. Gates and other company executives were painting a rosy picture of a software-enhanced future for chief executives of some of the world's largest companies. C25.
 
Costco Shares Plummet on Warning
Costco, the warehouse club retailer, posted third-quarter results that missed Wall Street estimates and reduced its fourth-quarter outlook, leading to a $4.2 billion fall in the company's market value. Costco said its third-quarter profits rose 14 percent but fell a penny a share below expectations. Shares of Costco declined $8.75, to $31.875. C8.
 
Garment Workers Lose U.S. Appeal
A federal appeals court has refused to reinstate a class-action lawsuit filed in 1997 against a garment industry union by union members who worked at a now-defunct Brooklyn sweater factory. C2.
 
Cisco's Help Doesn't Come Cheap
Getting a vote of confidence from Cisco Systems can be important to fledging technology companies. For example, Selectica, a company that makes software to help businesses sell complex products over the Internet, was so eager to make Cisco its customer that in a recent deal, Selectica went beyond giving Cisco its software all the way to effectively paying Cisco to take it. Market Place. C8.
 
Entertainment President at Fox
The Fox network appointed Gail Berman as president of entertainment for the network. Ms. Berman had been president of Regency Television, a production studio affiliated with Fox's television studio. She replaces Doug Herzog, who held the position only 16 months. Ms. Berman will report to Sandy Grushow, who last November was named chairman of the Fox television entertainment group. C7.
 
Heineken Expands Agency's Duties
A humorous campaign in the United States for the flagship beer brewed by Heineken is increasing sales. And that has sold Heineken executives on giving the agency creating the campaign, the New York office of Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide, an additional major assignment: to develop and produce Heineken brand advertising that is to run around the world. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C7.
 
Spitzer Drops Empire Opposition
Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York withdrew his opposition to plans by the big nonprofit insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to change into a for-profit company. As part of the shift, Empire would set up a multimillion-dollar foundation dedicated to making health care broadly accessible. B5.
 
New Third Rail of American Politics
The expansion of temporary visas that permit foreigners to work for employers that petition on their behalf shows that immigration reform has replaced Social Security as the third rail of American politics. Washington has come to rely on the visas as a substitute for addressing the economic and social failings of current policy. Alan B. Krueger: Economic Scene. C2.

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING;
Race Car Paradise Without Fumes

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

DATELINE: MOORESVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
Nothing about the reflecting glass exterior of DEI Inc. offers a clue that inside is an exalted garage built to harvest the fastest 720-horsepower beasts in stock car racing.
Yet starstruck pilgrims in shorts and T-shirts know that this Brobdingnagian race shop with unexpectedly elegant touches was built by Dale Earnhardt, stock car racing's career money winner, and that behind its doors, homage is paid to the deities of speed. 
 They arrive in cars, vans and motor homes to gaze at a complex created by Earnhardt and his wife, Teresa, for their three team drivers -- including Dale Jr., who has won two Winston Cup races this year -- and to tour the 8,000 square feet devoted to a showroom and gift shop brimming with souvenirs like Earnhardt caps, Earnhardt robes and Earnhardt Monopoly games.
"This is my temple," Nick Smith, a carpet layer from Newburgh, Ind., said last week, raising his arms to the ceiling of the $15 million racing shop dubbed the Garage Mahal.
"Some of my friends came here last year and said, 'You definitely have to come here,' " Smith said. "I've been a fan for 15 or 16 years. He's just Earnhardt. The Intimidator. He's the man."
The splendor Earnhardt has created would be unrecognizable to past drivers for Nascar, or the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, like Earnhardt's father, Ralph, Junior Johnson and Fireball Roberts. But so would nearly all the other one- and-two-story racing shops in Mooresville.
As auto racing heads into its biggest weekend of the year -- with not only the Indianapolis 500 taking place on Sunday, but Nascar's Coca-Cola 600 at nearby Lowe's Motor Speedway as well -- tens of thousands of fans will converge on what has become home to the nation's largest cluster of Nascar race shops.
The passing of the grease-monkey image here in the booming suburbs north of Charlotte mirrors Nascar's growth into a juggernaut with total revenues of $1.56 billion this year, according to Paul Kagan Associates, the media research firm.
That includes sponsors paying millions of dollars to tack their names on cars and races, retail sales of more than $1 billion in licensed merchandise and new TV deals worth $400 million annually.
Tracks in Florida, Texas, Nevada and California opened recently to exploit Nascar's popularity. New speedways near Chicago and Kansas City will open next year, while speculation continues about a track that may be built in New Jersey.
Everything in Nascar starts with four-speed Chevy Monte Carlos, Ford Tauruses and Pontiac Grand Prix that are assembled, fileted, reassembled, engineered, tested, painted and covered with logos at shops like Earnhardt's.
The shops, including those not associated with Nascar, employ 1,444 workers in Mooresville, more than any other local industry. This former textile mill town saw its last plant, one that made denim for Burlington Industries, close last summer.
By then, Mooresville had reinvented itself as Race City USA because of the 24 Nascar race shops that fabricate vehicles for 32 drivers on Nascar's Winston Cup, Busch Grand National and Craftsman Truck circuits.
"As the mills died, the shops gave Mooresville the identity it needed and an economic engine for growth," said Jack Cathey, an accounting professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who publishes an annual Zagat-like guide and rating service for Nascar shops.
Once, Mooresville believed that tourists would come to the town of 18,000 to vacation on Lake Norman. "Everybody thought that was the attraction of the future," said Dan Wallace, executive director of the Mooresville/South Iredell Chamber of Commerce. "Then came the racing business. Who knew?"
The town and county have never offered tax or financial incentives to lure the race shops to Mooresvile. They just kept coming.
The concentration of shops has made it common to see families and tour groups enter Lakeside Park (make a left at the Chick-Fil-A on Route 150) to make the rounds of 12 Nascar race shops, another dozen shops unrelated to Nascar, and the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame. Tourism soars in the days before the Winston Cup races at Lowe's Motor Speedway, 15 minutes away in Concord, N.C.: the Coca-Cola 600, which takes place Sunday night; the Winston, which was run last Saturday; and the UAW-GM Quality 500 in October.
Insurance concerns kept all but a few shops from offering behind-the-scene tours, where visitors could see a dozen or more cars per driver in various stages of construction. Tourists are left to admire cars from behind viewing windows or they get only as close as a lobby with souvenirs and race-used cars.
Everett Brooks was examining one of Ricky Rudd's No. 28 Texaco/ Havoline Fords last week at Robert Yates Racing.
"It's just a fascination," said Brooks, a retired machine shop supervisor from Petersburg, Va., who was making the rounds of shops for the first time in three years. "I like to see what's new. It's unbelievable. Half the shops that are here now weren't here then."
Rudd, who owned the shop before selling it to Yates last year to refocus on driving, said his one regret in designing the shop in 1994 was not offering the fans a viewing window. "In hindsight, I would have let them look in," he said.
Next door, fans quietly watched Roush Racing mechanics tend to Mark Martin's and Jeff Burton's Fords for the Winston.
Soon after Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the $500,000 prize for first place, a pedestrian walkway outside Lowe's Motor Speedway collapsed, injuring more than 100 people leaving the 175,000-seat stadium.
Among the fans who journeyed here for the race was Tom Bowen, a construction worker from Battle Creek, Mich., on a Nascar holiday.
"Compared with seeing these cars on TV, this is the only chance to see them up close," said Bowen, wearing a Dale Earnhardt Jr. T-shirt. "Being this close to things I've seen all my life is amazing. My father raced '55 Chevys and he hated Dale Earnhardt. But he's getting old now."
Fifteen years ago, Lakeside rejected two owners of race shops who wanted to relocate to the hilly business park. "We were unfamiliar with racing and thought they'd be dirty, with wrecked cars out front," said Cecile Ebert, the park's president and owner. "Turns out you can eat off the floor of these garages."
Ebert now comprehends the full meaning of Nascar: 60 percent of Lakeside's 170 businesses are racing related. And even if nearby Concord is offering incentives for shops to relocate, she's certain teams will stay in Mooresville for its low-key lifestyle and its proximity to interstate highways, airports and Lowe's Motor Speedway and other Southeastern tracks.
Rudd said: "I live on the lake seven miles away, so when I was looking to build a shop, I wanted to be nearby. And my wife has a knack for real estate."
Felix Sabates Jr., whose Team Sabco is led by the Winston Cup drivers Sterling Marlin and Kenny Irwin, said Mooresville's shops are too crucial to the local economy to lose to rival cities like Concord.
"Iredell County won't let them take anybody away," said Sabates, who has more than doubled the size of his complex since moving to Lakeside in 1995.
"Our first shop could have fit in here," he added, gesturing from behind a massive desk to his massive second-floor office.
Dennis Berken, a carpenter from Fox Valley, Wis., walked respectfully through the trophy room of Penske Racing South, Rusty Wallace's shop, which lets fans peer into the working garage. "I took three days off to see the shops and go to the race," he said. "This is as close as we've ever gotten to the cars."
Berken, who lives near Green Bay, is a Packers fan. "They'd never let you this close to a practice field," he said. The behemoth of Mooresville is Earnhardt's elegant 176,000-square-foot complex. He doesn't drive for DEI -- racing instead for Richard Childress, out of Welcome, N.C. -- but he is the undisputed icon here, a regular presence to employees, occasional visitors and fans admiring his and his drivers' trophies, their race-winning cars and his knife and boat collections.
DEI has a dining room that resembles a gentleman's club, red velvet elevator walls, cream-colored carpeting and an array of ceilings with reflective tiles, gold medallions and polished wood. "That comes from my wife's experience as an interior decorator," Earnhardt said.
Visitors can also watch a loop of his TV commercials or buy his leather jackets, diecast miniatures of his No. 3 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet, backpacks and energy bars.
But he will not permit fans to view the mechanics at work. "These guys work hard, and to have interruptions is no good," he said. "They're doing a job and they have business to do. I didn't build this to give tours."
Not every race team can afford a $15 million shop. MB2, which owns Kenny Schrader's M&M's Pontiac, is in a hangar-like shop too cramped for its production needs.
"The building doesn't make you go faster," said Jay Frye, the general manager of MB2, which is contemplating a new, larger home in nearby Concord.
"So we don't use our building as an excuse. We see a lot of great buildings and when you look at the points standings, we're higher."

HEADLINE: THE CHINA TRADE VOTE: A CLINTON TRIUMPH;
HOUSE, IN 237-197 VOTE, APPROVES NORMAL TRADE RIGHTS FOR CHINA

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
In a stunning victory for the Clinton administration and corporate America, the House today swept aside economic restrictions on China that were part of anti-Communist policy for two decades.
By a surprisingly wide margin, 237 to 197, lawmakers voted to give Beijing permanent normal trading privileges after months of fierce lobbying that pitted business against organized labor. A larger-than-expected Republican majority delivered President Clinton's top remaining legislative priority: three out of four Republicans voted in favor; two out of three Democrats voted against. 
 The vote virtually assures the end of the annual Congressional review of China's trade status, a ritual for 20 years that Beijing considers humiliating but that opponents argue is a lever for improving human rights. Congress has approved the trade status every year. The Senate is expected to endorse the permanent measure as early as next month, but may question some of the amendments the House added to the bill.
With his time in office winding down, Mr. Clinton threw the powers of the presidency behind passing the measure, which he considers a crowning foreign policy triumph. He met with more than 100 lawmakers face to face or in groups, called scores more by phone, and traveled to Congressional districts in the Midwest and California to rally support.
"The House of Representatives has taken an historic step toward continued prosperity in America, reform in China and peace in the world," Mr. Clinton said in a Rose Garden ceremony.
The agreement slashes Chinese tariffs on a wide range of farm and industrial products and removes some barriers to American service providers, like banks and telecommunications companies. And it puts the United States and China on equal footing as China enters the World Trade Organization, the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for global commerce.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has often voiced support for the legislation, hailed the vote. "Passage of this legislation will mean a stronger American economy, as well as more opportunity for liberty and freedom in China," Mr. Bush said in a statement.
Vice President Al Gore, who has walked a political tightrope between his labor allies and President Clinton, also voiced support for the bill today, but qualified it by saying that more had to be done to guarantee American workers' rights. "We must continue our efforts to assure that workers will succeed in a global economy," he said in a statement.
American companies and farmers -- from Internet moguls in Silicon Valley to orange growers in Florida -- supported normal trade ties with China so they could benefit fully from an accord that Washington and Beijing negotiated last November.
Regardless of the vote, China will enter the World Trade Organization. But without the blessing bestowed by Congress today, Beijing could withhold some trade benefits from the United States that it extends to other members of the group.
A coalition of labor unions, religious groups, environmentalists and veterans waged a furious campaign to deny Beijing this trade plum, arguing that it wrongly rewarded a Communist government that threatens its neighbors, represses its citizens and thumbs its nose at the rule of law. Unions have also voiced fears that passage would encourage American companies to move high-paying industrial jobs to China.
A frantic final round of lobbying, including horse-trading on home-district issues that have little to do with China, corralled enough undecided members yesterday to put the measure over the top. Late Tuesday, administration officials and Republican supporters of the bill said they were a handful of votes shy of the 218 needed for passage; opponents claimed the race was even at 210.
But when debate resumed this morning, opponents privately conceded defeat, and what had looked like a cliffhanger 24 hours earlier turned into a solid victory after four hours of largely pro forma debate.
Republicans attributed their wide support, which surprised even Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the chief Republican vote counter, to several factors, including last Friday's agreement by Chinese and European negotiators on terms of China's entry into the trade organization and support for the bill by Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian.
Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus followed the lead of an influential Democrat, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York. Also, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, crafted an amendment to the bill with Republican Doug Bereuter of Nebraska to create a 23-member commission to monitor human rights in China, and a second proposal would help fight sudden surges of imports from China. Those provisions attracted about 20 lawmakers who might otherwise have opposed the measure, vote counters said.
Supporters said the agreement would open China's vast commercial market to American business. "For America, this agreement is a one-way street," said Representative Thomas M. Davis 3rd, a Virginia Republican. "Our markets are already open to China."
Over all, the United States bought $82 billion worth of China-made goods last year, $69 billion more than the value of what it sold to China. The trade deficit, America's second largest, was slightly smaller than the one with Japan.
Opponents criticized this measure as one that would undercut America's moral authority in the world.
"We must stand up for human rights and democracy throughout the world," said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. "We have a chance to vote for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy."
During the long run-up to the vote, President Clinton repeatedly argued that the measure was more about national security than economic gain. He argued that rejection of permanent trade ties would undercut China's reformers and remove the one firm pillar of bilateral relations, potentially leaving the world's leading democracy and the most populous country on a collision course.
But the real fight from the corridors of Congress to union halls and chambers of commerce nationwide cast the lobbying and advertising muscle of corporate America and farming groups against a fervent grass-roots coalition of organized labor, human rights groups, veterans organizations and religious leaders.
The United States Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, two leading business groups, spent close to $10 million on ads -- their largest-ever campaign for a single legislative issue -- and assigned waves of lobbyists to buttonhole lawmakers.
Business leaders hailed the result as evidence that they could marshal support for a trade deal despite a string of defeats in the mid-1990's. Many had worried that after the collapse of world trade negotiations in Seattle late last year, the sentiment against globalization would make it difficult to get even the simplest and most economically beneficial trade measures through Congress.
But labor leaders denounced the vote. "This is a betrayal of workers' interests," said George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America. "This is about moving factories from the U.S. so that they can export back here."
Fuming about the Clinton administration's all-out pursuit of China trade, Mr. Becker said the Steelworkers' executive board would meet in three weeks to discuss its strategy in the upcoming elections.
On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton sought to begin patching up the rift the issue opened between the administration and labor by twice inviting John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., to join him tonight at a big Democratic fund-raiser here. Mr. Sweeney declined, aides said, unwilling to sit among the corporate chieftains who championed the China bill.
"We mounted a forceful and nearly successful challenge to an array of money and forces unlike any before seen in a lobbying campaign," Mr. Sweeney said.
In the span of a month, Congress has now approved the China bill and legislation to expand trade ties with more than 70 nations in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.
Until now, the administration's last major trade victories were passage of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which created the World Trade Organization, and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, which established duty-free commerce among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Today's vote cut across party lines, as 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voted in favor; 57 Republicans, 138 Democrats and 2 independents voted against. In the annual vote last year, 150 Republicans and 110 Democrats backed normal trade status for China. By comparison, the House passed Nafta in 1993 by 234 to 200, with 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting the measure.
Like many lawmakers, John M. McHugh, a New York Republican, made his final decision on economic grounds after deliberating until the final hours. He said he had been barraged by supporters and opponents for weeks, especially by farmers urging him to back the bill and unions urging him to reject it. Dairy farms and a General Motors plant are among the two largest employers in his district, in the northern reaches of New York State.
"I decided that the gains from selling ice cream and cheese outweighed the potential for any job losses at G.M.," Mr. McHugh said. "It's not a magic elixir, but our dairy farms are really suffering, and they needed this."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: SOCIAL SECURITY;
Gore Defends Stock Investment Switch

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said today that the stock market was an attractive place for Americans to invest over the long run but that it was the wrong place to seek a solution to Social Security's problems.
In an interview, Mr. Gore reiterated his strong opposition to Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to allow individuals to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes on Wall Street. And he defended his own decision to back away from his early support for allowing the government itself to invest in stocks on Social Security's behalf. He said that his shift was driven by a recognition that allowing the government to become a big shareholder would create problems and that the stock market had not generated as consistently strong returns as he had once assumed. 
 "The learning experience that we went through convinced all of us that it was a bad idea," Mr. Gore said of government investment in the market.
Tracing the evolution of his thinking about Social Security and the financial markets, Mr. Gore said that he had kept an open mind to many possible solutions to the retirement system's problems when the Clinton administration began examining the issue in earnest a few years ago.
Last year the administration proposed a plan, backed by Mr. Gore, under which the government would begin channeling hundreds of billions of dollars in additional money into Social Security out of general tax revenues starting in 2011. Under the plan, half of the new money going to Social Security would be invested by the government in stocks, up to a maximum of 15 percent of Social Security's total reserves.
The administration dropped the plan last year in the face of intense opposition from Republicans, revived it in its budget proposal early this year, then dropped it again as it became clear that Social Security would be one of the most heatedly debated issues of the presidential campaign.
The Bush campaign has sought to use Mr. Gore's on-again, off-again support for government investment in the stock market to undermine the vice president's assertions that Social Security benefits should not be dependent on Wall Street. And Mr. Bush's aides said Mr. Gore's reversal on the issue suggested that he was prepared to sacrifice principles to make a short-term political point.
"There is a growing sense that Al Gore has never had a conviction which he could not easily change," said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman. "He was clearly on record as advocating and supporting government investment in the market. Now he's walking away from something he advocated as recently as 1999."
Some advisers to Mr. Gore said the vice president had dropped his support for government investment in part to make it easier for him to attack Mr. Bush's approach.
But in the interview, on the porch of his home on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, Mr. Gore sought to play down the degree to which he had supported the concept, and said that in any case he had changed his mind as he learned more about the tradeoffs it would require.
Mr. Gore said he had been swayed in part by criticism of the idea from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan opposed the plan on the grounds that politicians would not be able to resist using the government's role as a shareholder to favor or punish certain industries or to meddle in corporate decisions.
"The magnitude of the government's stock ownership would be such that it would at least raise the question of whether or not we had begun to change the fundamental nature of our economy," Mr. Gore said. "Upon reflection, it seemed to me that those problems were quite serious."
Moreover, Mr. Gore said, he became convinced that Wall Street's ups and downs were large enough to create a risk that the government might be making a bad investment. During long stretches -- including from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, Wall Street was by no means the one-way bet it has often been viewed as in recent years.
Although Mr. Gore receives income from some stock technically owned by his mother, he owns no stock, and has never actively invested in the market. He said he had chosen to stay out of the market when he first was elected to Congress in 1976 to avoid any conflicts of interest, not out of fear of risk, and that he supported a variety of proposals to promote savings and investment.
But he said investment in the markets should "come on top of Social Security," rather than as a replacement for it. And he said that Mr. Bush's economic policies, including his big tax cut and his need to use much of the Social Security surplus to pay for the creation of private accounts, would undermine the fiscal discipline that has helped propel the markets upward in recent years.
Mr. Bush's approach "contains the seeds of its own destruction by virtually guaranteeing a weaker economy, and thus, you would expect, a weaker market, with lower returns than what we've seen in these boom years," Mr. Gore said.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Vice President Al Gore's position on Social Security misstated one element of his personal finances. Mr. Gore receives no income from investments in the stock market. Although his financial disclosure form lists dividend income, the stock is held in trust for his mother, and the income goes only to her.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Proposes New Rule To Lower Arsenic in Tap Water

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The Clinton administration today proposed strict new regulations of arsenic in tap water, reducing by 90 percent the public's maximum exposure to the chemical, which causes cancer and is found at harmful levels in at least 1 out of 10 of the nation's community water supplies.
The Environmental Protection Agency issued the proposal after having missed a deadline of Jan. 1 under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996. Environmentalists had threatened to sue the agency if it did not move quickly. 
 The agency proposed lowering the limit on arsenic to 5 parts per billion from 50 parts per billion by using additives, filtering or other methods. The E.P.A. estimated that this approach would cost $374 million a year and would prevent scores of cancer cases each year and provide other major health benefits.
Water utilities, while agreeing that the rules should be tightened, contended that this level of control would cost about four times more than the agency said and that the health benefits were not worth such an effort. Environmentalists called for an even stricter rule, saying the agency was accepting unusually high cancer risks in this approach.
"The subject of arsenic has been debated at the E.P.A. for the better part of a decade or more," said Charles J. Fox, the agency's assistant administrator for water programs. "We think this is affordable, and it is important for public health protection. But in some communities they will see increases in drinking water rates to pay for this additional health protection."
The agency said the costs per household might be about $28 a year in households in larger cities, and about $85 per household in communities of less than 10,000 households. The E.P.A. makes billions of dollars in loans to cities to help pay the cost of its regulations on drinking water.
The burden would fall most heavily in the Southwest, where many communities have tap water with high levels of arsenic. Other communities in the West, the Midwest and New England would be affected, especially those that rely on water found underground rather than streams and other surface water for their drinking water supplies.
For example, the Albuquerque water system, which serves more than 400,000 people, has an arsenic level of 14 parts per billion, and the Norman, Okla., water system, which serves 80,000 people, has arsenic levels at about 36 parts per billion, according to federal data complied by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The agency estimated that 6,600 utilities, which represent about 12 percent of all water suppliers in the nation and serve some 22 million people, would have to take corrective action, and that the vast majority of them serve 10,000 homes or fewer.
Arsenic in drinking water commonly comes from natural sources in the ground, but some can also come from industrial pollution. Its occurrence varies widely; New York City's water, for example, is essentially arsenic-free and meets the new standards.
In some communities, people may face a risk as high as 1 in 100 of developing cancer from contaminated water, according to a study published last year by the National Research Council. For decades, Congress has called for the agency to review its rules, but the agency, citing uncertainties over the costs and benefits, has never before issued a proposal.
While few experts argue against taking action to protect people better from arsenic, which can cause not only lung, skin and bladder cancer but also diseases of the liver, blood vessels and other organs, there is still a dispute over how strictly the agency should regulate it.
Erik Olson, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, objected that the E.P.A. proposal would provide a cancer risk of 1 in 10,000, a claim that the agency confirmed.
"Although it is a very significant step forward," Mr. Olson said, "it would still provide a higher cancer risk than any other E.P.A. rule for tap water. I think that is a pretty serious precedent for the agency to be undertaking."
His environmental advocacy group has urged the agency to adopt a standard of 3 parts per billion, the strictest standard that is considered feasible with existing technology.
Doug Marsano, a spokesman for the American Water Works Association, which represents water utilities, said the group had called for a standard of 10 parts per billion -- twice what the E.P.A. is proposing, and equal to the recommendation of the World Health Organization. That standard would bring reductions in the vast majority of cities where arsenic is a problem, Mr. Marsano said.
The E.P.A.'s draft proposal, prepared after years of discussions with health officials, water districts and the public, was held up at the White House for review until this month.
The agency's new proposal is a compromise, but leaves open the possibility of seeking higher or lower standards after a period of public comment.
The agency asks the public to comment on several alternatives: a 20 parts per billion standard, the 10 parts per billion standard that the water utilities have endorsed, the 5 parts per billion standard that the E.P.A. favors, and the 3 parts per billion standard. A decision is to be made within a year.
The agency's economic studies conducted over the past few years found that the standard of 10 parts per billion would cost half as much as its proposal, and that the standard of 3 parts per billion would cost twice as much as its proposal.
For each notch that the regulatory vise is tightened, there would be a corresponding reduction in cancers, the agency's scientists found. But the improvements would be relatively slight. And because most of the cancers at each level of control would be curable, the agency deemed that the health gains were worth only so much money spent cleaning up water supplies.
Large water systems would probably treat their water with relatively efficient technologies like filtering and adding lime. But systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people would probably choose less efficient methods, and the costs of treatment per household would probably be higher there. Large systems would be given three years to comply, and small systems five years.
 
THE LOCAL SITUATION
How to Check Water
 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORTS Beginning last year, local water utilities are required to send a consumer confidence report once a year with their water utility bill. The report has information on all contaminants, including arsenic, and the amounts found in the local water supply.
 
WHERE TO GET INFORMATION Call the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Hot Line at (800) 426-4791 for the number of your water utility and ask for a consumer confidence report. Or check the E.P.A.'s Web site for more information: www.epa.gov/safewater/dwinfo.htm

CORRECTION-DATE: May 30, 2000, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Thursday about proposed regulations to limit arsenic in tap water referred incorrectly to estimates of the cancer risk under the proposed standard of five parts per billion. The Environmental Protection Agency's estimate of risk, approximately 1 in 10,000, pertains only to bladder cancer, the most thoroughly studied health risk, and does not reflect other forms of cancer that can also be caused by arsenic.
 The article also referred incompletely to environmentalists' threat of a lawsuit if the Clinton administration did not propose the new regulations quickly. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, filed such a suit on May 10 to force the release of the proposal.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
From Ur, the First and Most Famous

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Mesopotamia, whose name comes from the Greek for "between the rivers," is one of the places where it all began, a cradle of Western civilization, like ancient Egypt. The rivers are the Tigris and the Euphrates, and the land between is a flood plain that today is in Iraq. It was inhospitable terrain: flat, arid and lacking in indigenous plant life or useful materials like stone, metals and wood.
But in the seventh millennium B.C. it was settled by people whom historians call Sumerians. And by the late fourth millennium, the Sumerians began to meet the requirements for ranking as a cradle of civilization. They probably invented the wheel; they established one of the world's first irrigation systems, essential to both agriculture and flood control; and they created one of the first written languages. The keeping of written records made large urban centers possible -- most notably the city-states of Uruk and Ur -- as well as an elaborate economy that included trade with places as far away as Afghanistan (from which the Sumerians imported various kinds of stone). 
 Beginning about 3500 B.C., the Sumerians also produced artworks of lasting beauty. Some of these, belonging to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, form the core of "Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur," a sumptuous exhibition at the Pierpont Morgan Library. They were allowed to travel for the first time while the museum in Philadelphia is being renovated.
Everything in this show came to light between 1922 and 1934, when archaeologists sponsored by the university and the British Museum discovered and excavated a vast cemetery full of hundreds of intact, often lavishly equipped tombs at Ur, the southernmost of the ancient Sumerian city-states. Leading the team was C. Leonard Woolley (1880-1960), an English archaeologist known for his energy and meticulousness.
Gertrude Bell, another archaeologist of the time, described Woolley as "a tiresome little man but a first class digger." At the Morgan, photographs blown up to sepia-toned wall murals indicate the substantial size of one of the main pits at Ur and also the work force. But once the heavy work was done, Woolley usually sent everyone away and did the most delicate, time-consuming excavating himself, working face down in the dirt with a knife and a little brush beside his wife, Catherine, who was also an archaeologist, and one trusted assistant.
In a letter quoted in the catalog, he describes the tedium of stringing beads from this vantage point, the better to preserve the order in which they were found.
Anyone who has taken an introductory survey of Western art has seen images of the exhibition's stars. There is the Ram Caught inthe Thicket, a small sculpture of an avid ram made of gold, lapis lazuli and silver, whose wool is ingeniously depicted as rows of spearheadlike pieces of shell. He stands on his hind feet, as if to graze on a gold tree. There is also the Great Lyre, with its big prow-like bull's head bearded in lapis. Just below is the lyre's four-tiered inlaid front panel, rich in intimations of gods and myths to come.
The panel's four scenes include one of the first appearances of what art historians call the nude bearded hero as well as figures and creatures that presage the Holy Trinity, the minotaur, and the clever beasts of Aesop. Also present is a scorpion-tailed man resembling a devil. All the standard textbooks of Western art reproduce two of these three items.
It is, however, something else to see the real thing, and in the company of nearly 200 other objects from the tombs, sensitively lighted and displayed in nearly invisible vitrines. There have been significant reconservations: the ram's feet, for example. After an earlier conservation, they had hung oddly in the air in photographs published as recently as 1993; now they rest on the tree's gold boughs, as if on the handlebars of a bicycle.
The show also has vessels of gold, silver and calcite, a pale translucent stone; tools and weapons; and, perhaps most interesting, the small stone cylinder seals that served important people as amulets and early identification cards. (These are supplemented by a selection of Middle Eastern cylinder seals from the library's own holdings, displayed in the East Room.) Most prevalent is all manner of jewelry: headdresses, rings, earrings, cloak pins, beaded necklaces and chokers, belts and even a beaded cape belonging to a queen or aristocrat named Puabi, whose grave accounts for more than half the exhibition.
The assembled objects suggest that the Sumerian elite lived well and died even better. Not only were their bodies lavishly adorned and surrounded by objects both useful and entertaining (lyres, for example, and little lapis tablets that may be the first dominoes), but they were also accompanied by attendants, themselves richly adorned, along with oxen and carts. The burial was the culmination of a feast and processional march into the tomb, where the animals were slaughtered and the attendants either committed suicide or were ritually killed.
The objects in this exhibition suggest their own purely visual criteria for qualifying as a cradle of civilization. While neither as unbending nor as pure as the Egyptians, the Sumerians achieved a consistency of style that operated over a range of media: sculpture, incised relief, inlay and the incised cylinder seals, whose cartoonlike narratives are made visible here with enlarged photographs and modern clay impressions.
Given the barbarism of human sacrifice, the style is surprisingly buoyant, characterized by a wide-eyed innocence and alertness that are also visible in Minoan and Etruscan figures. (The Sumerian animals are also depicted with wide round eyes: those of the bull on the Great Lyre, emphasized by repeating creases, make clear why targets are known as bull's-eyes.)
The recurrence of certain motifs from one medium to another is a further consistency, one that indicates art's increasingly complex mirroring of life. The sketchy lines visible around the heads of the tiny figures on the cylinder seals are drinking tubes, like a long gold one, resembling a bit of miniaturized plumbing pipe, in one of the vitrines. The fringed garments worn by the figures are sheepskin, as verified by a front panel for a lyre where a figure wears a garment incised with the same spear shapes that appear in three-dimensions on the back of the ram.
An oddly shaped pouring vessel appears in the hand of an upright lion in the front panel of the Great Lyre, and others like it are in a vitrine. These vessels seem to have developed from the bisected conch shells used for the same purpose, which are also in the show.
Lions are a frequent subject, especially impressive in a simple cast silver lion's head with staring eyes of lapis and shell. Also intriguing is a small, bedraggled copper relief that shows two striding beasts facing in opposite directions, as they would nearly 2,000 years later in the stone reliefs of Assyrian art. That lions were both a symbol of power and a real threat is apparent again in the cylinder seals, where they are repeatedly shown attacking domestic animals.
One of the less expected pleasures here is the plentiful jewelry. In addition to suggesting that beautification of the human form is among the most ancient impulses, it also reflects a continually evolving ingenuity and technology. In jewelry the Sumerians made extensive use of three materials, all imported: red carnelian, blue lapis lazuli and gold.
This triumvirate -- a mineral version of the primary colors -- recurs in different ratios, combinations and motifs and in beads and other elements of varying shape and size. It is a leitmotif that grows surely and irresistibly into a major theme of the exhibition.
"Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur" remains at the Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, through Sept. 10. It will travel to the Oriental Institute Museum in Chicago in October and to the Detroit Institute of Arts in February.

HEADLINE: Economy Continues Hot Growth, at 5.4% Rate in First Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
The nation's economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year, led by rising exports and business investment along with the fastest consumer spending pace in 15 years, the government reported today.
Gross domestic product expanded in the first quarter at the same rate that the Commerce Department first estimated a month ago, making it the third consecutive quarter in which growth was faster than 5 percent. In the fourth quarter of 1999, G.D.P. rose at a 7.3 percent annual pace. 
 In a separate report today, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed that home resales decreased in April after rising a month earlier to the highest level in seven months, offering little evidence that higher borrowing costs are cooling the economy. Though resales fell 6.2 percent last month, to an annual rate of 4.88 million, that followed a 9.2 percent gain in March that had been reported a month earlier as a 1.5 percent increase.
"It looks like there is a lot of momentum," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief United States economist for ABN Amro North America in Chicago. The strength in house sales means "solid spending for the next few months as people furnish their homes," he said.
The level of home sales in March was the highest since the 5.3 million annual rate in August, and sales for the first four months of 2000 averaged 4.8 million houses -- just below the record of 5.2 million set last year. That is likely to bolster purchases of furniture, appliances and other household goods.
All this momentum could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. The Fed officials have raised the overnight bank lending rate six times since last June in an attempt to slow the economy and keep inflation from accelerating. Last week, the Fed's policy-setting committee raised the overnight bank rate half a percentage point, to 6.5 percent -- the highest in nine years -- and signaled that further increases were possible.
Job growth shows little sign of cooling, with unemployment at a 30-year low of 3.9 percent. First-time claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000, to 284,000, last week, the Labor Department said today. That followed a drop of 20,000 the week earlier and left the average for claims this year at 278,000, down from an average of 298,000 last year.
The G.D.P. report showed that consumer spending rose at a 7.5 percent annual rate. Though that is slower than the 8.3 percent gain that was first estimated, it is still the fastest since the third quarter of 1985, when spending also rose at a 7.5 percent rate.
Exports rose at a 5.5 percent rate in the first quarter after the previous estimate showed a drop of 0.2 percent. Net exports, which include the effect of imports, subtracted 1.1 percent from G.D.P. compared with a 1.3 percent reduction in the first estimate.
The government releases three estimates of each quarter's gross domestic product as more information becomes available to its analysts. The final estimate will be released June 29.
The G.D.P. deflator, a broad measure of inflation tied to the report, rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the same as previously estimated and faster than the 1.9 percent rate of the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Applying RICO To Civil Cases

 BODY:
The lawsuit filed by the California Medical Association is an effort to apply the civil provisions of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. The statute is best known for its use in criminal cases in which the government charges that groups like organized crime or gangs have engaged in a pattern of conspiratorial activity to further their crimes. 
 In civil lawsuits, plaintiffs like the doctors' group use the civil provisions of the RICO statute to contend that they have been economically harmed through a pattern of misconduct. If successful under a RICO claim, they can win up to three times the amount of damages that they would in a traditional lawsuit.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton, in Rochester, Takes On Queries on Motive

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton used a town hall forum in Rochester yesterday in part to answer what she acknowledged were continuing concerns about her ambitions and motives in running for a Senate seat representing a state where she had never lived until five months ago.
Would she serve a full six-year term? 
 "I am committed," Mrs. Clinton said, "because I think it would take a good six years to be able to accomplish issues that I care about. Doing what I would like to see us do to get the pieces in place for a good economic strategy, you can't do that in a year or two or three."
Will she live in New York even if she loses?
"Absolutely."
When told by a participant that "many of your potential colleagues in the U.S. Senate knew you as a polarizing personality; that scares me," Mrs. Clinton rattled off a list of issues on which she has worked with the Republican leadership. And she drew titters with an end point, "After what I've been through for the last seven years nothing they can say can possibly hurt my feelings."
Mrs. Clinton has addressed some of those concerns before, particularly on her residency and ambitions, but they have been freshly raised by her new opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island Republican who announced his candidacy on Saturday after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dropped out.
Mrs. Clinton took questions for about an hour and a half from 85 people participating by e-mail, by fax and in a studio for a "Voice of the Voter" program sponsored by WXXI Public Broadcasting, WOKR-TV and the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. The program was broadcast live on radio and the Internet and was to be shown last night on television in an upstate region where the two candidates are vying for critical votes.
Mrs. Clinton appeared on the program after a Manhattan news conference to accept the endorsement of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Mr. Lazio scoffed at the endorsement, saying he too is "pro-choice." But he has drawn criticism from abortion rights advocates for opposing public financing for abortions and a late-term procedure critics call "partial birth abortion," a stance he says is more in line with "mainstream New Yorkers."
Many questions, however, focused as much on style as on substance. Mrs. Clinton appeared poised in response to questions about her personality and ambitions, issues Republicans cite as faults. She sounded surprised only when she was asked "if you were to die tonight do you know if you would spend eternity in heaven or hell, and if you don't know would you allow me to tell you how you could know?"
Mrs. Clinton seemed to wrestle with a response. She started by saying "I greatly respect the question" and ended with "I also do not believe that we should be, in public, putting people in a position of responding to questions that are really focused on ones of personal faith."
In between she said, "I hope that I will be someone who will live a life that is worthy of my strong Methodism and my Christian faith and my commitment to doing the very best I can to keep the example of our Lord and savior. But I cannot tell you where I will be. I can only hope and pray that I will find favor in God's eyes."
Mr. Lazio only came up once directly, when a questioner inquired about the linking by her supporters of Mr. Lazio to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Mr. Lazio supported much of Mr. Gingrich's so-called Contract With America, the 1994 agenda of conservative policies that Republicans used to regain control of the House.
"I cannot speak for all my supporters because certainly the facts are that he was closely allied" with Mr. Gingrich during those years, she said. "I think New Yorkers need to know that."
And, responding to a question on whether she would favor local issues as Alfonse D'Amato initially did or national ones, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Mrs. Clinton stayed in the middle. "I would hope to do both," she said.

HEADLINE: Bush Unties the Social Compact

BYLINE: By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is an adviser to the Gore campaign.

 BODY:
George W. Bush is advocating radical change in Social Security, which he himself calls "the single most successful government program in American history." He would take a part of the payroll tax that now flows to the Social Security trust fund and divert it to personal savings accounts.
But doing so would seriously undermine the finances of the present Social Security system. It would subject Americans, especially financially unsophisticated ones, to large additional risks. And it would abandon the noble commitment to social insurance that this country made in 1935. 
 While Social Security is a great success, its current large surplus masks a serious long-term financing problem. Simply put, we have promised far more in future benefits than future payroll tax receipts are likely to finance -- about 14 percent more on average over the next 75 years, according to the Social Security trustees' estimates. This is a huge hole that must be filled by some combination of raising payroll taxes, cutting benefits and infusing general revenue into the trust fund.
With the system in need of more revenue, not less, diverting part of the payroll tax into private accounts, as Mr. Bush proposes, appears irresponsible, unless, of course, you make up the difference by cutting benefits. Without such cuts, privatization would dig the financing hole even deeper, which is why thoughtful privatization proposals generally include significant tax increases to make good on promises that have already been made. But Mr. Bush has not proposed any. This is no minor omission. Diverting 2 percentage points of the payroll tax into individual accounts would drain trillions of dollars from Social Security over the next quarter-century.
And that's just the beginning.
The Bush plan not only would imperil Social Security's finances, but would add new elements of cost and risk to the retirement security of millions of Americans. Privatization is superficially attractive for two main reasons: the higher returns that can presumably be earned, say, in the stock market, and the virtues of individual choice. That's all well and good for financially sophisticated Americans, who happen (by no coincidence) also to enjoy every other advantage in our society, and who, by the way, do not rely heavily on Social Security for their retirement income. But what about the less fortunate citizens, the ones who will need to live on their Social Security checks but who may not know the difference between a stock and a bond?
Is freedom of choice such a blessing for them? Will they understand the risks to which they may be exposed? When funds are invested in stocks and held to retirement, the accumulated balance at retirement is as volatile as the stock market, which not so infrequently moves up or down by 50 percent or more within a few years.
It is a cruel illusion to pretend that small individual accounts will enjoy the full returns that people see in the stock market. There are commissions and, even more important, management fees that can easily exceed 1 percent of assets per year. Then, when they retire, people will discover that buying an individual (as opposed to a group) annuity eats up another chunk of the money, whereas Social Security offers annuities automatically and at zero cost. Furthermore, Social Security's annuities are protected from inflation, whereas private ones are not.
Finally, let's remember the central idea behind the Social Security system: to provide social insurance. Both words matter. High-wage earners like me would undoubtedly be better off under the Bush proposal, and even better off under full privatization. After all, universal social insurance forces us to remain in the same pool with, and partially subsidize, those who are less fortunate. Social Security's benefit formula offers a better rate of return to lower-wage individuals.
From a self-interested point of view, that's a bad deal for us high-income people. Were Vanguard or Fidelity to offer me a mutual fund like that, I wouldn't buy any. But people like me cannot opt out of Social Security, and frankly, I don't want to. Universal social insurance is one of those precious ties that bind our society together. Privatization, whether partial or total, would weaken that tie.

HEADLINE: As Protests Grow Violent, Peru Says Runoff Will Go On

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, May 25

 BODY:
The government of President Alberto K. Fujimori said today that a runoff presidential election would be held on Sunday as scheduled despite nationwide protests and calls from Washington and other allies that it be postponed to ensure a clean ballot count.
The decision appeared to increase the possibility of economic sanctions against Peru after it ignored the recommendations of the Clinton administration, the Organization of American States and several European and Latin American governments. 
 Within minutes of the announcement, violent clashes that had left several people injured earlier in the day resumed, with protesters setting fire to a balcony of the presidential palace and hurling stones at the building and at the police, who responded with tear gas.
The electoral crisis had been gathering momentum since Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate, dropped out of the race last Thursday, saying he would not compete in a fraudulent election. He had said he would rejoin the contest only if it were postponed by several weeks, with guarantees for a free vote.
Upon hearing today's decision, Mr. Toledo said, "This will bring Peru enormous instability, with totally unpredictable political and economic consequences."
During intense negotiations all week, United States and Latin American diplomats had urged Peruvian officials to delay the election so a computer system used to count votes could be overhauled and rechecked by independent auditors.
A brief announcement that the National Elections Commission had voted, 3 to 2, to go forward with the runoff was met with shock by international observers who had become increasingly hopeful that President Fujimori had decided to give in to international pressure.
"We are quite disappointed," said Eduardo Stein, head of an election observer team for the Organization of American States, "because other options were being intensively considered." He added, "It's been a terrible week."
A senior United States Embassy official said: "The U.S. government deeply regrets this outcome. Even a relatively brief delay would have put the Organization of American States in a position to speak to the integrity of the election results."
President Fujimori had appeared to be going back and forth on the election scheduling during the past three days, but Western diplomats said that mounting protests had perhaps strengthened the hand of hard-liners in the government.
Just Wednesday night, Mr. Fujimori had said in an interview in the government palace: "The possibility for an adjustment of the election date exists. We are in a fluctuating situation." It was one of several signs that Mr. Fujimori and his aides were satisfied that they could win the election at a later date and avert a crisis in its foreign relations.
"It was a close call," Francisco Tudela, Mr. Fujimori's vice presidential running mate, said of the decision in an interview tonight. The electoral commission "could not escape the Constitution and the elections law." Under the law, he said, the election could not be held more than 30 days after results of the first-round presidential vote were announced.
A wave of strikes and street demonstrations that followed Mr. Toledo's withdrawal from the race last week grew increasingly violent today.
A small group of protesters attacked the offices of the National Elections Commission, the highest government body that supervises the elections, and broke windows and damaged a door with rocks, pipes and at least one gasoline bomb. Scores of people were arrested in the northern jungle city of Iquitos for blocking roads, and the police used tear gas to clear protesters gathering in front of the government palace here in the capital.
Truck drivers and teachers staged a strike in the Andean city of Cuzco, a Toledo stronghold. Bands of university students in Lima and Arequipa repeatedly attacked riot police officers with stones, and the police counterattacked with tear gas through much of the day.
A growing number of influential businessmen had warned that holding the uncontested election on Sunday could mean years of economic sanctions and tensions with Washington that could impede investment and growth. Their arguments were strengthened through the week as Peruvian bond and stock prices dropped sharply and foreign financial institutions issued risk warnings that threatened to increase interest rates.
In recent days, the government's policies on the campaign and political process have been inconsistent. Several television stations allied with the government had begun showing Toledo commercials and coverage of his rallies, while tabloid newspapers thought to be directed by Mr. Fujimori's intelligence service had softened their negative coverage of Mr. Toledo's personal life.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday night, three unidentified men broke into the offices of an opposition journalist who was said to hold incriminating videotapes of Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr. Fujimori's intelligence chief, meeting with election officials. The journalist, Fabian Salazar, said the burglars tied him up and tortured him as they demanded that he reveal the sources within the intelligence service who gave him copies of the tapes, which apparently were made by Mr. Montesinos himself.
Mr. Salazar said the intruders cut his left wrist to the bone with a saw during their questioning. He was hospitalized, and his videotapes, archives and computer disks were stolen. Human rights activists said Mr. Salazar's descriptions of his ordeal, which were verified by doctors, may represent the worst example of torture in Peru in at least two years.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
In Far West 50's, Project Will Bring New Rentals

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A pair of mixed-income rental buildings that will offer a total of 222 apartments will soon rise on 10th Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets in the Clinton section of Manhattan, bringing new housing to the far West 50's for the first time in a decade.
The $60 million development, called the Foundry, will have studio, one- and two-bedroom units, with 460 to 1,183 square feet, spread between the two buildings. A 12-story structure with 164 units and 13,500 square feet of ground-floor commercial space will rise at 505 West 54th Street at 10th Avenue, and a six-story building with 58 units will go up at 510 West 55th Street. 
 They replace a parking lot and a taxi garage respectively that once stood on the sites, which are in the Clinton urban renewal area, extending from West 50th to 54th Street and from 10th to 11th Avenue.
Each of the Foundry buildings, which are separated by a five-story co-op at the southwest corner of West 55th Street, will have its own lobby and entrance. Eighty percent of the units will be leased at market rents. The remaining 20 percent will be rented to people with annual incomes of $19,650 to $37,100, depending on family size. The project is being developed by the Gotham Organization of Manhattan, which bought the sites in December from New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development for $8 million.
"The neighborhood has the potential to be the next TriBeCa," said David L. Picket, Gotham's president.
In exchange for setting aside the units for lower-income residents, the city provided tax-exempt bond financing to the developer, which is also eligible for a 20-year tax abatement from the city. Gotham also secured a letter of credit from Key Bank and is investing some equity into the project, which is to be completed in the summer of 2001.
The Foundry underscores renewed developer interest in the neighborhood, where the gentrification of the mid-1980's was cut short when that building boom deflated and the economy faltered. There were also concerns from community groups over displacement of residential and commercial tenants in the urban renewal area. Five of the original 12 parcels were developed from 1969 through 1981 into 1,396 mostly low-income housing units, plus Park West High School, according to the city's housing agency.
But now, with the economy strong, the 42nd Street redevelopment drawing attention to the whole West Side, and commercial tenants venturing into former industrial areas on 10th and 11th Avenues, "the flow of housing can expand farther west," said Brian Edwards, leasing director at the Halstead Property Company, a residential brokerage in Manhattan.
"Offices were the wild card," added Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a Manhattan rental brokerage and the leasing agent for the Foundry. Younger people who work in the dot-com and Internet businesses moving into the area "also like the older Midtown neighborhoods," she said.
There is a spate of residential projects planned in the West 50's, mainly on or off Eighth and Ninth Avenues, industry professionals said. "And we expect more pressure to rezone along 10th Avenue," said Katherine Gray, chairwoman of Community Board 4, which guides growth in the neighborhood.
In the Clinton urban renewal area, up to 700 new and renovated mixed-income residences could be developed on the five remaining city-owned sites. The understanding is, Ms. Gray said, that those sites will be developed with a larger percentage of apartments subject to income limits than is the case with the Foundry.
But the Foundry is the first project to go into construction west of Ninth Avenue in the West 50's. The Gotham Organization, however, built the New Gotham, a 375-unit mixed-income rental building at 520 West 43rd Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues -- relatively untested terrain when the project was completed three years ago. Now there are other residential buildings under way or planned in the far West 40's.
The Gotham Organization was selected to develop the two Clinton urban renewal sites because of its work at the New Gotham and "its responsiveness to community concerns over the impact on the existing corner structure and the design of the new buildings," said Christopher J. Cirillo, director of large-scale development for the housing agency.
The scale as well as the exteriors of the Foundry buildings, which will be clad in red brick and feature oversized windows, will blend with their low-rise neighbors. Most of the apartments at the Foundry will be one-bedrooms and be marketed to the young professionals who work in the area, Mr. Picket, Gotham's president, said. To appeal to those tenants and distinguish the Foundry from its competition, he said, he would do there what worked at the New Gotham -- offer lobbies and common areas with innovative designs.
Joel Sanders, a Manhattan architect who is also the director of the Parsons School of Design Graduate Program, has given the lobbies an urban pastoral design. The lobby of the taller building, for example, will feature a suspended concrete floor with openings to view a rock garden below as well as concrete furniture that seems to grow from the floor.
Amenities planned for the buildings include a landscaped terrace and laundry room. The taller building will also house an exercise room and parking for up to 60 cars.
Mr. Edwards, the Halstead leasing director, said rents in the area averaged $41 to $43 a square foot a year, or $2,000 to $2,150 a month for a 600-square-foot one-bedroom apartment.
Rents at the Foundry, where leasing will begin in March, have not been set. But Mr. Picket said that if rented today, they would lease at $45 to $47 a square foot a year, roughly $2,500 to $2,900 a month, comparable to the rents at the New Gotham.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Faces Loss Of Luster to Mainland

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 25

 BODY:
For a city that has prospered as an intermediary between the Chinese economy and the outside world, Hong Kong has lobbied hard to help China win full membership in the world's club of trading nations.
Now that the United States House of Representatives has voted to give China permanent normal trade status -- bringing normalized trade relations closer and easing China's accession to the World Trade Organization -- Hong Kong has to begin facing the consequences of its successful campaign. 
 A China more open to commerce with the outside world, many experts say, will jeopardize Hong Kong's historic role as a trading post.
"There's no question that companies are going to do business directly with China," said Robert C. Broadfoot, the managing director of the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy here. "It's not a question of if, but when, you're going to have shocks to Hong Kong's role."
Mr. Broadfoot contends that in the long run Hong Kong will benefit from China's integration into the global economy as the overall volume of China-related trade grows.
But in the short term, China's march into the World Trade Organization will pose a thorny challenge. As a former British colony and now a semiautonomous region of China, Hong Kong is a separate trading entity that already has its own membership in the W.T.O.
Hong Kong's stock market reflected this ambivalence, falling slightly today while shares in the mainland Chinese cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen roared ahead.
In 1998, more than $52 billion worth of goods passed through Hong Kong's port bound for mainland destinations. Mr. Broadfoot estimates that a third of that traffic will disappear after the United States and other countries start shipping directly to mainland ports.
Likewise in air travel, Hong Kong could lose its role as a gateway to China. As part of the W.T.O. negotiations last year between the United States and China, Beijing agreed to increase the frequency of commercial flights, which would enable more American cities to have more direct flights to mainland Chinese cities.
That could hurt Dragonair, a Hong Kong carrier that serves many mainland cities. It stands to lose Western passengers who fly to Hong Kong and transfer to planes to popular Chinese destinations like Xian or Guilin.
Hong Kong's position is further threatened by Taiwan, whose new President, Chen Shui-bian, has signaled that he is open to negotiating direct trade links with China. In 1998, Hong Kong's container port handled nearly $10 billion worth of Taiwanese exports bound for China. If Taiwan and China were to break down these barriers, some of that trade would also bypass Hong Kong.
"Once China gets into the W.T.O., Taiwan would presumably get into the W.T.O. soon as well," said Eden Woon, director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "That means that Taiwan would have to deal more directly with China."
With all the troubling implications, why did Mr. Woon and other Hong Kong officials push so energetically for the House to pass the bill?
Part of the reason is political. Beijing has made entry into the trade organization the centerpiece of its economic agenda. In Hong Kong, where politicians and business leaders try to outdo each other to be seen as loyal to the motherland, supporting the trade campaign was a natural.
Even Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy leader, traveled to Washington to lobby for the bill. Mr. Lee, a longtime critic of Beijing, said his motives were political rather than economic.
"I went to support the 1.2 billion people of China, not the Chinese government," Mr. Lee said. "I see in this bill a reasonable possibility that China will change its culture toward observing the rule of law."
Other supporters argue that Hong Kong can retain its middleman role -- with a few tweaks -- as a provider of services to the next generation of foreign companies that try to get into China. Hong Kong, with its legions of lawyers, accountants and consultants, is quite likely to remain a valuable guide for those companies.
"In order to handle all this trade, China will have to have a very well-developed service sector," said Victor K. Fung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the owner of a trading firm. "In the short run, it will be very difficult for China to ramp up those services."
But some more old-line Hong Kong industries will have to redefine themselves. With the United States set to lift import quotas on Chinese textiles and textile products by 2005, Mr. Woon predicted that many Hong Kong clothing makers would move their factories to the mainland to take advantage of lower production costs. Hong Kong, he suggested, could recast itself as a center for Asian fashion design, rather than a manufacturing center.
China's entry into the trade organization is also quite likely to deprive Hong Kong of its thriving gray market in goods like oil, cigarettes and agricultural products. Those are smuggled from mainland China by the truckload and exported from Hong Kong so that they will be subject to lower tariffs.
Despite its expected negative effects on some Hong Kong industries, China's trade campaign has made people here recognize that their economic fortunes are inextricably tied to the mainland. It seemed no coincidence that last week Hong Kong announced a $12 billion expansion of its rail system, including a direct link between central Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
Hong Kong's government estimates that China's joining the W.T.O. would add more than 5 percent to the territory's gross domestic product over the next decade. It also predicts that investment by Hong Kong companies in China will explode. Local companies have already poured in a cumulative $156 billion.
Because Hong Kong and China would retain separate memberships in the World Trade Organization, officials said Hong Kong would not necessarily gain access to Chinese markets earlier than other countries. But business people here are lobbying for special treatment. Even without it, officials say, Hong Kong will flourish.
"We do not mind if multinational companies go directly to China," the government's chief spokesman, Stephen Lam, said. "As long as the pie gets bigger, even if we get a smaller piece, it will still be more than enough for us."

HEADLINE: How the Hard-Driving G.O.P. Gave Clinton a Trade Victory

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
When Representative Tom DeLay came to work on Wednesday, he was still a vote or two shy of the bare-minimum 150 Republicans he needed to help push the China trade bill over the top.
Mr. DeLay, the Republican whip, had lined up lots of help. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was recruited to cajole several wavering Republicans. So was Gen. Colin L. Powell. Dozens of pro-trade lobbyists and corporate chieftains fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole the last dozen or so undeclared members for what both camps predicted would be a nail-biter. 
 Over the next crucial hours, those calls and an array of other influences paid off, as virtually every undeclared Republican, and even a few others who had been written off, broke Mr. DeLay's way. In all, 164 Republicans joined 73 Democrats voted to grant China permanent normal trading status, wiping out economic restrictions rooted in cold-war policy for a quarter century.
"Frankly, they surprised me a little bit," said Mr. DeLay, whose bare-knuckle approach to head-counting has earned him the nickname the Hammer. "Members in the last few hours really turned around and understood how important this was," he added.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where critics are already preparing amendments that could upset the delicately crafted measure.
Normalizing trade with China was a victory for the Clinton administration, but House Republicans had their own reasons for voting three-to-one in favor of the bill. Passage insured that Republicans' corporate benefactors would fully benefit from a market-opening accord Washington and Beijing negotiated that slashes Chinese tariffs on a wide range of farm and industrial products and removes some barriers to American service providers, like banks and telecommunications companies.
The House Republican leadership closed ranks behind the bill, arguing passionately that economic engagement would foster political change. But they needed to produce two-thirds of the yes votes, and had a tough sell with many Republicans who balked at rewarding a trade plum to a Communist government with a record of religious persecution and political repression.
"There was nothing simple about this," said Bob Schaffer of Colorado, one of the last conservative House Republicans to climb down off the fence in favor. "The 51 percent of this bill that's good only barely outweighs the 49 percent that is truly deplorable."
Republican leaders said a number of factors helped sway undeclared members in the final days and hours to provide the unexpectedly large margin of victory. An amendment creating a commission to monitor human rights in China won half a dozen Republicans and many more Democrats.
Republicans lined up Chinese dissidents who said that the bill would improve the rights of religious minorities, arguing that persecution cannot survive the advent of the Internet. Representative David Dreier of California, a chief Republican supporter, enlisted the evangelist Billy Graham to endorse the measure.
Two dozen Republicans with national security concerns were steered to General Powell or Representative Porter Goss, a Florida Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee. "I told them, the more open a society the better opportunity we have of getting results," said Mr. Goss.
Many members cited increased trade and national security benefits as reasons to vote yes. These broader merits, combined with the home-district considerations, collectively sealed the decisions of many borderline supporters.
"The key factor for me was that this was the last best hope to save family farms in middle and eastern Tennessee," said Representative Van Hilleary of Tennessee, who said Europe's agreement with China last week on Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization also convinced him that American jobs were at stake.
Finally, a few members who were leaning toward voting yes needed a touch of outside help to reach their decision. Governor Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, spoke to a handful of Republicans, including Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky, who was impressed by Mr. Bush's commitment to improving human rights in China.
Christopher Cox, a California Republican and outspoken critic of China, endorsed the measure after provisions in the human rights commission were strengthened. Elton Gallegly, a California Republican, said backing the bill was easier after he spoke to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman about keeping a ban an Argentine oranges, which could introduce a citrus-killing insect into southern California orchards.
Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican with steel mills in his district, voted in favor after Republican leaders agreed to amend a spending bill to address his concerns about imported coke, which is used in steel-processing. "We're always sensitive to our members needs," said Susan B. Hirschmann, Mr. DeLay's chief of staff.
By the roll call, all but a handful of the 15 or so Republicans who started the day on the leaders' lists as undecided voted yes.
"I've been counting votes for a long, long time and never in my life have I seen that many undecideds break in favor of a position," said Nick Calio, a bill supporter who was President Bush's top lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
Labor leaders said they had been outgunned. "The business community unleashed an unprecedented campaign that was hard for anyone to match," said George Becker, president of the United Steel Workers of America.
The China bill's 40-vote margin of victory in the House, 237 to 197, would seem to give it unstoppable momentum as the legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration, probably next month. Passage in the Senate, which is usually considered more pro-trade and internationalist, had appeared more certain.
But lurking in the Senate are critics like Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Helms, a fierce foe of the Beijing government, said after the House vote that he would not allow the Senate "to simply rubber-stamp the President's plan to reward the Chinese Communists."
Opponents do not have the votes in the Senate to kill the House bill, but amending it -- open to any Senator -- would force House and Senate negotiators to hammer out a compromise of the competing chambers' bills. The House would then have to cast a second vote on the revised bill.
Supporters vowed today to push for speedy Senate passage of a clean House bill.
"There will be efforts to derail this by using amendments and other parliamentary means," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who supports the measure. "But we have to keep this moving."
Rushing to the next legislative battleground, Commerce Secretary William Daley, Mr. Clinton's point man on the China bill, marched to the Capitol today to meet with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and senior members of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill.
Mr. Lott gave no hint of when the Senate will take up the measure, Mr. Daley said in an interview, and when asked how serious Mr. Helms's veiled threats were, the secretary said, "It's hard to judge how serious anything Chairman Helms does."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he and panel's chairman, William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, had no problems with the House bill. "Our job now is to see that the bill stays right on the floor and is passed as it was sent to us," said Mr. Moynihan.

HEADLINE: Are We Happy? Let Us Count the Ways

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"A Happiness Index With a Long Reach" (Arts & Ideas pages, May 20) has a profound implication for the Consumer Price Index. If the C.P.I. is to measure changes in the cost of living, as most analysts think it should, it should incorporate some kind of quality-of-life index. Including an index like Marc Miringoff's social health index or William J. Bennett's cultural index, both of which have shown declines in the last quarter century, would make the cost of living go up faster than the C.P.I. alone. 
 If the C.P.I. is to be an unbiased measure of the cost of living, it must also reflect those aspects of the quality of life that affect consumers.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW;
When Ideas Took Shape And Soared

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SPEAKING at a symposium held at U.C.L.A. in January, the historian Anthony Vidler announced, "All architecture is the result of panic." Panic has broken out with particularly vivid style in "The Triumph of the Baroque," now on view at the National Gallery of Art. A survey of European architecture from 1600 to 1750, the show reveals that buildings, like people, can be overtaken by mass hysteria. For a century and a half, European walls, doors, roofs, windows and entire cities were contorted into quivering, writhing shapes.
Organized by Henry A. Millon of the National Gallery along with Guy Cogeval, Paolo Viti and Marie-Paule Vial, the show documents the histrionics of Baroque architecture with about 100 artifacts, including antique wooden models and period paintings of buildings, gardens and urban vistas. Besides representing a style, the show explores a state of mind. Simultaneously embodying fight and flight, Baroque buildings look eager to escape the very reality they wish to dominate. 
 "The Triumph of the Baroque" can be seen as a sequel to the National Gallery's 1994 exhibition on Renaissance architecture, which also featured large wooden models as its star attractions. In Chapter 1 the models resembled Trojan horses: as expressions of humanism, Renaissance churches and palaces subverted the authority of the feudal institutions they were commissioned to glorify. In Chapter 2 the subversion grows more complex.
Baroque architecture was a theatrical art. Here's how history set the stage: by 1600 all the instruments that would eventually topple absolute authority came into play, but absolutism concentrated ever greater power unto itself. Martin Luther's tracts against the church, published in 1520, were best sellers. They were significant not only because of their content, but because they demonstrated the power of the press as well. Ideas could now be easily circulated. In 1600 Descartes proposed his solution to existence, a philosophical formula that predicated reality on the capacity to doubt. Oh, and by the way, the Earth was no longer the center of the universe.
The word baroque, originally applied to architecture in a pejorative sense, means irregular or misshapen. The show invites us to watch absolutism become literally bent out of shape. The Counter-Reformation granted people the right to question dogma, provided they ultimately submitted to the church. The Baroque style gave architects liberty to pursue infinite formal variations, provided that they ultimately submitted to Classicism. "The Triumph of the Baroque" offers a broad sampling of the results.
The show is organized thematically. Designs from Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and the Netherlands are grouped into sections on ecclesiastical, royal, military and commercial buildings. Besides emphasizing the international reach of the Baroque, this arrangement conveys the extent to which feudal institutions had evolved toward the modern corporate culture. Call it Baroque Inc.: travel specialists for the rich and holy, with an array of services provided by church and state.
The show starts (like Anita Ekberg) with a plunge into the Trevi Fountain in Rome, a stellar tourist attraction that introduces two themes coursing throughout the show: theatricality and psychology. A precisely detailed wood-and-plaster model highlights the fountain's theatrical dimension, for it depicts the palace facade, sans palace, designed by Nicola Salvi for the Trevi's magnificent sculptural tableau.
Since the model does not include water, visitors will have to imagine the Trevi's psychological dimension, or read Eleanor Clark's 1950 book "Rome and a Villa." Clark's chapter on Rome's fountains may well be the finest depiction of the Baroque's emotional atmosphere ever written. "You walk close to your dreams," she begins. "In another minute, people in the crowd will all be naked, or will have fish tails or horses' behinds, like the characters in the fountains. . . . This is the vocabulary of our sleep, and the key image is always water."
The fountains are pieces of urban infrastructure as well as incentives to free association. Fusions of art and technology, they bring the rational and the irrational together at the center of public space. Bernini's Four Rivers fountain in the Piazza Navona, also represented by models and paintings, shows that these waterworks were political emanations as well. The fountain advertised the relocation of the local water supply to the pope's family palace.
It is bizarre to move from this Mediterranean atmosphere toward the gilded dome resembling Chinese bells that crowns St. Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, but models of Russian Baroque buildings are a highlight of this show. This is one of the first occasions in which the Russian Baroque has been presented in a European context. Mr. Millon says that Russian curators have been besieged in the last decade with requests for material on Constructivist design while models of Baroque buildings have gathered dust.
A model of Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg is the most extraordinary of the Russian treasures. Designed from 1750 to 1756 by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, architect of the Winter Palace and other St. Petersburg landmarks, the complex is a cross-axial composition with a cathedral at the center, flanked by four smaller chapels. Rastrelli's palette of gold, celestial blue and white, and the repeating bays of his facades will put some viewers in mind of Balanchine's "Ballet Imperial," with its star ballerina, soloists and precisely drilled corps.
An enfilade of royal residences dominates the Baroque show's second-floor galleries. The great palace of Caserta, court of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, is the finest example of these.
Designed by Luigi Vantivelli from 1756 to 1769, the project induces a dreamlike state without recourse to water. The gentle incline of Caserta's grand staircase, the use of indirect lighting, the twisted pattern of the coffering within the building's domes induce the sensation of suspended gravity. This is Piranesian space, awesome and relentless. In comparison Versailles resembles a poorly planned suburban mall.
Gothic spires are for the soul, Renaissance domes for the mind, Baroque facades for the senses. But there is no telling where emotion, once aroused, will be directed. The most horrifying object in the show is a model of the Great Kremlin Palace. Designed for Catherine the Great by Vasily Ivanovich Bazhenov in 1769-70, this is a vast dominatrix of a building, encircled by stones that resemble the studs on a sadist's belt.
Psychological manipulation has a tendency to backfire. How long would it take before people began to wonder what kind of sovereign would want to appear in public dressed like a Mistress of Pain? Or what kind of saint would want to recline in ecstasy on an altar, like Bernini's sculpture of St. Teresa? In time the Baroque emphasis on psychology would invite the public to question external authority in all its forms. It would accelerate the modernity it sought to retard.
As Christian Norberg-Schulz remarks in the show's excellent catalog, the Baroque era was a time of choices. People could choose a different faith, a different occupation, or they could quit Europe altogether. It was, that is to say, a time of competition, an era that heralded the rise of the consumer and of the arts dedicated to persuading consumers to make a particular choice.
With Baroque architecture, space itself becomes a consumer product. In a recent conversation Mr. Vidler observed that the distorted forms and urban scale of the Baroque register the anxiety that came with the collapse of the distinct boundaries that once surrounded cities. The erosion of medieval fortifications and the rise of new modes of transportation went far toward undermining the traditional sense of place. Baroque spectacle helped to compensate for the loss.
Mr. Millon is correct to suggest that this show will hold special appeal for a generation now preoccupied with computer morphing. Scrolls; spiral columns; trompe l'oeil ceilings that extend physical architecture into the firmament of heavenly illusion; gilded wave crests; cornices folded and refolded to distraction; facades drawn out horizontally to the vanishing point; arches, saints and topiary endlessly repeated as if produced by a malfunctioning keyboard: such devices easily outstrip most of what I have seen on the monitor screens of today's design studios. And they should give pause to those who think that computer-generated, so-called blob architecture has no place in the old bricks-and-mortar world.
The affinity between the Baroque age and our own, however, goes deeper than the formal complexity common to both. We, too, have a complicated relationship to power. In a sense it is the reverse of the predicament in which church and state found themselves in the 17th century. Modern consumer society is committed to a way of life that is constantly corroding authority and its traditional institutions.
Nowhere is this more evident than in our museums, and in the increasing difficulty with which they seek to maintain a balance between scholarship and entertainment, connoisseurship and popularity. The Bilbao branch of the Guggenheim is merely the most prominent in a vast proliferation of museum buildings designed in part as pilgrimage destinations to lure tourist dollars. As such, they are part of the corporate monoculture that many artists want to resist.
The Guggenheim's serpentine steel skin and the Piranesian Turbine Hall of the new Tate Modern in London are formally quite different, but both are innately Baroque in their appeal to the emotions and in their ambition to set culture apart from commerce. Yet they also stand for the increasing importance of culture in the emerging global economy.
Still, I came away from this show convinced that we need more museums, larger museums, better-financed museums, particularly in the United States. The National Gallery show, sponsored by EduCap Inc., presents only one-fourth of an exhibition originally presented in Turin, Italy. I'm glad I didn't catch it there. The National Gallery's 1994 Renaissance show was truncated, too, and after seeing the complete edition at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, I found the abbreviated version a thorough letdown.
A Baroque show four times the size might prove daunting for many visitors. But then the point of this style was to overwhelm the viewer. How amazing it would be to feel overwhelmed by it in the nation's capital. The Baroque is everything Americans came here to escape. And where can we go to flee the Baroque contortions of our day?

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, a picture in Weekend yesterday showing a model for Bernini's sculpture of St. Teresa, with an architecture review of "The Triumph of the Baroque" at the National Gallery of Art, was reproduced in mirror image. St. Teresa should have appeared at the right, with the winged figure at the left.
The caption for the other picture with the continuation of the review carried an incorrect identification from the museum. The work shown was Rastrelli's model for Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg, not Rinaldi's model for the Cathedral of St. Isaac there.

HEADLINE: When Bubbles Are Corporate Ferment;
House of Taittinger, A French Demi-Icon, Is Raider's Quarry

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 25

 BODY:
As Europe's economies and bloated companies streamline, the Continent has become the latest playground for American leveraged-buyout specialists.
The cutthroat tactics of the 1980's, with vulture investors searching the landscape for takeover prey, have fallen somewhat out of fashion in the United States. This phenomenon, it turns out, did not die, but migrated across the Atlantic. 
 In the thick of this trend is one of the brashest and most feared of the old-style raiders, Asher B. Edelman, who is trying to outwit a venerable French family institution, Taittinger, the Champagne maker, luxury-goods producer and top-of-the-line hotel company.
But while corporate raiders used to slash and burn in relatively brief battles, Mr. Edelman is conducting a prolonged siege, having stalked the Taittinger family since 1996.
At one level, the battle has evolved into a clash of personal and corporate styles. Taittinger is represented by its chairman, Claude Taittinger, 72, and his niece Anne-Claire Taittinger, chief executive of the Societe du Louvre, the company that is the main Taittinger asset. They have been scrambling to transform Louvre from a French heirloom into a leaner American-style corporation, and they refuse to deal with Mr. Edelman.
But they face a formidable foe with potent allies, including the New York investor Guy Wyser-Pratte. Through a combination of legal expertise and sharp financial elbows, Mr. Edelman has been transferring the skills he honed in the United States to pursue Louvre. And Mr. Wyser-Pratte has successfully laid siege to another French institution, Groupe Andre, which owns a Champs-Elysees shoe shop, Chaussures Andre, and the Kookai fashion chain.
For Mr. Edelman, giving up seems the furthest thing from his mind. "There's every reason to stay in, and to continue to push for change," he said by phone from New York.
Beyond the clash of French provincial style and American bluntness, larger stakes are in play. As the Andre case showed, old French family companies are under pressure to perform or be taken over. Moreover, the way companies protect themselves is a hot topic of corporate and political debate. Several French companies, like the conglomerate Vivendi and the bank Societe Generale, have recently limited stockholder voting rights, sending minority shareholder groups to the barricades.
Luxury products are hot now, and the Taittinger properties of Societe du Louvre, like the Hotel de Crillon in Paris and the Baccarat crystal works, are thriving. Mr. Edelman thinks that breaking Louvre into separate companies could vastly enhance its value. But the Taittingers say that a loss of family control would weaken the company's image.
Early this month, in a Paris court, Mr. Edelman contested the Taittinger family voting rights in Societe du Louvre. A decision is expected early in June. But even if the court rules against him, Mr. Edelman says he will not give up.
The struggle can be wearing, as each side tries to push on as though the other does not matter. The history of the battle goes like this:
In 1996, Mr. Edelman began buying shares in Taittinger S.A., the holding company that owns the Champagne maker and more than half the voting rights in Societe du Louvre. He also went after Louvre itself, bringing his holdings and those of his allies to about 25 percent. At a stockholders meeting in 1998, Mr. Edelman's group presented a list of 52 questions about the company's inner workings, including delicate matters like whether family members used company apartments rent-free or held fictitious jobs.
Such methods, tastelessly aggressive by Taittinger standards, are part of Mr. Edelman's corporate arsenal. In the 80's, he was feared for his assault on companies like Datapoint, a computer concern he took over after a long and bitter battle. By the early 90's, Mr. Edelman, an avid art collector, retired to Switzerland and opened a gallery. His reputation had become one of lavish living more than of financial acumen. In 1996, his sale of a Jasper Johns painting for $3 million drew attention, as had his sale two years earlier, for $5.8 million, of a 23-room Manhattan apartment overlooking the East River.
But by the mid-90's, he was back at work, running Edelman Value Partners from New York, investing mainly in undervalued French and Swiss stocks.
Despite the sniping, his continuing struggle has had its playful moments. When Claude Taittinger said in an interview that if the Taittingers wanted to paint the Crillon pink, "we can, and Mr. Edelman can't," Mr. Edelman responded by having a can of pink paint delivered to Mr. Taittinger's home.
In this spirited give-and-take, Mr. Edelman has been clear about his motives. He says there is great value to be unlocked in Louvre. He wants to shed nonluxury businesses and focus on the Concorde hotel chain and its flagship, the Crillon, where stars and statesmen congregate; the midprice Envergure hotel chain, and a luxury-goods division centered on a revived Baccarat.
Mr. Edelman makes no secret of wanting to ride the wave of demand for luxury. France remains Europe's, and the world's No. 1 tourist destination, and Societe du Louvre's chief luxury hotels, which also include the Hotel de Louvre in Paris and the Martinez in Cannes, are hot properties. Baccarat he sees as a glass company around which to build a luxury-goods group in the style of Louis Vuitton or Gucci.
"When we first bought in, we thought we would enter into a basic cooperation agreement," he said. "We now see it differently. Whether through a takeover or a proxy fight, in either event we have a plan for three different public companies."
Mr. Wyser-Pratte agrees. Societe du Louvre, he said in a telephone interview, is "highly, highly undervalued," adding, "The value of the assets is two, two and a half times the value of the shares."
But Ms. Taittinger wants no part of a breakup. "We have a very great sense of security," she said in her office paneled in black wood on the edge of Paris. As for Mr. Edelman's continued pressure, she remarked: "It's nothing new. There's no rational explanation for it."
What she wants is to keep Louvre together, to keep focusing on its main businesses. Over the next five years, she wants to double the number of rooms in the Envergure hotels and to spread into markets like Spain, Italy and Eastern Europe.
Ms. Taittinger, a slight, engaging woman of 50, was educated in sociology and urban studies, and says her passion is urban planning. Asked why she joined Louvre in 1979, she hesitated, but an associate who knows her well said, "Duty." In 1997, after running several divisions, including a line of perfumes and Baccarat, she succeeded her father, Jean, then 70, as chief executive.
"A family company must be run like a company," she said, adding that family-owned companies have it harder in France, where envy of wealth is a national sport, than in Germany or Italy.
But the Taittingers are not just any family. Nine Taittingers are listed in "Who's Who in France." Ms. Taittinger's father was mayor of Reims and French minister of justice in the 1970's. Her uncle, Pierre-Christian, was a senator; her brother, Jean-Frantz, is a member of Parliament. Yet business has always been the family's inclination. Ms. Taittinger's son recently dropped out of college to join a dot-com company.
By shedding nonessential businesses like ELM Leblanc, a heating concern, and a controlling share in the private Banque du Louvre, and then sprucing up the perfume and glassware businesses through increased marketing and more closely controlled distribution, Ms. Taittinger raised revenue 10 percent a year, to 677 million euros in 1999, now $617 million. Net profit has risen 52 percent since she took over. Now, Baccarat plans four new stores in the United States, including locations in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
Some of the changes, she acknowledges, came partly in response to Mr. Edelman's pressure. "I have to thank him for the opportunity," she said.
Mr. Wyser-Pratte accuses her of arrogance. "It's the Marie Antoinette story," he said. "Let them eat cake."
Mr. Edelman, for his part, says the improvements are not enough. Claude Taittinger, he said, now brags that Louvre is "run in the Anglo-Saxon fashion." But he added, "They've been put in a position where they have to run it that way." Even with the changes, he said, the hotel chains and luxury-goods businesses have yet to fully exploit the Internet. The company should sell costly hotel buildings, like the Crillon, he says, and concentrate on hotel management. To bolster his arguments, he commissioned a study by Jones Lang LaSalle, the real estate firm.
"The company is basically un-run," he concluded.
Ms. Taittinger says she does not need the advice. What separates the family from Mr. Edelman, she says, is a question of credibility. "And then," she adds, "there is Datapoint."
Indeed, Datapoint stands out as perhaps the muddiest chapter in Mr. Edelman's career as a turnaround artist. Under Mr. Edelman, Datapoint, once a leading-edge producer of computer networking equipment, collapsed, crushed by losses and a series of irregularities. In 1996, when Mr. Edelman was still registered as holding 20 percent of its voting shares, Datapoint settled a lawsuit over a fraudulent Texas land sale after a jury had ordered Datapoint to pay $63 million in penalties.
Five years earlier, Mr. Edelman agreed to pay almost $437,000 in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had accused him of delaying the disclosure of Datapoint stock purchases.
But the past does not interest Mr. Edelman. "If I were to go away," he said of Societe du Louvre, "they would go back to the way they used to run it."

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Renaissance on the Schuylkill

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
This is a city on second base, wondering if it can make it all the way home.
The old Philadelphia, which lived on manufacturing and banking and lawyering, ran out of steam a half-century ago. Now the city is betting a billion dollars and more that a new Philadelphia can prosper on history and culture and tourism -- that people will come here not merely for the obligatory visit to the Liberty Bell with the kids but for several days of meetings, music, art, shopping and good food as well. 
 An unmistakable new energy has taken hold in Center City, as the locals call downtown Philadelphia. Without losing its civilized manners, the city has begun to bounce after dark; Walnut Street's sidewalks are still crowded at 10 p.m. A Democrat, Ed Rendell, a husky, dynamic former mayor, gets much of the credit for setting the transformation in motion, but the first big payoff is this year's Republican National Convention, opening here on July 31.
"People at the convention will see signs of a real renaissance in key parts of the city," said Senator Arlen Specter, who served as Philadelphia's district attorney before heading to Washington. "But don't delude yourself: 15 blocks from the center, enormous problems remain."
Philadelphia was, of course, America's original convention city, beginning in 1774 with the Continental Congress, which two years later produced the Declaration of Independence. But no major political party has held its quadrennial powwow in the city since 1948, when no fewer than three of them did so (the Democrats, to choose Harry S. Truman; the Republicans, to nominate Thomas E. Dewey, and the Progressives, to name Henry A. Wallace).
A lot has happened since then, too much of it bad. Philadelphia lost many of its defining institutions, including The Saturday Evening Post, once the nation's leading magazine; The Bulletin, a powerful and venerable evening newspaper; the Pennsylvania Railroad, one of the first great routes to the West; John Wanamaker's department store, a pioneer of mass merchandising; and the Philadelphia Athletics, who made baseball history under Connie Mack. It had a surly white mayor, Frank Rizzo, whose confrontational approach to blacks was typified by the nightstick he once famously tucked into his cummerbund, and a star-crossed black mayor, W. Wilson Goode, who in 1985 dropped a firebomb on the headquarters of a radical group in his own city.
In 1976 an outbreak of a mysterious respiratory disease killed 34 members of the American Legion attending a convention here.
David L. Cohen, a co-chairman of the host committee for the Republican gathering, defined the status quo ante in these words: "People didn't have low expectations of Philadelphia; they had no expectations of Philadelphia." They saw it, he said, as "an old city, falling apart, dirty and unsafe."
A first important step toward recovery was a new convention center, which opened in 1993. Then, in 1996, 548,000 people came to see a Cezanne exhibition at the Museum of Art -- many of them suburbanites who hadn't been downtown in years, many others from New York, Washington and elsewhere.
Local leaders realized that there was big money in culture. Broad Street got a face-lift and a new name, the Avenue of the Arts, and this year steelwork for a new, $245 million Regional Performing Arts Center began rising there. Designed by Rafael Vinoly of New York in emulation of London's 19th-century Crystal Palace, it is scheduled to open in the fall of 2001.
To house the hoped-for throngs of visitors, 5,000 new hotel rooms have been added in the metropolitan area in four years. Two of the splashiest new hotels and several restaurants have taken over old banks; the metaphor is almost too apt.
The much-admired PSFS building (the letters stand for Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, though few remember that) is now a Loews hotel, with all its architectural glories, including a polished black granite base that bends around a corner, miraculously intact. Designed by William Lescaze and George Howe in 1932, it was the first International Style skyscraper built in this country, just at the end of the Art Deco era. Soon the old Girard Trust Company, a little Ionic temple with a perfect dome, designed in dazzlingly white Georgia marble by Stanford White, will be a Ritz-Carlton.
Philadelphia used to concentrate on food that filled big men up fast: cheese steaks, hoagies, soft pretzels, L. D. Bassett's world-class ice cream, scrapple (a Pennsylvania Dutch blend of cornmeal and unmentionable pig parts), sticky buns and pepper pot soup (a potent brew of honeycomb tripe and hot chilies). Most of the traditional fare can still be found at the Reading Terminal Market (often sold there by Amish or Mennonite women in white gauze caps) or at Bookbinders Seafood House on 15th Street or both.
 
Booming (and Shrinking)
But now the city is a playground for foodies, with heroically hip restaurants opening every month. These are no storefront improvisations; by the end of the year, Neil Stein, who started it all with a place called Striped Bass, will have opened five sophisticated spots at a cost of $10 million. "I think it will work," he told me, "if the economy holds up."
Rick Nichols, who has watched the city's travails for years from various posts at The Philadelphia Inquirer, sounded similarly cautious.
"The fate of Philadelphia really hangs in the balance," he said. "Can we live off this culture-dining-service boom, or do we need more lunch-bucket jobs to keep the thing going?"
Look carefully on the side streets downtown, and you will see vacant shops and even a few vacant buildings. The region's retail nexus is not there but out in the suburbs, at King of Prussia, in a megamall where Hermes and Neiman Marcus and other chic merchants court the carriage trade. Jobs have fled the city, too, as companies like CoreStates Financial and Bell Atlantic have closed or shrunk their Philadelphia offices because of mergers.
New stadiums for the Phillies and Eagles are all talk and no action, and the ballyhooed DisneyQuest mall is just another hole in the ground, its financing having collapsed. Mr. Rendell, now the Democratic national chairman, must be devastated; the project had so excited him that he told an English visitor, "To call it virtual reality is to call Michelangelo a house painter." The city will now have to make do with a $300 million Family Entertainment Center at Penn's Landing on the Delaware River, featuring a children's museum, an 18-screen multiplex cinema, restaurants and a wide range of shops. Not exactly the sort of thing that brings the Renaissance to mind.
William P. Hankowsky, Philadelphia's industrial development czar, acknowledged frankly that "you have two contradictory phenomena here at the same time: Center City is booming, with people moving back downtown, while the population as a whole is still in decline." With some exceptions, like Chestnut Hill, the northern, western and southern parts of Philadelphia are worn and worried. Between 1990 and 1998, the city lost 9.4 percent of its population; of the 10 largest cities in the United States, only Detroit and Philadelphia shrank, and Philadelphia shrank more.
Philadelphians tend to undersell Philadelphia. Is it the Quaker heritage of dour understatement? Or the city's position halfway between the nation's political capital, to the south, and its economic and cultural capital, to the north? Could it possibly be an inferiority complex?
"Cheering against the home team is a time-honored tradition in Philadelphia," wrote the social historian E. Digby Baltzell.
Whatever the reason, locals have allowed a Philadelphia-born comedian of minimal talent, W. C. Fields, to fasten a joke to their city like a barnacle. Asked what he wanted on his gravestone, the great man is said to have replied, "On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia." That one-liner has been repeated ad nauseam.
Yet this has always been a richly endowed city, full of distinctive neighborhoods, a center of artistic and intellectual life since the days of Benjamin Franklin and the Peales, much loved by those who live here. The population is less transient than in most large American cities; Philadelphians may flee to the suburbs, but most of them go no farther.
Whether they call it Philadelphia or Philly, a nickname loved by some and loathed by others, whether they are Rocky Balboas (or Frankie Avalons or Vic Damones) from gritty, Italian-American South Philadelphia or Tracy Lords from the wealthy, pastoral Main Line, they are staunch loyalists.
The Philadelphia story started with that redoubtable Quaker, William Penn, who laid out the city's grid in 1682. It was he, not some latter-day adman, who named it the City of Brotherly Love, and he who gave it many of its characteristics: its respect for education (Temple, Villanova, Haverford, Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr and Drexel, as well as the University of Pennsylvania, with its celebrated Wharton School of Business, carry that tradition forward today); its wide streets and its extensive parks, religious tolerance and closely knit families.
As usual, Mark Twain got the picture. In Boston, he said, people ask, "What does he know?" In New York they ask, "How much does he make?" In Philadelphia, the crucial question is, "Who were his parents?"
Some of those families can be frosty, snobby and self-satisfied, their lives consecrated to the First Troop of the Philadelphia City Cavalry, the Merion Cricket Club and the Union League Club (whose brownstone clubhouse bears a plaque celebrating its loyalty to the North in the Civil War). Many live in the western suburbs known as the Main Line because the Pennsylvania railroad connected them on a route running from Philadelphia to Paoli.
Generations of young college students learned a mnemonic aid to help them find their way home: "Old maids never wed and have babies," for Overbrook, Merion, Narberth, Wynnewood, Ardmore, Haverford, Bryn Mawr.
But of course Philadelphia is not all socialites or Quakers or Italian-Americans, and even if the current gamble succeeds, it will not become a tourist target and little else, like Las Vegas or Orlando. Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Museum of Art, New York-bred but devotedly Philadelphian by adoption, calls this "a city full of nooks and niches."
It is not just Rittenhouse Square, the traditional center of patrician Philadelphia, bounded by mismatched buildings that give it visual vigor, used every day by dogs and bums and Frisbee-tossing adolescents and pram-pushing nannies and students from the nearby Curtis Institute of Music, and celebrated for its vitality by no less than Jane Jacobs.
Philadelphia is also the home of an old and eminent black community, which has produced national leaders like A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., who was a towering presence on the Federal appeals bench; former Congressman William Gray, who now heads the United Negro College Fund; and William Coleman, a former transportation secretary. And it is a river town; the Schuylkill (pronounced SKOO-kul) ) is one of the city's delights, especially on days when it is filled with sculls and eight-oared shells from clubs along its bank. Grace Kelly's father and brother, both named Jack, rowed there and won national titles.
 
From Greek Revival to Pop
The tide of the Revolution flowed through and around Philadelphia. Washington crossed the Delaware just north of town, lost to the redcoats at Germantown and spent the severe winter of 1777-78 at Valley Forge. But it is in the Old City, in the blocks south of Walnut Street between Second and Sixth Streets, that the drama of those astounding years comes to life.
Perhaps it is, as its promoters say, "The Most Historic Square Mile in America." Few visitors miss the Liberty Bell or Independence Hall, where both the Declaration and the Constitution, those two extraordinary products of Enlightenment genius, were debated and finally approved. Even the history-averse are stirred, though the fabric of the buildings has been mended as often as an old sock.
Benjamin Franklin was a dominant figure in the life of the city and the young nation, so it seems fitting that he is buried nearby, across the street from the Free Quaker Meeting House. His grave is strewn with coins tossed by tourists mindful of his maxim "A penny saved is a penny earned"; the site of his house is marked by a steel frame devised by Robert Venturi, a "skeleton" of the original, much more evocative than a mere reconstruction.
But many of the red-brick houses where Washington and Madison and the others lived during the decade from 1790 to 1800, when Philadelphia was the nation's capital, still stand on the cobbled streets, shaded by plane trees, south of the Independence National Historic Park. You can sit in the pews where the Founding Fathers sat (Washington used Pew 58) at Christ Church, whose six-sided, 209-foot steeple, built in 1753 and 1754, was the tallest structure in America for more than a century. Influenced by the work of Gibbs and Wren in London, the church is remarkable for its broad expanses of clear glass.
Some idea of the wealth of Philadelphia may be gained from late Georgian mansions like Cliveden (1767), in Germantown, and Mount Pleasant (1762), in Fairmount Park, the nation's largest urban park. Cliveden, seat of the Chew family, still contains chairs and a sofa by Thomas Affleck, one of the greatest Colonial furniture makers. At the end of the 18th century, Philadelphia was the leading American city. Once the government left, it never again enjoyed that eminence.
But it built as if it did. That was the doing mainly of Nicholas Biddle, the city's social, cultural and financial star (and the founder of its most notable dynasty of civic leaders). He returned from a trip to Athens in 1806 with this in his diary: "The two great truths in the world are the Bible and Grecian architecture."
Soon the city was awash in Greek Revival temples, from the Philadelphia Water Works (1819) along the Schuylkill River to Biddle's own magnificent house, Andalusia (1836), high above the east bank of the Delaware, with a grand, six-column-wide portico designed by Thomas U. Walter. The Second Bank of the United States (1819-1824), designed by William Strickland, parts of which literally copied the Parthenon, is the masterpiece of the genre. In this white marble temple, Biddle, the bank's president, fought with Henry Clay against Andrew Jackson for control of the nation's monetary supply, and lost.
 
Monuments and Culture
Ever since Biddle's day, Philadelphia has had a taste for the monumental. A climax of sorts was reached in the exuberant Second Empire City Hall (1872-1901), a hulking, multi-pavilioned mountain of a building topped by a statue of the city's founder, William Penn. The creation of Alexander Milne Calder, Penn stands up there in a broad-brimmed hat, all of 37 feet tall.
Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the city's ceremonial boulevard, is a Calder-to-Calder-to-Calder triple play. Halfway along its length, one comes to Logan Circle, which was modeled after the Place de la Concorde in Paris; the fountain in the center is by A. M.'s son, Alexander Stirling Calder. At the far end of the parkway, at the top of the steps leading up to the Greek Revival facade of the Museum of Art (remember them from "Rocky"?), stands a bold red stabile called "The Eagle," by A. S.'s son, Alexander Calder.
The transitional figure in Philadelphia architecture was Frank Furness, whose taste for the exotic and the eclectic is evident in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His enthusiasm for certain kinds of foliate decoration communicated itself to a young draftsman in his office named Louis Sullivan, who returned to Chicago and became a pioneer modernist.
Philadelphia has had two great latter-day modernists: Louis I. Kahn, whose Richards laboratories at Penn (1960-64) turn the unavoidable technological folderol into crisp design elements, prefiguring the Pompidou Center in Paris, and Mr. Venturi, the father of Pop architecture. For me at least, local buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright (a synagogue in Elkins Park) and Helmut Jahn (the Liberty Place skyscrapers) are less successful.
The Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Orchestra are both ranked among the top five or six institutions of their kind in the nation.
Founded exactly 100 years ago, the orchestra is older. Wolfgang Sawallisch, its current music director, surprised many here by presenting its subscribers with a centennial program composed entirely of 20th-century music, from Scriabin and Poulenc to Lutoslawski and Takemitsu. Many of the pieces had been given their American premieres by the orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and Leopold Stokowski, who introduced Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" here in 1922. Joseph H. Kluger, the orchestra's president, said that the programs of more-or-less modern music had given a boost to single-ticket sales, brought the average age of audiences down and provided "an idea we plan to build on."
The orchestra has been housed for years in the Academy of Music, a charming, 143-year-old opera house whose acoustics are poor for symphonic music. Soon the orchestra will be the main tenant in the new arts center, and a new conductor is expected to replace Mr. Sawallisch, who is 76, once the move is made. The move is not without controversy; the old academy may be the city's most beloved building, and neither the Pew nor the Annenberg foundations, two of the city's cultural mainstays, contributed to the new center's cost.
Nonetheless, it will confer at least one indisputable benefit on the city by opening more room at the academy for the Philadelphia Opera, which has made considerable progress under Robert B. Driver, and the Pennsylvania Ballet. Their growth has been stunted by a dearth of free dates there.
Across from the academy is the Wilma Theater, designed by Hugh Hardy. Two Czech-born directors, Blanka and Jiri Zizka, present works there by David Gow, Tom Stoppard and many others, in productions that are often controversial but very seldom dull.
 
A Vast Bastion of Art
The vast, honey-colored Museum of Art looks as if it had been there for 700 years, not 70. It will soon get an annex -- an Art Deco building across the street, which will provide 100,000 square feet of additional space. Its holdings are enormous, ranging from period rooms (including one by the great Scottish designer Robert Adam) to impressive arrays of armor and Oriental art. It also continues, in the tradition of the Cezanne show, to mount and aggressively promote special shows, though I must confess that I found the current exhibition of 18th-century Roman art a letdown; for me, it's a struggle to accept Pompeo Batoni as a seminal figure among European painters.
But the museum's permanent painting collections more than make up for that. Its old masters are dominated by the pictures accumulated by John G. Johnson, the prototypical Philadelphia lawyer, who appeared a record 168 times before the Supreme Court. And his pictures (among them arresting works by van Eyck and Giovanni di Paolo) are dominated by the majestic Rogier van der Weyden portrayal of the Crucifixion with the Virgin and St. John the Evangelist.
The austere figures are shown against brilliant red hangings, the Virgin crumpling in grief, Christ's loincloth lifted by some mysterious force. It is the saddest, greatest painting in the museum and one of the greatest in the United States. I have sat before it a dozen times, always mesmerized.
In another part of the building are assembled the brilliant, before-their-time collections of Walter and Louise Arensberg and A. E. Gallatin, notably Miros, Brancusis and Duchamps, including the once-scandalous "Nude Descending a Staircase." At the moment, the modern galleries are being renovated, but that gives visitors a chance to see (and compare) three large-scale masterpieces in one small room: Leger's colorful, mechanistic "City"; Picasso's "Three Musicians," a pivotal example of Synthetic Cubism; and Cezanne's architectonic yet lyrical "Large Bathers."
Of course, the museum also prides itself on its paintings by local artists, and it would be a mistake to miss Thomas Eakins's "Concert Singer." But a greater Eakins painting, "The Gross Clinic," hangs at Thomas Jefferson University, and others are at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, where the painter sought solace on Sunday afternoons.
Art is, in fact, almost omnipresent in and around Philadelphia. In Merion, the truly fabulous Barnes collection (reserve in advance) mixes rustic ironwork with paintings that people travel thousands of miles to see. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts boasts a brilliant American collection, including superb works by Gilbert Stuart, Winslow Homer and all the Peales. The museum at the University of Pennsylvania houses the golden treasures from the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, amid much else. And the Rosenbach Museum and Library contains not only the rare books and manuscripts accumulated by A. S. W. Rosenbach, a scholarly, piratical dealer who helped to build the Folger Library in Washington and the Huntington Library near Los Angeles, but also important antique furniture.

HEADLINE: Angry Election Monitor Leaves Peru 2 Days Before Runoff Vote

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, May 26

 BODY:
The head of the Organization of American States observation team, saying he had been deceived by Peruvian officials, angrily left Peru today, two days before the presidential runoff election that he was supposed to monitor to guarantee against vote fraud.
"The conditions of the election do not provide a strong basis of legitimacy," said the organization's chief, Eduardo Stein, who has been the senior foreign observer of a process that has been tainted with allegations of dirty tricks and fraud. "I feel deceived and disappointment." 
 Mr. Stein's views will be crucial as his organization and the Clinton administration and the United States Congress consider applying economic sanctions on the government of President Alberto K. Fujimori. In a report released late Thursday, after the government's announcement that it would not postpone the runoff on Sunday, Mr. Stein's team offered a stinging rebuke.
"The Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could be considered free and fair," the observation team said.
The team then ordered its election observers to leave Peru.
Mr. Fujimori's election to a third five-year term was effectively assured when his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, dropped out of the race last week, saying that he was not ready to enter "a butcher shop" of fraud in a fixed election.
But Mr. Stein, with Washington's full backing, tried to mediate a solution between Mr. Toledo and the government in which the election could be postponed to give foreign observers ample time to test computer programs to make sure that the count would be transparent and clean.
Mr. Stein, a former foreign minister of Guatemala, led the international criticism of the first-round balloting, on April 9, saying, "Something sinister is happening here," as ballots and tally sheets disappeared for hours without explanation and votes were counted in undisclosed locations. Mr. Fujimori fell just short of winning an outright majority victory in that round, according to an official tabulation made over three days as the United States and other countries pressed for a runoff.
Since that round, Mr. Stein has been cajoling the government to stop spending public money in the Fujimori campaign and open television networks to covering the opposition. He has had limited success.
In the last few days, Mr. Stein had expressed renewed optimism that an agreement could be worked out, with a new date to be set on June 4 or some weeks later. Negotiations had reached the level where Mr. Fujimori was talking directly by telephone with Cesar Gaviria, head of the Organization of American States and a former president of Colombia, Peruvian officials said.
Mr. Stein said he saw strong indications that the government would postpone the election as late as midday Thursday, before he was shocked by the news in the afternoon that the National Elections Commission voted, 3 to 2, against a postponement. "We were led to believe that there was going to be a favorable outcome," he said.
The decision was met with an increase in violent demonstrations across Peru, including a rock and gasoline bomb attack on the presidential palace by protesters late Thursday.
In a television interview today, Mr. Fujimori brushed aside Mr. Stein's complaints. "Globalization does not mean there can be unlimited intervention in a country's internal affairs," he said. "The software problems have been resolved. There will be no fraud."

HEADLINE: Demand for Big-Ticket Goods Logged Steep Decline in April

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Demand for big-ticket goods in April registered its steepest decline since late 1991, and consumer spending rose at its slowest pace in nine months, the government said today, indicating that the economy may be slowing.
Orders to factories for costly manufactured goods fell an unexpected 6.4 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $205.6 billion, pulled down by a record drop in demand for electronics, the Commerce Department said in one of two economic reports it released today. Economists had been expecting a decline of only 0.5 percent. 
 Americans also pulled back slightly in April from their generally free-spending ways, the second report showed.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity and is the engine of the supercharged economy, rose 0.4 percent last month. That was the smallest increase since July.
At the same time, American incomes, a category that includes wages, interest and government benefits, grew by a brisk 0.7 percent, the second month in a row in which income went up faster than spending. The figures on consumer spending and income were in line with forecasts.
Looking at both reports, "we might conclude there is some fraying around the edges of the booming economy -- that the economy is going from white-hot to perhaps simply red-hot," said Mark Zandi, an economist with RFA Dismal Sciences. "We might be seeing the first signs that the broader economy is throttling back a notch."
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since last June, including an aggressive half-point increase last week, trying to slow the economy and keep inflation from becoming a problem.
The increases are intended to raise borrowing costs and cool demand for big-ticket items like cars and homes.
"Together, the reports provide unambiguous evidence of a slowdown emerging," said Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
The reports, economists said, suggested that the Fed's interest rate increases were beginning to bite. But analysts offered conflicting views as to whether the reports would discourage the Fed from raising rates again in June.
The 6.4 percent decline in orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- was the steepest since December 1991 and followed the first increase this year, a 4.5 percent rise in March.
A record 20.1 percent plunge in orders for electronics and electrical equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and home appliances, led the April decline.
Even with the big drop in April, total durable-goods orders in the first four months of the year are running 7.6 percent higher than the same period a year earlier, evidence of the economy's strength.
In the other report, the government said the slower growth in spending helped lift the personal savings rate, or savings as a percentage of after-tax income, to 0.7 percent in April, the best showing since January.

HEADLINE: House Vote on China Trade: The Politics Was Local

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The most important foreign policy vote so far this year, the 237-to-197 House approval of the China trade deal, was no new affirmation of internationalism by an often provincial Congress, but a reaffirmation of one of its oldest truths: Members vote their districts.
That is, they vote their districts if their constituents have an interest, and a trade bill is a singular foreign policy measure because the question of jobs gained and lost commands attention from lawmakers and constituents ordinarily not much concerned about the rest of the world. 
 But other foreign policy matters have far smaller constituencies, and are much more subject to Washington's political influences, especially partisanship. To put it meanly, each party plays politics with foreign policy; to put it kindly, each trusts presidents of its own party but discerns grave weaknesses on the other side.
In any case, the "internationalist" Republicans who supported President Bush's Persian Gulf war in 1991 suddenly became "isolationist" Republicans who opposed President Clinton over military action in Somalia (where Mr. Bush actually had sent the troops), as well as in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Democrats, meanwhile, eagerly seized the labels the Republicans had dropped.
There are some members of Congress who take the "internationalist" view on trade, intervention abroad, United Nations financing and comparable issues regardless of party, at least most of the time.
But looking at a dozen key votes dating back to the gulf war, there are only 10 current House members who voted that way all the time. Several are Southern Democrats with no union pressure over trade to worry about. Two are Democrats from Washington State, where union desires to sell Boeing airplanes to China overcome all other trade questions. And one is a moderate Republican, Representative Constance A. Morella from the suburbs of Washington, D.C.
But most representatives rise or fall on domestic records, and for them "foreign policy is totally unimportant most of the time," said Barbara Bardes, a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati. "They are available for those swing votes as long as it doesn't hurt them."
And more of them are available these days because two factors encouraging instinctive support of a president no longer matter.
One was the cold war, which drew the argument that the United States would seem weak to the Soviet Union if the president could not enforce his foreign policy views, even in areas of no concern to Moscow.
A second is the departure of the World War II generation from Congress. Only nine veterans of that war now serve in the House. The Senate has lost the voice of Bob Dole, who could tell his colleagues that once the president had made a decision, even a weak one, he must be supported.
The "sort of 'president knows best' attitude is gone," said another student of Congressional behavior on foreign policy, James McCormack, an Iowa State University political scientist.
Indeed, that generation has been replaced by the skeptical veterans and nonveterans of the Vietnam era, for whom "the commander-in-chief thing doesn't work," Dr. Bardes said. "They are worried about becoming too involved."
That attitude produces resolutions demanding withdrawal of troops from Bosnia and Kosovo, delays in appropriations for drug wars in Colombia and, at its most intense level, Senate rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
The consequence is that, "given the polarization of the parties, almost any major initiative requires a major effort" by the president, said Bob Pastor, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta.
This China trade bill got that intense effort, not just from the administration, but from business and House Republicans, too.
But without outside allies of the weight of the business interests that backed this bill, the administration lost the nuclear test treaty and faces continual difficulties in getting the money to pay back dues to the United Nations.
That effort was required because even if this was fundamentally a trade bill, where most of the votes depended on jobs gained for Florida fertilizer mills or lost to textile plants in North Carolina, it also carried the baggage of a foreign policy measure about a Chinese government that no one in Congress will defend. This was not a pure trade measure, like the question of extending lower tariffs to Chile.
The 57 Republicans who voted no were primarily motivated by China's treatment of Christians and political dissidents, plus its reported espionage activity against the United States. And others were tempted, doubting the argument that trade would broaden Chinese society.
Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado dripped with sarcasm: "We have been told wonderful things will flow from expanded trade with China. Workers' rights will be respected, religious freedom will be enhanced, and probably Jeffersonian study groups will be popping up all over China."
But supporters like Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, disagreed. She quoted a clergyman, Rev. Daniel Baida Su, who told the Ways and Means Committee that the deal and membership in the World Trade Organization obliged "China to play by the rules."
"In the process, China will need to strengthen its legal institutions, train more legal professionals, learn to follow international legal procedures, and educate its people about the concept of rights, law and international norms," Ms. Johnson quoted Mr. Su as saying. "This process alone is a breakthrough with important philosophical implications for China as a nation. When a Chinese realizes he has rights as an investor that government should not violate, then more likely he will also realize that he has other rights as a human being."
But her argument would not have prevailed without the sense in Congress that more jobs were to be gained than lost, and without the labor opposition suffering from the label of "protectionism," concerned about saving the jobs of union members at the expense of the American economy in general.
John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called that label "very unfair." He said in an interview: "We realize the value of trade with any country. We recognize the expansion of globalization. But in this new global economy, we must strive for rules that protect human rights and workers rights and the environment and not just profits."
It was the bill itself that was protectionist, he said, as an "outright attempt to protect profits without any concern for human rights and workers' rights."
That argument was often heard on the House floor. Representative Janice D. Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, said the bill encouraged United States companies to take "advantage of the nearest slave labor conditions and wages." That sort of attack went largely unchallenged.
But arguments like those of Representative Marge Roukema prevailed. The New Jersey Republican saw huge opportunities for American energy, gas, construction, telecommunications and engineering companies in China. "Not only for New Jersey," she said, "but for the nation, the bottom line here is that this is a jobs bill."

HEADLINE: Almost an Energy Alternative;
FuelCells Hold Promise, but Problems Remain

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CARLSBAD, Calif.

 BODY:
Jeff Colborn plunged into fusion energy research in the late 1980's, first at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, filled with idealism about fusion's potential for revolutionizing nuclear power generation.
"I wanted the toughest challenge," said Mr. Colborn, recalling the goals he had after studying engineering and physics at the University of California at Berkeley. 
 But the entrepreneurial Mr. Colborn, who founded a business during high school selling decals for the motorcycles he and his friends raced, fretted that it could take 50 years before anyone could build a business on fusion. No wonder he is more at home these days as founder and chief executive of Metallic Power Inc., a little-known entrant in the intense race to design and manufacture fuel cells, low-pollution devices that generate electrical current from chemical reactions.
Although they are similar in many ways to batteries, fuel cells can be quickly regenerated by pumping in new chemical fuel. And unlike fusion, they are teetering on the edge of becoming big business. Several hundred units have been sold already, and some analysts predict a billion-dollar market by 2005.
The last steps are not coming easily, though. No one is making money yet, and the technology is not ready for potential home-run markets, like power for vehicles.
The fuel cell companies' slow path highlights the difficulties of innovating for the nuts-and-bolts dimension of the economy. Though this is not the fusion world it is also not the Internet world, where new services can be up and running within weeks and barriers to entry are low.
"People have gotten used to the pace of change of information technology," said Vincent R. Shiely, a vice president who oversees new ventures -- including a research partnership with Metallic Power -- at the Briggs & Stratton Corporation, the largest manufacturer of nonautomotive gasoline engines. "But this is pushing the frontier of materials, and there are still basic technology and reliability questions."
Fuel cell companies are developing everything from replacements for tiny batteries like those used in cell phones and hearing aids to highly efficient power plants big enough to fit the needs of electric utility companies.
The challenge is to come up with answers to conflicting demands for, among other things, lightness, reliability, durability and low cost.
Metallic Power has been slowed down by annoyingly mundane problems like troubles making its early designs leak-proof. But there have also been scarier roadblocks, as when Mr. Colborn and Stuart I. Smedley, his chief technology officer, reached the painful conclusion that a system they had adapted from other researchers for converting wastes back into recyclable fuel was hopelessly unreliable.
Mr. Smedley, a former university professor from New Zealand, eventually came up with a new design that was much simpler, one-tenth the size, and, perhaps best of all, something that Metallic Power's lawyer say he believes is patentable. But it took many months.
"Multiplying the ideal time for each stage by two has turned out to be a pretty accurate predictor of what actually happens," Mr. Colborn said. "Our schedule has stretched."
Metallic Power was founded in 1995 but did not produce its first primitive prototype until late 1997. The company faces steep challenges. Not only is it a relative newcomer with far less capital than many others; it is also using zinc as its fuel, a radically different approach from what nearly everyone else uses.
Several venture capitalists unfamiliar with the energy business got cold feet after looking closely at Mr. Colborn's plans. Among them was a restaurant owner. "I spent a lot of time driving to L.A. and eating in his restaurant," Mr. Colborn said, but the prospect dropped out when it came time to sign a check. "Everybody thinks fuel cells are cool, but when they get into it they discover they know nothing about it."
Mr. Colborn got a better reception from energy-focused investors like Robert W. Shaw Jr., president of the Arete Corporation, an investment firm based in Center Harbor, N.H., that manages money for utilities. "Every fuel cell company is struggling with similar problems," said Mr. Shaw, whose company's fuel cell investments include $2 million of the $8.6 million Metallic Power has raised in two rounds of financing. "At the end of the day, this company is going to make something, and it could have a long-term, sustainable advantage."
The payoff for fuel cell innovators could be breathtaking, especially if someone can create products that meet the performance needs of the auto industry. "As soon as someone has a system that operates in all environments at the cost of combustion engines, which is about $50 per kilowatt, it will take over the world," said Patrick Grimes, an energy consultant in Scotch Plains, N.J. "Some ell system will get there."
Mr. Colborn's company is focusing first on market niches that can afford far higher prices per kilowatt and are more likely to generate near-term profits, starting with portable generators for homes and small businesses.
History supports a cautious approach. Fuels cells were described in concept as far back as 1839, but when it came to designing products, other power sources -- from batteries to internal combustion engines to steam turbines -- always seemed to have a better cost-benefit mix.
So far, fuel cells' only big success has been on space missions, where cells have been used for more than 30 years and cost has been a negligible concern. But there has been renewed interest in recent years, bolstered by new electronic controls, better understanding of which chemicals would make the best fuel cells and, perhaps most important, government research grants and stricter environmental regulations.
A lot of the interest has been focused on hydrogen-based designs. Most hydrogen cells extract hydrogen from hydrocarbons like gasoline, natural gas or methane. The purified hydrogen reacts with oxygen drawn from the air to create electricity and water vapor.
Metallic Power, however, is working instead with zinc, which produces electricity and zinc oxide, a harmless powder used in cosmetics, when suspended in an alkaline liquid and then exposed to oxygen. Zinc/air cells, as they are called, are in theory simpler and cheaper than their hydrogen counterparts, according to Mr. Colborn. Other companies experimenting with zinc/air fuel cells include zinc/air battery makers like EVonyx Inc., a subsidiary of Reveo Inc., in Elmsford, N.Y., and Electric Fuel Ltd. of Israel.
Zinc's biggest disadvantage is that nothing can match the infrastructure already in place for distributing hydrogen. Automotive fuel cells based on hydrogen, for example, could be refueled by today's gas stations with relatively modest changes.
Hydrogen-based fuel cells are the only commercially available products, and numerous new variants are well down the development path.
The company most in the Wall Street spotlight is Ballard Power Systems Inc., a publicly traded Canadian company that is 25 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler. In recent months, Ballard has shipped a stationary 250-kilowatt fuel cell generator to European utilities for testing; introduced an improved, compact version of its first automotive cell, which Ford Motor is testing; and announced a partnership with the Sunbeam Corporation's Coleman Powermate unit, a big distributor of portable electric generators, to develop a co-branded fuel cell.
A newer entrant, Plug Power Inc. of Latham, N.Y., is developing refrigerator-sized cells that run on natural gas or propane for use as home power sources. Plug Power went public in October at $15 a share and soared to a high of $149.75 on March 10. But investors fled after a dose of reality about the pace of development: the company passed a deadline without meeting design requirements of the General Electric Company, a joint venture partner, which was to buy 485 cells. The shares ended Friday at $39.4375.
Multinational companies have largely been participating as investors and partners but some multinationals are more directly involved. The United Technologies Corporation owns International Fuel Cells of South Windsor, Conn., the developer of the fuel cells used on space missions and a stationary power system that has been installed in more than 200 commercial and institutional sites. And Siemens of Germany, with support from the Department of Energy, is field-testing a high-temperature hydrogen cell that could operate in tandem with gas turbines at power plants.
Metallic Power, by contrast, is not scheduled to deliver its first testing prototypes to partners like Briggs & Stratton and potential customers like the Army until the end of the year. Its more immediate goal is to complete a demonstration unit by July that will show how a portable cell for backup power can be kept running when fuel runs out simply by popping a new fuel cartridge in place. The target audience is venture capitalists; Metallic Power hopes to raise an additional $10 million to $15 million by the end of the year.
At a recent staff meeting, Mr. Colborn and three other senior managers pored over a chart showing the breakdown of the fuel cell into scores of components. They pondered where weight could be cut by design changes. Weight was not a concern for the July goals, but promises had been made to Briggs and others about the year-end prototypes, and Mr. Colborn wanted assurances that the July unit could be finished without compromising delivery of the prototypes.
Mr. Colborn is also juggling the demands of raising capital, nearly doubling his work force to about 50 by the end of the year and moving to larger quarters. He is determined to move methodically, arguing that in the turbulent world of fuel cells, Metallic Power is not as far behind the hydrogen companies as it looks if the finish line is defined as profitability.
"They are ahead of us in what they've put in the field, but they are too expensive," he said, predicting that Metallic Power will be among the first to become profitable if it meets its goals of commercial sales in 2002.
Mr. Colborn is quick to acknowledge, though, that the hydrogen cell designers are bringing down costs. "Realistically," he said, "the best thing that could happen for us is that they succeed -- but not a whole lot sooner than us."

HEADLINE: A Land Use Struggle Over a Forest Bounty

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SITKA, Alaska

 BODY:
Carved by ice and washed by as much as 12 feet of rain a year, the Tongass National Forest stretches across Alaska's panhandle, full of coastal fjords and majestic strands of spruce, cedar and hemlock, which John Muir described in 1879 as a seemingly "indefinite, on-leading expansiveness."
Indeed, at 17 million acres, the Tongass is more than three times the size of any other national forest. But as the Clinton administration promotes its far-reaching plan to safeguard the forests by banning new road building throughout much of the system, the Tongass has a curious distinction: it is the one national forest specifically exempted from such a ban. 
 There are already more than 4,000 miles of logging roads snaking through the rain forest here, built as part of the nation's most heavily subsidized logging program, one that costs taxpayers about $30 million a year but is fiercely defended by Alaska's tiny but powerful Congressional delegation.
With 400 miles of new federal logging roads slated to be built in the Tongass rain forest over the next four years, the exemption has already set off a battle between national environmental groups and the timber industry.
And here in southeast Alaska, where the tourism industry now outpaces timber as a source of jobs, the debate over whether to build more logging roads in the world's largest remaining stretch of temperate rain forest is also surprisingly spirited, in a way that would have been unthinkable a generation ago when logging was firmly seen as the great spur to jobs in the sparsely populated area.
While logging interests complain that environmental restrictions have already cost the region hundreds of good jobs over the years and closed down two big mills, many of those who make their money by guiding tourists and sport fishers through the spectacular inlets and past the emerald forests favor more protections, and even an end to any clear-cutting in the Tongass.
And while just about everyone here agrees that America's largest, wildest national forest holds great resources, the core question in the debate is this: just how much of an economic resource is untouched wilderness?
"A lot of Alaskans don't like what we are inevitably becoming -- a place where people come to see it, rather than to exploit it," said Richard Nelson, a writer and cultural anthropologist who is on the board of the Sitka Conservation Society, an environmental group that wants to include the Tongass in President Clinton's ban on new road building.
"The whole frontier philosophy, the whole conquest-of-wilderness mentality, is certainly alive and well here," Mr. Nelson said. "But there is a whole opposite ethic that is growing fast."
There is no question that much of the battle over what to do with the Tongass will be fought in Washington.
For environmentalists, "leaving the Tongass out of this plan is like deciding to protect all national parks except Yellowstone," said Matthew Zencey, the Washington-based manager of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign, an umbrella coalition that hopes to have much of the forest protected by a road ban.
The timber industry is similarly animated, saying the Tongass is already subject to a federal "management plan" that balances wilderness protection in the area with a prudent amount of logging. The administration, in fact, cited that plan in exempting Tongass from its road restrictions, although other areas also have management plans. But critics of the exemption have suggested that the administration was merely trying to avoid picking a fight with Alaska's senators, who both lead committees that have authority over the forest service.
But as the land use struggle ensues thousands of miles away, people who live here are also clearly divided over whether the forest is chiefly useful for timber, or tourism, or both in equal measure.
In Sitka, for instance, the onetime capital of Russian America that is ringed by forests, sea and a snow-covered volcano on a nearby island, the city split a few years ago (1,702 against, 1,068 for) when a nonbinding measure was put on the local ballot to make it the city's official policy to oppose clear-cutting in the nearby national forest.
Both tourism and fishing now outrank the timber industry as a source of jobs in southeast Alaska, according to the state's Department of Labor and Workforce Development, a situation that is radically different from the case 25 years ago and that logging officials attribute to protections that environmentalists have already secured for the Tongass.
One came in the Carter administration, setting aside more than five million acres as wilderness, and another in the Bush administration, when Congress agreed to phase out much of a subsidy that was allowing two major timber companies to pay as little as $2 for huge Sitka spruce logs that would fetch about $300 on the open market. The subsidy dated to the 1950's, when the United States Forest Service agreed to provide a steady supply of timber at low prices to two companies that agreed to build pulp mills in the area.
Both of those mills are closed now -- one near here may be reconverted into a privately owned water-bottling plant, under a plan that is still being negotiated -- and the area now welcomes about 700,000 tourists every summer, more than double the number a decade ago. Many come in the cruise ships that glide by the magnificent scenery and dock in and around the coastal towns. Others come to fish with one of the dozens of guide companies that advertise their services in what many call "the salmon capital of the world."
Tourism is all well and good, but there is no reason for that industry not to coexist with continued logging, said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of a committee that oversees natural resources.
"So a tourist in Alaska comes in on a boat, and he gets off in Ketchikan or Juneau, and maybe spends a little money here, spends a little money there, and gets back on the boat," Mr. Murkowski said in a telephone interview from Washington. "That's important. It's a significant contribution. But it's not sufficient. What we really do well is, we grow timber and we grow fish. And they're both renewable if you do it correctly."
Besides, he added: "If we've done such a bad job with this forest in Alaska, then why is it still so scenic today for tourism? Why do so many people still want to come here?"
Under the president's plan, the Forest Service would ban road building in areas of the national forests where there are currently no roads. The plan would protect about 43 million acres that could be logged, roughly one-quarter of the 192 million acres in the national forest system. That would reduce planned timber harvests, now at about 3.6 billion board feet a year, by about 700 million board feet. (There are about 10,000 board feet of lumber in an average-size American home.)
But under the administration's recently announced preference, no such ban would apply in the 17-million-acre Tongass forest, and a decision on whether to impose a ban would not be made until 2004.
The Forest Service's program in the Tongass already operates at a deficit of about $30 million a year, meaning that the federal government pays that much more to build roads and maintain the forest than it takes in from timber companies, which grind most of the trees to a pulp that is sold for export.
That subsidy used to be even larger, and the program remains popular in some quarters here.
"Yes, we manage forests at a net loss for the taxpayer," said Bob Weinstein, the mayor of Ketchikan, a timber town at the southeastern tip of the state. "But that doesn't bother me until such time as the United States government eliminates every direct or indirect subsidy for any business."
Mayor Weinstein, a visceral opponent of a road building ban in the Tongass, said logging areas were typically well out of the view of tourists anyway.
"If there are cuts," he said, "the Forest Service has made sure they can't be seen from passing cruise ships."
The lush growing areas most prized by logging companies, however, are precisely the same areas that are most critical for wildlife habitat, conservationists say. The region, roughly the size of West Virginia, has one of the largest concentrations of bald eagles and grizzly bears anywhere in the world and is also considered one of the largest stretches left of temperate (as opposed to tropical) rain forest.
James Lyons, the assistant agriculture secretary in charge of the Forest Service, said the Tongass was exempted from a road ban under the recent proposal because it had already been subject to an intensive, yearslong review process that resulted in a 1997 "management plan" aimed at balancing wilderness protection with continued logging.
Total logging in the forest now amounts to about 150 million board feet annually, having steadily dropped from a high of 590 million board feet in 1973. Environmental groups said that areas served by existing logging roads already provided enough land for a sustainable timber harvest, and that the road ban should be extended here.
But Senator Murkowski said the logging statistics indicated that environmentalists had already gotten the upper hand in the Tongass.
"Now they want it all," he said. "Have you ever met with an environmental group that's satisfied? If they were satisfied, they wouldn't have a cause. They'd have to shut up shop and retire."
Logging industry officials also said they were extremely skeptical of environmentalists' claims that tourism would be the economic lifeblood of the area.
"When they get finished shutting down logging, they're going to go after the cruise ships," said Jack Phelps, executive director of the Alaska Forest Association, a trade group based in Ketchikan. "They think there're too many people coming here."
And, indeed, there is evidence that some Alaskans feel they are overrun with tourists: Juneau has slapped visitors' fees on those who arrive by boat, and Sitka residents voted down a proposal to build a dock that would have allowed more cruise ships to moor in town rather than out in the bay. (Many cruise ships offload their passengers onto smaller boats to bring them into town.)
But Eric Jordan, a second-generation fisherman here in Sitka who also runs a guide business, said the local economy was stronger today than when the mill went out of business. The air and waters are much cleaner too, Mr. Jordan said.
"When the mill actually closed and that cloud of smoke was lifted, both psychologically and literally, an amazing thing happened," he said. "Property values shot up, and they've been going up ever since. The reality was more palatable than dealing with this constant threat that the economy would collapse if the mill went. I really think the psychology of the town has brightened in a lot of respects."

HEADLINE: COST OF INSURANCE FOR CARS IS RISING ACROSS THE NATION

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
After falling for two years, car insurance premiums around the country are climbing once again, resuming a steady quarter-century rise.
Several big insurers -- including Progressive, Geico, State Farm and Allstate -- have begun imposing higher prices, and analysts say that by the end of the year most other leading companies are likely to follow suit. The insurers said they were forced to act because of rising expenses for repairs and treatment of injuries. 
 "The trend is clearly upward," said Thomas V. Cholnoky, who follows auto insurance for Goldman, Sachs.
While the size of the increases has varied widely -- and some companies are still cutting prices -- rises of at least 4 to 5 percent have not been uncommon. And a few companies have raised prices in some states by more than 10 percent. Analysts and industry executives say they expect more of the same next year.
In New York and Connecticut, the first signs of the shift are appearing. But the situation is less clear in New Jersey, where spending on car insurance -- averaging $1,150 a year a car, compared with $700 nationally -- has been the highest in the country. Last year the legislature took the unusual step of ordering a 15 percent cut in prices.
While expenses for insurers may well be rising in New Jersey, as elsewhere, industry executives said it was difficult to predict whether those costs would be offset by legislative changes aimed at reducing fraud and litigation and, if not, to what extent political leaders would permit price increases.
Consumer advocates say the increases may not be justified. J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America, said that while some costs were rising, expenses for insurers, over all, were still declining.
Americans spent an estimated $126 billion last year on car insurance, which is mandatory in all states. That was nearly four times what they paid to insure their homes. There are many more claims involving cars and passengers than for homes, though, and liability claims in the hundreds of thousands of dollars are much more common in car crashes than in incidents related to homes.
Besides raising prices, insurers are reducing or eliminating discounts and screening applicants more carefully so that they apply the highest rates to the riskiest drivers and simply refuse to sell to some. Several companies have also been hacking away at administrative expenses, with layoffs in some cases.
Consumer advocates say that to make sure of getting the best deal as prices are rising, people should review their bills and check prices with several companies. But rather than basing coverage decisions on price alone, the advocates advise people to talk with friends and insurance regulators to learn how various companies treat customers.
Prices for auto insurance had risen steadily since 1973, and in theyears through 1997 they rose more than twice as fast as inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But in 1998 they fell 2.8 percent and last year 3.2 percent, said Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group in New York. Insurers said they had cut their prices to reflect falling costs for claims.
Fewer and less serious accidents were occurring, partly because of safety features like air bags and antilock brakes. There had also been declines in drunken driving and auto theft, and signs that aging baby boomers were becoming safer drivers. Mr. Hartwig said body shop costs and medical expenses had leveled off.
While many of those trends are continuing, Mr. Hartwig said, their financial benefits are being eclipsed by a resurgence in costs for repairs and treatment of injuries. He said repair costs are up partly because many companies stopped using generic replacement parts after State Farm was sued by consumers last fall and ordered to pay $1.2 billion for not using original manufacturers' parts.
Randy Stoddard, a top executive at Safeco, the nation's 15th-largest insurer, said that while the number of accidents was still declining, "the severity is up."
Moreover, he said: "The new cars are smarter and more expensive to repair. And people are more expensive to repair; we call that medical inflation."
Mr. Hunter said he had no doubt that the insurers' costs per accident were going up. "But," he said, "the number of accidents is falling faster than the increase in costs."
Safeco, which reported a nearly $40 million loss in its auto insurance business in the first quarter, has increased rates in 20 states so far this year, from just under 1 percent in Colorado to 8.2 percent in Michigan. Last year it cut prices in 18 states.
The two biggest companies -- State Farm and Allstate -- are still cutting rates in more states than they are raising them, but they, too, are showing the early signs of a shift. Last year, State Farm cut rates in 48 states and increased prices in only one, Massachusetts. So far this year, State Farm says it is cutting rates in 15 states and increasing them in 10, including a 5.6 percent rise in Montana.
State Farm is seeking a decrease of nearly 5 percent in California, the state with the most drivers. But Mr. Cholnoky said that an analysis of rates in California showed that State Farm's prices were among the highest in the state, 31 percent higher than Allstate's and 55 percent higher than Progressive's.
So far this year, Allstate has raised prices in two states -- Louisiana and South Carolina; last year there were no increases. While it trimmed rates in 10 states last year, only 4 states have had cuts this year.
In New York, where regulators have taken steps to ease costs for insurers, just as they did in New Jersey, one of the largest companies, Progressive, has raised rates 4.3 percent. Nineteen small companies have put in place increases ranging from less than 1 percent to 18.6 percent; six other small companies cut prices. In Connecticut, one of the largest insurers, Nationwide Mutual, increased prices 4.9 percent and six other insurers have come in with smaller increases. Five small insurers cut prices. Last year price decreases outnumbered increases nearly 3 to 1.
One small New Jersey company, GSA, raised premiums 15 percent, and several New Jersey insurers are asking regulators for even higher increases. But John Tiene, executive director of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, said these increases had been requested two years ago and did not reflect current expenses. The increase for GSA, however, had the effect of nullifying the 15 percent legislative rollback.
Geico, Progressive, Safeco and several other major insurers do not operate in New Jersey, saying that it is difficult to do so profitably.
Across the country, Progressive and Geico have been leading a price war and gaining market share at the expense of companies like State Farm and Allstate, which have been either losing market share or merely holding even as the number of drivers has been growing.
Now, both Progressive and Geico, after suffering significant losses in earnings, are shifting toward higher prices. Since last year, for example, Progressive has increased prices by an average of 7.4 percent in 41 states, according to Charles B. Gates, an insurance analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Progressive has raised rates about 4 percent in Missouri and is asking for an increase of 9.9 percent in Florida.
As it announced an underwriting loss of $86 million in the first quarter of this year, Geico said it expected to increase rates in many states, but gave no details. Geico is a unit of Berkshire Hathaway.
Mr. Gates said the increase in prices by Progressive and Geico, which have been the fastest-growing big insurers, were likely to be taken as a sign by other insurers that it was safe to raise prices. Previously, he said, the others may have feared that price increases would drive customers to Progressive and Geico.
Several analysts said they expected State Farm and Allstate to raise prices more slowly than other big companies because over the previous two years they had reduced their prices less than many competitors.
Mr. Hunter said that in their zeal to capture market share, Progressive and Geico might have cut prices too much for their own good. "Those companies might have to raise rates," he said. "But some companies may be taking advantage of this opportunity to raise their rates. I'm saying, 'Wait a minute. You don't need to raise your rates. You should be continuing to lower them.' "

New Wave of Growth in Asia Is Reminiscent of 1980's
Less than three years after a plunge in the value of Thailand's currency set in motion a devastating economic crisis across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980's.
The latest evidence of the resurgence came with a report that Hong Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since 1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a distant memory. Page A1. 

Demand for Big-Ticket Goods Falls
Demand for big-ticket goods in April registered its steepest decline since late 1991, and consumer spending rose at its slowest pace in nine months, the government said, indicating that the economy may be slowing. Durable goods orders fell 6.4 percent; economists had been expecting a 0.5 percent drop. Consumer spending rose 0.4 percent, while consumer income climbed 0.7 percent; both figures matched forecasts. B3.
 
Car Insurance Premiums Edge Up
After falling for two years, car insurance premiums around the country are climbing once again, resuming a steady quarter-century rise. Several big insurers have begun imposing higher prices, and analysts say that by the end of the year most other big insurers are likely to follow. The insurers said they were forced to act because of rising expenses for repairs and treatment of injuries. A1.
 
Push for Prescription Drug Coverage
Bill Thomas of California, an influential Republican member of the House, and Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democratic senator, announced that they would collaborate on a bipartisan effort to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare this year. The effort alters the politics of the issue in this election year, at least marginally increasing the chances that Congress can break the deadlock on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. A10.
 
De Beers Seizes Angolan Diamonds
De Beers has begun seizing shipments of Angolan government diamonds after the Angolans scrapped a 10-year-old agreement with De Beers to market stones from an Angolan concession. De Beers officials said they were acting in part because of a $50 million debt owed to the company by Angola. B2.
 
Boeing's Satellite Deal Is Delayed
Boeing's proposed purchase of the satellite unit of Hughes Electronics faces an extended investigation by European antitrust officials, which may delay the deal. B2.
 
Toshiba Faces Complaints in China
Toshiba's settlement of a class-action lawsuit in the United States last year has backfired in China, where consumers are charging discrimination because the Japanese electronics maker has not offered them the same deal. Masaichi Koga, a vice president of Toshiba, went to Beijing this week to try to repair the damage. B2.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Plan to Protect Nation's Shorelines

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: ASSATEAGUE ISLAND, Md., May 26

 BODY:
Using the sand and surf as a backdrop, President Clinton announced new initiatives today intended to preserve the nation's fragile shoreline and threatened coral reefs.
Mr. Clinton directed the Commerce Department and the Department of the Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, to strengthen ocean protections through administrative steps similar to the ones applied to large tracts of land protected as wilderness areas. Coming in the final months of his presidency, Mr. Clinton's protections would not require approval by Congress but could be undone by his successor. 
 "Beachlines and coastlines are now our No. 1 tourist destination," the president said as he strode onto the sand on this barrier island.
"Our oceans, however, are far more than a playground," Mr. Clinton continued. "They have a central effect on the weather, on our climate system. Through fishing, tourism and other industries, ocean resources -- listen to this -- support 1 out of every 6 jobs in the United States of America."
The president, who spoke over a roaring surf as sea gulls flew overhead, directed the Interior and Commerce Departments to set up a system of "marine protected areas" to coordinate the hodgepodge of federal protections now in place for beaches, reefs and other marine habitats.
His order did not specify any areas, but it requested recommendations on shorelines in need of limits on activities like fishing, offshore oil drilling, mining and dumping.
As it is, the National Park Service protects 54 marine areas, which cover more than three million acres of water, including Glacier Bay in Alaska, the Everglades in Florida, and here on Assateague, an island renowned for the wild horses that roam its marshlands. Other marine areas have been set aside as wildlife refuges under the supervision of the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"These different protections have all been fragmented," said David Hayes, deputy secretary of the interior. "And for the first time under the executive order, there's going to be a requirement that the agencies work together and look together at the protections that we have, and determine whether we need new protections or not."
Although the details remain to be worked out, some commercial fishermen were nervous that their favorite spots might be declared off-limits.
"The whole world is against watermen, and now you have the world plus the president," Freeland Mason, past president of the Virginia Watermen's Association, told The Associated Press. "The conservationists want to cut out all commercial fishing. They don't want any fishing except by hook and line. The waterman is an endangered species these days."
Mr. Clinton also directed the environmental agency to adopt tougher water pollution standards to protect beaches and coastal areas, and to identify areas where additional protections are required.
"They're going to go back and look at their permitting process for all of the ocean discharges that could have an impact in ocean areas, and make sure that those are fully scientifically based, and if necessary, to increase the protection," said James Baker, administrator of the oceanic and atmospheric agency.
As it is now, thousands of beaches are closed every year as heavy rains cause sewers and drains to overflow, washing sewage into the surf. That polluted runoff can cause a variety of health hazards, including dysentery and hepatitis. It also leads to the growth of toxic algae and threatens marine life.
Without better protections, polluted shorelines can only get worse as nearly half of all development in the United States is along coastlines.
Mr. Clinton also ordered the development of a plan within the next 90 days to protect the coral reefs off a 1,200-mile string of uninhabited islands in northwestern Hawaii. Coral reefs, which harbor an abundance of marine life, are threatened worldwide from pollution, overfishing and rising ocean temperatures.
The Hawaiian reefs, first protected when President Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, make up nearly 70 percent of the coral in United States waters and support threatened sea turtles, monk seals and other marine life.
Mr. Clinton's plan, which will probably increase the zone of protected coral off Hawaii, would be developed in cooperation with the Hawaiian authorities, officials said.
In announcing the initiatives, Mr. Clinton made both environmental and economic arguments.
"The old idea that we can only grow by putting more pollution into our lakes and rivers and oceans must finally be put to rest," he said. "Indeed, it is now clear that we can grow our economy faster over the long run by improving our environment, and it's really not enough for us just to try to keep it as it is. We have to do better."
Although the president has used his executive authority to impose an array of environmental protections, Congress is in charge of the purse strings, and Republican leaders have been reluctant to spend money for all of what Mr. Clinton considers critical environmental priorities.
Pete Jeffries, communications director for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said the president was acting unwisely by expanding protected areas without giving sufficient resources to the ones already on the books.
"Republicans want to take a responsible, common-sense approach to our environment," Mr. Jeffries said.

ASIAN REGION RIDES A WAVE OF GROWTH LINKED TO EXPORTS

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 26

 BODY:
Less than three years after a plunge in the value of Thailand's currency set off a devastating economic crisis across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980's.
The latest evidence of the resurgence came today with a report that Hong Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since late 1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a distant memory.
 Other Asian economies, from South Korea to Singapore, are growing at rates much faster than the most optimistic forecasters had predicted -- powered, to a large extent, by a booming demand for Asian exports of computers, electronics, machinery and textiles in the hot economy of the United States. 
 Earlier this month, the Salomon Smith Barney investment bank raised its full-year forecast for Asia's regional growth to 6.9 percent from 6.7 percent. This week, Salomon raised it again, to 7.1 percent.
"The U.S. economy is showing absolutely no signs of slowing, which is great for Asia," said Simon L. Ogus, an independent economist here. "The longer the U.S. keeps booming, the faster Asia will grow."
But Mr. Ogus and other economists also warn that any downturn in the American economy could ripple harshly through Asia. They note that stock markets in Asia have tumbled recently on worries about rising interest rates and a possible future slowdown in demand from the United States. Moreover, Japan, the biggest economy in the region, is still trapped in a prolonged slump.
But it is clear that Asian countries have defied the skeptics, who said the region would need a long convalescence from two years of painful economic contraction, plunging asset values and corporate insolvencies.
The spreading rebound is good news for both the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund, which had come under heavy criticism in Congress and academia for mismanaging the approximately $100 billion bailout of troubled Asian economies. The critics charged that the Treasury and the I.M.F. prescribed a mix of radical economic restructuring and fiscal austerity that threatened to seriously prolong recessions in the region and leave millions jobless.
Asia's stronger-than-anticipated rebound has largely silenced those complaints. At the same time, however, it has also reduced the pressure on Asian governments to clean up the debt-ridden banks and corporations that contributed to the crisis in the first place.
"I think we'll get surprised further on the upside by Asian economic growth, which will have the effect of reducing the pressure for structural reform," Mr. Ogus said.
Enthusiasm about the Asian recovery began earlier this year, when South Korea started posting double-digit year-to-year gains in growth, putting the severe slump that began in late 1997 firmly behind it. South Korea's strong performance has also been accompanied by progress in restructuring its most debt-ridden conglomerates, though some economists still criticize the pace of reform in that nation as too slow.
In Thailand, generally regarded as the domino that set off the Asian crisis with the devaluation of its currency -- the baht -- in July 1997, the I.M.F. decreed in a review two weeks ago that the recovery "has turned out to be impressive: output growth this year is set once again to exceed 4 percent, exports are growing rapidly, the balance-of-payments position remains strong, and inflation is well under control."
Malaysia, which flouted the I.M.F.'s prescriptions and imposed strict controls on currency and capital flows, has turned into one of the region's export stars. After growing at 5.4 percent in 1999, Salomon Smith Barney predicts Malaysia's economy will expand 7 percent this year.
Even in Indonesia, widely regarded as the most fragile of the Asian economies ravaged by the crisis, growth is expected to exceed 3 percent this year, although the government has said it could fall to 1.5 percent if political instability persisted. Unlike its neighbors, Indonesia is still spurned by foreign investors.
In Hong Kong, talk of economic reform in Asia has all but vanished as export-led growth has returned, with more shipments of clothes, toys and machinery. Hong Kong's exports rose 20.7 percent in the first quarter, as it shipped more goods to China, the United States, Europe and other Asian countries. China, which uses Hong Kong as a source for raw materials like unfinished leather, cotton and electronics components, was a particularly good customer.
Analysts noted that Hong Kong's robust growth was partly a reflection of its poor performance in the quarter a year earlier, when output fell 3 percent. But they still said Hong Kong's performance was remarkable, given that its currency is linked to the United States dollar at a fixed rate. The export success of other Asian countries, notably Malaysia, can be attributed in part to their weaker currencies, which make their goods cheaper overseas.
"The Hong Kong economy turned out a spectacular performance," said the government's chief economist, K. Y. Tang. "Looking into future months, we still see strong demand for our exports."
Mr. Tang said Hong Kong would be further strengthened by the vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday to grant permanent normal trade status to China; the Senate is also expected to approve such a measure. That step will ease Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization, a move that Hong Kong estimates will add 5 percent to its gross domestic product over 10 years.
In the longer run, a more open China could rob this former British colony of its traditional role as a middleman between China and the outside world.
But few economists are thinking beyond this year. Following the lead of private economists, Mr. Tang revised his official forecast of Hong Kong's full-year growth to 6 percent from 5 percent. He said the revision was conservative because he harbored nagging worries about how long the economic boom in the United States would last.
"If there is a more distinct moderation in the U.S. economy, somehow -- directly or indirectly -- the Hong Kong economy will be affected," Mr. Tang said.
Mr. Ogus is more emphatic about the damage Asia would suffer from a slowdown in the United States. Given that so much of the region's rebound has hinged on exports, he said Asia's recovery would come to an abrupt halt if demand from the United States diminished. At that point, he said, the lack of progress among Asian countries in overhauling their financial sectors could come back to haunt them.
Asia's stock markets reflect this sensitivity to the outlook across the Pacific. Fears of interest rate increases in the United States drove down markets everywhere today, with the exception of Taipei, Bangkok and Manila.
Shares in South Korea plunged 6.13 percent after Hyundai, the country's biggest conglomerate, asked its main creditor for loans to avert a cash shortage.
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index declined 1.4 percent to its lowest level in six months, despite the buoyant economic numbers. Hong Kong has also not emerged from the deflationary spiral that has pummeled the prices of everything from apartments to luxury goods. The local consumer price index fell 4.9 percent in the first four months of this year.
One unexpected bright spot was a surge in investment in computers and other information technology. After the ascent and crash of Internet-related stocks here, there is now evidence that Hong Kong is investing in cyberspace.
"This reflects a basic change in attitude toward the new economy here," said Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "It's a belated response to what's been going on in the United States."

HEADLINE: Internet Cafe Chain to Try A Times Sq. Connection

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 26

 BODY:
It is an unlikely export from here, but come this fall, a Britain-based entrepreneur will be taking his phenomenally successful chain of Internet cafes across the Atlantic to Times Square. The company, called EasyEverything, has created the equivalent of cybercafes on steroids: the one being planned for Times Square will have 650 to 1,000 Internet terminals with high-resolution flat-panel screens.
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of EasyEverything and EasyJet, the five-year-old low-cost European airline, signed a lease this week for a 13,300-square-foot site at 8 Times Square on 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Easy Everything is part of the same development where the new Hilton Hotel is being readied, along with another British export, Madame Tussaud's, the wax museum. 
 If EasyEverything has even a smidgen of the success it has had here, queues -- er, lines will begin to form around the super-cybercafe before it even opens. The first Easy Everything, which opened on June 21, 1999, near Victoria Station here with 400 computer terminals, was greeted by so many Internet surfers on its first day that staff members handed out coffee to the hordes to keep them from leaving.
Internet cafes have never really taken off in the United States the way they have here and throughout other parts of Europe, so it may be somewhat of a surprise if Mr. Haji-Ioannou succeeds. But even he concedes it may be a struggle, though one he expects to win. "A lot of people have said that I'll never make it work in New York," he said. "But they said that about London, too. Have you ever been to EasyEverything in London at 2 a.m.? It's packed."
The cafes themselves look futuristic, like a set from "Star Trek," with hundreds and hundreds of people at rows of computers. The cafes sell coffee, snacks and sandwiches.
Among the reasons EasyEvery thing, which is open 24 hours a day, may have succeeded in London are that most people here do not own personal computers and that the telephone rates for dial-up modem access to the Internet are significantly higher than in the United States. Because local telephone calls are billed by the minute here -- not a flat rate like American telephone companies offer -- Internet users must pay the telephone company and the access providers, like America Online, every time they log on.
"By itself, it is deadly dull for a U.S. audience," said Bruce Kasrel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, which analyzes e-commerce. "People already have Internet access at the office and at home." He cited empty Internet access terminals at airports as an example of a similar scheme that had not worked.
One reason New Yorkers could log on is simply the sense of privacy. "I know a lot of people come in to go online to search for jobs so their employer doesn't know," Mr. Haji-Ioannou said. He also expects tourists to pop in to check their e-mail. "Mobile Internet access doesn't work and isn't cheap," he said.
Mr. Haji-Ioannou has always prided himself on offering customers things cheap. EasyJet, which has many of the qualities of Southwest Airlines, offers tickets sometimes for a third of the cost of the same flights on British Airways. At EasyEverything, the pricing scheme is truly laissez-faire. The price fluctuates depending on how many people are using the computers, but it usually hovers around $1.50 for an hour of surfing. "We'll charge whatever it takes" to fill the cafe, Mr. Haji-Ioannou said.
The Times Square cafe is set to open in September or early October. Mr. Haji-Ioannou now has six super-cybercafes in London, with a total of 2,800 terminals, and he opened one in Edinburgh last week, with others on the way in Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands and in Barcelona, Spain.
Still, Mr. Kasrel is not convinced. "There's a reason Regis Philbin hosts 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' in the States," he said, referring to the British program that was successfully exported. "We have different tastes."

 BODY:

ASIA
 
JAPAN: PREMIER APOLOGIZES -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori apologized for remarks last week that seemed to endorse emperor worship. After several days of heavy criticism, Mr. Mori, left, expressed regret in a tense news conference that his remarks had caused misunderstanding, but declined to retract his statement altogether. In his original remarks, which critics said echoed Japan's prewar militarism, Mr. Mori said Japan was "a divine nation with the emperor at its core." Howard French (NYT)
 
SRI LANKA: MILITARY PLEA -- The government asked retired officers and policemen to re-enlist in the armed forces in hopes of bolstering 30,000 troops under assault from separatist ethnic Tamils in the northern Jaffna Peninsula. Those who rejoined would take the noncombat positions of younger soldiers, who would then be shifted to the front lines. The rebels threatened a bloodbath for soldiers who failed to surrender by today.
 Celia W. Dugger (NYT) 

AFGHANISTAN: ARMS BLAST -- An ammunition depot at a Taliban military base in Kabul exploded close to a residential area, but no casualties were reported. Officials accused the northern opposition forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood of sabotage, but an opposition official denied the charge. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
AFGHANISTAN: RUSSIAN WARNING -- The commander of Russia's border guards warned that Moscow risks destabilizing part of Central Asia if it attacks outposts of Afghanistan's Taliban, which is accused of training Chechen rebels. Gen. Konstantin Totsky said the attacks could provoke violence in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, two Russian allies that are Afghanistan's neighbors. The Taliban has said it would hold the two states liable for any Russian attacks. Michael Wines (NYT)
 
CHINA: OPTIMISM ON TAIWAN -- After talks with Chinese military leaders and diplomats, an American official is hopeful China and Taiwan can resume a dialogue over their differences. "My sense is that there's a genuine desire for a solution," said the official, who is based in Beijing and spoke on condition he not be identified. He added that there had been no official change in China's policy that Taiwan accept it is part of China, but "somewhere in China's position there's room for dialogue to start." Erik Eckholm (NYT)
 
NORTH KOREA: PLEA FOR AID -- North Korea plans to ask donor countries for $250 million to help people suffering from hunger and to achieve self-sufficiency in food supplies by 2002, said David Morton, the top United Nations official in the country. Mr. Morton said North Korean officials would present a plan on June 20 to build up its agricultural sector and reforest areas stripped of trees. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: E. COLI INQUEST -- Ontario's coroner's office will open an inquest into the deaths of five people in an outbreak of E. coli bacteria in Walkerton, west of Toronto. The outbreak, from polluted water, sickened 10 percent of the town's 5,000 people. Dr. Murray McQuigge, the local medical officer, has charged that the local water company knew on May 18 that the water was potentially contaminated but maintained through May 21 that it was safe. James Brooke (NYT)
 
MEXICO: TEACHERS PROTEST -- Some 20,000 schoolteachers seeking a wage increase blocked Mexico City's main street for 12 hours during a march to Ernesto Zedillo's presidential compound, where they were blocked by hundreds of riot policemen. Thousands of teachers from several states have been camped in parks and on sidewalks for a week as they press their salary demands, a yearly ritual. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
SURINAME: MIXED RESULTS -- The opposition New Front coalition failed to win enough seats to form a government as voters punished President Jules Wijdenbosch's poor economic record. With 85 percent of votes counted, the New Front was projected to win 33 seats in the 51-member National Assembly, one short of the two-thirds majority needed to appoint a president. (Reuters)
 
EUROPE
 
IRELAND: EX-PREMIER CONDEMNED -- On a state visit to Poland, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern sharply criticized former Prime Minister and Fianna Fail party leader Charles Haughey, 74, saying his behavior "offends against the ethics and integrity of what our party stands for." A tribunal will call Mr. Haughey, 74, to testify after amassing evidence of almost $10 million he received between 1979 and 1996 in gifts, party donations and written-off bank loans. Brian Lavery (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: HARD-LINE PLEA -- In a speech that appeared to be a plea for peace with the new reformist Parliament, which convenes today, a senior hard-line cleric asked legislators to solve their differences privately. "We must solve our problems among ourselves," said Ayatollah Ahmad Janati, head of the Council of Guardians, an election watchdog. "We must talk privately and avoid causing worry in the mind of the public. National unity must be preserved." Nazila Fathi (NYT)
 
PACIFIC
 
FIJI: GUN BATTLE -- Government soldiers exchanged gunfire with ethnic Fijian rebels trying to overrun a roadblock near Parliament, where about 60 gunmen have been holding Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, an ethnic Indian, and more than 30 members of his government hostage since May 19. Two soldiers were wounded, and a cameraman for Associated Press Television News was shot in the arm. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
ZIMBABWE: PROTESTER KILLED -- Paramilitary police fired tear gas and live rounds over a group of governing party supporters trying to storm a police station to free 19 people arrested in earlier violence, the authorities said. One man, who was hit by a tear gas canister, died. It was the first death of a member of the ruling party in political violence that began in February, after President Robert Mugabe lost a bid to strengthen his powers and seize white-owned land. (AP)
 
RWANDA: GENOCIDE TERM CUT -- A former Rwandan mayor convicted in Switzerland for crimes committed during the 1994 Rwanda genocide had his life sentence cut to 14 years. A Geneva appeals court reduced the term given to Fulgence Niyonteze, while agreeing he had incited Hutu extremists to kill Tutsi and supplied them with weapons. Mr. Niyonteze fled to Switzerland, and he was the first Rwandan suspected of genocide to be judged by a foreign country's court. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)

HEADLINE: Final Answers Aren't So Final, Students Learn

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
For some of the smartest high school students in New York City, this Memorial Day weekend will not be the carefree interlude of splashing at the beach and picnics with family and friends that they envisioned just a few days ago.
Instead, they will be studying for and worrying about their Advanced Placement calculus test -- again. 
 On Thursday, 84 students at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens, were told that their answer booklets for Section II -- the problem-solving part -- of the Advanced Placement test they took on May 15 had spilled out of a damaged box on the truck ride from Queens to Princeton, N.J., headquarters of the Educational Testing Service.
Officials for the testing service offered devastated and angry students at Cardozo three options: retaking Section II; allowing the testing service to extrapolate from the scores for Section I, the multiple-choice section, to create a score for Section II; or forgetting the whole thing and getting a refund of the $76 test fee.
But for many students, none of those options were compensation for the agony stirred by the lost answers. They had hired tutors, let easier subjects slide and pulled all-nighters preparing for the Calculus BC test -- reputed to be the hardest in the Advanced Placement repertory. Now, they said, they were being asked to gamble it all away on a retest they had not expected to take.
"I am so mad," said Seeun Yoon, an 18-year-old senior, standing on the steps of Cardozo at dismissal time yesterday. "E.T.S. is a monopoly like Bill Gates and Microsoft."
At the very least, Ms. Yoon and other students said, the testing service should give them their scores on Section I, so they can make an informed decision about whether to take Section II.
Ms. Yoon's friend Erica Hom sobbed when she heard the news, wondering how she could handle her job at the Gap and her final exams while retaking the calculus test. "I was crying," she said. "A whole year's work is gone."
She attacked the testing service for planning to grade the Cardozo students the same way it would grade any other class of high school students in the country. "It is wrong for them not to take responsibility," she said. "Our whole mind-set is gone. We're thinking about graduation and college. How can you compare us to the other kids whose scores were not lost?"
After at first saying that it would be irregular for the students to see the results of Section I before any retest, Tom Ewing, a spokesman for the testing service, called a reporter back to say the company might consider such a possibility.
"We'll be back in touch with school officials bright and early Tuesday morning and continue to discuss the options," Mr. Ewing said. "It's not out of the realm of possibility."
Company officials yesterday denied responsibility for the foulup, blaming Federal Express. Mr. Ewing said that a shipment of eight boxes of test answer booklets had left Cardozo on May 15, arranged for and paid for by the testing service. All eight boxes arrived in Princeton two days later, he said, but one box was damaged. Of the 117 booklets, each the size of a comic book, packed in the box, only 33 remained, he said.
But Federal Express said its tracking records showed that the box of answer booklets had been signed for by the testing service on May 17, with no complaints of damage. Indeed, Federal Express said, there was no record of any complaint until yesterday, a week after the box was delivered to the testing service and three days after the service told Cardozo of the problem.
"Our records are showing that the package was delivered on time and with no issues noted," Carla Boyd, a spokeswoman for Federal Express, said yesterday.
If the booklets show up before the retest next Thursday, Mr. Ewing said, they will be counted. But if they show up after, they will be voided.
Kimberly Wong, 17, said she had an economics final coming up and was worried that retaking the calculus test would make it hard to do well on either of them. But Doug Fath, 18, tried to be stoic. "It's summertime, a three-day weekend, and we have to study," he said. "What are we going to do?"
A teacher at Cardozo said many students were upset because Section II of the calculus test was "significantly easier" than Section I, and they had counted on using it to increase their scores.
The students who choose to retake the test will be taking a different version, Mr. Ewing said, so that there will be no advantage.
It was important for the students to have their Advanced Placement scores count. Some colleges give course credit for Advanced Placement tests, allowing students to graduate early or save on tuition, which is especially meaningful, a teacher said, for the working-class and immigrant students who attend Cardozo. The teacher spoke on the condition that she not be named, saying she feared reprisal from the Board of Education for speaking out. Cardozo is one of the city's most academically rigorous schools, and hundreds of students there take Advanced Placement tests, from macroeconomics to English to statistics.
Rick Hallman, the principal of Cardozo, said, "We just want the students to get their right scores."
Last year, 884 students took the Advanced Placement calculus exams in New York City high schools, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education.

To the Editor:
There may be debate over how to carry out the reforms outlined in the master plan approved by the trustees of the City University of New York (news article, May 23). But there can be no debate that one of the most critical aspects of the plan is the creation of partnerships between CUNY and business.
 CUNY has the potential to be the engine driving the economic development of the metropolitan region by applying its intellectual capital to stimulate growth in technology and by offering educational opportunities tailor-made to accommodate the needs of potential workers and the existing work force in the new economy. 
 Universities can no longer afford to be quasi-monastic entities that exist at arm's length from the experience of working Americans. Engagement with the community is essential for our success and for that of society at large.

To the Editor:
The approval of a master plan by the trustees of the City University of New York (news article, May 23) comes not a moment too soon for the sciences, which have suffered through two decades of budgetary crises. The plan provides the focused hiring and resource allocation necessary to build flagship programs in the sciences. 
 President Clinton asked Congress to increase the number of foreigners admitted to the United States to fill high-technology jobs. His economic policy adviser says the best way to meet the economy's current needs is to improve the education and training of those already here. CUNY must fulfill its potential as a major source of talent in our increasingly technological society to meet the needs of our city, state and students.

And Bear in Mind
(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
THE BINDING CHAIR: Or, A Visit From the Foot Emancipation Society, by Kathryn Harrison. (Random House, $24.95.) A resonant, elaborately constructed novel that renders the lives of two women, an aunt deformed physically and morally by tradition and her overtly rebellious niece.
 
BOBOS IN PARADISE: The New Upper Class and How They Got There, by David Brooks. (Simon & Schuster, $25.) Affection, ridicule and plain ambivalence propel this work of "comic sociology" as it examines the rise of the "bourgeois bohemian," the social and economic type that now controls and consumes everything.
 
THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE: A Memoir, by Keith Fleming. (Morrow, $24.) The tale of a troubled straight teenager sent to live with his uncle, Edmund White, one of the best-known, best-liked gay men on earth, who turned out to be exactly the ideal trustworthy parent.

FROM DAWN TO DECADENCE: 500 Years of western cultural life, 1500 to the present, by Jacques Barzun. (HarperCollins, $36.) Who else would have the nerve to write a book by this name, or the range and clarity to succeed? The sole unpleasant prospect is the vile 20th century.

JOHN RUSKIN: The Later Years, by Tim Hilton. (Yale University, $35.) Opening when its subject is 40 and a rising authority on aesthetics, Volume II of this vast biography charts Ruskin's unraveling from passionate cataloger (rocks, plants, buildings, paintings, clouds) to tragic obsessive (irrigation, drainage, running water, little girls).
 
KARL MARX: A Life, by Francis Wheen. (Norton, $27.95.) An engaging reinterpretation of the prophet's life that defends his ideas (not very persuasively) but emphasizes his Victorian male egocentricity and bourgeois pretensions.
 
THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING, by Martin Clark. (Knopf, $24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features . . . a Southern judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter and tester of abused substances but by the end has become well worth knowing.
 
NEWJACK: Guarding Sing Sing, by Ted Conover. (Random House, $24.95.) A journalist's account of his year as a correction officer, where his moral well-being was as much at risk as his bodily safety.

 PASTORALIA
 Stories.
 By George Saunders.
 188 pp. New York:
 Riverhead Books. $22.95. 
 The Puritans proved their worth in the New World by achieving worldly success that, they hoped, demonstrated God's love. But since the Bible told them the meek shall inherit the earth, wealth was an uncertain sign. God could be ambivalent. Failure, like the Devil, could masquerade in a wicked variety of disguises. Anxiety and guilt drove the Puritans, and those were their psychological gifts to America's future. It is this punishing legacy that shapes the wacky world of George Saunders's second short-story collection, "Pastoralia."
Saunders's exuberantly weird stories recount Americans' mostly futile attempts at self-improvement, the terrible dread of failure -- or damnation. His stories appropriate behaviors and institutions that already seem parodies of themselves. They respond to an America where men running for president cite Jesus Christ as their favorite philosopher, either to curry votes or because they haven't actually read any philosophy, and where women vie to marry a multimillionaire on television. They speak about the most prosperous nation in the world, whose citizens don't have adequate health insurance and worry about being too fat to be loved but not about being too self-involved to consider the pain of others.
Saunders showcases Americans' fears, shames and need to be accepted -- all resonant reminders of this country's neurotic origins. In "Pastoralia," his frantic characters move through defamiliarized terrain. They anxiously await punishment for nonexistent crimes and imperfections, suffering for the strange sin of wanting to be happy. His losers are threatened with losing even more -- jobs, sexual attractiveness, their illusions, just about everything.
In this collection's title story, a woman named Janet and an unnamed male narrator worry about losing their jobs playing cave people in a historical theme park. The pair are not allowed to speak English: "I make some guttural sounds and some motions meaning: Big rain come down, and boom, make goats run, goats now away, away in high hills." Janet speaks English anyway, among other rules she breaks, and the narrator protects her from the boss. The boss punishes him by withholding their daily food. "I go to the Big Slot and find it goatless."
In "CivilWarLand in Bad Decline," his first collection, Saunders also represented America as a kind of Disneyland and relied on repetitions and other stylistic devices to hammer home the poverty of a simulated existence. He stripped down his sentences to convey the inadequacy of language to capture the zeitgeist. His insistence on these effects sometimes turned smart into merely clever, inventive into predictable.
But in his new collection, Saunders's tales cover larger, more exciting territory, with an abundance of ideas, meanings and psychological nuance. Saunders can be brutally funny, and the better his stories are, the more melancholic, somber and subtle they are, too. Pathetic contradictions underlie the ruthless drive for success in love and work, and Saunders weaves them into artful and sophisticated narrative webs.
In "Winky," a desperate character named Yaniky is prey to self-help and New Age groups whose philosophies fault the individual for not having it all. Yaniky attends a meeting where people wear white paper hats that mean "Beginning to Begin," or pink ones meaning "Moving Ahead in Beginning"; they are labeled "Whiny" or "Self-Absorbed" and are taught there's "A Time for Me to Win." Their leader tells them: "I was once exactly like you people. A certain someone, a certain guy who shall remain nameless . . . simply because he'd had some bad luck, simply because he was in some pain, simply because, actually, he was in a wheelchair, this certain someone expected me to put my life on hold." He exhorts the group not to let others, as he puts it, relieve themselves "in your oatmeal." Suddenly Yaniky realizes that his sister, Winky, has been fouling his. This dismal epiphany provokes a series of deluded interior monologues that describe yet another geek who won't realize the American dream. But what makes the narrative truly unusual is Saunders's introduction of Winky, whose voice he juxtaposes with Yaniky's in a tragicomic duet for codependents.
"Sea Oak" is the sick tale of a man who works in a strip club but who doesn't want to show his penis, even though he'd earn more in tips. After giving the ladies (almost) what they want, he returns home to his dysfunctional family. Saunders mocks that overused generalization in stupefying exaggerations that recall Theodor Adorno's dictum, "Today only exaggeration can be the medium of truth." The stripper's sister, Min, and cousin, Jade, are barely literate single mothers who watch bizarre television talk shows and converse in monosyllabic curses. Their Aunt Bernie, an optimist -- or "optometrist," as Jade calls her -- acts as a foil to their sullen negativity. But when this Pollyanna dies, Saunders transforms their home into a neogothic haunted house. Aunt Bernie returns from the grave. "Why do some people get everything and I got nothing?" she asks. "Why? Why was that?" Through the undead Bernie, Saunders unleashes the fury of the unfulfilled, the yearnings of America's damned.
In "The Barber's Unhappiness," an aging bachelor who was born without toes lives with his mother (in Saunders's world, this always signals male abjection). He spends his time "ogling every woman in sight" and fantasizing about each one. An uncle's cruel comments about his bachelorhood spark even more obsessive thoughts, which are both hilarious and miserable.
Saunders crosscuts between the lives of two anxious men in "The Falls." There's Morse, who is "too ashamed of his own shame," and Aldo Cummings, "an odd duck who, though nearly 40, still lived with his mother." To Cummings, Morse is "a smug member of the power elite in this conspiratorial Village"; to Morse, Cummings is a nut he fears will "collar him. When Cummings didn't collar him . . . Morse felt guilty for having suspected Cummings of wanting to collar him."
Saunders pulls out all the parodic stops in "The Falls." Cummings, a secretive writer, concocts rhapsodies in his head and also corrects them, hoping to remember and write it all down later. Morse, a family man, carries Saunders's version of the paradigmatic American disease. "His childhood dreams had been so bright, he had hoped for so much, it couldn't be true that he was a nobody." Both wind up at the falls, witnesses to an accident, where they fear taking action and dream of heroism, two solitary fighters in an ethical boxing match. Uncharacteristically, both "The Falls" and "The Barber's Unhappiness" end ambiguously -- with hope, maybe. Given Saunders's generally ironic stance, it's hard to tell but intriguing to consider.
In all of his unsentimental stories, Saunders commiserates with the disspirited, the weak, the flawed. His engagement with have-nots is a kind of return, like Aunt Bernie's, a visit to the worlds of John Steinbeck, Sinclair Lewis, Thornton Wilder and the Theodore Dreiser of "An American Tragedy" -- small-town, small-city, little-people writers. Impoverishment in Saunders's work includes economic inequality, but he focuses more on deprivations that foreclose possibilities for expansive experiences, limiting perception and imaginative thinking. His eccentrically poignant fictions speak, in part, to the concerns Max Weber raised in 1921 in "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism": "In the United States, the pursuit of wealth, stripped of its religious and ethical meaning, tends to become associated with purely mundane passions, which often actually give it the character of sport. No one knows who will live in this cage in the future, or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely new prophets will arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas and ideals, or, if neither, mechanized petrification, embellished with a sort of convulsive self-importance."
Saunders avoids righteousness and pleading. He understands Mary McCarthy's observation in "A Charmed Life," "Nobody can have a permanent claim on being the injured party," and his earnestness and seriousness propel him instead, as they did McCarthy, to satire and parody. Imagine Lewis's Babbitt thrown into the back seat of a car going cross-country, driven by R. Crumb, Matt Groening, Lynda Barry, Harvey Pekar or Spike Jonze. That'd be a story Saunders could tell.

 To the Editor:
Louis Uchitelle almost, but not quite, gets his economic arms around Robert J. Shiller's "Irrational Exuberance" (May 7). The stock market has been more volatile than usual, but that does not mean it is behaving irrationally. Uchitelle says, "Most economists assume that people are rational and fully informed, and that their stock investments reflect a realistic assessment of the economy." Not so. Most economists may believe people act rationally, but few believe investors are "fully informed." 
 They can't possibly be, which is why they follow opinion leaders who try to be fully informed. Some follow the bullish leaders and some follow the bears, and the market that comprises them is more efficient in setting prices than they are. Uchitelle notes that Shiller himself allows that steep market expansions unwind "when something scares the investors." It is the task of market analysts to figure out what will scare the bulls and what will scare the bears. Sometimes it takes only a rumor to start a stampede of bears or bulls, but when the truth arrives, "rationality" is re-established.

HEADLINE: The Venture Capitalist in My Bedroom

BYLINE: By Jeff Goodell; Jeff Goodell, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone, is the author of "Sunnyvale: The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family," to be published in July.

 BODY:
Of all the houses on Meadowlark Lane, this one is the shabbiest: it is a dingy mustard color with brown shutters; there is a Toyota Camry parked on what used to be the lawn; the backyard fence is sagging; the window shades are drawn. As I walk up the driveway, I am greeted by a cheap gold "No Soliciting" sign on the front door, as well as a smaller sign, handwritten in Mandarin, that I cannot read but that, I imagine, says, "You are not welcome here."
I ring the bell. When the door cracks open, I see a vertical slice of a woman's face: young, Asian, attractive. I introduce myself as a journalist and explain that I live in New York now, but that my family lived here in Sunnyvale, Calif., in this very house from 1963, when I was 3, until my father's death in 1990, when I was 30. I ask her if we could talk for a few minutes and if I could have a look around inside. She looks me up and down, making a judgment. "Well, if you grew up here, this house must mean very much to you," she says in halting English. And then she swings the door open. 
 Her name is Sara Liang. She is 27, dressed in shorts and a pink T-shirt. She is wearing Dolce & Gabbana glasses with blue-tinted frames and a bracelet of pink plastic Buddha beads. As we stand in the hallway and talk, I learn that she is from Taipei, Taiwan, and that she came to America in 1993 to attend the University of San Francisco, where she studied international business. Now she works in sales at a small company that imports flat-panel display screens. She is giddy and shy, but willing to show me around. I notice a pile of shoes near the door and begin to remove mine, but she says, "No, no, that's not necessary." She seems slightly embarrassed, as if Asian tradition were something she has recently outgrown.
We move inside, and I have the strange feeling that I am looking at the wreckage of the American dream, circa 1963: the kitchen, which my mother was so proud of and where we gathered every night at 6:30 for our family meal of beef stroganoff or tuna casserole, now looks like the communal kitchen in a freshman dorm. Two fluorescent lights flicker overhead, and the floor is covered with industrial-grade linoleum. A second refrigerator has been shoved up against the wall in the dining area, a torn curtain is falling off its rod above the sliding glass door and the cupboards are empty, save for a large bottle of soy sauce and a few containers of SlimFast. The fireplace my father built in the family room, with its enormous cobblestone hearth, has been painted white and looks as if it hasn't carried a wisp of smoke since the day we moved out.
"How many people live here?" I ask.
"I don't know," Sara says. "Maybe eight, nine. It is impossible to say. People always coming and going."
As Sara and I talk, an Asian man in jogging pants and plastic thongs emerges from what was once my family's living room. A wall has now been erected down the center and another door and window installed, and it has been turned into two bedrooms. Behind him, through a half-open door, I see a small TV on a folding metal chair, a single bed and a computer. "Hello, Eric," Sara says. She continues in Mandarin, explaining who I am and why I am in the house. He glances up at me, then turns around, walks into his bedroom and closes the door.
"Engineers are weird," Sara says.
"Weird in what way?" I ask.
"They have no lives," she says.
I ask if I can meet any of her other roommates.
"No one else is home now. Maybe later."
"What time do the others get home from work?"
"All hours -- usually 9, 10 o'clock," she says. Then she adds, with a giggle, "We all work very hard, because we want to get rich in Silicon Valley."
In a place where every molecule is stretched toward the future, nothing feels quite so freakish as looking backward. In Silicon Valley, the very notion of reflecting upon what has happened, rather than what will be, seems to violate the laws of physics. My own sense of disorientation is underscored by the magnitude of the changes that have swept through this once-sleepy flatland at the foot of the San Francisco Bay over the last 20 or so years. When I was growing up, this region -- roughly the area between Palo Alto and San Jose -- always felt like a lonely place, nothing but fruit trees and aerospace engineers. I thought the future was anywhere but here.
I was not just wrong, but grandly, hilariously wrong. I witnessed the birth of a new world, even if I was too ignorant to recognize it at the time. The valley not only designed and built much of the machinery that powers the new economy but it also freed capitalism from its old restraints of class and corporatism, transforming untold numbers of college dropouts into multimillionaires and sparking a technological revolution that is reshaping our lives in unimaginably vast, complex and subtle ways. So powerful is the valley's allure that the word "silicon" itself, as if it wields alchemistic powers, has been snatched up by business leaders everywhere: Silicon Alley in New York City, Silicon Bog in Ireland, Silicon Forest in Seattle, Silicon Prairie in South Dakota. One Web site has counted 90 Silicon Valley wannabes.
I should be proud of the stature of my hometown, but the truth is that I have mixed feelings. This whirlwind has been great for my retirement fund (even after the recent battering), and I love my computer almost as much as I love my dog. But outrageous prosperity does not come without a cost: most of my friends and family who do not work for high-tech companies have long since fled the area, driven out by skyrocketing real estate prices and snarling traffic. My eyes have burned from the thickening smog, I've tasted the metallic water that flows out of the faucet in my old house and I've seen even my most successful, level-headed friend become consumed by envy because the guy in the cubicle besides him is worth nine million and he is worth only four. I've watched the apricot orchards get bulldozed and the dark, rich alluvial soil -- the finest in the world, ranchers say -- get paved over and forgotten. Twenty years ago, the valley felt like a suburban nowhere, sleepy and homogenous; today, it feels like a giant, nonvirtual eBay, a noisy, chaotic place that is growing at an exponential rate, where everyone is consumed with making the big score.
Still, many of the changes in the valley are worth celebrating. Good restaurants, for example. Palo Alto, Mountain View and San Jose are exploding with interesting, expressive cooking and a newly civilized clientele. "Five years ago, you had to explain to people what a salad fork was and that you might want to wear socks when you go out for dinner," says David Kinch, the chef and co-owner of Restaurant Sent Sovi in Saratoga, one of the top establishments in the region. "Today, my clientele is as sophisticated as the clientele at any restaurant in the world." Downtown San Jose, long a ghost town, now boasts the new Tech Museum, an elegant Fairmont hotel, a refurbished museum of art and, coming soon, a new city hall designed by Richard Meier. The old concrete tilt-up office buildings that blight the industrial landscape are slowly becoming things of the past; companies like 3Com and Novell have built artful new campuses with outdoor patios, water sculptures and cantilevered roof supports. "The area is beginning to achieve a distinctive style and sense of itself," says Erik Sueberkrop, a principal at Studios Architecture, a firm that has designed many of the area's most stylish buildings, including the 3Com campus. "You can feel the fabric of a new society being woven together here."
The biggest change prosperity has wrought, however, is in the faces of the people who live here. For most of the 20th century, the population of Santa Clara County (which includes the bulk of Silicon Valley) was about 80 percent white. Today, thanks largely to a wave that has brought nearly 160,000 immigrants into the area in the last decade, whites are now a minority. The 1.6 million people who live in the county are 49 percent white, 24 percent Hispanic, 23 percent Asian and 4 percent black. The defining character of Silicon Valley today is not the pasty-faced plaid-shirt-wearing aerospace engineer, but a young geek from Taipei or Bangalore with an H-1B visa and a fondness for American pop culture. These new immigrants are escapees from small villages and moribund economies; they are attracted to the valley by its reputation as a digital meritocracy, where nobody cares what color your skin is as long as you can speak the global language of entrepreneurs. Although most of these new immigrants are highly educated and technologically savvy, they have at least one thing in common with the waves of dreamers who came through Ellis Island a hundred years ago -- they believe America is a land of opportunity, a place where they can build better lives. Some want to put down roots and pledge their allegiance to the flag; others are the 21st-century equivalent of 19th-century gold miners who traveled from strike to strike, looking for the next mother lode.
A handful of these new dreamers, I recently learned, have taken up residence in my old house in Sunnyvale. I went home to meet them and to see what the digital revolution has done to the place that gave birth to it.
To thank her for showing me around, I offer to buy Sara dinner. The following night, we head to Cupertino Village, a small shopping center a few blocks from the house. I know the place well; I used to ride my bike here to buy Spider-Man comic books. There was a Rexall drugstore, a Safeway supermarket, a deli that served excellent bratwust, a dry cleaner and a travel agent. The shopping center is across the street from several early Hewlett Packard buildings -- Steve Wozniak worked here in the 1970's while he and a barefoot kid named Steve Jobs were wiring together their first computer in Jobs's garage.
Today, the shopping center has been transformed into a suburban Chinatown. The parking lot is jammed; the signs are all in Mandarin. A Chinese supermarket called Ranch 99 is stocked with 50-pound bags of jasmine rice and salmon heads for $2.99 a pound. In an herbal medicine shop, dried shark fins hang on the walls, and exotic varieties of ginseng are packaged like precious jewels.
Sara is dressed in high heels, blue jeans and a Guess denim jacket -- she is bubbly, happy, a little vain, completely charming. As we walk around the shopping center, she tells me that she ended up in my father's house because of an ad in The World Journal, a Taiwanese newspaper published daily in America; when she went to look at the room, she liked it because at $550 it was relatively inexpensive and because it was convenient to the freeway as well as to her office in Santa Clara. "I only plan to stay a few months, until my parents buy me a house," Sara explains. She pauses in front of a Taiwanese antique store and points to a ceramic Buddha that sits serenely in the window, gold paint peeling off her nose. "This is Chinese antique," she says, with thinly veiled disgust. "This is what my mother likes. The house where I grew up in Taiwan was full of it. That is why I hate it. When I get my own house, it will have none of that in it. I want everything clean and new."
Home decor is very much on Sara's mind, it turns out. Her mother and stepfather, who live in Taiwan (her parents divorced when she was 12; her stepfather is a financier who Sara claims "is not rich but definitely not poor either"), recently decided they want to buy a house in America -- they will use it only a month or two each year when they visit, but mostly it is for Sara. She has been running around with real estate agents for weeks, looking at dozens of houses in the half-million-dollar range. That is about the median price of a house in the valley today, and it gets you, at best, a shaggy but livable three-bedroom tract house in the flatlands.
Although California is half a world away from Taipei, Sara says her parents feel very comfortable here. "There are so many Chinese here now, it is almost like home. You can read Taiwanese newspapers, shop in Taiwanese markets, go to Taiwanese restaurants. But you have American stock market, American political system. It is maybe better than home."
For Sara's parents, owning a house in the valley is also an escape hatch from the rapidly escalating political tensions between Taiwan and mainland China. "No one knows what's going to happen in Taiwan," Sara explains. "Our relationship with the mainland is not good, the stock market is not strong -- there is a lot of uncertainty. If China invades, what happens to my parent's property? It could be confiscated; no one knows."
Sara, of course, wants a house for her own reasons. For the first time in her life, she is thinking about starting a family. She also sees a home as something that will give her life in America some ballast: her H-1B visa, which allows her to work in the United States for six years, will expire in three years, and unless she has been approved for a green card by then (highly unlikely) or has married a U.S. citizen (distinct possibility, since her current boyfriend was recently granted citizenship), she will have to leave the country for a year, then reapply for another visa, which given the competition, is anything but certain. "If I own a house, or if my parents own a house, I feel like it is the first step toward -- how do you say? -- putting down roots."
As for the house she lives in now -- my house -- she hardly gives it a thought. It's just a place to crash, a way station between her last apartment and her new life. She pays her rent to a Taiwanese immigrant who bought the place as an investment. She rarely sees her roommates, and when she does, they don't talk much or share meals. "It's not like 'Friends,"' she jokes. The only person she knows at all, she says, is Tammy, the woman who lives in the other half of my father's old bedroom. Tammy is also from Taiwan and works in sales for a cable modem company.
After dinner, we return to the house and Sara takes me upstairs and knocks on Tammy's bedroom door. Tammy opens it, glances at me, then back at Sara. She is middle-aged, tired-looking. She and Sara converse for a few moments in Mandarin, and Tammy becomes increasingly upset. I wonder if there has been a family tragedy.
After Tammy closes the door, Sara turns to me. "She does not want to talk tonight -- she's not in a very good mood," she explains. "Her AOL stock lost five points today."
It is a sunny spring day, and my sister, Jill, and I are walking along a levee at Shoreline Park, an open-space preserve near the foot of the bay that is a popular jogging and in-line skating spot for high-tech workers. Jill, 31, is the last member of my family who still lives in the valley. She is a project manager at Excite@Home, a top cable modem service and Internet directory that was once -- and may again be -- one of the hottest companies in the area. Despite the company's sagging stock price, she loves her job and the friends she has made there, as well as the glitzy new campus in Redwood City, where she can step outside her cubicle onto the third-floor breezeway and get a magnificent view of San Francisco Bay and the southern portion of the valley.
I tell her about the people living in our old house, and how the rooms have been subdivided.
"How bizarre," she says.
"Bizarre how?"
She looks over at the new Microsoft campus that has risen nearby. It is gray and black and stealthy-looking -- the architectural equivalent of Darth Vader's mask.
"I just think Dad would be spinning in his grave right now if he knew about this."
She may be right. My father was an Old World man. As a landscape contractor, he worked with plants and trees, not bits and bytes. But he loved Sunnyvale -- the balmy weather, the rich soil, the feelings of hope and optimism that were embodied in the beautifully curving sidewalks and sparkly new kitchen appliances.
Our house was nothing special. It had hollow wooden doors and cheap aluminum-framed picture windows, but my father adored it anyway. He always had some project going on -- landscaping the backyard, converting the garage into a family room, building brick planters around the front of the house. His pi<heart>ce de resistance was the fireplace in our family room. He laid every brick and cobblestone himself, working nights and weekends for months. But when it was done, it was magnificent, with a two-foot-high hearth and a firebox big enough to roast an ox. Over the years, our house became the wonder of the neighborhood, a brick-and-mortar monument to my father's deep feeling for his family and for the world he lived in.
Then the revolution began, and everything changed. It felt less like a revolution, exactly, than the slow buildup of electrical charge you feel as a thunderstorm approaches. My friend's father, who worked for a data storage company, arrived home one night in a new Buick. Other neighbors took vacations to Tahiti, added second stories to their homes, sent their kids to camp on the East Coast. New tilt-up buildings rose around us. My girlfriend in high school, a chemistry whiz who had already set her sights on a career in engineering, received a summer internship at Varian, then one of the valley's largest electronics firms, that paid more than I earned in an entire year of part-time work for my father.
In the late 1970's, my father's landscaping business fell on hard times, and he was forced out of the company. Landscaping was on the wrong side of the economic bell curve, and my father had difficulty finding work after that. At about the same time, my mother decided she wanted a divorce. Although she had no college degree and had not held a job in 20 years, she was hired by a new company with a dopey rainbow-colored logo: Apple Computer. She ended up working there for the next eight years as a designer, plotting the intricate layouts of printed circuit boards. Unlike my father, she caught the rising wave of prosperity in the valley, and with stock options and a steadily escalating salary, she did very well for herself. She eventually remarried and began a new life.
My father tried to start over, to date new women, to begin again, but it didn't work. He seemed shellshocked and unable to understand how things had gone wrong so quickly. He refused to sell our house, even when it became a financial burden for him, even when my sister and my brother and I were long gone, and he was living there alone. The house was the last thing he had to hold on to in a world turned upside down. Eventually he couldn't hold on any longer. He died of lung cancer in 1990 at the age of 53.
My brother and sister and I sold the house a few months later to a Taiwanese engineer and his pregnant wife for $289,000. (My parents paid $19,950 for it in 1963.) As far as I knew, they were the first nonwhite family to move onto Meadowlark Lane. I was happy to pass the house on to them, thinking that they were about to start a family of their own and that they would find as much hope and happiness in it as we had. Whatever they found, it didn't last long. In 1993, they sold it to a Hong Kong businessman named Zhengfei Ren, who used it primarily as a flophouse for himself and his employees when they visited the area. Last June, Ren sold the house to its current owner, a software engineer and real estate speculator named Nelson Chao, for $450,000.
Chao, who immigrated to the bay area from Taiwan 26 years ago, bought the house for one reason. "I think it is excellent investment, even better than the stock market," he says. And like any good investor, he set out to maximize his profit, cramming in as many tenants as he could get away with. The house was no longer a family home, a repository of hopes and dreams; it was now a wooden structure whose sole purpose was to keep rain off its occupants heads and to generate cash flow.
There are two Franks living in the house now. The first Frank I meet, who declines to give his last name, lives in the rear half of what was once our living room. He is 30, tall, thin and wary. We talk for a half-hour or so, during which he manages to tell me very little about his life except that he was born in Beijing, came to America to study computer science at the University of Southern California and now works as a software engineer for Nortel Networks. Like almost everyone else in the house, he is here on an H-1B visa; I get the strong impression that he is afraid that if he says one wrong word, he'll be thrown out of the country. That is not true, of course, but life on a temporary visa is full of anxiety and fear.
The H-1B visa, which was created in 1990 largely in answer to the high-tech industry's complaints about a shortage of skilled workers in the United States, is the topic of heated debate right now. Many high-tech executives are clamoring for the federal government to raise the ceiling on the number of workers allowed into the country each year, arguing that the booming economy is dependent upon attracting the best and brightest minds from around the world. Responding to these demands, the Senate recently introduced a bill to increase the annual allotment of six-year visas, which had already grown to 115,000 in 1998 from 65,000 in 1990, to 195,000. Labor leaders are vehemently opposed to this increase, arguing that the H-1B is little more than indentured slavery and that while foreign workers are indeed important to the new economy, the whole program needs to be substantially reformed.
The crux of the problem is that because green-card applications are sponsored by employers -- a company basically has to say, "We need this person permanently" -- visa holders are locked into an unbalanced relationship with the corporations that hire them. During the application process, which averages three years in San Jose and often takes much longer, an applicant cannot be promoted or change his or her basic job description. And if an applicant switches companies or is laid off, the whole application process begins all over again.
For workers from China and India, the H-1B is a particular problem. Although more than half the H-1B's go to citizens of those countries, the law specifies that only 7 percent of employment-based green cards can go to applicants from any one country. So Indian and Chinese applicants often wait several years for an open slot before they can even apply, and by then it is usually too late to get a green card processed before their visas expire. Many immigrant workers believe that although the high-tech industry claims it wants the green-card application process reformed, in fact the corporations are quite happy with the system the way it is because it gives them a fresh crop of young minds to exploit every six years. "The information revolution is occurring on the backs of these workers," says Pradeep Chaphalkar, a green-card holder from India who is a spokesperson for the Immigrants Support Network, an organization of workers seeking permanent residency.
When I ask Frank if he feels exploited, he pauses and looks out at the backyard, where the trunk of the mulberry sapling my father and I planted 35 years ago is now as thick as my waist. "I am very grateful to be in this country," he says, then politely excuses himself before I can ask him any more questions.
The second Frank, I soon learn, lives in my old bedroom. "He is never home, he works very hard," Sara says, then adds with a touch of awe, "He's a venture capitalist."
I meet him a few nights later, when a well-dressed young Asian man blows in through the front door. He is in a hurry and seems to be talking to himself -- then I realize that he is wearing an earpiece connected to a cell phone in his shirt pocket. He is doing business as he walks.
Sara waves him over. Frank Lin says goodbye to the person on the phone, pulls the wire out of his ear and shakes my hand. He is 25, immediately likable, though a little slick. Unlike the others in the house, his English is impeccable, his manner casual and hip -- he is what's known in the Chinese immigrant community as a "banana": yellow on the outside, white on the inside. He was born in Taiwan and came to L.A. with his family when he was 10. They were not struggling immigrants. "My father ran a large car dealership in Taiwan, and he got into the same business in L.A. and did pretty well," Frank says, standing in the sparsely furnished living room, where copies of Business 2.0 and Red Herring are stacked neatly on the coffee table. He graduated from Harvard with a degree in applied mathematics and was immediately hired by Salomon Smith Barney. He worked in the technology division, putting together mergers and acquisitions for Fortune 500 companies like Hewlett Packard. He eventually tired of the grueling hours and rigid corporate structure; when he got an offer from Panasonic's venture-capital group in Silicon Valley, he jumped at it. "It was pretty clear to me that there are a lot more opportunities here in the valley than there are back East," Frank explains. He invites me to visit him at work, and a few days later I take him up on it.
The Panasonic Digital Concepts Center (P.D.C.C.), which is only a few blocks from my old house, is an example of the latest trend in venture-capital investing in Silicon Valley -- a start-up incubator. It is a little like a day care center for entrepreneurs: Panasonic provides not only start-up capital to its clients but also office space and in-house expertise on how to get a business up and running quickly. The setup gives entrepreneurs space to work, an increasingly rare commodity in the valley, while allowing Panasonic to keep a watchful eye on its offspring. Panasonic's incubator is not the richest -- P.D.C.C. has a modest $50 million fund, which it has used to invest in about a dozen companies so far -- but it may have the sleekest offices: a thin-panel TV playing "The Matrix" in the lobby, glass-wall offices, a well-stocked kitchen where geeks working on the various start-ups congregate and swap stock tips.
Frank's first meeting the morning of my visit is with Joe Corrigan, the C.E.O. of Rocket8, an online auction network targeted at teenagers. Corrigan is here at the P.D.C.C. to pitch the coming global dominance of his company. Depending on how things go over the next hour or so, Corrigan could walk out with a promise of several million for his start-up. Or not.
The meeting is held around a long mahogany table in one of the conference rooms. Besides Frank at the table are Cate Cavanaugh and Jim Robbins, the company's principals. Corrigan, 25, is a polished, well-spoken guy, his shirt collar open, his sleeves rolled up, suggestive of a man who is getting down to business. He rattles off numbers, flashes charts and talks about "data mining" and "scalability." Frank scratches notes on a yellow legal pad and asks a few pointed questions. Cavanaugh and Robbins do the heavy lifting, grilling Corrigan on his business plan: "How are you going to separate yourself from the hundreds of other sites that are trying to attract the Gen-Y crowd?"; "I don't really see the nuts and bolts of your revenue stream here -- is this 100 percent advertising driven?"; "What's going to prevent this from becoming a dumping ground for second-rate products?" Corrigan has an answer for everything, but it is clear that no one in the room is bowled over by his pitch.
Afterward, Frank lingers in the hall and talks with me about the flaws and the strengths in Rocket8's business model. "Maybe we'll take a look at them again in a year or so, after they've built up some momentum," he says. This is V.C.-speak for "Thanks, but no thanks."
Still, after this meeting I understand why Sara is so respectful of him. While she is stuck on the phone 10 hours a day, selling computer monitors and worrying about her H-1B visa, Frank works in the valley's inner sanctum -- the place where the money is distributed. Whereas Sara's best hope in the valley is to marry well, Frank has his get-rich-quick credentials in order: a degree from an Ivy League college, an understanding of how money moves, a singular and ruthless devotion to work that is uncluttered by love or lust. He is one of the foot soldiers in what the Silicon Valley social critic Paulina Borsook, author of "Cyberselfish," calls "the invasion of the M.B.A.'s" -- the huge flood of well-educated, soft-shoed money shufflers who are a sure sign of what a global powerhouse the valley has become, as well a tombstone for the wild, freewheeling days of barefoot entrepreneurs and change-the-world technohippies. Like the elegant restaurants and sophisticated architecture, the invasion of the M.B.A.'s is a sign that the valley has been civilized.
To Frank, however, the move from Wall Street to Silicon Valley feels plenty adventurous. Most established V.C.'s get a piece of equity in companies they invest in, and if you hit it big, you can get very rich; Frank, who is near the bottom of the V.C. totem pole, works for straight salary. He won't say how much, except that it is about half of what he was making on Wall Street. Worse, he is living in a place he clearly believes is beneath him. Like Sara, he ended up in my old house by answering an ad in The World Journal. He thinks of it as temporary quarters until he finds a place of his own. But in the few months since he moved in, the landlord has jammed several other tenants into the house, and now Frank has to wait in line for the bathroom every morning and do his laundry in the washing machine in the backyard.
"I'm paying my dues," Frank says one night, looking around my old living room with disdain.
One night, Sara invites me upstairs to look at some pictures with her. The room is in such chaos that it is hardly recognizable as the room where I watched my father waste away: a double bed on a metal frame against the wall, clothes and junk piled out on the balcony, a folding metal table in the corner that is stacked high with various cosmetics and ointments, a desktop computer with brightly colored fish swimming across the screen and on the nightstand beside the bed, a big plastic pink and white cat-shaped Hello Kitty alarm clock and a dogeared copy of "Soros on Soros," a book-length interview with the global financier George Soros, translated into Mandarin.
She shows me pictures of herself when she was 21, 22, 23, wearing a red silk dress, on vacation with her ex-boyfriend (now a Microsoft paper millionaire), frolicking on the beach. "See, I was a good-looking woman once!" she jokes.
For Sara, being a single woman in the valley is not fun. She broke up with the Microsoft guy about a year ago, and now she is going out with a software engineer who works at an investment bank in San Francisco, but she is not sure where that relationship is going. In the valley, where men outnumber women by roughly 3 to 1, you would think that someone like Sara -- attractive, fun-loving, funny -- would have her pick of the litter. Sara assures me it is not true. "What is that joke I heard?" she says, tapping her fingers on the photo album. "Something about how there are thousands of men in Silicon Valley, but they are all the same man. All engineers. All working very hard. All when they don't work, they have to study, because they are all afraid of becoming obsolete. That is the big fear of everyone here -- if you don't work hard enough, you become obsolete."
As it turns out, Sara has a lot of theories about men in Silicon Valley. She believes that the same character traits that this economy rewards -- a monomaniacal devotion to work, technological savvy, a brash arrogance that you, too, can reorder the world -- are precisely the qualities that make most men in the valley such bad bets for husbands. "It is very difficult to have an argument with a Silicon Valley man," Sara explains. "They are not used to compromising, or not getting their way, or listening." She tells me about an engineer she dated who used to yell at her if she got up from her table at a restaurant and pushed her chair back at an angle. "Engineers like order," she says. "They do not like messy people like me."
Part of Sara's worry about men comes from her mother in Taiwan, who fears that she will turn into an old maid. Her parents don't like a lot of what America has done to Sara -- they think she dresses too casually now, doesn't wear enough makeup, speaks her mind too much. At the same time, by American standards she is very conservative. She won't go to bars or clubs, doesn't date anyone who isn't Taiwanese, never does drugs and rarely drinks alcohol. "I am not American; I am not Taiwanese," she says. "I'm in between, and that is a hard place to be."
At 8:30 on a Friday night, Frank Lin picks me up at my hotel in his dusty, gum-wrapper-strewn Honda Accord. He had intended to go to his usual Friday networking party for Asian-Americans at a bar in Palo Alto, but at the last minute he changed his mind -- even Frank, dedicated networker that he is, gets tired of passing business cards around. So, instead, we head up the Bayshore Freeway to dinner with a few of his friends at a sushi restaurant in Milbrae. Bayshore is the Main Street of Silicon Valley, a shaggy, bumpy, traffic-choked four-lane highway that is festooned with billboards for dot-coms desperate to capture a nanosecond of the fractured attention span of the valley's movers and shakers.
It has been a tense day in the valley -- the Nasdaq fell 189 points, one of the first tremors before mid-April's full-scale panic. Already, the mood is shifting. Gone is the simple idea that anyone who has a good idea and is willing to work hard can hit it big. A quiet panic is beginning to rise, like the panic that spreads on a listing ship when its passengers realize there aren't enough lifeboats to go around.
Frank, however, shows no signs of slowing down. He snatches up his ever-buzzing cell phone ("Frank Lin," he answers with studied abruptness), and it is clear that he is still a little jazzed from a busy day -- four pitches, two of which he says were interesting enough to pursue further. Plus, P.D.C.C. is set to announce a $5 million investment in a company that creates in-store media displays, which is the incubator's largest deal yet. I ask if the day's drop in the markets spooked him.
"Nah," he says with surprising bluster. "If you're gonna be in this game, you gotta have a stomach for risk."
At the sushi restaurant, we meet Frank's friends in a small private room. They are all Chinese and Taiwanese-Americans, and like Frank, they have all been in the United States long enough to become naturalized citizens, they all speak fluent English and of course they all work in high tech.
The talk is about stocks -- what you should sell, what you should hold, the difference between options and futures, the dangers of shorting and going long. Frank claims to be a long-term investor, not interested in the day-to-day gyrations, but in the valley, that is like standing in the rain without an umbrella and trying not to get wet. One of Frank's friends, Victor Yang, a tall, stylish 25-year-old who sells computer hardware -- L.C.D. screens, motherboards and other components -- for Quanta, a giant Taiwanese manufacturer, admits that these wild market swings are spooky: "If this thing crashes, where are all these jobs going to go? What are people going to do? Everyone is stretched so thin around here. I think it could be real chaos." Like many other salaried workers I've spoken to, Victor admits he is tired of meeting people who have gotten rich simply because they have been in the right place at the right time, and says he won't mind the social justice that a crash would bring to the valley. "I think a crash would be a kind of leveler," he says. "It might equal things out a bit." Of course, Victor's credibility as a have-not is undermined slightly when we leave the restaurant and I notice he is driving a shiny Porsche 911.
We head down to Nola's, a popular bar in downtown Palo Alto. The place is jammed, music blasting, funky Caribbean art all over the walls. Between beers, Frank talks about his future plans: stay at P.D.C.C. for a year or two, learn how the game is played, then start his own company. What that company might be, he has no idea. "I think it's important to take your time, think it through. I don't care what the market is doing -- there will always be plenty of money around for good ideas."
Frank's relentless optimism is countered by Victor's continuing tales of woe in the hardware business. He spends two or three weeks of every month in the air, he explains, jumping from city to city in the U.S. to visit customers, then flying over to Taiwan at least once every two months to visit the home office. "My life is a series of airports, hotels and rent-a-cars," Victor says. "It can be brutal. Hardware is a commodity now, like toilet paper, and competition is intense." Sipping on his beer, he tells a story about a guy he recently met on a flight from New York to San Jose: "The guy asked me what I do for a living, and I went on my usual spiel about chips and motherboards and how tough life is in the hardware business. He nodded, then looked at me and said: 'What about the trees, what about the air? Do you ever think about that?' I just stared at him. I had no idea what to say. I just thought: 'You're right, buddy. We've totally lost perspective."'
Whenever I am in the valley, I spend a lot of time driving around, checking out new buildings and old haunts, trying to absorb all the changes that have swept through in the last couple of decades. It is not easy. The valley lies between two major earthquake faults, the Hayward and the San Andreas. The ground is, quite literally, always moving. Subtle sociological shifts that take generations to occur in other regions seem to happen here overnight. Barber shops morph into copy centers; malls are torn down and rebuilt; new office buildings rise like towers of Lego blocks; roads are widened, then clogged, then widened, then clogged again. Some of this motion feels appropriate; some of it feels tragic; some seems unwittingly symbolic. The office building where Steve Jobs and his band of merry pirates built the first Macintosh, for example, has been leveled and replaced by sleek new offices for Ernst & Young, one of the world's largest accounting and consulting firms. Even more telling, the bungalow where the Nobel Prize-winning scientist William Shockley designed the first transistor chip in the late 1940's -- a Silicon Valley landmark if ever there was one -- now sells ergonomic furniture, designed to relieve the stress of high-tech life.
There are signs that the brutality of life here is beginning to take its toll. Austin, Tex., not Silicon Valley, was the fastest growing high-tech center in the United States in 1999; in fact, last year, for the first time in five years, the tide of new immigrants into the valley was offset by an even stronger flow of people moving out. And no wonder. The quality of life in the area has seriously deteriorated over the last decade. Cities are having a hard time hiring cops; traffic is a nightmare; schools are struggling to recruit teachers -- if you don't work in high tech, why live here?
Still, Silicon Valley remains the capital of the new world, and as long as it doesn't all vanish in a major earthquake, it will probably retain its prominence for some time. The central paradox of the valley is that although it invented the technology that has made geography increasingly irrelevant, if you work in high tech, this is still the place to be. Part of it is the easy access to vast amounts of capital, which is crucial to anyone dreaming of a start-up; part of it is simply keeping up with the buzz. "The more dependent we become on technology, the more we understand that it's in face-to-face human contact that all the subtle energies are exchanged," says Paul Saffo, founder of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park. "In the valley, you pick up information about what's new and what's hot almost by osmosis."
So far, Silicon Valley has been able to avoid the ethnic and racial tensions that plague other regions that have absorbed large numbers of immigrants. But easy harmony during boom times is no great accomplishment; it remains to be seen what happens as the boom fades. The valley's true human fault line, however, is not race but class: it is evolving rapidly into a two-tier culture of the technologically savvy global elite and the people who service them. In San Francisco, where many artists and small businesses have been displaced by skyrocketing rents, there is already a backlash brewing. The invasion of the dot-commer was an issue in last November's mayoral race, and warehouse walls in the red-hot South of Market district are scrawled with graffiti like "evicted.com" and "greed.net."
But whether these voices of protest are a sign of a rising social movement or just the whispers of the vanquished remains to be seen. One of the self-perpetuating virtues of a fast-changing culture like the valley is that there are fewer and fewer people around who remember what was lost. The past is not only uninteresting; it has been obliterated. The price of progress is memory.
Sara calls me on my cell phone and says excitedly: "I found a house! We're closing on it today!"
A few hours later, we drive to a neighborhood in west San Jose, a couple of miles away from my old house. It is a modest area, maybe one click down the socioeconomic scale from my neighborhood in Sunnyvale. But the house she is buying is neat and pretty, the nicest one on the street, with a big rose hedge and a lemon tree in the front yard. It is hard to see it clearly because it is pouring rain, but that doesn't dampen Sara's enthusiasm. She stares at it through the beating windshield wipers and for moment all her worries -- her boyfriend, her visa, her future -- seem to vanish. She is excited, happy, bouncing in her seat. "I was born to be an American," she crows.
When we return to my old house, it looks shaggier than ever. The gutters are clogged, and sheets of water are pouring off the roof onto the exterior walls, dripping over the door stoop, seeping through cracks in the shingles. I smell mold, decay, decline. Even the water in the aquifer 210 feet beneath the house is in bad shape, polluted by toxic chemicals -- TCA, TCE, Freon -- that leached into the ground from an old chip-manufacturing plant nearby. My family home is now perched on the edge of a Superfund site.
Still, life continues on Meadowlark Lane. Sara and I talk in the living room for a while; tonight, for the first time since I've been back to visit, the house is bustling. Eric, the cranky engineer I met on my first visit, heats a bowl of soup in the microwave; the other Frank, the one who works at Nortel, sits with his door a crack open, which, given the closed-up nature of life in the house, is a gesture of friendliness. The hum of activity feels not unlike it did when I was growing up there, and for a moment I wonder if maybe my sister is wrong -- my father is not spinning in his grave. Maybe he is looking up at these new settlers who have landed in his beloved home and smiling, grateful that it is being lived in by people who, in their own way, are as optimistic and hopeful as he once was.
As I'm preparing to leave, Frank Lin walks in, looking haggard. We talk for a few minutes about the new deals he has been working on and he seems, as usual, excited about them. He tells me that he will be moving out in a few weeks -- his brother is buying a town house and Frank is going to rent one of the bedrooms. "I can't wait to get out of here," he says, glancing around the lonely kitchen. A wave of revulsion passes over his face. "This place is just such a dump," he says. "There's not much you can do but tear it down." Then he heads into my old bedroom for some much needed sleep.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 5-28-00: Word & Image;
Who Wants to Be a Monopoly?

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
Until a few weeks ago, I expected to live out my life without adopting a firm theory of monopoly. The subject, confounded by the obfuscation of economists and lawyers, always struck me as impossibly difficult. Fair competition in capitalism seemed to be like the strike zone in baseball -- a matter of considerable discretion and best left to the regulation of umpires.
I even thought that some monopolies were useful; securely profitable newspapers obviously behaved more responsibly than economic weaklings. And big was not automatically bad: corporate giants needed giant rivals to feel challenged and checked. I pronounced flexibility a virtue and relied on government umpires to protect our markets and the public interest. 
 No longer.
When the Time Warner cable monopoly in Manhattan chose on May Day to deny me Peter Jennings, Regis Philbin and Ted Koppel merely to squeeze some more millions out of the Disney Company, I realized that the umpire had been much too lax, refusing even to demand payment for use of the broadcast spectrum or to get some free television time for decent election coverage. All this was proof that the media monsters will never put a public interest ahead of their own. Time Warner had for too long controlled not only the cables into my home but also many of the channels and programs passing through its wire. It was hogging both my medium and my message, and the combination virtually guaranteed anticompetitive behavior.
Now Time Warner wants to merge with AOL and control my cable access to the Internet as well. And still the umpire seems distracted or asleep.
Not that the May Day blackout was entirely Time Warner's fault. It pulled the trigger but not without provocation from the Mickey Mouse moguls. Because Disney, too, had been allowed to grow too fat and to swallow up media properties like ABC and ESPN, it felt directly threatened by the AOL Time Warner combine. Disney had also threatened me with a blackout, showing equal disregard for my prepaid viewing rights.
To be sure, the ambitions of Disney and Time Warner are so complementary that they are bound to find an eventual accommodation. But their peace, like their war, will be at my expense. If not soon reduced in size, all the overgrown media monsters will follow in the path of Microsoft, abusing their control over both the conduits and contents of communication to destroy competitors and elude regulation.
The media news in recent weeks confirms the trend. Viacom swallowed CBS to gain control of 41 percent of the broadcast market (and began maneuvers to overcome the frail regulatory limit of 35 percent). AT&T moved to complete its acquisition of MediaOne so as to seize command of more than one-third of the nation's cable industry. And the five major American music companies virtually confessed to having colluded to cheat their disc customers of more than $500 million with various price-fixing schemes.
Some newspapers were also caught up in these antics, an uncomfortable reminder that the monopolistic arts antedate the Web. The Hearst Corporation was shown at trial to be finagling to kill its own San Francisco Examiner so that it could acquire the paper's more profitable partner, The Chronicle, and dispense with even nominal competition. Testimony revealed the use of crude promises of editorial support for Mayor Willy Brown if he would drop his opposition and help to gain federal approval for the scheme. (The Examiner and The Chronicle had already been merged for all functions except news gathering under an antitrust exemption that the newspaper industry pushed through Congress 30 years ago. These "joint operating" deals have done much less for journalistic enterprise than for profits. But in any case they only disguise and delay the drift toward print monopolies. Even before the Hearst trial ended, a famous rivalry between The Post and The Rocky Mountain News in Denver ended in yet another such "joining.")
So I have learned three things about the evolving media business:
1. The commendable but all-consuming prosecution of Microsoft by the Justice Department seems to have exhausted or distracted the umpire and left the rest of the field unguarded.
2. The Clinton administration's repeated claim that the lure of monopolistic profits can stimulate giant corporations to innovate is unproved and probably wrong. As William Safire observed with an African proverb after the May Day blackout, "When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers."
3. The hope that the new technologies will democratize the commerce of communication is, on present evidence, nave. The world's half-dozen conglomerated merchants of information and entertainment control so many conduits and so much content that they will inevitably rig the market to favor their own transmissions and services and to disadvantage all others.
In some distant future, it may become possible for Americans to get their Web-based news, fun and education by many competing routes, including interactive cables, telephone wires, wireless radio and satellite dishes. But for the foreseeable future, the path of choice will be the cables that already carry TV images into three of every four homes.
It is the lure of owning cables that inspired AOL to offer billions to acquire Time Warner and AT&T to mortgage itself to buy MediaOne. They well understand, even if the umpires don't, that the complex "architecture" by which small packets of data travel to and from the Web now permits the owners of cable lines to enhance the speed and quality of their own messages and to shortchange rivals.
Just months ago, when America Online had reason to fear that AT&T's new cable prowess would be used against it, AOL begged the courts and Congress to intervene to forbid all discrimination. Yet now that it hopes to own Time Warner's cables, AOL no longer begs; it actively opposes government regulation. To facilitate Washington's approval of their marriage, AOL and Time Warner promise fair access for "multiple" -- if not all -- Web services. As an alert White House should know, this all depends on what "all" means.
It was fear of cable discrimination that drove Disney toward the May Day shootout. Similar disruptions are inevitable if the media's quasi-monopolies go unchecked.
By far the best way to achieve openness would be to require media corporations to choose between the business of conduit and the business of content, between managing the lines of communication and designing the messages and services to be transmitted. Hoarding both functions confers monopolistic power to rig the market and to diminish competition. The emerging concentrations of power risk a May Day every day.

HEADLINE: Old Wethersfield Streets Offer a Glimpse of the Past

BYLINE: By BESS LIEBENSON 

 BODY:
BETWEEN Rocky Hill and Hartford there is a time warp and it is called Old Wethersfield. Founded in 1634 as Connecticut's first permanent English settlement, Wethersfield was described as the state's "most auncient" town by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut in 1650.
"It's a town of pristine preservation with the largest historic district in the state," said Brenda Milkofsky, director of the Wethersfield Historical Society. "Unlike Williamsburg and Sturbridge, which are recreated communities, Wethersfield is an authentic landscape." 
 The approximately two-mile rectangular strip called Old Wethersfield (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) offers visitors an easy way to lose themselves without getting lost.
A get-acquainted drive past old houses, farms, barns and warehouses, about 150 predating 1850 is an easy way to begin; then visitors can simply walk the short distances. Wethersfield has a rich vocabulary of architecture ranging from early English style to suburban houses built at the turn of the century.
A logical first stop along the tree-lined brick walks is the Wethersfield Museum in the Keeny Memorial Cultural Center, built of local brown brick and stone in 1893 with splashing front fountain. It is a place to relax on new benches, pick up pamphlets, learn about walking tours and view an orientation exhibit. "Legendary People, Ordinary Lives" offers an overview of the town's architecture, furnishings and prominent residents as well as its early economy, which was rooted in maritime and agricultural industries. (For those with children in tow, there is a special guide to help them.)
One driving loop can take motorists up Broad Street and back down Main, past the Broad Street Village Green, mariners' and merchants' homes of various vintages and one of two early farms still in operation. The Anderson Farm, circa 1837, with weathered wagon in front announces flowers as well as produce in season.
Cove Warehouse, a 17th-century post and beam warehouse at the north end of Main Street, sits on a lonely crest overlooking the water. If visitors push open a shutter-like window they can be transported to the middle of the 1600's, when vessels were being built in the area and the harbor, now called the cove, was a center for shipping animals, flax, seed and the region's major crop, red onions, to places as far away as the West Indies. Story panels and artifacts recreate a warehouse alive with business activity among farmers, merchants and shipmasters. Outside the old warehouse there are picnic tables that offer a place to rest and soak up the view, in summer a sea of boats.
On Main Street, gardening-minded visitors and others simply interested in the beauty of flowers can head to Comstock Ferre & Company, a four-story red barn dating from the 1820's and one of the oldest garden centers in Connecticut.
Today, original tin signs and blazing nursery display of perennials and roses stop traffic. But their indoor row-on-row old rocker bins and tin-lined oak drawers displaying seed stock and bright bouquets of original lithographed packets might be the real scene stealers. When the onion trade (1730-1830) expired, "Wethersfield farmers were charged with finding a new outlet," Ms. Milkofsky said. "Eight seed companies developed trial and seed gardens in plots that had previously been onion patches."
Wethersfield's centerpiece may well be the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum, a trio of mustard, red and blue houses from the 18th century. Their newest attraction is the Colonial revival-style garden. It was installed behind the Webb House last year from long-lost plans; now old-fashioned flowers, archways and paths lead to a barn, sometimes a setting for weddings. Inside the houses, furniture and decorative arts from 1690 to 1840 reflect the life styles of the merchant Joseph Webb, the diplomat Silas Deane and the leather worker Isaac Stevens. In the Webb house's front parlor it is said that George Washington met with Comte Rochambeau to outline plans that led to the final victory of the Continental Army in Yorktown. The Rev. Wallace Nutting -- renowned as a philosopher, maker of reproduction furniture and Colonial restorationist -- bought the house in 1916.
The Greek revival circa-1830 Chester Bulkley House, next door to the Wethersfield Museum, is a bed and breakfast and the only overnight lodging in the restored district. A steep flight of steps leads to a sitting room and guest rooms (there are five guest rooms, three with private baths, priced from $65 to $85 plus 12 percent tax). In one room, two white four-poster beds crowned with pineapple finials overlooked a white antiqued bombe chest bearing a bouquet of tulips. White lace swags hang at the windows and floral rugs rest on wide planked floors.
Just down the block is the circa-1787 Standish House. The gracious white Colonial -- which has served as inn, stagecoach stop, post office and restaurant -- offers dining downstairs and up.
The brick Georgian Hurlbut-Dunham House, on the other side of the Wethersfield Museum, is typical of many New England houses. It was updated in the 1860's with porches, a colonnade and a commanding belvedere. Much of the last owner's furnishings and collections remain, and a center-hall bombe breakfront is aflow with blue and white china.
A tour of the Ancient Burying Ground can be a treat if one is fortunate enough to be led by the Historical Society's education coordinator, Betty Arnold, a feisty, knowledgeable 85-year-old woman who has lived in the community since she was in the third grade. Ms. Arnold can prod even weary visitors up the hill among gravestones that tell stories going back to the 1630's. The stones range from simple slabs with crude letters to ornate tables and tombs boasting carved heads and cherub faces. A slave dying a freed man, a fever sweeping the town and sailors perishing at sea are among the historic glimmers.
And Ms. Arnold can offer fairly direct commentary as well: "The Puritans were people of the upper sort who believed in a hierarchy," she said, pointing out the more prestigious hilltop, where, she added, "People were buried on the hill according to their place in society."
Across the street is the meeting house of the First Church of Christ (1761). A glass corridor overlooking the Ancient Burying Ground is enthralling, and inside the sanctuary are red velvet pews, mustard, red and green candelabras and a dramatic raised pulpit and canopy. Two blocks south is Temple Beth Torah, housed in a former Methodist church dating to 1689, its double blue doors adorned with raised gold stars.
"We like to say Wethersfield is 10 minutes and 200 years removed from Hartford," said Ms. Milkofsky of the Historical Society. "It's very much removed from the hustle and bustle."
 
If You Go
 
 Old Wethersfield can be reached by taking Exit 26 from Interstate 91.
Among attractions to look for this summer are the exhibition "Lost Gardens of New England and Wethersfield," June 8 through Sept. 4 at the Wethersfield Museum in the Keeney Memorial Cultural Center (200 Main Street; 860-529-7656).
For a get-acquainted tour, call the Wethersfield Historical Society (860-529-7656); a "Welcome to Wethersfield: Home and Garden Tour" will be given on June 10.
Among places to stay are a bed and breakfast, the Chester Bulkley House (184 Main Street; 860-563-4236), and the Ramada Inn (1330 Silas Deane Highway; 860-563-2311) .
Places to eat include Standish House (222 Main Street; 860-257-1151), the Spicy Green Bean Deli (285 Main Street; 860-563-3100) and Mainly Tea (221 Main Street; 860-529-9517). BESS LIEBENSON

HEADLINE: FILM;
The Blockbuster Can No Longer Live By Muscle Alone

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS; Nancy Hass writes frequently about the business of entertainment.

 BODY:
LIKE death, taxes and those sprayed helmets of hair sported by many women on the Upper East Side, some things never seem to change. Like summer movies. Always the same: fiery explosions, knockout special effects, thin plots, well-muscled stars. Add to that nonstop television commercials, toys on the shelves, action figures in the Happy Meal. It seems so formulaic.
Despite appearances, however, the summer blockbuster has changed plenty since its birth -- widely acknowledged as June 1975, when "Jaws," the first movie to be treated to a full television ad campaign, began systematically terrorizing the nation. But the changes have been subtle and cumulative. 
Cooking up such a film may still look as simple as following a recipe, but with the escalation of technology, the proliferation of movie screens and a steadily increasing number of films, the path to official blockbusterdom has become as complicated as a quadratic equation, and as hard to calculate. "There's just an ether in the world when a movie breaks through," said the director Barry Sonnenfeld, whose "Men in Black" (a successful 1997 blockbuster) was followed last summer by "Wild Wild West" (a bust). "You can't predict it, you can't market for it. You just have to breathe it in."
If that is true, then this summer's contenders could use an oxygen tent. The sound you have been hearing in the pre- and early summer season air is conspicuous silence. Remember, as early as April 1999, "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" and its product line were being flogged so relentlessly that the Force was with us even in our dreams.
Not to mention that by then teenagers across America, primed by the publicity machine for "Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me," were already greeting pals in the mall with a rousing "Shagadelic!" (Blockbuster Rule No. 1: the average number of times that teenagers see a summer blockbuster is 2.8. Repeat customers are the secret to racking up $100 million in ticket sales.)
Many would have been hard-pressed to name the five most anticipated films for the summer of 2000. (Among the top contenders are the "Mission: Impossible" sequel, "M:i-2" (which opened on Wednesday); "X-Men"; "The Patriot," with Mel Gibson; "Gone in 60 Seconds," with Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie; and Wolfgang Petersen's adaptation of Sebastian Junger's "Perfect Storm.")
The contrast between the last two seasons illustrates how complex the making and marketing of summer movies has become. Some Hollywood insiders say preseason buzz has been light this time around because the films simply aren't very good. Studios, they say, are no longer willing to promote a mediocre movie heavily in the hope that marketing alone will push it to blockbuster status. "Godzilla," said one producer, referring to the 1998 film that was heavily promoted and disappointingly received, "changed everything."
Others counter that the relentless hyping of "Phantom Menace" simply tired the public out. Besides, they argue, there is no reason to spend lavishly on publicity when overall ticket sales rose more than 65 percent during the 1990's, to $7.4 billion last year. If you release it, the conventional wisdom goes these days (cadged, of course, from an April release, "Field of Dreams"), they will come.
Another reason for the lack of prerelease hoopla is that many in this summer's crop of films don't lend themselves to licensing, which has in the last decade become a crucial source of profit and promotion (sorry, kids, no Tom Cruise "M:i-2" action figure). "The most important thing about licensing isn't really the money you make," said Danny Simon, president of the Licensing Group, which puts together deals between manufacturers and movie studios. "It's the promotional value of having those products on the shelves, the excitement it generates for the film in the hearts of every kid who passes by."
So far this season hasn't even seen the usual overhyped product-placement deals, an important element of summer films since the 1982 hit "E.T." (The decision back then by the M &M Mars Company not to pay the filmmakers for using M & M's as a crucial plot point in Steven Spielberg's film led to the makers of Reese's Pieces' gaining an avalanche of publicity.)
Fresh in many executives' minds is the memory of last summer's surprise: the extraordinary success of two modestly financed films, "The Sixth Sense" and the "Blair Witch Project." A few executives said they were advising their studios to hang back, hoping to ride the trend toward such smaller movies that turn into blockbusters by word of mouth.
"A few years ago, people were totally focused on getting big budgets and promotional commitments," said one producer with several large-scale blockbusters under his belt. He called it the "Independence Day" mentality. "Now you think to yourself, is there any way I can make a small film that hits huge, which works out so well for everyone. You think that, even though you know it's ridiculous. You can't plan for something like that."
The good news for moviegoers is that as filmmakers and studios seem to be casting about for the next wave, the movies themselves seem to be getting smarter, or at least less cartoonish.
Not all of them, of course, but a significant number. Gone, for now, are pure testosterone-driven vehicles of the sort that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone specialized in during the 1980's and early 1990's. In their place is a more balanced palette of offerings, including last year's "Notting Hill" and this June's "Me, Myself and Irene," a comedy with Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger. There is also a golf story directed by Robert Redford, "The Legend of Bagger Vance," which stars Will Smith and Matt Damon and is due out in August.
Although this year will have plenty of slam-bang adventure and science-fiction films, including Paul Verhoeven's "Hollow Man" (opening Aug. 4), with Kevin Bacon as an invisible man, and this month's "Battlefield Earth," adapted from an early novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, the trend seems to be toward real-life, character-driven suspense. For example, the history-based "Gladiator," with Russell Crowe, which earned more than $102 million in its first three weeks, and "The Patriot," a Revolutionary War drama opening June 28. Instead of aliens, the most fearsome enemy seems to be the elements, as battled by George Clooney in "The Perfect Storm." Even "X-Men," adapted from a popular comic book, is said to emphasize the humanness of its superheroes.
This summer's movies feature polished but decidedly unpumped stars like Mr. Cruise, Patrick Stewart, Chris O'Donnell and Mr. Cage. "As compared with some of the action stars of the past, these guys take a very active role in making sure their characters aren't just stereotypes and that the movies aren't overmarketed," said Brian Grazer, who produced the 1995 hit "Apollo 13," among others. During the making of that film, said Mr. Grazer, Tom Hanks insisted that the marketing plan avoid imitating the classic over-the-top campaigns of the 1990's: "How he handled it really made an impression on me."
This season it was Mr. Cruise himself who rejected the idea of big licensing tie-ins to "M:i-2," said Mr. Simon of the Licensing Group.
BUT star control is only one way in which the economic infrastructure of the summer blockbuster has changed. Even the very definition of a blockbuster has metamorphosed since "Jaws," which set the benchmark at $100 million. That stayed pretty stable until the 1990's, when the grosses started climbing. Since 1997, the cut-off seems to be $200 million. And that's just in domestic ticket sales. Add to that overseas sales, licensing, video, soundtracks and product placement, most of which didn't even exist when "Jaws" hit the beach.
Unfortunately for the studios, production budgets have swelled even faster. "E.T." made $399 million and cost $10 million. (The film is part of summer movie lore; even though ticket prices at the time were about $4, it remains the fourth-highest-grossing picture of all time.)
For studios, the stakes are enormous. Pressured toward profitablity by the entertainment conglomerates that now own them, they have become increasingly dependent on summer revenue. Last year, 40 percent of the studios' $6.9 billion annual take came in the weeks between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of "Armageddon," said: "Some people like to dismiss summer movies as just entertainment, but the truth is that they are hugely important to the health of studios. In summer every night is Saturday night and there is a lot of pressure to perform, more than ever before." Mr. Bruckheimer is also the producer of "Gone in 60 Seconds" and "Coyote Ugly," both coming this summer, as well as the highest-budget film ever approved -- the $135 million "Pearl Harbor," due next summer.
Although directors like Mr. Sonnenfeld insist it's impossible to plan for a blockbuster, some producers say there is now no choice but to try. Kathleen Kennedy, who produced "E.T." for Mr. Spielberg, said that back then no one had enough foresight to fully exploit the merchandising possibilities of the cuddly alien. This year, she said, long before she started filming the third "Jurassic Park," she found herself in studio meetings focusing solely on cross-promotion and licensing.
Of course, not even the definition of summer has stayed the same. Forget the calendar; as far as Hollywood is concerned, summer started weeks ago with the opening of DreamWorks' "Gladiator," Sony's "I Dreamed of Africa" and Universal's "Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"
Underlying these changes are two developments: the proliferation of films being released and the multiplexing of America. Both are good news for theater owners, but treacherous for moviemakers and moviegoers.
With more than 40 pictures to open in just three months this year, summer scheduling has become a Hollywood obsession. The trick is to find a weekend when there is no formidable competition. To that end, studios now announce release dates long before the first frame has been shot (though to add confusion, those dates are often shifted).
"Opening big" has always been crucial to summer movies, but now, with the average multiplex offering 6 screens (some have as many as 25), the fate of each film is decided 45 minutes into the first showing on Friday night. While there has been some reversal of the trend toward snap judgments in fall and spring films -- inspired by slow-growing hits like "American Beauty" and "Shakespeare in Love" -- the pressure has escalated in summer.
These days, if the audience isn't laughing or gasping enough by 7:45 p.m. on that first night, theater owners can easily decide to boot the film and replace it with additional showings of the action-adventure flick next door. "You're out literally by the 9:30 p.m. show," Mr. Bruckheimer said. "It can be brutal." For moviegoers, it can mean being faced with the same four rock-'em-sock-'em movies playing in a 12-screen cineplex.
With competition fierce for those summer teenage dollars, filmmakers increasingly employ high-tech effects. There may be fewer jacked-up physiques on screen, but there are more gadgets and cinematographic sleight-of-hand. What allowed "Jaws" to chomp its way into the public consciousness was the realism of the mechanical great white. That lesson has grown into a mantra in the intervening decades.
From the doe-eyed extraterrestrial in "E.T.," which now looks so primitive, to the dinosaurs of the 1992 "Jurassic Park" and the pyrotechnics of last year's dizzying "Phantom Menace," computer technology has become a cornerstone of summer films. Animated films, which were once limited to a single Disney picture every few years, are now made by several studios using innovative techniques. (This year, "Dinosaur," which opened on May 19, "Chicken Run" (June 23) and "Titan A.E." (June 16) are among the entrants.)
The Internet has also had a profound effect on the making of a blockbuster. Its democratizing nature has led to unexpected hits like the "Blair Witch Project," which was marketed almost entirely online through the filmmakers' own efforts. But the Internet has also made it very hard for filmmakers to stop the leaking of information -- especially negative market research and focus-group feedback -- before the film is ready to be released. Such bad word of mouth, instantly communicated to millions of teenagers, is a sure killer for summer films.
"When you're doing a big movie, you try a lot of things -- the last thing you want is your process to be reviewed before you're done," said Gale Ann Hurd, a producer of "Terminator," "Aliens" and "Armageddon." "It's frightening."
Mr. Sonnenfeld believes that one of the reasons "Wild, Wild West" did so badly on its opening weekend was that "misinformation" got out on the Web and was picked up by journalists. "It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said.
Still, Mr. Sonnenfeld, a master of combining computer effects with quirky stories, looks forward to another technological leap that will be a great boon to him and other filmmakers. The way he sees it, digital transmission, in doing away with the costly process of striking thousands of prints, will change everything. Within a couple of years, he suggested, a filmmaker whose blockbuster is starting to fade a bit at the box office could easily zap in some additional footage to lure teenagers back for another viewing. "That," he said, "would stand summer on its head."

HEADLINE: HEALTH;
Health Chief Faced Trouble in Previous Post

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
A LITTLE more than a year ago, Dr. Joshua Lipsman left Alexandria, Va., where he had been health commissioner for seven years, to become executive director of the Manhattan-based Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's oldest and largest AIDS services agency.
But after just 10 months on the job, marked by severe budget problems and political infighting, Dr. Lipsman has returned to the field of public health as Westchester's new health commissioner. 
 "I just plunged into this maelstrom of discontent and unhappiness, on top of the already sad and hard situation called AIDS," Dr. Lipsman said.
The agency had already gone through three downsizings -- eliminating programs and laying people off -- when Dr. Lipsman discovered a $2.5 million budget shortfall. The staff became disillusioned at the prospect of further cuts, and Dr. Lipsman said he became "the lightning rod" for criticism.
The financial crisis was caused by the changing demographics of AIDS, Dr. Lipsman said. It no longer strikes primarily gay white men -- traditional donors to the group -- but has moved into poor minority groups. At the same time, new drugs are prolonging the lives of many people with AIDS -- increasing demand for the agency's services.
There were also political problems. Dr. Lipsman angered members of the gay community by supporting a state law requiring AIDS patients to report the names of their sexual partners. He said the issue was one of the few on which activists and public health officials disagreed. The decision for Dr. Lipsman to leave was mutual, he said.
Dr. Lipsman, who is gay, said he was pleased that his new post is in "a politically progressive community." But he added that working in the public sector was different from working for an agency.
"As someone who is in charge of the health department for the entire county of Westchester, it's important that I remain neutral in terms of my personal identification," Dr. Lipsman said. "I am the health commissioner for everyone, male and female, gay and straight, black and white."
Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for County Executive Andrew J. Spano, said of Dr. Lipsman: "His life style was never an issue. He was hired because of his background in public health. We did a nationwide search, and he was at the top of everyone's list."
Dr. Lipsman said one of his first priorities as commissioner would be working on the West Nile virus. He also intends to focus his efforts on preventing smoking, which Dr. Lipsman said was the single most preventable cause of death and disease.
"My philosophy," he said, "is that we need to pay attention to the diseases that are either the most deadly or affect the greatest number of cases."
The West Nile virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, is frightening because it is unpredictable and can be lethal. Dr. Lipsman said he hoped to avoid aerial spraying of pesticides. Instead, he plans to focus his department's efforts on prevention -- by educating the public about emptying standing water on their property and using larvicide in catch basins.
He said that since the West Nile virus is so new -- it was only seen in this hemisphere for the first time last year and there has yet to be a full season of it in Westchester -- he wanted to proceed cautiously. "We could have an outcome which ranges from a very relaxed summer with little, if any, activity, or we could have a case number that is larger than last year," he said. "We have no way of knowing." As with other diseases carried by insects, like tick-borne Lyme and Erlichiosis, the Health Department will urge traditional precautions like the use of insect repellent and covering exposed flesh.
Dr. Lipsman said it was a particularly exciting time to be working on antismoking measures, because money from the tobacco settlement is trickling down to the county.
Environmental health will also be a focus, with special attention given to reducing the use of pesticides. "You can make people as healthy as you want, but if you're living in an environment that is unhealthy, it kind of undoes all that good work," he said.
Dr. Lipsman, who began his new job this month, runs a department of 400 employees with a budget of $125 million this year. He replaced Dr. Harold N. Adel, who retired in January. Though now living in Manhattan, Dr. Lipsman plans to move to the county, where he hopes to indulge his love of sailing. He said he also likes exercising, reading and attending plays and the opera.
"Working in Westchester is tremendously exciting and appealing," he said. "It has all the key ingredients -- public health problems that are complex and challenging, as well as the financial resources and the will to address these needs."

HEADLINE: The Second Great Wave;
Hispanic Immigrants Are Changing the Face of Central Jersey

BYLINE: By RICHARD BRAND 

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
IT is 6:30 p.m., and there isn't an empty seat at St. Paul's Catholic Church at the church's busiest service on the holiest day of the year. Father Javiar Diaz, reading from a Bible written in Spanish, gives the Easter Mass while hymns are accompanied by Mexican guitars.
The parishioners -- many dressed in worn jeans and mud-stained sweatshirts -- line the pews at the stolid brick church on Nassau Street. They come from places like Oaxaca, Mexico; Santa Rosa, Guatemala; and Havana, Cuba. 
 There weren't always standing-room-only crowds at St. Paul's. Two years ago, only a third of the pews were filled on Easter Sunday. And less than a decade ago, there was no Spanish-language Mass at all.
"This is a growing community, one with many needs," Father Diaz said. "They are people who work very much and make very little. The majority don't have social security or medical security. Yet they pay their taxes, because they have enough problems in their lives."
It is in church that Hispanic immigrants find the pervasive Roman Catholic culture they left behind, one in which the priest and the church are the center of private and community life.
The crowd at the service is just one reflection of the recent flood of Hispanic immigrants to central New Jersey, one that immigration experts say rivals the great wave of European migration of the late 19th century. And Newark International Airport, where about 55,423 international flights land each year, has replaced Ellis Island as the port of entry.
From Bound Brook to New Brunswick to Princeton, the state's Hispanic communities are larger and more vibrant than ever before. The United States Census Bureau says the state's Hispanic population grew to more than a million people in 1999 from 739,861 in 1990.
More startling, perhaps, is the bureau's prediction that Hispanics will surpass blacks as the largest minority group in the state by 2004. Puerto Ricans and Cubans now make up the largest Hispanic groups in the state, though most immigrants in the last five years have come from Central and South America.
"We are going through the second great wave of immigration in the history of this country," said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. "New Jersey has always been an immigration gateway, and it is getting a large share of what is a far more heterogeneous immigration boom."
As was the case in the late 19th century, when European migration underpinned the rise of New Jersey's urban manufacturing economy, most of today's immigrants are drawn by the prospect of better-paying jobs in towns like Princeton, where help-wanted signs are ubiquitous.
The boom in central New Jersey's economy has been fueled by the growth of electronic, biotech and information industries. Indeed, Route 1 has become a busy corridor of steel and glass office parks; and to the west, a number of luxury housing developments have helped the "Wealth Belt" earn its nickname.
With such prosperity, professionals in the area have more money than ever, and unemployment in the state is below 4 percent. As a result, service-level jobs in kitchens, automobile repair shops and landscaping companies are abundant in an area where Mercedes Benzes and BMW's are almost as common as stop signs.
But with so many opportunities, there are also major risks. Practically all of the undocumented immigrants seized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service will be sent back to the countries they came from, losing the investment of many years' wages to make the journey.
So far 38-year-old Pedro Sanchez Rodriguez, who has been here for less than a month, has not yet found a job. No reason to worry, though said Mr. Sanchez, because "there are many places to work."
Instead, he worries about his undocumented status and repaying the relatives who scraped together $3,000 for him to make the journey from Oaxaca, Mexico. He worries about his wife and two children still there, to whom he will send money when he gets some.
"It was a risk to come here," he said in Spanish. "I don't speak English. I have $20 in my pocket, a friend with a house and the clothes I am wearing. I know there is work, even though I have not found it yet."
Lynn Durko, a spokeswoman for the immigration office in Newark, says there are an estimated 143,000 undocumented immigrants in New Jersey, although she cannot not say how many are Hispanic.
The growth of the Hispanic community in central New Jersey is rooted in several historical processes. Hispanic immigration first became a significant trend in the New York metropolitan area when Puerto Rico became a Commonwealth of the United States in 1952. In addition, the effects of regularized air travel combined with aftermath of the Cuban revolution in the 1950's led to the expansion of Cuban and Puerto Rican neighborhood in North Jersey, most of them in Hudson County.
In 1965, a revised immigration law gave preference to immigrants seeking to reunify families in the United States, and it increased quotas from non-European countries that in the past had been excluded.
"At some point by historical accident, these communities provided a comfortable, transitional environment where newcomers felt comfortable,"
Mr. Hughes said, explaining why Hispanics were drawn to this area. "You always have newcomers coming to a node and expanding it."
In the same way that Union City developed a large Cuban community in the 1950's, towns in central New Jersey like New Brunswick, Hightstown and Bound Brook have recently been the destination of choice for Mexicans and Guatemalans.
Moreover, the overwhelming majority of these newest immigrants are men. Some are like Mr. Sanchez: heads of households taking a gamble on America. Others are young men seeking a better life.
Mario Barias, 22, remembers being a migrant farm worker in Guatemala, a country with an annual per capita income of less than $675. "Depending on the season, we would pick beans, corn and coffee," Mr. Barias said. "It was very difficult."
Mr. Barias is now cleaning dishes at a restaurant in West Windsor, making the minimum wage of $5.25 per hour.
"The jobs here are much easier and more relaxed," he said. His one regret is that he has not spoken to his parents or brothers since he left his hometown of Santa Rosa four years ago.
While some new immigrants intend to earn some money and return home, many others come to settle in the United States and start families.
Less than a mile from Nassau Street's tony boutiques and restaurants one recent night, Flabio Cortez Gonzalez, 30, ate dinner in a parking lot outside the one-bedroom apartment where he lives with his wife, nephew and two children.
"It's cooler out here," he said as he spooned from a bowl of rice, chicken and frijoles.
Inside, his wife, Venoria Gonzalez Cortez, prepared soft tacos, boiled peppers and grilled chicken. Smells of grease, plantains and burnt cheese hung over the stove. The hot oven inside and relentless heat outside caused Ms. Gonzalez, a native of Oaxaca and no stranger to warm weather, to sweat heavily.
"We turn the air-conditioner on only when we are sleeping," Ms. Gonzalez explained. "Electricity is very expensive."
Mr. Cortez says he and his wife can barely afford the rent of $975 a month for the apartment behind a small bodega; he works at a nearby stable, feeding horses and cleaning stalls, and she at a restaurant.
The apartment is decorated with a giant stuffed Tweety Bird, Porky Pig, and Sylvester the cat. "The children like them from television," Mr. Cortez says.
Their two children, Flabio, 5, and Lizbeth, 2, are American citizens born in Princeton, where the family hopes to stay because of the highly regarded public schools.
Luxury comes in the form of large Sunday-night dinners and three annual trips to the Six Flags amusement park.
Mr. Cortez says the couple came to the United States in 1988 from Oaxaca "because of the need to do something with our lives, to have money to buy a house, buy a car and help my parents economically."
Not all of New Jersey's newest Hispanic immigrants came merely to tap the employment opportunities on the bottom rung of the ladder. To be sure, engineers, academics and entrepreneurs make a significant portion of the new immigrants, especially since the immigration agency now gives preference to those with high-tech skills.
A handful of New Jersey companies recruit abroad, and a growing number of Latin American-born people with doctorates are streaming into the New Jersey work force after graduating from Rutgers and Princeton Universities.
In 1993, the New Jersey Department of Labor reported that a survey had found that 30 percent of the state's Hispanics earned from $25,000 to $50,000 a year, and almost 15 percent earned more than $50,000.
Indeed, a good number of Hispanic earners chose to start their own businesses. The 11-year-old Statewide Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey says it represents 30,000 businesses.
"Without the Latino entrepreneur, New Jersey's cities would be falling into urban decay," said Guillermo Beytagh-Maldonado, the executive director of New Brunswick's Puerto Rican Action Board and a board member of the chamber, which says it represents 30,000 businesses. "If you go through New Brunswick, you'll see that that Latino entrepreneurs are the owners of the mom-and-pop shops."
Many of the state's middle-class Hispanics are second-generation Americans whose immigrant parents had struggled to make ends meet.
Jeffrey Vega, 33, is the vice president of New Brunswick Tomorrow, one of the most active Hispanic community organizations in the state. He remembers how his Peruvian-born mother worked at a Revlon factory in Irvington even though she barely understood English. She encouraged him to study hard, and he became the first in his family to attend college.
Now Mr. Vega, a graduate of Rutgers, is the family's main breadwinner, and he just bought a house in Highland Park that he shares with his mother, sister and nephews, and he regularly sends money to relatives in Peru.
"It's really the experience of the Latino family in the U.S. that you have somebody who has gone to college, become educated and has a career while the rest of your family still lives somewhat in poverty and is still struggling," Mr. Vega said.
Most economists agree that the influx of immigrants to New Jersey has helped sustain the state's recent economic growth by providing labor in a tight market.
"We are a labor-short nation and New Jersey is a labor-short state," Mr. Hughes said. "So absent immigration, we'd be in trouble."
He added, "Immigrants push forward the economy through their labor and tax revenue contributions, and immigrants that are both documented and undocumented give to taxes more than they get from government benefits."
While their ability to pay taxes has indeed been tapped, their potential political clout has not.
Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado asserted, "Hispanics can be a swing vote in close elections nationwide, and it behooves politicians to pay attention to us."
Only recently have politicians have taken note of the swelling Hispanic vote in the region, saying that what the community lacked in its ability to donate money to campaigns it made up for in turnout.
In the 1996 Presidential election, for instance, about 248,000 Hispanics voted in New Jersey, accounting for 7.6 percent of the state's total turnout, the Census Bureau said. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials projects that almost 328,000 Hispanics will vote in the 2000 election, comprising about 10.2 percent of the overall turnout.
Although Hispanics actually have lower voting rates than non-Hispanic groups, the lag is attributed to the fact that the median age for Hispanics in the country is about 26 years, compared with 36 years for non-Hispanics. In addition, noncitizens -- who make up about 25 percent of the Hispanic population -- are not allowed to vote.
Still, most of the Hispanics who can vote ultimately do.
"In many cases it is because they left countries where they lost that right, and they are very conscientious of it," said Representative Robert Menendez, whose Union City constituency includes a large Cuban population. "Or they came from countries where political activity is very high. This is where the community has used the power of its votes to maybe offset the power of donations. And it has done that quite significantly."
More and more frequently, Hispanics themselves are running for office in the state -- and winning.
"In 1986, I became the first mayor of Hispanic descent in the state's history," Mr. Menendez said. "Now you have several Hispanic mayors. Where I was the only Hispanic legislator in the state at one time, you have now five and literally dozens who are councilmen. In less than a decade, you've gone from one in all those categories to something like 30 to 40. There may be even more."
As the November election draws near -- at stake is the presidency, a Senate seat and the House seats -- the ability to woo the Hispanic vote will be crucial.
"Hispanics are becoming a real focus for political actors on both sides of the aisle," Governor Whitman said in a recent interview, citing a growing number of Latino political action groups in the state.
Although politicians are beginning to seek out Hispanic voters, financing of programs to improve their plight has been slow to come.
"We are contributing to society more than we get out," said Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado.
In 1994, the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington issued a report, "Immigrants and Immigration, Setting the Record Straight," which said that for every dollar a recent immigrant pays in taxes, he or she receive 37 cents in government benefits.
Over all, it said, annual taxes paid by immigrants to all levels of government offset the costs of services received, generating a net annual surplus of $25 billion $30 billion.
Most federal and state social services are not available to noncitizens, even to those who are in the country legally. Part of the problem is that the government cannot provide services to populations that it does not officially acknowledge.
Hispanic community leaders charge that in 1990 the census undercounted Hispanics, and because of that that funds allocated for community programs are insufficient.
"There were a lot more than 700,000 in 1990, and there's a lot more then a million now," said Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado. "There is a major undercount problem."
Even though the census bureau has invested tens of millions of dollars in advertisements encouraging Hispanics to fill out census forms, Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado said he was concerned that an undercount of Hispanics in 2000 was inevitable. "Many are here undocumented, and they won't allow themselves to be counted," he said.
New Jersey's Center for Hispanic Policy, Research and Development, which was founded in 1975 to distribute funds for community-based projects, has an annual budget of $1.625 million to divide among almost 80 programs statewide. "It's not enough," said Mr. Vega of New Brunswick Tomorrow. "It's not a lot of money."
Mr. Vega, who is the chairman of the center's advisory board, said: "But I don't want to criticize the government because the Whitman administration has been more open to help the Hispanic community than any other administration. Our budget before Whitman was $1.25 million and she was the one who advocated the increase."
The Hispanic community has pulled together to do many of the jobs the government does not finance.
"We are the organizations that are taking care of the newly arrived immigrants," said Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado, who is also the president of the Hispanic Directors Association, a coalition of 27 Hispanic community-based organizations across the state that run preschools, health clinics, youth volunteer groups, housing services and English classes.
While most of today's immigrants are seeking the same opportunities as the Europeans of generations ago, community leaders fear that the American Dream may now be more difficult to achieve. They cite Hispanic dropout rates in some school districts as high as 38 percent, a growing illiteracy problem and efforts by lawmakers to exclude immigrants from welfare benefits.
"A lot of people that talk about immigration issues really use their own experience as a basis to make judgment about those that are now coming," Mr. Vega said. "They say, 'Well, my grandfather migrated to this country and he was able to make it. Why can't you?' And that's a view that tends to blame the victim. Back several generations ago if you didn't have an education, that was fine. You could make a decent earning. You could make a living wage. Today, if you have no technical training or hard skills, you can't survive."
He added, "Will the community advance and be equal to other communities? I don't know if it will happen in my lifetime, but I like to think that it will, but it's not going to be at the same rate as the immigrants of the past."

HEADLINE: Looking for the Right Man in Bridgeport

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
MANY Roman Catholics of the Diocese of Bridgeport were proud that their bishop, Edward Michael Egan, had been chosen as archbishop of New York to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor, but there were also sighs of regret.
Bishop Egan is widely popular among many parishioners and clergy of the diocese, which consists of Fairfield County, for what they say are his gifts as a homilist, his support of Catholic charity and education, his attention to spiritual matters in the parishes, and for improving the financial condition of the diocese. 
 According to several parish priests and church officials, what the 360,000 Catholics of the diocese want the most in their next bishop is a man who possesses many of the same qualities as Bishop Egan and is able to expand on his record.
"The concern is that we continue the programs that we have," said Monsignor Alan Detscher, ecumenical officer for the diocese, "and most bishops, when they come in, don't try to make too many changes right away."
Fairfield County is geographically small, but complex, said Dr. Anthony Cernera, president of Sacred Heart University. Some parishes are poor and others wealthy, and throughout the parishes are enclaves of immigrants. "It defies simple answers," he said.
Dr. Cernera said that the next bishop would have to be "someone who's going to understand the needs of that struggling immigrant in Bridgeport and also the corporate executive who's also a member of the diocese."
When Bishop Egan arrived in the diocese in 1988, he was fluent in Latin and Italian, but he soon learned Spanish and would frequently preach in Spanish and English when celebrating Mass at predominantly Spanish-speaking parishes, said Monsignor Aniceto Villamide, the diocese's vicar for Hispanics. "People were very happy with that," he said.
The next bishop won't have to deal with many of the difficult problems that the diocese faced when Bishop Egan arrived. At that time, the economy was moving into recession and many of the parishes in poorer neighborhoods, and their schools, were feeling the pinch.
Bishop Egan closed some Catholic elementary schools that were poorly attended or dilapidated, and regionalized the school system so that the remaining 33 elementary schools were supported by all the diocese's 88 parishes, not only by each one's individual parish.
Along with his streamlining and reorganization of diocesan operations, this eventually put the diocese on firm financial ground.
"Financially, he straightened the place out," said the Rev. Michael Jude Fay, pastor of St. John's Church in Darien.
Bishop Egan also started the Inner City Foundation, a semi-autonomous fund-raising organization, to raise money in support of the parish schools and Catholic Charities of Fairfield County. The foundation's director, Richard Stone, said that since 1992, it has raised $9.5 million to help the poor in Fairfield County. The money has been used to open health clinics and job-training programs, and grant scholarships to families to send their children to Catholic schools.
"People usually think of Fairfield County as a very wealthy county, but there are many needy people in the cities of Bridgeport, Norwalk and Stamford," Mr. Stone said.
The reorganization of the diocese's parish schools made a big difference, and coming, as it did, just ahead of a resurgence of the school-age population in the state, it was fortuitous. In addition, Bishop Egan also raised a $55 million endowment for the diocese's five high schools and implemented improvements in school budgets.
"He changed the paradigm from parochial to regional," Armand Fabri, the diocese's superintendent of schools, said. "The demand was always there, but affordability was an issue."
As a result, the next bishop can look forward to leading the diocese's Catholic schools in an expansion drive. Mr. Fabri said plans are being made to reopen some of the schools that had been closed and to build additions on others to meet the demand for Catholic education.
Another area in which Bishop Egan was very successful, and where there is a high interest in seeing a continuation, is in priesthood vocations. Six months after his appointment as bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Bishop Egan started the St. John Fisher House, a residential seminary in Stamford, and he was responsible for attracting many of the seminarians who have trained there.
Since 1965, said the Rev. Chris Walsh, the spiritual adviser at the seminary residence, there has been a 21 percent decline in the number of Catholic priests in the United States. The Diocese of Bridgeport has stayed even, but even at the current rate of increase Father Walsh said it doesn't have enough priests to meet the expansion of parish services that is foreseen in the coming years, something the next bishop will face. "I hope for someone who will be identical in terms of his dynamism and commitment toward vocations," he said.
Monsignor Villamide said Bishop Egan's success attracting men to the priesthood has been particularly helpful in expanding Catholic ministry to Hispanics and other immigrants in the cities in the diocese. When Bishop Egan came to the diocese there were only three Hispanic priests and seven parishes with Spanish ministries, and now there are eight Hispanic priests and a number of non-Hispanic, Spanish-speaking priests, and Spanish ministries at 12 parishes.
He said three new Haitian priests were ordained in the last three years to preach to Haitian immigrants, and a Vietnamese priest was newly ordained as well .
Until a new bishop is appointed, Monsignor Greg Smith, director of the Institute for Religious Education and Pastoral Studies at Sacred Heart University, said Pope John Paul II will probably appoint an administrator to run the diocese.
Monsignor Smith said he doubted a new bishop would be appointed before September, because decisions like that are usually not made during the summer.
Meanwhile, a Vatican official will consult with American bishops to compile a list of names to submit to the Pope for consideration, Monsignor Smith said.
He said he thought that the church's hierarchy would look for someone who is a leader, has shown loyalty to Pope John Paul, had demonstrated spiritual qualities, and has pastoral and administrative ability.
But continuing those programs that Bishop Egan started, particularly with regard to Catholic education and the priesthood, would weigh heavily in Rome, he said.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Taking Inspiration From Brecht

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
IT'S all in the title. "The Good Person of New Haven" reflects the best of intentions: To be a good person in a bad world. You can't get much better than that. Talk of what's in a name: New stands for redemptive change, saving grace, hope eternal. And doesn't everyone hope for a safe haven? As for person, the word is human, gender-free.
What better notion than to adapt time-honored traditions of classical theater to the immediate concerns of a contemporary urban community? And the thrust of arts in education, with an emphasis on diversity, is on the minds of every concerned artist and educator. 
 It is no wonder that the Cornerstone Theater Company, based in Los Angeles and traveling everywhere, is applauded for its effort to make the classics fit time and place. And the company is welcomed by communities that need the reinvigoration and enlightenment that theater does best. Think live, interactive, collaborative, participatory, all terms that transcend ego and personal gain. Cornerstone puts such ideals into practice, moving into cities and setting up workshops involving students, elderly people, community leaders, business executives, volunteers of all stripe -- and, for example, resetting Shakespeare to nourish dreams and lift spirits.
At this time the company and its specialists are exploring New Brunswick, N. J., attempting to design a theater piece for the George Street Playhouse and neighboring Crossroads Theater Company. Such work does not happen in a flash. In August 1998 the much-talked about New Haven Project was born. "The Good Woman of Szechwan," by Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), was the chosen classic, to be adapted by Alison Corey and directed by Bill Rauch, Cornerstone's founders. Participants in the work were selected from Fair Haven, the Hill, West Hills, Wooster Square and Newhallville.
A workshop production took place at Long Wharf Theater's Stage II last June. Every theater student knows that a Brechtian ground rule is epic theater and one of Cornerstone's missions is to make possible that impossible dream in the world of corrupt economics, in and out of theater. By casting non-professional actors with Actors Equity performers, "Good Person" was put on with a cast of 34, 10 of them professional.
So far, so good. But the place, however purposeful, of "Good Person" in the Long Wharf main stage season's repertory seems dubious. Brecht's plays are rarely performed, not just because of cast size, but because they have seldom been popular or understood (with the obvious exception of "Three Penny Opera").
"Good Woman" was produced only twice in 50 years in New York, and not since 1970 at Lincoln Center. Both times, the play served more as a display piece for a great actress -- Uta Hagen in 1956, later Colleen Dewhurst -- than as effective theater or political message piece. Brecht's detractors have referred to his plays as tracts sermonizing worn-out ideas. But the theatrical credo of the playwright cannot be entirely overlooked.
Conveniently, the New Haven production uses the epic part and reinvents the political and the moral for the purpose of raising the self-esteem of a city and making its people -- consequently, one presumes, all people -- count.
Musical interludes, a great Brechtian device, are superbly interwoven here in calypso, rock and jazz. So is narrative, in the striking person of Quinn, the can man, first seen pushing a supermarket cart on the New Haven Green. His litany of good will groups (Latino youth, all the AIDS programs, Community Gardens, City Kids) and local lures (the pizza) is terrific bravura stuff, performed by Christopher Liam Moore, the star of this occasion.
Also true to Brecht, as translated from the German by Ralph Manheim, is Ms. Carey's fitfully arousing attempt to alternate slang and lyric language. But the ideas and techniques are simplistically reiterated.
The playwright's global view was deliberately set in mythical territory and colored by supernatural forces, in order to stimulate objectivity; theater of alienation is the phrase and it is rarely workable. In New Haven, plot line is otherwise followed, the other worldly in the guise of stereotypical white tourists with very bad taste: a terrific notion.
But site specificity is antithetical to Brechtian beliefs. And the specifics would not be quite so bad if they weren't so often gratuitous and contrived. One script reference, however, is dead on: a visitor from another planet asks when Yale's next Black Panther rally is going to happen; he wants to be there. That would have made Brecht look away and smile.
Otherwise, there is no reason why angels cannot descend upon New Jersey, seeking the good person of New Brunswick. The set designer Lynn Jeffries' multipurpose backdrop, an artistically striking overview of the Interstate 95 overpass, is a fine Connecticut detail, though it must be added that David Zinn's costumes for the working class are either appallingly unsuitable or patronizingly appalling.
The saint (read good person) of New Haven is the golden-hearted prostitute Tyesha. With virtuosic intentions and variable results, Patrice Johnson is double cast as the good person and as her cousin, Taiwo Highwater, a capitalist. Taiwo exploits; Taisha recycles.
Throughout, the acting is uneven at best, except for the thoroughly excellent Christopher Liam Moore. And throughout, sermonizing and moralizing do not stop. Sample: "No one has a right to prevent a person from being useful." It is all for the possibility of doing good in this worst but changeable of all possible worlds.
"The Good Person of New Haven," Long Wharf Theater, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven (203-787-4282). Performances through next Sunday.

HEADLINE: ZONING;
The City's Shapers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Can Mr. Muschamp honestly believe that the city's real estate interests and officialdom concocted this revision to the zoning law in response to a fear that power in New York is shifting to the "cultural plane"? I would hope that one of the more public-spirited developers will invite him to sit in on a project meeting so that he can view firsthand what scant influence the self-referential world of academic architecture has on building in New York, or, for that matter, anywhere in the country.
Nearly 40 years since the 1961 zoning resolution was crafted to make New York safe for Modernism, perhaps half a dozen buildings of real architectural quality have benefited from its provisions. Countless others have cluttered the skyline and streetscape with cheap imitations of Corbusian models. A change in the resolution has long been overdue. 
 The purpose of zoning is to regulate the 99.9 percent of building which must relate to the city as a whole and which is, for good or for ill, driven primarily by economic and functional forces. All the Frank Gehrys of the world in fact rely aesthetically on background buildings to play off their experimental forms. Citizens and architects need to care about these background buildings as well as the monuments. Unfortunately, since too many architects and architectural writers seem only to be concerned with the five buildings per year that stretch the boundaries of formal language, it must fall to others to shape the development of our cities.

HEADLINE: A Building Transformed, Inside and Out

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
WHEN people in New London say "Hygienic," they're usually not speaking of scrubbing their hands. They're referring to the Hygienic Building, a downtown landmark that dates to 1844.
Thanks to a remarkable grass-roots effort, the old building is now the Hygienic Artist Cooperative and Galleries. There, on a recent Saturday morning, volunteers briskly changed exhibits, while the six artists who live upstairs in co-op apartments gathered for a meeting. 
 A. Vincent Scarano, the president of Hygienic Art Inc., took a visitor around. After checking the second floor, which has two apartments, he kept climbing, to reach the four third-floor apartments with their sleeping lofts and bathrooms in what was once the attic. He pointed out features of the apartments, from original fireplace surrounds to brand new kitchens, in apartments that rent for $400 to $475 a month.
 The freshly renovated Hygienic (which got its name from a restaurant that opened there in 1929) is a place where artists can afford to live and work, and where galleries aim to draw all kinds of people, not just regular gallerygoers.
"It could be a model for other cities," Mr. Scarano said. But a while back, he recalled, "Nobody ever thought it would happen."
 Local artists used to hang out at the grubby (but welcoming) Hygienic Restaurant, and in 1979 they held the Hygienic Art Show there. The show had the motto "No judge, no jury, no censorship, no fees!"
When the lively anti-establishment show turned into a popular annual event, the artists organized into Hygienic Art Inc. to run it. After the restaurant closed in 1985, they moved the show to other spots around the city, but they always treasured the old building, with its distinctive flatiron front. So did preservationists.
In 1996 a bank announced plans to buy the Hygienic, which was by then a boarded-up eyesore, and to demolish it to create parking space. Horrified admirers rallied to gain an injunction, and, in 1997, after much negotiating, Hygienic Art members made a deal to buy and rehabilitate the building.
Up until then, the group's treasurer, James Stidfole said, "We had an annual budget of $2,200. For developing a building, we had the credibility of a gerbil."
Hygienic Art signed a contract with Christopher Widmer, an architect and the executive director of Alderhouse Residential Communities (who had already developed a limited-equity cooperative nearby) to renovate the Hygienic for nonprofit galleries and affordable apartments for artists.
 The Hygienic's four galleries include three on the first floor and one in what was the basement. The main gallery still has the restaurant's 1950's lunch counter and stools, where visitors often sit and talk.
"This is not intimidating space, like a stuffy gallery," Mr. Scarano said. "It's part of the community, common ground. It makes art accessible."
 The apartments, each about 1,000 square feet, have features for artists: big doors for ease of moving art, lots of light, extra sinks and easy-to-clean wooden floors.
"I love the fact that I have a good place to work," said Broderick Price, a painter who has been making tables of varied sizes for his apartment out of materials left from construction. "The whole building is a work of art."
 The completed renovation cost about $800,000, including $105,000 to buy the building. The state contributed $250,000; the city of New London, $142,000; the Fannie Mae Corporation, $10,000. Private foundations, businesses and groups contributed, and Hygienic Art raised about $275,000, including $100,000 in tax credits from the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority.
The group even held an auction where people bid not only on art but also on Mr. Stidfole's mop of gray hair, which was sheared off for $5,500.
 From the start, ordinary people in and around the city contributed time, money, materials and elbow grease.
Actual renovation began in January 1999, under the construction manager Paul McMasters. But the regular carpenters, sheetrock workers and other crews couldn't start until volunteers spent six weeks cleaning everything, from old furniture to dead pigeons, out of the building.
"Six weeks, eight big Dumpsters, 190 cubic yards," Mr. Stidfole said of the clean-up. He noted that volunteers worked throughout the project, doing whatever was needed. Some people, he said, "just walked in off the street and said, 'Can I help?' "
Volunteers are still coming forward to help, he said, and others offer gifts.
Last summer brought one of the most notable features of the renovation project, the women on the wall. Working on scaffolding on the south wall of the building, Terry (Davo) Davis, a Hygienic artist, and his assistants, Sarah Warda and Wendy Kuklinski, painted a 30-by-50-foot mural featuring five women, partially draped, who represent caryatids, sculptured female forms that appear to serve as architectural supports.
The galleries opened in late January with the annual Hygienic Art Show, back at the place where it started. As usual, it allowed one work per artist and included a wide variety, from sensitive watercolors to toilet bowls as art. A more conventional show came next.
 The most recent show was called "Handkerchief Art from Prison." Mr. Stidfole explained that inmates can buy handkerchiefs cheaply at prison commissaries, draw or paint on them, then fold them (without making lasting creases) and mail them to people outside. Such work is attracting academic attention, he said, and the Hygienic displayed more than 100 examples, some with matching envelopes.
 Hygienic Art Inc. will soon turn the building (its only debt is a $105,000 mortgage and a $90,000 low-interest bank loan) over to a new corporation, Hygienic Art Cooperative Inc. Each of the six residents will be a voting member; Hygienic Art Inc., which operates the galleries, will be a voting member.
Mr. Scarano noted that all too often artists move into affordable areas that soon become unaffordable. In New London, downtown property is becoming more expensive, but under the co-op arrangement, participants can manage the Hygienic, set rents, and not be squeezed out, he said.
 The resident artists, who moved in in February, must have incomes under $29,500 when they move in, put cash and sweat equity into their apartments, participate in a co-op training program, work some hours in the galleries, and exhibit their work in group and individual shows. They sign no lease but agree to follow the co-op rules for as long as they reside there. The residents all needed to finish and paint their apartments, as part of their sweat equity, before concentrating on their art.
Tekla Zweir, a sculptor who graduated last year from the Lyme Academy of Fine Art, pointed out the woodwork that she had just stained, with the help of a friend. "Now I've started working on this quilt-and-figure series," she said, describing her plans for relief sculptures with smooth figures against textured quilts.
 The artists will have a group show in June and individual shows at later times. Mr. Price, the table-making painter, is already planning his December retrospective, which will cover some 30 years of his work and include written pieces as well.
Life-drawing classes are under way, with still more activities being considered, such as a playwriting workshop and a drumming group. Jenn Collins, a Hygienic resident, has suggested a fall show of installations by and about the women of New London, women of all ages, races, social and economic levels.
"It's cool to live here," said Ms. Collins, who designed and made decorative elements for the recent renovation of the Garde Theater, just a few blocks away. "We've got an opportunity to create the scene."
 The Hygienic Galleries, 79-83 Bank Street, New London, are open Thursday and Friday, 4 to 7 p.m.; Saturday, noon to 10 p.m., and Sunday, noon to 6 p.m. The galleries' Web site is www.hygienic.org.

HEADLINE: Keeping an Eye Out for Beetles

BYLINE: By SAM LIBBY 

 BODY:
BECAUSE the Asian long-horned beetle has been found to be spreading in the New York metropolitan area, Connecticut state scientists are urging property owners to inspect their trees, particularly their maple trees, for the beetles.
"The extremely destructive beetle has been found in the New York metropolitan region, on Long Island and in Chicago," said Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. "Over 6,000 trees have been destroyed in those places in an attempt to stop the spread of the beetle, but it could have already spread to Connecticut," he said. 
 For now, the beetles are 50 miles from the Connecticut-New York border and have yet to be spotted in Connecticut.
"If the beetles were to become established in the state's forests they have the potential to leave large swaths of dead maples," said Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward, a station forester whose job is to monitor the health of the state forests. "The impact would be as devastating as the loss of American elm and chestnut during the past century," he said.
Dr. Ward said 40 percent of the state's trees are maples and their destruction would "even more dramatically alter the forests and cities that depend on the trees for landscaping and shade." "The brightest most vibrant colors of the fall foliage come from the maples," he added. "Without maples fall foliage would be vastly diminished."
In New York State the beetles have been attacking maple species including Norway, red, sugar, silver, boxelder and sycamore maples. Other known hosts are other hardwood trees such as horse chestnut, black locust, elms, birches, willows, poplars and green ash.
"There is no effective insecticide for the beetle," Dr. Magnarelli said. "The only way of controlling an infestation is to destroy affected trees by chipping or burning. The only chance we have to stop this is to have as many informed alerted property owners as possible looking for infested trees."
The Asian long-horned beetle is about an inch long, shiny black with bright white spots. The beetle has long, curved antennae that are longer than the beetle's body. In May the adult beetle emerges from deep inside an affected tree. When the beetles emerge from the trees they leave visible exit holes. The diameter of the hole ranges from a quarter-inch to a half-inch.
Beneath the exit holes, or in the branch crotches, piles of frass (insect waste and sawdust) may accumulate. The exit holes often bleed large amounts of sap. Defoliation and leaf damage appear when the juvenile beetles deep in the tree bore through the trees' tissues that carry water and nutrients to the trees' crowns. (Trees die from the crowns down.)
Station inspectors equipped with binoculars are searching for beetle-damaged trees throughout the state and this month they are doing surveillance almost every week day. Other inspectors are viewing aerial photos that would show a pattern of leaf damage indicating the beetles' presence. "We're looking in areas that have high concentrations of maple trees," said the deputy state entomologist, Carol R. Lemmon. "We're looking for any signs of defoliation or leaf damage particularly in the crowns of trees.
"I'm really scared this beetle will establish itself in Connecticut and take off," Dr. Lemmon said.
But Dr. Magnarelli said the situation isn't hopeless. "We have some things going for us," he said. "Although the beetle can fly as much as half a mile when it emerges in May, it usually re-infests the tree it emerged from or infests a nearby tree. It won't spread as fast as a gypsy moth infestation. It seems like the beetle only infests trees that are already stressed."
But for the last 20 years the Connecticut forest has been subjected to a series of harsh environmental stresses, Dr. Lemmon said. In the 1980's, gypsy moths defoliated trees throughout the state, there was a record drought during the summer of 1995 followed by the heavy snows of the winter of 1995-96. The warm winters and wet springs of 1997 and 1998 produced fungal blights on leaves, which further stressed the forest and resulted in muted fall foliage. Then there was last summer's record drought, she said.
Dr. Ward continued: "Trees in cities are always subject to high level of stress and may be particularly susceptible to the beetle. If the beetle were to become established, the cost of removing and replacing the trees and the decline in real estate values will have a severe economic effect in addition to the severe esthetic effects."
Maple, beech, hemlock and birch are known as the old-growth species. They are tree species that in many ways define the forest as we know it, Dr. Ward said. "Beech trees are presently being attacked by beech bark disease complex, the hemlocks are being devastated by the woolley adelgid," he said. "If the beetle were to establish itself in the state's maple trees, three of the four old growth species will be greatly diminished. What a mess this would cause."
Dr. Lemmon said the beetle has no known predators in China. There is some evidence that the beetle came from somewhere else and arrived in China relatively recently. (The beetle came to the United States in wooden crates sent from China.) Although the beetle was found to be in the United States in 1996 there is evidence that it has been in the United States since 1989. The beetle has been found in the New York metropolitan area, Amityville, N. Y. and Chicago. It is possible, Dr. Lemmon said, that trees are infested elsewhere but the beetle has not yet been detected.
In the end, dying infested trees can be dangerous to life and property, Dr. Ward said. The trees become weak and brittle as they are being eaten by the beetles and large branches can break away, especially during wind storms. For those reasons, Dr. Ward said it is important to find infested trees as soon as possible and destroy them.
If someone finds an Asian longhorned beetle, he or she should keep the specimen for identification and call the Department of Entomology (203) 974-8474 or 974-8600. An inspector will respond to the call.

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT;
A Short Leash For Camden

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
Never has the state taken so firm a hand with an errant city. Last week, the Whitman administration dispatched yet more expertise to Camden, introducing a local-government expert from Cleveland as the newest member of the team settling in here to take control of the city's troubled finances.
After two years of limited fiscal oversight, the Local Finance Board in Trenton voted on May 10 to impose the highest level of supervision allowed by law. In the event that that is not enough, administration officials said last week that they want legislation enacted this summer to allow a full state takeover. 
 "I am afraid that without that authority in our hip pocket, we won't get the kind of cooperation we need out of some of the local officials," Govewrnor Whitman said on Friday. In the meantime, at a news conference Tuesday to introduce Prof. Sylvester Murray of Cleveland State University, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, Jane M. Kenny, promised "to get to the heart of where the issues and problems are."
But while television lights still hovered over Mr. Murray, city officials wondered aloud whether he knew what he was walking into or whether efficiency and integrity could change the reality of a city depleted of both resources and spirit.
Camden's city government had already been stripped of many functions: the state took over the parking authority in 1994 and put the police under the county prosecutor's supervision in 1998. The housing authority is under federal control. And a state-appointed task force has been overseeing the school board because of low test scores.
The pressure for a fiscal takeover notched up when Mayor Milton Milan, who had resisted the review board, was indicted March 31 on federal corruption charges.
"You can lower the deficit, which is treating the symptoms, but at some point you've got to treat the disease, and that's macroeconomic," the city clerk, Luis Pastoriza, said. 'Eighty percent of the people in Camden are on some form of government assistance. These people have got to be realistic."
Emphasizing that point, Angel Fuentes, vice president of the City Council, walked out before the news conference ended. "I left in frustration,"' Mr. Fuentes said later.
Like many here, Mr. Fuentes said the review board that has monitored Camden's finances since 1998 had been a failure. "People say, 'Look how those incompetent public officials waste taxpayers' money,' " he said. "We want to tell them we're struggling."
Mr. Fuentes tried to make the point to the review board, which held meetings here. He has kept the big color photographs -- a gallery of crumbling brick -- he had once presented to the board. "I told them, 'None of you live here. None of you would have your children play on these streets.' "
Professor Murray, a former city manager in Cincinnati and San Diego, does plan to live here, at least through the summer. Although he had never been in Camden before last week, he said: "I don't know that the city is lost, is dead. I believe in cities, I believe in people. I believe in communities."
A board member of the National Academy of Public Administration, an organization chartered by Congress, he will be working with its president, Robert J. O'Neill Jr., under a contract authorizing fees up to $500,000. For its part, the academy will advise the Local Finance Board, which has set up its operation in City Hall.
For now, the team is deciphering the city's books and management systems, which local officials concede are in disarray. While the state has the authority to replace department heads, Ms. Kenny said there were no plans "right now" to do so.
Still, the Local Finance Board chairman, Ulrich Steinberg, must approve any expenditure of more than $4,500, meaning that the city cannot install a traffic light or replace a police car without permission.
With such tight reins has come some chafing. Yet the ill will between city and state appears to be receding. After a meeting with Mayor Milan two weeks ago, Mr. Steinberg described it as "very positive."
But local officials continue to plead for attention to the still-bleeding tax base, which urban experts acknowledge cannot possibly support Camden. Already the city, New Jersey's poorest, receives 70 percent of its revenue from the state, up from 57 percent three years ago.
Howard Gillette Jr., a history professor at Rutgers's Camden campus who is writing a book on the city, said reliance on local property taxes -- which account for only 20 percent to 25 percent of Camden's revenue -- was starving the city.
Nor is the state likely to commit the kind of money needed "to get Camden back into the economic mainstream," Professor Gillette said.
Jeffrey L. Nash, the Camden County freeholder director, said, "We've been trying to convince the state for years to take a more active role."
Mr. Nash and state legislators from the area, all Democrats, have pushed for a recovery plan enlisting experts from Rutgers to rebuild Camden's crumbling infrastructure.
"The administration doesn't want to have to answer to the 85,000 residents as to why there is not enough police protection, why the streets are not being cleaned, why not enough houses are being renovated," Mr. Nash said. "The state of New Jersey has that responsibility but does not want to invest those dollars in Camden."
Gwendolyn A. Faison, the City Council president, said she and other city officials had no idea what the state's intentions were. While welcoming Mr. Murray at the news conference, Ms. Faison directed a faint scolding at the officials from Trenton for giving her short notice of the appointment.
"This is my city," she said. "This is my home. I want to know who youre bringing into my home."
At a City Council meeting that afternoon, she introduced Mr. Murray and the state team. In her office later, Ms. Faison sighed. "We do need the help," she said. "We can't afford to pay for it."

A Speedier Cleanup Sought at Brookhaven

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A federal cleanup at Brookhaven National Laboratory should be accelerated to reduce its cost by about $18 million and remove contaminants sooner, Senator Charles E. Schumer said at a news conference at the laboratory.
Mr. Schumer said he would lead efforts to convince Energy Secretary Bill Richardson of the economic and environmental advantages of halving the cleanup, to three years. 
 The $18 million saving, Mr. Schumer said, would give the Energy Department more for cleanups at other laboratories while assuring that "different plumes that are moving toward different water sources" at Brookhaven were cleaned up more quickly.
But it was unclear whether other labs engaged in cleanups, including Hanford, Wash., and Oak Ridge, Tenn., would support a plan that initially increased financing at Brookhaven. The 5,300-acre Brookhaven property is contaminated by radionuclides, metals and chemicals in the soil and ground water. The laboratory has been a federal Superfund site since 1989.
The Energy Department budget currently includes nearly $261 million for the six-year cleanup, officials said. The cost of the three-year cleanup would be about $242 million, they said, with savings from lower overhead and management costs.
The laboratory director, John H. Marburger, said the faster cleanup "gets an issue off our backs that I think has been hampering us from making progress with the community and with our many constituents." The plan is also supported by a citizens advisory panel.
But a laboratory critic, Scott Cullen, the legal counsel for Standing for Truth About Radiation (STAR) of East Hampton, said contamination was too extensive to be cleaned up in three years "no matter how much money they get."
"It's a good idea to do the cleanup faster," he said. "But if after three years they referred to the site as being cleaned, it won't be the case." JOHN RATHER

HEADLINE: Bell Atlantic Stumbles, And Competition Suffers

 BODY:
Re: "Lots of Blame Going Around in (631) Glitches" May 7 .
Long Islanders' inability to call across Route 110 is the most damning evidence yet that Bell Atlantic's arrival in the new world of deregulated telecommunications has not only hit a shoal, but has succeeded in hurting virtually anyone who depends on the telephone. 
 There is no small irony that Bell Atlantic's crisis comes as the company has enlisted seemingly every telemarketer in North America to phone us during dinner to insist that its new long distance service is where we want to be.
In the last several months, the Public Service Commission fined Bell Atlantic for failing to permit viable local phone competition when it secured permission to go into long distance service. Now communication companies are filing complaint after complaint regarding a broad range of Bell Atlantic disconnects, 631 being just one of them. The commission should get Bell Atlantic's attention by levying a fine that is heavy enough to convince consumers that this is not how the telecom business is to be done in the 21st Century.
Genuine competition is supposed to be mean that utilities like Bell Atlantic work leaner, smarter, faster and better. Instead, they have created the Long Island Expressway of telephone paths.

HEADLINE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE;
Judith Krantz, Cinderella In Chanel, Shares the Plot

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel 

 BODY:
JUDITH KRANTZ may live in Bel Air, but she's a New York girl by birth and by temperament.
When she still lived in Manhattan, in 1962, she despaired of being able to glimpse John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, in a Fifth Avenue parade being held in his honor. So, she went to Saks, secured a corner dressing room with windows in the maternity department, and bought a king's ransom worth of clothes she didn't need in order to eyeball her idol. But when she returned her enormous purchase a few days later, Saks balked and canceled her account. 
 "I couldn't possibly do without a Saks charge," she said last week, back at Saks, whipping through racks of Yves Saint Laurent. "I wrote them and told them I had a miscarriage."
Mrs. Krantz, 72, recalls the fib in her new memoir, "Sex and Shopping: The Confessions of a Nice Jewish Girl" (St. Martin's). She writes: "Another step toward fiction? What's a short girl to do?"
This short girl -- 5 feet 2 1/2 inches, she says -- has done just fine. (Yes, her credit was reinstated.) Although she waited until her two sons were grown before publishing her first novel, at 50, the best-selling "Scruples," she has published nine more best sellers in the last 22 years, most of which I've read. They are my vacation indulgence, what I really read when I've righteously packed Thackeray. Her books transcend the Hollywood gloss of a Jackie Collins, the smarmy heat of a Danielle Steel. Rather, this Wellesley graduate does diligent homework on all aspects of the fashion business, and often the art, antiques and jewelry trades, spinning intricate plots jammed with industry details, which also offer inside looks at worlds of high-octane glamour. Though I've traditionally savored her books poolside, as pure escapism in today's runaway economy they've taken on a practical dimension: a woman's guide to rubies and Renoir.
If Ms. Krantz's books celebrating Porthault sheets and the women who love them seem oddly in style right now, their timeless appeal lies in their compelling Cinderella stories. A Judith Krantz heroine is beautiful (of course) but also smart, smart, smart. She learns a business along with the reader as she works night and day, overcomes emotional hardships (which only add depth to her natural beauty), and eventually, with the aid of a handsome, powerful man and the perfect Hermes bag, triumphs. No one whines. They act. The world bursts with possibilities.
It's a winning formula. Her books have sold 85 million copies in 52 languages. "The boys gang has always resented me," she said. "Sidney Sheldon, Irving Wallace, Harold Robbins. It was like 'How dare she do that?' And being from Hollywood, the press would describe my house as a mansion when it's a perfectly normal house. They made me the glamorous character from my novels, but those characters were written by someone in J. Crew sweats who's not glamorous at all."
 Well, maybe not when she's writing, but she was certainly turning heads at Saks. Though she said she was "out of uniform" by not wearing Chanel, she was flawlessly dressed in a pink and gray tweed pantsuit with a matching coat, custom made by a Milanese tailor. The Van Cleef & Arpels Bois de Rose, a white coral pin in the shape of a flower with diamonds at the center, reflected the luster of her South Seas pearl earrings and -- just as they do in her books -- seemed to add a glow to her ivory complexion. As she tore through the meager offerings of Gucci and Fendi with the sharp eye of a military commander, the sales staff instinctively stood back. They, not to mention their merchandise, were distinctly outclassed.
"Now look at that," Mrs. Krantz fumed, holding up a transparent lime green Fendi skirt and top. "Tell me, have you ever seen a woman in a restaurant in a transparent top? Well, me neither."
Gucci fared no better. "That is the worst knocked-off thing," she said, fingering a python print dress. "And the length is wrong. The fitter at Chanel will always say, 'Mrs. Krantz, hemlines are going down.' But I don't care. My skirts stay 19 inches from the floor. That's what looks best on me."
Though Mrs. Krantz is a clothes connoisseur, it is a mistake to think her books are about shopping, even though "Scruples" was the name of a fashion boutique. They are instead about the transforming power of clothes.
"I always use clothes for manipulation, to create an effect," she explained earlier at lunch at Le Cirque 2000. "With the right clothes, the character suddenly appears. In many cases, the clothes reveal a personality that was obscured by poverty. I write about clothes as magical things that can change you. I feel that women are comforted by having clothes and accessories. I have every scarf I've ever bought."
These days, Mrs. Krantz rarely goes shopping. "I can't stand it," she said of going to malls. "Anyway, California is not a dressed up place. At every dinner party people wear black, which annoys me. I don't wear black at night. I want to be more visible."
Among her other fashion dictums, Mrs. Krantz says, she has never worn jeans or a bikini (unflattering), swears by Hanro lingerie (no seams) and thinks that as an accessory "burgundy is the best neutral." She also declares that she doesn't "believe in plastic surgery below the neck" because people should diet and exercise. What about breasts? She shrugged. "So they droop," she said. "Certain things just happen."
Perched on a banquette in the restaurant, her coat bundled behind her, the writer in Mrs. Krantz took over from the strident fashion expert. She appeared small and tentative as she watched other women parade past, bedecked and bejeweled, as if they were characters in her books. The closer she observed, the smaller she seemed to become. You can see why she says that it is the character of the best friend that reflects her in her books, not the heroines.
"The heroine bears the burden of the plot and always has dramatic things happen to her," she said. "Her mother dies, her father dies, some guy leaves her. The best friend is along for the ride having a wonderful time, wearing crazy clothes that wouldn't be becoming to a heroine, who must have a certain dignity and gravitas. The heroines I create are all bigger than life. But the best friend is a life-size person." She smiled. "Usually short."
Her own outfit matched neither description; rather, it belonged to the grande dame character, the doyenne who long ago learned the value of quality. She kept talking as she ate her shad and bacon -- possibly the only woman in the room not picking at a salad -- and said that flying lessons had prompted her to start writing novels.
"I was always so afraid to fly, and when I finally learned how, I think it made me write 'Scruples'," she said. "I thought, What else am I terrified of doing? Writing fiction. I'm not sure why. I think I was a victim of a very good education. I majored in English literature and said, 'I know I can't do that, so why do it at all?' But there is a real place for a book that's not George Eliot but is still for intelligent women."
Another reason Mrs. Krantz may have waited, she said, was because of her mother. Mickey Tarcher sounds like a nightmare in Mrs. Krantz's memoir, though her independence was certainly exemplary. She dropped out of school at 14 to work in a candy factory to help support her family. After she married J. D. Tarcher, who became a successful advertising executive, she earned her college degree, a master's in economics and a law degree. She spent her career at the Legal Aid Society and her time at home raising, and often criticizing, her daughters, Judy and Mimi, and her son, Jeremy. She also endured a lifetime of cheating from her husband; when he died in 1960, she sold the weekend home he loved and its contents within two days. She dressed her children cheaply, withholding material rewards as consistently as she withheld emotional ones.
"My dream was that my mother would come home with a big package from Best with cashmere sweaters for me," Mrs. Krantz said, her voice growing full. "That's where I got the magic of clothes, because my mother didn't give them to me. If she had, I never would have known the power, magic and mystery clothes could have. Out of that yearning you get fiction."
It is probably no accident that in 10 Judith Krantz novels, six of her heroines have mothers who die when their daughters are younger than 8.
In her real life, Mrs. Krantz has been married to the film and television producer Steve Krantz for 46 years. Their son Nick is a stockbroker, their son Tony is the chief executive of Imagine Television, and the couple have two grandchildren.
For the first time in years, she hasn't started her next novel. "I have a crazy plan not to do anything and see what happens," she said. "I'd love to do something different, have a life change. There are so many things I don't know yet."
As she spoke, her blue eyes sparkled. And the air filled with the unmistakable sense of possibility.

HEADLINE: In Silicon Valley, Loyalty Means Paying a High Price;
Cultural Strengths Help Offset Loss of Paper Wealth

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
IN November, more than 100 employees of Calico Commerce were millionaires, at least on paper.
Today only 20 are. As Calico's stock has fallen 80 percent from its November peak, the rest have watched their fleeting wealth burn away like fog in the California sun. In April alone, Calico shares lost nearly half their value. 
 In Silicon Valley, where job hopping is a way of life and even robust companies regularly lose workers to start-ups dangling chances at instant wealth, a stock meltdown like Calico's might seem a recipe for disaster, prompting top employees to flee and crippling morale among those who remain.
But Calico, which makes software that helps companies sell products over the Internet, has weathered the storm so far, thanks to an intangible commodity that is supposedly even scarcer around here than out-of-work software engineers: the striking loyalty of its workers.
So far this year, only 15 of Calico's 330 workers have left the company. That translates into an annual rate of 12 percent, barely half the typical turnover at Silicon Valley companies, according to Steve Radford, who has surveyed salaries and turnover at high-technology companies for more than two decades.
Calico's stability is no accident, employees say. While many Silicon Valley companies depend largely on the promise of riches to attract and retain workers, Calico has gone a different route, using more than money to keep employees happy. The company tries to combine the openness and workplace perks common in Silicon Valley companies with the very uncommon understanding that employees sometimes have lives outside the office.
So far, the mix seems to be working. From Alan Naumann, Calico's chief executive, to Aleida Kolodzieski, an administrative assistant, employees interviewed at Calico's headquarters in San Jose last month said they believed in their company, whatever the stock market might think.
Of course they say that, a cynic might interject. But many Calico employees have put their money where their mouths are.
In March, five months after the company went public, restrictions on insider stock sales expired and Calico workers were free to sell shares and turn their paper wealth into cash. Few did. In fact, Mr. Naumann actually spent more than $2 million in late April to buy 150,000 shares on the open market, building his total stake in the company to 1.65 million shares.
Joe Schwartz, a 29-year-old manager who was Calico's 13th employee and has been with the company since 1995, said he shared that confidence. With more than 5,000 options, Mr. Schwartz lost more than $300,000 in paper wealth as Calico's stock price shriveled. Yet he remains a believer. "I would encourage my parents to buy, my best friends to buy," he said.
A strong company culture only goes so far, and even Mr. Naumann admits that his company will eventually start losing people if the stock price remains depressed. And it is hard to forecast what the immediate future holds for the company. Its products compete in a hotly contested market niche against offerings from specialists like FirePond and giants like Oracle. Though Calico's sales have grown steadily at 70 percent annually or better, reaching $35.6 million in the year ended March 31, its losses have widened as well, to $27.8 million -- a new-economy story that investors used to shrug off but now have little patience for.
Still, Calico's efforts to make its employees feel like partners seem for the moment to have cushioned the blow of the stock slump.
"The difference between good and bad management teams in the valley is their ability to manage through the natural ebb and flow of the business," said Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist whose investment funds own more than 5 percent of Calico. "This is a management team that understands the business that they're in. They made a conscious choice to run the business for the long term."
That choice makes Calico unusual -- and could help the company prosper over time, management consultants said.
The notion that employees and companies have a social contract with each other that goes beyond a paycheck has largely vanished in United States business. In its place is a free-agent culture where workers are expected to look out for themselves and switching jobs regularly is seen as normal.
BUT a few big companies, like Cisco Systems, Southwest Airlines and Men's Wearhouse, have found success by going out of their way to make employees feel valued, according to Charles O'Reilly, a Harvard professor who is writing a book about the cultures of successful companies.
"The average point of view is that loyalty is for chumps, that the longer you stay on the job, the stupider you are," said Fred Reichheld, a fellow at Bain Consulting who is writing a book about loyalty. "Most business leaders cannot tell you why their people should be loyal. They get it confused with obedience, or just staying there, or fear."
Instead, companies often try to combat turnover with big salaries and option grants. But Mr. Reichheld said that approach is self-defeating, because it works only as long as times are good and an organization can afford to pay a fairly small roster of stars above-market salaries.
Being honest with employees and giving them a chance to grow at their jobs builds loyalty in a way that money cannot, he said.
Mr. Naumann appears to have taken that lesson to heart. He shares lots of information with employees, holding monthly company-wide meetings to discuss where Calico stands relative to its competitors and internal goals. In addition, he hosts a monthly group breakfast for employees whose birthdays have fallen that month and solicits feedback from the group. That level of disclosure and communication is vital to building loyalty, Mr. O'Reilly said.
"The all-too-typical M.B.A. response is that people can't be trusted, and they're not very smart, so why would you give them this information?" he said. But companies that keep workers well informed find that employees come to feel they have a stake in the company, even if they own only a little stock. "Then people feel like owners, and they stick around even if the stock price dips," Mr. O'Reilly said.
OF course, Calico is not alone in fostering an atmosphere of openness. Young companies often share more information with their employees than bigger, older businesses; the gulf between management and the rank and file tends to widen over time. And some of Calico's other perks, like allowing employees to telecommute twice a week, are typical at young Silicon Valley companies where employees put in long hours.
But Calico does differ from its young cousins in some crucial ways. With weak or nonexistent human resources departments and a culture that puts work first, many young companies stumble when dealing with employees having personal crises. Not at Calico, said Rob Devine, a 32-year-old consultant who joined the company in June, six months before his wife died of ovarian cancer.
"Leadership two and three levels above was completely fair" in its treatment of him, Mr. Devine said. As his wife's health worsened, he said, the company arranged his work to minimize travel and offered him extra time off, an offer he declined because, he said, "it's important when you're in a situation like that to have something where you feel you're contributing."
Shelly Begun, Calico's vice president for human resources, said the company allowed an employee whose wife gave birth prematurely more than two months' leave to help care for the baby. "It is a huge deal for people that, when they have these types of situations, Calico will help to deal with them," Ms. Begun said.
Nancy McDermand, a manager whose grant of more than 10,000 options has just begun to vest, said she had recently turned down a job at a start-up that offered her "lots of shares" and more money, preferring to remain at Calico for its collegial atmosphere. "If it weren't like that, I could leave tomorrow," she said.
To maintain that spirit, Calico has made a concerted effort to seek out employees considered likely to fit into its culture, placing a premium on recruiting graduates directly from college or business school.
Hewlett-Packard and other successful technology companies "do superaggressive college hiring, because it's the only way to get people who fit in," said Mr. Naumann, an Iowa native who worked for Hewlett-Packard for five years after graduating from college. "We're trying to do the same thing."
Make no mistake, though, this is still Silicon Valley, the overnight-millionaire factory. Most Calico employees acknowledge forthrightly that tantalizing stock windfalls like those that were briefly within their grasp are a large part of what brought to Calico to begin with.
"The potential money that could be made getting into a company pre-I.P.O. really was a big consideration," said John Driver, Calico's director of field marketing.
So too, for many people in Silicon Valley, are bragging rights, and Calico's stock no longer yields employees much of those. "There is a gold rush mentality" in the new economy, said Barry Obrand, managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, the executive recruiting firm. "For people who haven't made it in some way, shape or form, there's a sense that you haven't done as well for yourself or your family."
YURI SMIROV, an engineer who joined Calico last year after two years at a privately held start-up, looks at Calico's prospects through that lens. Working for a company that does not succeed is extremely costly in Silicon Valley, he said, because "time is becoming the most expensive resource."
"Time is something you lose and it doesn't come back," Mr. Smirov said.
Mr. Smirov, who emigrated to the United States from Russia in 1992 and earned a doctorate in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said moving from Russia to Pennsylvania was a smaller adjustment for him than moving from Pennsylvania to Silicon Valley. The people he met in Pittsburgh were white and middle-class, with "the same income, with the same interests," he said. "Here, people are stratified much more."
As for the stock, he said, "the hardest part is mismatching your expectations." Mr. Smirov, who will receive more than 25,000 options between now and 2003, used to think he would be able to buy a house large enough for his two children to have separate bedrooms. That prospect is now remote, but Mr. Smirov remains hopeful.
Housing is on the mind of Ms. Kolodzieski, the administrator with only "a couple of thousand shares," as well. She and her husband hope one day to move out of the condominium apartment they rent. "We want to have a family, and part of that equals buying a home," she said.
Mr. Naumann knows his staff's patience will not last forever. "Our total compensation packages have to be competitive, or we won't retain people," he said. But for now, the stock woes have, if anything, pulled the company closer together, he said. "The market's got it wrong, and we're just going to have to prove them wrong."
 
For a New Insider, It Was a Risk Worth Taking
OF Calico Commerce's 330 employees, John Driver might have the best reason to be upset with the company's plunging stock price.
Mr. Driver joined the San Jose-based software company as director of field marketing two weeks before it became a public company last October, scrapping a thriving business as an independent consultant. His take-home pay at Calico came to only half what he had been making in fees; to compensate, Calico promised him more than 25,000 stock options, a potentially huge payoff. (Typically for Silicon Valley, Mr. Driver will receive his options over four years -- one-quarter of the grant on his first anniversary with the company and the rest in equal monthly installments thereafter.)
When Calico shares soared to $75 in November, Mr. Driver's decision to join the company looked brilliantly lucrative. Even if the stock failed to rise any farther before 2003, he stood to reap more than $1.5 million from his options.
Not so now that Calico's stock has plunged by 80 percent, right back to the initial offering price of $14 a share. At that price Mr. Driver's options are worthless.
So does Mr. Driver, who has an 18-month-old daughter and another child on the way, regret his career decision now?
No, he said, for lots of reasons. First off, his stock wealth does not yet really exist, even on paper; it will only accumulate over time as his options vest. "I have a very practical view of the stock," he said. "Even if the stock was trading at 100 today, I don't vest until September."
Mr. Driver, who said he is a fan of Warren E. Buffett, invests for the long haul and has "actually never sold a stock," is optimistic that by the time the options are actually his to exercise, Calico shares will have rebounded.
"I think Calico at the moment is actually undervalued," he said. "We have a good strategy, a good management team. There's a market there, and Calico is going to get some of it."
Even if the stock does not recover, Mr. Driver said, he is glad he joined the company. He enjoys working there, and even on half his former pay he and his wife will be able to support their family, he said. And the chance to be a part of the action, instead of on the outside looking in, was too exciting to pass up.
"It was a gamble," he said. "It was a risk, and if things don't work out, you've really got to be okay with the outcome. I have a great life the way it is -- I have a great house, I have a little kid, another on the way. If I wind up making millions of dollars, it's a bonus. If it doesn't happen, I have a really good life." ALEX BERENSON

Uncertain Market Appetite For Dean & DeLuca Offer

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to Dean & DeLuca, the Soho retailer of fine food and gorgeous kitchenware, New Yorkers are happy to spend $15 for a pound of rugelach or $2 for an Asian pear.
But will investors prove as eager to put money into Dean & DeLuca stock when the company offers shares in its initial public offering, expected in five to six weeks? 
 As of Friday, Dean & DeLuca -- which hasn't turned a profit in seven years -- had not set a price for the offering, nor had it announced how many shares it would sell. But the company hopes to raise about $69 million to finance a major expansion.
One of the first things an investor is likely to glean from the prospectus is that Joel B. Dean and Giorgio G. DeLuca, the company's founders, are no longer minding the store. Leslie G. Rudd, who holds 64 percent of Dean & DeLuca's shares, has been chairman since September 1995. And while Dean & DeLuca's flagship venue on lower Broadway remains one of Manhattan's culinary temples, the company has been opening stores nationwide for the past decade, and channeling money into its catalog and Internet businesses.
Today, Dean & DeLuca operates four other stores, in Washington; Charlotte, N.C.; Leawood, Kan. (a suburb of Kansas City); and St. Helena, Calif.
The company wants to open one or two specialty stores next year, and three or four stores in each of the five years thereafter.
Dean & DeLuca's expansion has not come cheaply. The company has not been profitable since the end of February 1993, a fact that must leave purchasers of Dean & DeLuca's $5 horned melons scratching their heads. And because of its expansion plans, the company expects to report sizable losses for the foreseeable future.
Last year, it lost $8.9 million on sales of $59.6 million, compared with a loss of $5.7 million on sales of $49.3 million in 1998, and a loss of $9.3 million on sales of $34.4 million in 1997. As of Jan. 30, it had $17.1 million in cash. Total debt stood at $3.2 million.
Still, the market for specialty foods -- Dean & DeLuca's largest business -- is growing, as is demand for premium-priced wine and upscale kitchenware. The prospectus forecasts United States sales of specialty foods alone to reach $54 billion by 2002, up from about $38.8 billion in 1997. And Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that sales of specialty foods online will rise from $248 million in 1999, to $6.3 billion in 2003.
So the company's expansion makes sense, industry analysts say. "Specialty food customers are the best food customers," said Phil Lempert, the editor of the Lempert Report, a newsletter in Santa Monica.
But competition is increasing. The Internet gives consumers access to the Web sites of food manufacturers, not just retailers. Evie Black Dykema, a Forrester analyst, cautions that online grocers like Webvan Group and general retailers like Amazon.com are expanding their specialty food offerings, too.
Others, like Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a Chicago consulting firm, question whether it makes sense for a specialty food store to open so many outlets.
Mr. Lempert, for one, isn't surprised by Dean & DeLuca's losses. He thinks the future of specialty food retailing lies in companies either creating strong, content-filled Internet sites that keep customers coming back for more products, like Amazon, or building 40,000-square-foot superstores that can generate high sales. Dean & DeLuca's new outlets will average just 10,000 to 15,000 square feet.
And like a number of other food analysts, Mr. Lempert thinks the retailer's Web site needs a makeover. Dean & DeLuca is planning such an overhaul, according to the prospectus. It also plans to use its catalogs to promote its Internet business more vigorously by sending out about 13 million this year, compared with 4 million in 1999.
Still, the climate for new issues is tepid. And according to Steven Tuen, director for research at IPO Value Monitor, a research firm in New York, food-related initial offerings historically have not fared well, with many eventually sinking below their offering prices.

A Sound Sleep and a Good Return

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI 

 BODY:
MY PARENTS have long told me their stories of growing up during the Great Depression. I heard how my dad delivered groceries for a dollar a week and how his family ate meat once a week with the leftovers stretched, thinner and thinner, into the next few meals.
For my father, James, 76, especially, the Great Depression has had a lasting effect. He's eating much better now, but he refuses to put his money into any investment where he isn't guaranteed to get his principal back. 
 He's not stuffing money into mattresses, but his insistence on safety has meant he has sat out the bull market. Several of them, actually. My lectures on the dangers of inflation and the historical return of the stock market have not had as much effect on him as those sparse chicken dinners. He puts his money almost exclusively in certificates of deposit and savings bonds, and that's that. The man will just not listen to me.
"Dad," I say, "don't put all your money into C.D.'s. Diversify. Try some mutual funds."
"Too risky," he says. "I wouldn't be able to sleep at night."
The sleep indicator is as important to my father's generation as the G.D.P. is to mine. We get frustrated seeing our parents' life savings invested at 6 percent, but they expect to sleep very soundly when it comes to their money. Although our parents are very fond of us, often those feelings don't run deep enough to take investment advice from their reckless children.
Giovanni S. Testa, 43, of Livingston, N.J., said he has tried for years to get his father, Marino, 75, also of Livingston, to invest more wisely, but to no avail.
"With stocks, my father thinks he'll lose all of it," he said. "I try to explain risk to him, but he didn't understand it. Forgetaboutit. It was like talking to a wall, talking to my father."
Richard J. Nemec, 54, of Hinckley, Ohio, never could get through to his father, but he understood why.
"He tended to be quite nearsighted and ultraconservative," Mr. Nemec said. "Let's face it, when a man has gone through the Depression and World War II and then lived in a nice suburb, he gets very comfortable with his station in life. My father was a blue-collar worker and money came hard. He didn't want to take a chance on losing it."
Mr. Nemec's father died in 1992, and his mother, Lillian, 79, was more open to change. He had her meet with his planner, Paul A. Hrisko.
"It was a big change for her and she asked an awful lot of questions," said Mr. Hrisko, a certified financial planner who owns Paul Hrisko & Associates in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. "Is it safe? Is it guaranteed? What are my chances of losing my money? It didn't take one meeting. I had to come back several times. She was a bit nervous. The more I discussed it with her, the more she was willing to take the next step to a more aggressive portfolio."
Mr. Hrisko said children must explain the investments, and their risks, fully and clearly. Children should also help their parents clarify their goals to determine how much risk is acceptable: is the money for them, their children or their grandchildren? The key, Mr. Hrisko said, is the parent must trust the child.
The senior Mr. Testa moved slowly into mutual funds after his son persuaded him to see an investment adviser and he saw how diversification could keep his risk low but increase his return. Gail Rosen, 41, of Martinsville, N.Y., talked to her father for years about leaving savings bonds behind. He resisted at first, but he trusted her enough to move some money into mutual funds. Now he's hooked.
"My dad has a computer and watches his funds online," said Ms. Rosen, an accountant. "Now he tells me how I'm doing on my investments. He's so addicted that my mother hates it that he's on the computer all the time. Like some wives lose their husbands to golf, she's lost him to the computer."
HER father, Irving Horowitz, 72, of Monroe Township, N.J., said he changed after his daughter showed him how much money he was losing to inflation and taxes.
"She's an accountant, so I listened," he said, eventually moving money into funds and individual stocks. "Since I retired, I have made a hobby of it."
My father's hobby is his garden. And keeping his principal safe. I know his greatest concern is not for his children or his grandchildren, but for my mother, Mary. He wants to leave her secure and comfortable if anything happens to him. If his principal is safe, he knows she will be, too.
He could have a better strategy, but that's not a bad one. It's a heartfelt plan that this son is going to stop arguing with.

Will Managers Relate To This Gripping Tale?

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS 

 BODY:
A DECADE or so ago, Dennis N. T. Perkins, president of the Syncretics Group in Branford, Conn., brought us "the moose on the table," the disarming metaphor that companies use to mention the unmentionable. He devised that impish but effective image as a way of coaxing business people into talking openly about the sensitive issues that hang heavy over a discussion but that no one dares mention.
Now Dr. Perkins, a management consultant whose clients include American Express, Bose, Citibank and Marriott, is back with bigger game in mind. He is a connoisseur of leadership in circumstances of great peril. His new book offers lessons in leadership "at the outer limits of human endurance -- the place I call The Edge." 
 This thoughtful work has the feel of a lifelong obsession. An Annapolis graduate, Dr. Perkins woke up to genuine leadership in Vietnam, a brutal and unforgettable academy. At one point he found himself in command of a Marine convoy running a bloody gantlet along Route 1 from Chu Lai to Da Nang. Caught in a withering ambush, shaken and confused, he urged his column forward, concluding that the risk of crossing an open field of fire was better than sitting tight in the bull's-eye of the killing zone. ("A man sits as many risks as he runs," Dr. Perkins quotes Henry David Thoreau.)
Dr. Perkins builds his corporate leadership text around the astonishing story of the British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton. In December 1914, Shackleton and 27 others sailed from South Georgia, an island in the Southern Ocean, bent on becoming the first to cross Antarctica on foot, a trek expected to take three months.
Instead, Shackleton and his troop endured more than 600 wretched days of endless cold, near-starvation, scanty shelter, misery and despair before they struggled back to South Georgia. Their ship became icebound and was eventually crushed.
For months, the party clung to an ice floe, but as the floe melted, the desperate men took to the frigid sea in open boats. They found a toehold on a small island, but that proved untenable, so Shackleton and five others struck out in a lifeboat for help 800 miles away across the world's most storm-swept seas. Barely surviving that ordeal, they then clawed their way across New Georgia's icy mountain ranges to safety.
Dr. Perkins offers us Ernest Shackleton as the model leader, a captain obsessed with the welfare of his men. Cautious or daring as circumstances required, Shackleton was a rock. An inventive and insistent cheerleader, he refused to let the enfeebled company give up. He insisted on maintaining equity and mutual respect, and he saved the most onerous tasks for himself. Incredibly, not a man died.
So far, so good, but what does all this have to do with meeting a payroll?
Dr. Perkins has distilled 10 principles from these survival experiences, and he offers them as a guide for business leadership at the edge (though it's never entirely clear what, in business, "the edge" means). The 10 principles, the backbone of the book, are expounded in the Shackleton saga. Taken out of that adventurous context, they seem mostly unexceptionable, if not routine.
"Never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and focus energy on short-term objectives." "Set a personal example with visible, memorable symbols and behaviors." "Minimize status differences." "Find something to celebrate and something to laugh about." "Reinforce the team message constantly: 'We are one -- we live or die together.' "
"Leading at the Edge" reads like two different accounts -- a gripping adventure story and an orthodox management manual -- that never really marry. To stitch the two together, each chapter on the Shackleton expedition concludes with questions and some "lessons for leaders." The lessons tend to be shopworn episodes from management lore, like Andy Grove's pivotal decision to get Intel out of memory chips or James Burke's handling of Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol tampering scare or Scott McNealy's resourcefulness at Sun Microsystems.
Dr. Perkins does include four business cases where he applies his principles in detail. Abstract and dry, lacking pertinent detail, the case studies cannot measure up to the survival saga. They tend to depict executives who obtained outstanding results by greatly improving communications with the rank and file. Jack Creighton revived Weyerhauser from mediocrity. Pat Russo led a turnaround at AT&T's Global Business Communications Systems. These executives' efforts, as impressive as they were, pale in comparison to Shackleton's: Ms. Russo gave subordinates her home telephone number. Shackleton led a terrifying sail across polar seas.
The only case that comes to life involved loyalty and devotion. It is the tale of Aaron Feuerstein's rebuilding of Malden Mills after its disastrous fire in December 1995. At 70, his life work consumed in flames, Mr. Feuerstein could have pocketed the insurance proceeds and retired. Instead, he vowed to rebuild his mill and save his employees' livelihoods. Struggling against enormous odds, Mr. Feuerstein and his loyal workers managed to get Malden's Polartek lines back in production within months.
Why do the two halves seem so out of kilter? In truth, precious few business decisions are made "at the edge," with life or limb in peril. Dr. Perkins argues that "the edge" of endurance can be subjective. "I've seen people more upset about missing deadlines or giving presentations than Marines under automatic-weapon and mortar fire." But we all know that business teams do not "live or die together." It is romantic (or foolish) to frame the stakes that way.
When a business fails, it is dismantled or reorganized; people lose jobs but most find other ones. Failure is a cleansing of the economy. If a chief executive falls short, typically he or she is given a comfortable departure, and a new aspirant comes in to tackle the job. Business problems are serious but not lethal.
One wonders how the valiant Shackleton would fare in today's business world. In his circumstance, the ultimate goal -- survival -- was indisputable. In today's bewildering environment, reaching agreement on fundamental goals may be half the battle. And though Shackleton's people might grumble or bicker, they were hardly free to listen to a headhunter and depart for a more promising enterprise.
SHACKLETON is the leader as father figure, a heroic provider who shouldered the weight and made the decisions. He had loyal lieutenants but not equals. He listened to others but chose the path himself. Today's business leader is less a hero than a first among equals, an enabler who inspires commitment and exists to bring out the best in his or her people. The talent is unwilling to rely so heavily on someone else.
"Leading at the Edge" has a wistful air. The lessons are shaped for warriors and adventurers but directed at managers, who are neither. At some level Dr. Perkins is looking for the ideal company commander. Only in the recounting of miraculous survival does the writing come alive -- not only the tale of the Shackleton expedition, but also of Steven Callahan, who, with indomitable ingenuity, survived 76 days in a five-foot rubber raft in the Atlantic, warding off sharks and spearing fish for food. Or the Navy patrol plane that crashed in the North Pacific, consigning the crew to two small life rafts. (Five of 15 died, but the survivors buoyed their spirits by chanting, "Toga, toga, toga," after John Belushi in "Animal House.") Or the Texan who, bitten by a coral snake, bit off the snake's head and used the snake's skin for a tourniquet.
Put that one in the office manual.

Trading More Now For Less Later

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
BECAUSE it is so contentious, the debate over reforming Social Security draws plenty of attention. So it is easy to overlook that Congress has just reformed Social Security -- enacting a change that should have been contentious but somehow wasn't.
For the first time, workers in their late 60's have the choice of collecting a full pension regardless of what they earn. That can backfire. What America's senior citizens decide to do with this choice will affect their level of income -- or poverty -- in deep old age. Because of the way the new law plays to human nature, many might make the wrong choice, taking too much pension now and not enough later. Some already have. 
 "Waiting to collect benefits is basically betting that you will live beyond the average life expectancy," said Peter Orszag, an economist and Social Security expert at the University of California at Berkeley. That average for people who are already 65 is 81 for men and 84 for women, and rising for both. "When you give people in their late 60's the choice of collecting their Social Security benefits now, then you raise the odds of their being poor in real old age."
The mechanics are simple enough. Previously, people between 65 and 70 who earned more than $17,000 a year had their Social Security pension benefits reduced, and those who earned $52,000 a year or more had them postponed entirely, until they turned 70. As a quid pro quo, the monthly pension checks they ultimately received were higher.
Now people in their late 60's can earn any amount and still draw full pensions. But the old quid pro quo survives: people can still voluntarily wait until 70 to get larger checks thereafter. Those who take their pensions at 65 get a head start in total benefits paid, but those who wait will overtake them in their 80's, and the longer they live, the wider the gap will grow.
The monthly payment at 70, for example, would be $1,300 for someone who passed up $1,000 at 65.
Congress had been moving gradually in this direction, but the new legislation, signed by President Clinton April 7, completed the process in one leap. As a byproduct in this election year, the Social Security Administration expects to deliver $6 billion in extra pension money.
But that is politics. The real issues are work incentives and adequate income in very old age, particularly the latter. It is still possible to postpone collecting pension benefits until age 70, but hardly anyone has chosen to do so. Of 419,000 registered wage earners in their late 60's who were collecting either reduced benefits or none at all when the new law took effect, only 800 are still holding off until age 70.
WHAT does not mean the others have all actively chosen not to wait; many were probably swept passively onto the benefit rolls. To minimize its clerical work, the Social Security Administration sent out letters announcing that all 419,000 would receive full benefits automatically, unless they called a toll-free number and specifically opted to wait. Getting through on the often-busy phone line was not easy.
People who wanted to wait could also have sent back their first checks. But in defiance of a main tenet of mainstream economics, that people make rational decisions in their best interest, hardly anyone returned the checks. "People in their 60's in good health whose parents lived long lives should rationally choose to defer," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "But there is a tendency to want your money now." Particularly when it is in hand and substantial; the first checks averaged $3,500, retroactively covering the first four months of the year.
There is a second irrational tendency among people drawing both paychecks and benefit checks: to spend the pension rather than save for future retirement, increasing the odds of poverty later. But Congress gave in to an irrational outcry from working people in their late 60's who complained with growing frequency that withholding benefits was an unjust "tax" on work.
"There is a real misperception out there that when the money is withheld it is gone; they will never see it again," said Kenneth S. Apfel, commissioner of Social Security. "The number of seniors who perceive this is not insignificant."
So Congress acted. Federal surpluses helped to make the action politically palatable. So did another misperception: that in a robust economy suffering labor shortages, removing the earnings limits would encourage senior citizens to work a lot more. The most optimistic studies fail to support this contention. Hours worked will rise 5 percent at most, or roughly the equivalent of 50,000 full-time workers a year. That is what today's strong economy absorbs in a week.
Maybe there is a lesson here for judging the Gore and Bush proposals for Social Security reform: Look for the misperceptions.

Too Much, Too Soon Halts Assisted-Living Boom

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
FUELED by favorable demographic trends, strong consumer demand and a robust economy, the assisted-living industry was supposed to be mounting record profits this year while expanding rapidly and reaching new stock market peaks. That, at least, is what analysts were predicting three years ago.
It has not exactly worked out that way. One publicly traded company -- Grand Court Lifestyles Inc., in Boca Raton, Fla. -- filed for bankruptcy protection in March. Several others are under financial strain, and most have seen their shares recently plunge to record lows. 
 New construction has all but stopped. The Alterra Healthcare Corporation of Milwaukee, the nation's largest assisted-living operator, has abandoned plans to build 100 new homes. Last year, the industry's publicly traded companies, which account for 10 percent of the homes, lost 68 percent of their value, according to Philip J. Martin, an analyst with First Union Securities.
What went wrong? The answer is a binge of overinvestment and overbuilding, with too many companies trying to seize a trend.
The elderly are the fastest-growing segment of the population; the number of Americans 85 or older is expected to increase by one-third in the next decade, to about six million. Most dread the prospect of being confined to the hospital-like setting of a nursing home.
Privately paid assisted living is viewed as an appealing alternative for people who need some help but do not require skilled nursing. Residents have their own apartments with kitchens, eating communally and taking part in social activities only when they want to. Public areas are designed to evoke a comfortable hotel rather than an institution.
Experts in senior housing say the industry's poor financial performance has not discredited assisted living, any more than the slide in dot-com stocks has undermined the Internet. They cite a gold-rush fever that led some companies to grow too fast and to use creative (though legal) accounting methods to hide their losses.
The concept of assisted living has existed for about two decades, but as recently as 1994, the industry had only two publicly traded companies. As capital became widely available, about 20 more public offerings followed, including some for companies operating both assisted-living and nursing homes. That resulted in pressure to produce quick increases in earnings.
In contrast to nursing homes, assisted-living homes face few regulatory barriers. New residences often went up with little market research.
But many companies did not anticipate how long it would take to fill their buildings. The costs are beyond many people's means. Monthly fees start at $3,000 in lower-cost regions and climb sharply, depending on the services needed -- with medical care usually extra. Also, many elderly people are reluctant to give up their independence.
Some companies failed to foresee that they would be serving an increasingly older, and therefore more frail clientele (the average age is now 84), forcing them to add staff, which cut into profits. "There wasn't a lot of discipline on the part of the companies," said Christos Kuliopoulos, a senior consultant at Ernst & Young who specializes in senior housing. "They weren't doing their due diligence."
And so the building boom has tapered off. The 164 homes now under construction are just a third as many as were completed in 1998. There are about 7,000 professionally run homes nationwide, with about 520,000 units, according to the American Seniors Housing Association in Fairfax, Va.
DURING the building boom, many markets quickly became saturated, prompting several states to require certificates of need before a home could be built. North Carolina has declared a moratorium on new construction, an action that backfired when many companies rushed into the state to beat the deadline.
Confidence in the industry was also shaken when many companies chose to engage in so-called off-balance-sheet financing. Abraham Gosman, the chairman of the Care-Matrix Corporation, a publicly traded company based in Needham, Mass., used a private but wholly owned company, the Chancellor Senior Housing Group, to buy property and absorb start-up losses. Chancellor paid CareMatrix a fee for developing the homes and running them in the early stages. As the homes filled up, CareMatrix would either lease them or buy them back.
"They were moving money from one pocket to another pocket," said James J. Kumpel, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, who called attention to this financing arrangement at several companies. "It was a cynical financing vehicle to promote hypergrowth in what is generally not a hypergrowth industry."
However, Louise T. Major, director of investor relations for CareMatrix, said this type of financing has been standard in the hotel industry for many years.
Not all of the industry's problems have been of its own making. Changes in Medicare reimbursement methods for nursing homes also affected the prices of assisted-living stocks, because many investors do not distinguish among various forms of senior housing, analysts say. Last year, the stocks tumbled after an analyst reported -- incorrectly, as it turned out -- that the Government Accounting Office was about to recommend federal regulation of assisted living.
The industry is generally not opposed to regulation (it is easier to market government-certified homes), but it prefers to have it imposed by state lawmakers, who are easier to lobby.
As the industry faltered, even the better-managed companies saw their shares drop precipitously. These included Sunrise Assisted Living, Brookdale Living Communities and the American Retirement Corporation. The pioneer in assisted living, Sunrise, based in Fairfax, Va., opened its first home in 1981 and now has 148 homes in 23 states and one in Britain.
Companies like these own their real estate, choose their locations carefully, usually in densely populated areas, and focus on their operations, said Kathryn A. Sweeney, a vice president at AEW Capital Management, a Boston company that invests in privately held assisted-living companies. "Those firms that succeed as good operators will live in this business," she said. "Those that entered the business as real estate developers -- for opportunistic reasons -- will not."
For these reasons, a shakeout could benefit consumers in the long run. It would force companies to shift their attention from development to management, said Don Redfoot, a senior policy adviser to AARP.
But for now, families may want to exercise an extra measure of caution when choosing a home. "The intense pressure to show profit margins created enormous pressures to keep staffing to a minimum," Mr. Redfoot said. "You want to make sure that the place is adequately staffed."

Pay First, Drive Later

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.

 BODY:
Filling up for the Memorial Day weekend, drivers paid as much for gasoline as they did at the height of the oil price spike in March.
This time, though, it's not OPEC's fault. Low inventories of gasoline and a scramble to introduce a cleaner-burning reformulated fuel across much of the nation have tightened supplies -- especially in the Midwest -- just at the start of the summer driving season. 
While $1.53 a gallon is the highest average gas price ever, adjusted for inflation, it is still cheaper to fill up the family sports utility vehicle than it was to top off the Model T, noted Daniel Yergin, author of "The Prize," a history of the oil industry and president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. In 1918, using today's dollars, gasoline approached $3 a gallon.
"Everybody is going to notice it this weekend," Mr. Yergin said of the rising prices. But he added, "On an inflation-adjusted basis, it's still cheaper than it's been in most of the last 80 years." That sort of historical perspective may be small comfort to drivers paying 40 cents a gallon more than last year.
Mr. Yergin, like most experts, believes prices may rise higher this summer. RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Antitrust Annals;
The Uncertain Art Of Legal Remedies

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
IN a court filing last week Microsoft called the government's proposal to break the company in two "the antitrust equivalent of the death penalty."
Lawyerly hyperbole, it seems, but in the old days -- the very old days -- antitrust offenders couldn't afford to take any chances. In 388-386 B.C., a group of Athenian grain dealers formed a corn monopoly and manipulated prices, according to research by Spencer Weber Waller, a professor at the Brooklyn Law School. The dealers were caught, prosecuted and put to death. 
 Ever since, the issue of the appropriate punishment in antitrust cases has been a conundrum, if not a lethal one.
"We kill companies occasionally, but we've never killed any people with antitrust enforcement in America," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
Antitrust is a flexible doctrine intended to prohibit "anticompetitive behavior" -- a concept whose definition shifts according to the economic and political thinking of the day. So the remedial steps, too, have varied widely over the years.
There are two broad approaches: "structural" remedies, which involve breaking up the offending company; and "conduct" remedies, which involve prohibiting certain kinds of corporate behavior, like threatening rivals or writing contracts that restrict competition.
Both approaches have drawbacks. Breaking up a company is drastic, irrevocable and runs the risk of doing more harm than good. Restraints on a company's behavior can be easily sidestepped, may do little to curb its market power and may require constant policing by a court or government.
In the Microsoft case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson appears to be seriously weighing a breakup of the company. In his court in Washington last Wednesday, Judge Jackson pointedly asked the government why it did not go even further and recommend breaking up Microsoft into three companies instead of just two. The judge may issue his remedies order as soon as this week, but no matter what he decides, Microsoft will appeal both his sanctions and his legal ruling, which found the company to be a monopolist that used its market power to stifle competition.
THE track record of antitrust remedies is decidedly mixed, even humbling. For decades, from Standard Oil in 1911 through United Shoe Machinery in 1968, the courts tended to look approvingly on structural remedies, says Mr. Hovenkamp, editor of the 18-volume treatise "Antitrust Law," begun in 1978 by Philip Areeda of the Harvard Law School, who died in 1995.
United Shoe Machinery is the classic cautionary tale for skeptics of the structural approach. The government sued the company and in 1953 a district court in Boston found that it had violated the law but declined to break it up. In his opinion, Judge Charles Wyzanski explained that federal judges are not experts in economics or politics and "their prophecies as to the economic future are not guided by unusually subtle judgment."
YEARS later, the government asked the Supreme Court to modify Judge Wyzanski's remedies order so that United Shoe could be broken up. In 1968, the Supreme Court agreed with the government and United Shoe was split up, even though United Shoe's share of the shoe-making machinery market declined from 85 percent to 48 percent between 1953 and 1968.
United Shoe eventually collapsed, though the role of the government's misguided ministrations is unclear. Among antitrust scholars, however, "A lot of people who have studied it since believe that the courts got it wrong," Mr. Hovenkamp observed.
Maybe, but 1968 was the height of the "big is bad" bias against business and for the notion that government should step in to restrain corporate power. That changed by the late 1970's, as international rivals began to challenge America companies and as free-market academics, led by University of Chicago theorists, influenced antitrust thinking.
The courts, in general, have been skittish about splitting up companies in antitrust cases since the 1980's. A qualified exception was the AT&T breakup in 1984, but that was unusual, a consent decree applied to a government-sanctioned monopoly.
Antitrust experts say the structural approach to antitrust remedies is gaining renewed respect. One reason, they say, is that the consent decree the Justice Department signed with Microsoft in 1994 is widely seen as a failure.
The decree, antitrust experts say, was a backward-looking remedy that did little to restrain Microsoft's market power in an industry moving ahead at a rapid clip. "The government was shooting at a moving target, and it aimed, shot and missed," noted William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school.
The cases in which breakup remedies will now receive serious consideration by the courts, according to antitrust experts, involve "durable" monopolies (at least five years old) for which there is "no reasonable prospect" that the market will become competitive unless the monopolist is split up.
So much for theory. In the Microsoft case, what are the chances that the company will be broken up after all the appeals are over? A straw poll of six antitrust scholars who are not affiliated with either side in the case rated that probability at 20 percent to 50 percent.
Significantly, all six wanted to do their handicapping anonymously. There have been too many surprises already, they say, in the antitrust soap opera formally known as the United States of America v. the Microsoft Corporation.

HEADLINE: The World;
Yes, Trade Brings Freedom. Except When It Doesn't.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE arguments that finally persuaded wavering members of Congress to grant China permanent trade status last week had very little to do with tariffs or even whether China's state-run industries would finally allow American farmers to deliver beef and wheat directly to the world's largest market.
Instead, it came down to one of the biggest bets in geopolitics: Most of the members of Congress who voted "yes" said they believed President Clinton's oft-repeated assertion that the faster the Chinese people are enmeshed in Western markets, legal systems and technology, the faster they will be tempted to cast off the one-party rule of the Communists. 
 "When over 100 million people in China can get on the Net," Mr. Clinton argued in a commencement speech days before the vote, which he won by a surprisingly wide margin of 237 to 197, "it will be impossible to maintain a closed political and economic society."
Really? Who knows. Mr. Clinton may be well into a second career as an investment banker or a third one as a movie producer before anyone has the foggiest sense of whether last week's decision to end the annual Congressional review of China's trading rights, and usher the country into the World Trade Organization, has any real effect on political freedom in China.
Yet recent history suggests it is not an entirely wild gamble. Look around the rest of Asia, where there is a clear -- if sometimes tenuous -- connection between the growth of market capitalism and the growth of some kind of democratic institutions.
Taiwan and South Korea are the success stories that everyone points to, places where the arrival of high technology, commercial legal systems and a gradual opening of the market was followed by an end to autocratic rule. But economists and political theorists have spent years arguing over the precise connections between freer markets and freer political systems and -- no surprise -- they can't agree on much.
And for every success story there are exceptions like Singapore and Malaysia, which have managed to embrace free enterprise while maintaining strict one-party control. Or Russia, where political liberty has preceded the introduction of a real market economy. But there are a few common themes:
Free markets don't equal freedom. But they make it a lot harder for the government -- or corrupt bureaucrats -- to rule over everyday choices.
Before China began to embrace market principles, a Communist Party official would get up at 5 a.m. in cities like Shanghai, go to the market and decide who got what. As in the old Soviet Union, the system worked for a while -- goods and services got produced, and people didn't starve. Usually. In short, the apparatchik played the role that pricing plays today, allocating scarce resources. And since handing out goodies was the local official's main source of power -- to say nothing of an opportunity to have his pockets stuffed with bribes -- the arrival of a market economy means the diminution of the party's arbitrary power. Entry into the W.T.O. promises to reinforce this process. "The arrival of foreign competition means the local party officials will lose their control over what the big factory in town produces, or even how many people it employs," says Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings Institution. Chang Lin Tien, the former chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, just returned to Taiwan a week ago to witness the swearing in of the new president, and he says it got him thinking about what prompted the change from the martial law of his youth to the election of the opposition leader, Chen Shui-bian, earlier this year. "We had some ruthless leaders," he said, "but as the economy came up, and Taiwan became part of the global market, it ended up giving more and more influence to the local Taiwanese and less to the party. State-owned enterprises just couldn't compete."
A rising middle class first demands a decent apartment, then a car, and sooner or later a vote.
Well, sometimes. In South Korea, American efforts to push a series of authoritarian leaders toward greater freedom failed before the country's workers began making decent wages. "When I think about our first efforts to convince South Korean leaders to liberalize, well, we saved the life of Kim Dae Jung," said William H. Gleysteen Jr., the former American ambassador to Seoul, referring to the onetime dissident who is now president. "But a lot of the other efforts didn't amount to much. Then people started to buy cars, to travel, and to demand a bit more political space. They became less compliant with the government." By 1987 the movement had become unstoppable.
The I.M.F. may be much reviled, but sometimes it aids and abets a democratic coup.
Suharto did not found the Indonesian state, but he ruled over it for 35 years. For years the Central Intelligence Agency speculated how his regime would end -- heart attack, coup, assassination. "We forgot about economic chaos," says one of the agency's old Asia hands. Once the Asian economic crisis began, the International Monetary Fund began demanding changes -- including the dismemberment of Suharto's family enterprises, which were skewing the government's budgets. And that unleashed political forces that Suharto couldn't withstand. The I.M.F. made a lot of mistakes, and the Indonesian bailout was not intended to oust Suharto. In retrospect, though, the world got a more open Indonesia and one less authoritarian ruler. "Of course there was no plan," says Jeffrey E. Garten, a former senior official in the Commerce Department. "But from the beginning of the Clinton administration there was a sense that economic liberalization and political liberalization would somehow go together. Of course, no one envisioned how this dangerous cocktail would come together."
The Internet will change this. But no one knows how.
Mr. Clinton is probably right that the Chinese will never be able to control discourse on the Internet (which doesn't stop them from trying). And while it may be a force for democracy, it may also prove a spur for anti-market, anti-American feelings. No sooner had the House passed the trade bill last week than Chinese scholars like Han Deqiang were on the Web preaching the dangers. Mr. Han told China Online, an electronic newsletter for executives, that through the W.T.O. "American economic hegemony could easily control China." Oh, and he added: "There are 133 W.T.O. members. Look at some of the African countries, the corruption there is much worse than in China."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: CORRESPONDENCE/A SLAIN JOURNALIST;
Reports From Faraway Places That Brought War Home

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
JOURNALISM, it is said, provides a first draft of history. It is a cliche, yet sometimes an unlikely combination of war and a witness illustrates the hallowed truth that lurks behind a hollow phrase. I write this sitting in Berlin, dreaming of Bosnia, and thinking of Kurt Schork, the Reuters correspondent whose dispatches from Sarajevo helped shape the world's view of a war that was as morally indelible to my generation of correspondents as Vietnam was to another.
Mr. Schork, 53, was killed on Wednesday in an ambush in Sierra Leone. A dispatch from his news agency described the scene: the armed men in T-shirts bursting out from behind a bank on a dusty road 50 miles from Freetown, the volley of automatic-rifle fire, a bullet through Mr. Schork's head. Another quick, senseless death of a foreign correspondent: what more is there to say? 
 But in this case, more must be said. For in nobody else did the conflicts of the first post-cold-war decade find a witness so driven or so able to write the accounts on which history will draw. With vivid declarative sentences this American journalist hammered out the discomfiting truths of a bloody decade. Lucidity of mind and economy of expression combined to penetrating journalistic effect.
I knew him in Sarajevo, a besieged city I covered for two years as a correspondent for The New York Times. Mr. Schork, compact, bespectacled, precise and insatiable, had a passion for truth and a gift for evoking it that made him a Bosnian reference. Wherever the post-modern wars of fractured or disintegrating states broke out -- Afghanistan, Chechnya, northern Iraq, Kosovo and finally Sierra Leone -- he was to be found. I believe he intuited, earlier than anyone, that the pieties of the new world order, postulating a Western triumph and even the end of history, were largely empty. What he saw, in his remorseless way, was that the end of the superpower confrontation had in fact unleashed a new violence, and that the killing would pose an unavoidable challenge to supposedly victorious Western values.
For a deep moral conviction guided this unusual newsman, who came to journalism late after a career that included running Bill Bradley's first Senate campaign. It backed his stubborn belief that his words would ultimately count and perhaps even right wrong. The truth is, he changed things, and with his death an era has passed: that of a gradual awakening to the fact that distant war and genocide could not be ignored by America and its allies.
When Yugoslavia began its protracted disintegration in 1991, precipitating the latest round of Balkan wars, the West's instincts were those of Neville Chamberlain on Czechoslovakia in 1938: these were conflicts "in a faraway country" involving people "of whom we know nothing." Not knowing amounted to the best excuse for not acting, especially when the imperative to do something was accentuated by the daily Serb bombardment of Sarajevo that began in 1992 and by an archipelago of Serbian concentration camps for Bosnian Muslims uncovered that year. Mr. Schork was driven by a desire to ensure that nobody could claim ignorance.
In these days of databank journalism and infotainment as news, he wrote what the great war correspondent Martha Gellhorn famously called "the view from the ground." In so doing, he brought journalists back to the basics: to see, to listen, to remain, to reflect, to report. His copy was so lapidary that the oft-repeated claims of muddle in Western capitals -- the repetitive talk of 1,000-year-old conflicts between indistinguishable Balkan tribes -- became largely preposterous in the gleam of Mr. Schork's clear-eyed observation.
H ERE, at the beginning of one of his best-known dispatches, so descriptive of the ideological insanity unleashed, is Mr. Schork on the killing of a Serb man and a Muslim woman, both 25, joined by love but hounded by the politics of ethnic hatred: "Two lovers lie dead on the banks of Sarajevo's Miljacka River, locked in a final embrace. For four days they have sprawled near Vrbanja bridge in a wasteland of shell-blasted rubble, downed tree branches and dangling power lines." He continued: "Bosko is face-down on the pavement, right arm bent awkwardly behind him. Admira lies next to her lover, left arm across his back."
For all his fierce competitiveness, Mr. Schork could never hide an overriding humanity, which once impelled him to drop his notebook and rescue Sarajevans as Serbian shells fell on a funeral. It was this combination of professionalism and moral clarity that made him a beacon for many journalists seeking to untangle the wars of recent years. And what could have been more important, for these conflicts have already involved two genocides -- in Rwanda and Bosnia -- and the death of more people in European violence than in the entire 44-year cold-war era?
These facts have only recently moved toward the center of political consciousness, spurring the West's first "humanitarian war" in Kosovo, intensifying its diplomatic quest to quiet the killing fields of Africa. Mr. Schork's work must take a large share of credit. As Hannah Arendt observed of acts of courage that may seem futile in the light of early death: "The holes of oblivion do not exist. Nothing human is that perfect and there are simply too many people in the world to make oblivion possible. Hence nothing can ever be practically useless, at least not in the long run." No other journalist I know did so much in recent years that will resist oblivion.

HEADLINE: The World: U.S.-Europe Relations;
Tiffs Over Bananas And Child Custody

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
ACLOSE aide to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder was recently astounded to find a cabinet meeting devoted to the divisive issue of child custody in German-American relations. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer weighed in; so did Mr. Schroder himself. There was much agonizing as they reviewed the family difficulties of Lady Catherine Meyer, who is the wife of the British ambassador to Washington.
Welcome to the new trans-Atlantic relationship, one that is bereft of an overarching mission yet so intimate that issues long considered domestic or secondary become major irritants. Lady Meyer has two sons from a previous marriage to a German doctor. The boys live in Germany with their father. Because of the vagaries of German custody laws, the children have had limited access to their mother, who is indignant. President Clinton, moved by this and other similar cases, is expected to raise the issue during a visit to Germany this week. 
 The cold war, whose heart was in Germany, has been over for a decade, and the big questions -- Euromissiles, Soviet divisions, global peace itself -- have disappeared from Washington's relations with Berlin and other European capitals. Beyond the intermittent flaring of Balkan crises, their place has largely been taken by genetically altered food, banana trade, the death penalty and even child custody. America's apparent determination to build a national missile defense system could still spur a major confrontation with Russia that would be deeply troubling to Washington's European allies. But, in general, how to live, what to eat and whether to accept the death sentence seem to have become the stuff of trans-Atlantic tiffs.
The recurrent rows over such questions are sometimes viewed as a sign of the fraying ties between Western Europe and the United States. A voguish band of French intellectuals predict a coming clash with the all-devouring, all-knowing "hyperpower." But there is another way of looking at these issues, many of which are essentially moral. Their prominence demonstrates the unprecedented closeness of European and American societies linked through business and cultural bonds intensified over the Internet.
"What we now have with the United States is a relationship so close that it is quasi-domestic," said Karsten Voigt, a senior German foreign ministry official. "The distinction between foreign and domestic policy has blurred as our societies have interwoven. That is why emotional issues like genetically altered food or the way we treat the children of international divorces rise to the surface. In a way, foreign policy was easier when it dealt with interests rather than emotions and morals."
Emotions being what they are, discussion of the new issues can get heated. An overwhelming majority of Germans consider the death penalty as unconscionable as the slave trade. Lady Meyer and others see Germany's child custody laws as barbaric.
But Europeans and Americans are now divided by how they run their domestic societies even as they are bound by a shared international goal: enlarging the areas of the world with a functioning market economy governed by the rule of law. Such enlargement, in turn, opens new avenues to prosperity.
"The pressures on all advanced nations are similar in the global economy," said Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser to President Clinton. "So what we find ourselves discussing are values -- how open we should be to immigration, how to educate people for an information society."
Of course, divisions of substance do persist. President Clinton will hear much criticism in Europe of the proposed national missile defense system, which European governments view as a risky recourse to an unproven system against an unproven enemy -- so-called rogue states like North Korea whose inclination or ability to attack the United States is doubted here. Many European officials are not happy about the new isolationism they see in the House of Representatives, which tried to end the deployment of American peacekeepers in Kosovo. Europeans are uncertain about the American view of the old continent's determination to forge a more united Europe with its own credible military force; they also wonder what America thinks of a European federation -- a kind of United States of Europe -- suggested as a long-term aim by Foreign Minister Fischer this month.
But even these issues seem to be about preserving a bond, and not about confrontation. True, the French argue for the euro or a proposed European rapid-reaction force as means to counterbalance the United States, but such talk is de rigueur. As Karl Kaiser, a German political scientist, noted, "The first to scream if American troops upped and left Germany would be the French, because of their lingering fears of German hegemony."
AT a profound level, America has become an essential European power. Hence the concern here over possible isolationism and a missile system that poses the question: what happens when Americans have protected themselves and their European allies are sitting ducks? "Our militaries have gotten in the habit of working together and that gives us something people don't want to give up," said John Roper, a British security expert. "So problems will be finessed."
No doubt they will. For in some senses, the deepest concern of European governments today is that the United States is not paying Europe enough attention. "Americans think Europe's problems are largely solved," said John Kornblum, the American ambassador to Germany. "They are not thinking about the structures of Europe any more, they are thinking about why they can't sell their beef. Europeans, however, see themselves at a critical and rather treacherous juncture and would like America to pay more attention."
At that juncture stands the question of what "Europe" should be. The continent is at a crossroads. It feels a historic obligation to expand the 15-member European Union to include the former Communist states of Eastern Europe, but fears hordes of poor immigrants pouring in. It knows that this larger union would become ungovernable unless moves begin toward Mr. Fischer's federative United States of Europe, but the end of the nation state in places like France or Britain is a deeply divisive idea.
Here, in these intra-European differences, the most painful and substantive clashes of the coming months and years may well emerge. Meanwhile, Europe and the United States, ever closer, will bicker over Texan executions and the fate of children whose mothers and fathers separated.

HEADLINE: Retiring Debt Clock Could Be Put to New Use

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your article "Debt Clock, Calculating Since '89, Is Retiring Before the Debt Does" (May 14) was sad news. Strong economic growth during the 90's provided excess tax revenue that the federal government has begun to use in making a down payment toward paying off our national debt. When economic recession inevitably returns, watch how debt reduction resumes its position on the back burner of political priorities.
The debt clock has been a beacon to remind us of the terrible inheritance that could destroy the financial security of future generations. 
 Why not use the debt clock to keep an eye on our city and state long-term financial borrowing?

HEADLINE: Connecting Rural India to the World

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: EMBALAM, India

 BODY:
In this village at the southern tip of India, the century-old temple has two doors.
Through one lies tradition. People from the lowest castes and menstruating women cannot pass its threshold. Inside, the devout perform daily pujas, offering prayers. Through the second door lies the Information Age, and anyone may enter. 
 In a rare social experiment, the village elders have allowed one side of the temple to house two solar-powered computers that give this poor village a wealth of data, from the price of rice to the day's most auspicious hours.
"If I can get a job through this, I'll be happy," said V. Aruna, 14, who pestered her father, a farmer, until he agreed that she could come here each day to peck at a computer keyboard, where she learned Word and PowerPoint. "I want to work instead of sitting in the house."
At a time of growing unease about the global gap between technology knows and know-nots, India is fast becoming a laboratory for small experiments like the one at the temple that aim to link isolated rural pockets to the borderless world of knowledge. Local governments and nonprofit groups are testing new approaches to provide villages where barely anyone can afford a telephone with computer centers that are accessible to all.
To be sure, these experiments are still small and there are many obstacles. The vast majority of Web sites are in English, a language that more than 95 percent of Indians do not speak. Routine power failures and overloaded telephone lines make connecting to the Internet a frustrating proposition. And there are serious questions about whether countries like India, weighed down by high rates of illiteracy and illness, should spend heavily to provide villages that desperately need schools and health clinics with what most would consider a luxury.
But others say a well-placed computer, like a communal well or an irrigation pump, may become another tool for development.
Information from the computers in this area, where people live in thatched mud huts, has saved the life of a milk cow named Jayalakshmi, prevented the blindness of an old woman named M. Minakshi and routinely warned fishermen of stormy weather that can claim lives.
While Internet cafes have sprung up quickly in even small Indian cities, it is in rural areas, where most people live, that computers must spread if developing nations like India are to close the yawning technology gap with rich countries.
North America, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, has more than half of its Internet users. South Asia -- home to more than a fifth of humanity -- has less than 1 percent, according to the 1999 Human Development Report sponsored by the United Nations Development Program.
But how to make computers available to villagers has led to divergent approaches. Two of the most intriguing efforts are in the former French colony of Pondicherry and in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.
The Pondicherry project was created by the Madras-based M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization that uses science and technology to tackle poverty, with a $120,000 grant from the Canadian government. The foundation provides villages with free technology and information in exchange for the villages' promise to house the computers and staff their operation.
The spread of this approach to more of India's 600,000 villages would ultimately require government money and manpower, with support from nongovernmental organizations and philanthropies.
In contrast, the Madhya Pradesh approach is more entrepreneurial and market-driven. Villages have bought computers with money from their own budgets, then franchised their operation to a local person who charges fees of 10 to 35 cents for government records and other services available at the click of a mouse. The operators, who receive no salary, keep most of the money but give a portion back to the village and state governments.
The story of the cow and the computer is a parable showing that sometimes the simplest information is the most valuable.
Some months back, Subrayan Panjaili, a round-faced woman who cannot read or write, sat in the courtyard of her small home in the village of Kizhur, in Pondicherry, with the family's only milk cow, Jayalakshmi. For five days and nights, the cow moaned while in labor. Something had gone wrong and she was unable to deliver her calf. Mrs. Panjaili grew ever more fearful that the cow would die.
"This is the only good income we have," she said, explaining that the four gallons of milk the cow produced each day paid the bills.
Word of Mrs. Panjaili's woebegone cow soon spread to Govindaswami, a public-spirited farmer who uses one name. The village's computer, obtained through the Swaminathan Foundation, is in the anteroom of his home. The computer is operated full time and for no pay by his 23-year-old, college-educated daughter, Azhalarasi, who used it to call up a list of area veterinarians.
One doctor arrived that night and, by the light of a bare electric bulb, stuck his arm into Jayalakshmi, pulled out the calf's spindly leg and tied a rope to it, then dragged the calf into the world.
The Swaminathan Foundation has sought to give the four villages in its network other practical, highly local information, which is distributed through the village computer network in the local language, Tamil. Generally, that kind of information is not on the World Wide Web.
They distribute the dates that roving medical camps will be set up in various villages. M. Minakshi, 70, who said she felt as if a sari had been draped over her right eye, went to one and discovered that she needed cataract surgery.
Each day, the project's staff also download a map from a United States Navy Web site that shows the wave heights and wind directions in the Bay of Bengal.
On a recent afternoon in the fishing village of Veerampattinam, loudspeakers fixed to tall poles along the broad beach blared out that daily weather report. Bare-chested fishermen in loincloths who were mending nets, repairing homemade wooden boats or just snoozing in the sultry heat perked up to listen.
The four villages taking part in the project are linked to the foundation's hub through an ingenious wireless system. It was dreamed up by V. Balaji, a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur, who oversees the project for the foundation.
While the foundation's model is relatively costly and may prove difficult to replicate on a large scale, the government of Pondicherry nonetheless plans to expand the project to 50 more villages.
One immediate obstacle, as Mr. Balaji notes, is that local bureaucrats have often been reluctant to give up their monopoly on information, which can be a source of power used to extract bribes.
"We're hoping the bureaucrats will become public servants," said M. S. Swaminathan, the internationally known geneticist who leads the foundation.
One such public-minded civil servant is Amit Agarwal, the creator of the model computer project in the state of Madhya Pradesh. It is Mr. Agarwal who has taken power out of the hands of bureaucrats and given it to village entrepreneurs.
Mr. Agarwal, 29, the chief executive of the Dhar district council, said he believed that while low-level bureaucrats might be tempted to demand bribes, an entrepreneur being paid to provide the records retrieved on a computer would be more inclined to work hard.
He has set up a model project in his district, one of India's poorest, where young men have a franchise from the state to distribute daily crop prices and commonly needed state records for a small fee.
Mr. Agarwal predicts that revenue-generating computer projects like his will spread more quickly than those that depend on scarce state funds. "This is the paternalistic welfare model that the country has been slowly discarding over the past decade as not having worked," Mr. Agarwal said.
Since the project was set up in January, 22 villages have each bought a computer, a modem, a printer and a battery for $1,500 with their own money and agreed to provide a small booth to house the setup.
In each case, the state then picked a young person from the village with at least a 10th-grade education to operate the computer and gave him a franchise to sell information from the state's computer network.
For 25 to 35 cents, villagers buy printouts of documents that they might have spent days trying to get from local bureaucrats: land records, caste certificates and proof of income, among others.
For another 25 cents, any citizen can send a complaint to the state by e-mail -- my pension didn't arrive, my child's teacher didn't show up, my village hand pump doesn't work -- and the state guarantees a reply within a week.
And for 10 cents, a farmer can get a printout listing the prices of any agricultural commodity sold at surrounding markets.
At Bagdi village, wizened, sun-beaten farmers filed in to collect the day's price lists for wheat, garlic and whatever other crops they had to sell. They all said their knowledge of the rates improved their negotiating leverage with middlemen.
"If the price he offers suits me, I'll sell it to him," said Satya Narayan Khati, who grows wheat on his three acres. "Otherwise, I'll take it to market myself."
In Bagdi, the computer booth is operated by Deepak Patel, 20, a gaunt, lanky son of a farmer. Mr. Patel still helps milk the cows and bring in the harvest, but he prefers his computers. After just a few months, he is already making a good living from the long hours he spends selling printouts.
When people come in to e-mail a complaint to the state, Mr. Patel writes out their grievances for them, since most residents of the district are illiterate.
In his booth, as in every computer center visited in Madhya Pradesh and Pondicherry, children crowd in, clamoring for a chance to play on this machine that their elders call a magic box.
"It's better than farming," Mr. Patel said. "Through this you feel connected to the rest of the world."

HEADLINE: Holiday Motorists Face Soaring Prices at Pump

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 27

 BODY:
By now, most of Eddie Slack's customers are accustomed to paying $30 or more to fill their gas tanks. "The big sticker shock was several months ago," said Mr. Slack, owner of the Delwood Chevron service station in Austin, Tex.
After falling a good bit following a decision by the petroleum-exporting countries in March to increase oil production, gasoline prices have soared to the highest levels of the year in many parts of the nation. 
 Drivers now filling up are paying record prices for the Memorial Day weekend. And analysts say tight supplies, particularly in the Midwest, could push prices higher as demand increases with the beginning of the summer driving season and as parts of the country struggle to meet a June 1 deadline for using a cleaner-burning reformulated fuel as required by the federal government.
The average national price for regular unleaded is $1.53 a gallon, the same level reached in March and almost 40 cents higher than last year, federal officials said. In New York City, drivers are paying $1.64 a gallon, compared with $1.27 last year, according to AAA, the automobile association.
Adjusted for inflation, of course, gasoline is still cheap, even with the sharp rise of the last year. The 30 cents a gallon that Americans paid in the early 1960's translates to about $1.75 today, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. And the $1.25 a gallon that drivers paid in the early 1980's is equivalent to $2.50 today.
In April, prices around the country fell almost a dime a gallon, on average, after OPEC ministers voted in late March to increase production. But the decline turned out to be short-lived, as drivers everywhere learned this week when they gassed up for the holiday weekend.
"It costs so much that I don't even fill up the tank anymore," Tadd Balfour, a 25-year-old computer network engineer, said as he added $10 worth of gas to the 20-gallon tank of his Montero sport utility vehicle at Mr. Slack's station on Friday. Mr. Balfour, who commutes more than 20 miles each day, says he has considered buying a smaller car. "If gas goes up another couple of points, I may have to make a change," he said. "But I'm closely watching what prices do. Right now, it's out of control.".
Mr. Balfour and other customers at Mr. Slack's small but busy service station on Interstate 35 near downtown Austin paid $1.41 a gallon for regular gasoline this week, $1.52 for midgrade and $1.61 for premium. That is less than in most other parts of the country, but that did not stop customers from complaining about recent increases. "They were really hollering," Mr. Slack said.
Despite the high prices, holiday driving is expected to eclipse last year's rates. AAA said it expected more than 34 million Americans to travel at least 100 miles from their homes over the weekend, 3 percent more than last year and 31 percent more than during the 1991 Memorial Day weekend.
Much of the blame for the recent price increase lies with the low inventories of gasoline around the country, a factor that played a big role in high prices earlier this year. But the latest run-up has been accelerated by the scramble to introduce a new reformulated fuel in most large metropolitan areas. Prices have also moved higher because of worries that a legal dispute involving the Unocal Corporation's patents for certain reformulated gas is holding back production at some refineries.
The cleaner-burning fuel is being sold in the Boston-to-Washington corridor, including much of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as in much of California and in Chicago, Milwaukee, Houston and Dallas. Worries over tight supplies of the fuel have been particularly acute in the Midwest, where prices are soaring. In Chicago, for example, drivers are paying an average of $1.85 for regular unleaded, up 30 cents in the last month and more than 60 cents over last year, according to AAA. Some of the city's service stations have already raised prices above $2.00 a gallon. Milwaukee drivers are paying $1.74 a gallon.
State lawmakers in Wisconsin have authorized the filing of a lawsuit to block adoption of the new fuel rules there. And in St. Louis, officials won a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency allowing use of the old gas until June 5.
Late Friday, the E.P.A. denied requests from both Chicago and Milwaukee for waivers there. The agency said there was enough of the reformulated fuel to make waivers unnecessary.
The reformulated fuel is harder to blend, and Midwest refiners are unlikely to be able to increase production soon, said Philip K. Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. Absent an E.P.A. waiver, gas prices in Chicago and Milwaukee could go much higher, even well above $2 a gallon, before the situation stabilizes, Mr. Verleger said. "There's no real way out of it for the next three or four weeks," he said.
On top of pressure to meet the new fuel requirements, inventories are low even for regular gasoline, and that leaves the nation exposed to price spikes, said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Stocks are so low, he said, that "any change in supply will reverberate in the markets right away -- there isn't much of a normal cushion."
Concerns about a shortage of reformulated fuel helped push gasoline futures to $1.026 a gallon on Friday, their highest level since the Persian Gulf war, before settling back a few cents in the shortened preholiday trading session at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil futures closed at $30 a barrel, only a few dollars short of the high for the year and at the top end of a trading band in which OPEC ministers want crude to remain. Should oil prices stay at these levels, or rise, analysts say the cartel could act to increase production once more.
Oil prices have more than doubled since early last year. OPEC decided in March 1999 to cut back production, and cartel members largely adhered to the new limits on output, which, combined with stronger demand from Asia, caused prices to soar.
At Mr. Slack's service station, Edward Wyndham, a 64-year-old carpenter and part-time minister, remembers when gas stations gave away glassware to attract customers. Now he says he and his friends just seek the cheapest prices.
"It's outrageous, what they've done," Mr. Wyndham said as he finished putting gas in his pickup truck. "It's the poor people who are suffering. I'm mad about it."

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
This 30-second commercial, titled "Wall Street," was released by the Camden County Democratic Committee, which has endorsed former Gov. Jim Florio in his bid for the Democratic Senate nomination in New Jersey against Jon S. Corzine. It is a classic "soft money" ad, in that it does not explicitly advocate voting for or against anyone. The commercial began running on Wednesday on television stations in New York City.
 
PRODUCER -- Murphy Putnam Media. 

ON THE SCREEN -- New York's financial district -- introduced with the caption "Greed is good" -- is made to look as sinister and intimidating as possible. Photographed looking up from street level, through a blue filter, the New York Stock Exchange and other imposing Wall Street buildings roll by. An unflattering photo of a squinting Mr. Corzine takes up one corner of the frame, as printed warnings sidle across the screen: "$250 Million Penalty for Raiding Pension Funds." "Supports Republican Plan to Privatize Social Security." "Good for Goldman Sachs, Bad for Seniors." The commercial ends with the admonition to "Tell Jon Corzine to Leave Our Retirement Funds Alone," along with the phone number of Mr. Corzine's campaign headquarters.
 
THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: "Wall Street. A place where some say greed is good. A place Jon Corzine feels right at home. When he was chairman of Goldman Sachs, the firm paid a $250 million penalty for raiding employee pension funds. Now, Jon Corzine supports the Republican plan to privatize Social Security. Good for Goldman Sachs. Bad for seniors. Raiding pensions and privatizing Social Security. Tell Jon Corzine to leave our retirement funds alone."
 
ACCURACY -- As Mr. Florio has done less artfully in his own ads, this commercial flatly misrepresents Mr. Corzine's position on Social Security. In fact, it brazenly cites as a source a Business Week article that actually makes clear Mr. Corzine's opposition to individual investment accounts, the heart of the Republican plan. Goldman Sachs did pay $253 million in 1995 to settle charges that it had conspired with Robert Maxwell, the British publishing magnate, to defraud pensioners of hundreds of millions of dollars. It is debatable whether a settlement of a lawsuit, under which Goldman did not admit wrongdoing, amounts to a "penalty."
 
SCORECARD -- Mr. Florio's campaign, which began running $900,000 worth of commercials on Wednesday, is now essentially out of money, and the former governor's friends in Camden County, his political base, have done him a tremendous favor by buying $500,000 in television time to run this commercial. Conveniently, because it does not explicitly urge voters to back Mr. Florio or reject Mr. Corzine, the ad can be paid for with soft money, which has much larger individual contribution limits. The ad is arguably more effective than any of Mr. Corzine's attack ads and is as polished as his positive ones. It manages to paint Mr. Corzine as a pension robber out to cheat the elderly, and a New Yorker running for office in New Jersey -- all in an economical half-minute. DAVID M. HALBFINGER

HEADLINE: The Fresh Air Fund;
Lessons for Life (Nachos, Too) at Weekend Camp

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
About 15 minutes after a group of a dozen teenagers began cooking the vegetables and meat for a heaping plate of nachos, a dispute arose.
On one side was Daniel Mercado, 17, a Bronx resident who is in the culinary arts program of Park West High School in Manhattan. He wanted to fry the onions, mix them in with the beef and put the melted cheese on the side. On the other hand, his fellow chefs noted that the directions called for raw, diced onions to be sprinkled on top and for the cheese to be melted directly onto the tortillas. 
 "I prefer to keep the chip dry -- you take the chip and dip it in the bowl," Daniel said in a way that indicated he knew his nachos. "If you melt the cheese on the chips, the chips will be moist."
The teenagers were engaged in an exercise in food preparation and teamwork that was part of a weekend retreat at Camp Mariah in Fishkill, N.Y. The camp is one of five run by The Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides free summer vacations in the country to economically disadvantaged children from New York City.
Darcel Serapio, 17, of the East New York section of Brooklyn, a cheese-on-top proponent, reminded Daniel that the group was being judged according to a 19-point list of instructions, one of which was to carefully follow the recipe. "It says: 'Follow each step in the recipe,' " she said, holding a printout from the Food.com Web site that contained the recipe.
"We're a group; we can change the rules if we decide," Daniel countered.
While the group debated, groups of teenagers elsewhere at the camp learned about balancing a checkbook, keeping credit card debt from skyrocketing and budgeting a household's resources.
All the teenagers are members of the PreOccupations Club, a program for teenagers who have attended Camp Mariah. The camp prepares boys and girls 12 to 14 for work and careers by helping them set educational goals and get a summer job.
"Having some experience in the summer is a great indicator of future career success," said Miriam Seidenfeld, the director of Camp Mariah and the PreOccupations Club program. "And when you have a summer job, you get paid. The rewards are not so far in the future -- they're very here and now, which is important for that age group."
There are 56 high school students in the PreOccupations Club this year. They meet once a month at the Fresh Air Fund's office in Midtown and two weekends during the school year to continue the training and friendships that began at Camp Mariah.
"I really like the camp," said Dionne Letts, a 15-year-old from the Bronx who attended Camp Mariah for three years and decided to continue on to the PreOccupations Club this year. "It helps you to accomplish your goals and keeps you focused and stable."
While the students learn how to fill out a job application and how to impress an employer during an interview, the club also helps them build and maintain confidence.
"We remind them that they have problem-solving skills, they have communications skills," Ms. Seidenfeld said. "They don't need to be scared when they first go to a job."
One thing the former campers learn is how to resolve conflicts.
"We want them to look at not just your favorite person's point of view or your own point of view, but anyone's point of view," Ms. Seidenfeld said. "We teach them how to compromise or find alternative, creative solutions, to speak through problems, and how to handle them by deciding what you'll accept or be able to live with."
The group in the kitchen eventually chose to saute the onions and melt the cheese directly onto the nachos. Though they departed slightly from the instructions, they received a stellar review from the volunteer judge, Hortense Noble, vice president for global corporate events at Credit Suisse First Boston.
"In the end, they all learned to work together and to resolve the conflict that comes from within the group," she said. "They're going to encounter a lot of that when they start working."
Families wishing to inquire about registering children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the fund can send a check to: The Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.

HEADLINE: After 40 Years, Israel May Be Losing Its Outsider Status at U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
After decades of exclusion from all regional groups in the United Nations, Israel has been accepted on a temporary basis by the Western Europeans, ending its virtual disenfranchisement in the organization.
Israel's ambassador to the United Nations called the long-sought invitation, issued on Friday, a turning point in his country's relations with the organization, where a voting bloc of Arab and third world nations has perennially attacked and isolated the Israelis in the General Assembly and other bodies. 
 Only two nations, Israel and Estonia, have never belonged to one of the regional groups, formed 40 years ago to decide on candidates for many council and committee positions at the United Nations and its agencies and programs around the world.
Estonia chose not to join the Eastern European group, holding out for membership in the Western European caucus, which also includes Australia, New Zealand, Canada and sometimes the United States. But Israel has been barred by Arab and other opposition from the Asian group, covering all nations from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean to the Pacific. Membership in the Asian group is still Israel's goal, diplomats say.
The United States has been lobbying hard over the last year to get Israel into the Western Europe group. The decision was bumped from one level to another in the 15-member European Union for months before the Netherlands, which now holds the rotating chairmanship of the group at the United Nations, pressed for closure.
On Wednesday, American diplomats said, the Dutch ambassador to the United Nations, Peter van Walsum, circulated a letter to the group's members saying that if there were no objections raised by Friday, Israel would be invited to join the group, under certain conditions.
One is that temporary membership will be extended initially for only four years, after which Israel's relationship with the group would be reviewed. Israel would also have to forgo seeking elected positions for two years. American officials say intense competition for contested posts was a major factor in keeping Israel out of the Western European group. Other positions in the United Nations system will be closed to Israel for longer periods because of past agreements. Israel must formally accept the limited invitation.
There are five regional groups at the United Nations -- Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Western Hemisphere, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.

U.N. Patrols Border
 
FATIMA GATE, Lebanon, May 27 (Reuters) -- United Nations peacekeepers patrolled this border flash point between Israel and Lebanon today and pushed back Lebanese civilians trying to taunt Israeli soldiers across barbed wire.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon sent four armored troop carriers and dozens of peacekeepers to Fatima Gate, the scene of daily gatherings by Lebanese since Israel pulled out of southern Lebanon this week. Hezbollah guerrillas moved into the border zone after Israeli forces withdrew.
Today, the peacekeepers turned back Lebanese who were heading to the fence to jeer Israeli soldiers and wave Hezbollah flags at them.

HEADLINE: A Commencement For a Classmate Beloved by Many

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., May 25

 BODY:
Instead of caps and gowns, the graduates wore basketball and soccer jerseys. Instead of "Pomp and Circumstance," the crowd swayed to "Stand by Me." And instead of conferring 1,000 degrees, Brown University presented only one today, to Casey Shearer, a beloved member of the senior class who died less than a week before he was to graduate.
Mr. Shearer, 21, suffered a sudden shutdown of his heart, brought on by an undetected viral infection, after a basketball game with friends on May 19, his family said. He never regained consciousness and died four days later. 
 His classmates, determined that Mr. Shearer should still graduate with plenty of fanfare, organized this commencement four days before their own, which is Monday.
There were as many laughs as tears at the gathering, as friends and family praised Mr. Shearer's quick smile, poked fun at his penchant for giving everyone a nickname (his was "Case," or "Case Dog"), and maligned his mediocre jump shot.
Despite his magna cum laude degree in economics, Mr. Shearer was remembered foremost as a sports lover who covered games for Brown Student Radio and wrote a sports column for The College Hill Independent, a weekly college newspaper.
His father, Derek N. Shearer, a longtime friend and economic adviser to President Clinton, said he was amazed by the 80 friends who kept vigil at the hospital while his son was in a coma. He said the service typified all the things his son loved about Brown.
"He chose Brown because it was his sense that this was the most friendly and diverse mix of kids," said Mr. Shearer, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Scholars Center in Washington.
Casey Shearer's network of friends stretched from Providence to southern California, where he grew up, to Finland, where he attended high school while his father was ambassador. Through his father, he made friends in the White House, as evidenced by Mr. Clinton's attendance at the service.
His arm around the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president recounted how Mr. Shearer had tried to tutor him in rap music before an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show" in 1992.
But politics was not in his game plan. Nearing graduation, he had already mailed out tapes of his broadcasts of Brown games, in hopes of landing a broadcasting job.
Politics did not seem to matter much to his friends, either, who remembered him more for his ability to memorize the statistics of every Brown athlete and his inability to eat his usual morning bowl of Cheerios without dribbling milk down his chin.
"Those of you who belong with Casey to the Class of 2000 will know that he marches by your side on Monday," said Sheila E. Blumstein, the interim president of Brown. "You will hear his laugh and see his smile."

HEADLINE: Behind Success Of Tour Buses, Troubled Trail

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS and JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
It seemed an almost comic gamble, bringing red double-decker buses from Britain and setting them loose on New York.
Not only was the man behind the idea, Harry Grant, a New Jersey developer, in bankruptcy proceedings, but New York in 1991 was saddled with a staggering crime rate and a sour economy. Times Square, where the buses were to pick up passengers, was a haven for vagrants and sleaze. 
 Mr. Grant's leap across the Hudson River turned serendipitous. Crime rates fell. The economic downturn reversed itself. Times Square was transformed from grit to gaudy commercialism. As more tourists came to the city, the company, New York Apple Tours, prospered, growing from two used buses to an operation with $10 million in annual income.
But as tourists flocked to the used British buses, so did city, state and federal regulators. The company amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for falsifying records and sidestepping inspectors, and drew the ire of neighborhood groups and politicians.
No matter how intense the scrutiny, though, the company survived, even thrived, until last Monday, when a bus operated by a driver who the police said did not have a proper license turned onto a crosswalk at West 45th Street and fatally struck Randolph Walker, 71.
By week's end, Apple Tours was in the fight of its life in an administrative hearing at the City Department of Consumer Affairs, facing a city effort to immediately suspend its license. Susan Kassapian, a department lawyer, contended that the company had shed even the veneer of decency and accumulated a list of civil and criminal violations that was remarkable for its scope and scale.
Company officials have strenuously objected to the hearing, calling it a naked violation of due process. "What they're doing to us here is completely unacceptable," said Hayim Grant, the company's president and Harry Grant's son.
But hearing the city's case, critics were left to wonder how a company of that description could have survived for so many years in the law-and-order climate established by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"I've never seen a company flagrantly violate the law on this scale," said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a watchdog group. "How much evidence do they need?"
Lawyers and business associates offer a two-word answer as one possible explanation for the bus company's resilience: Hurricane Harry, the nickname given to the company's patriarch and organizing force.
They say Apple Tours is a company made in Mr. Grant's image, and that Hurricane Harry is a man undeterred by adversity, even embarrassment.
Mr. Grant, who immigrated from Israel to the United States with his wife and three children in 1975, penetrated New Jersey's construction industry and was a quick success, so quick that after building upscale houses in Bergen County, he began proposing projects of an enormous scale.
Harry Grant said he would build the tallest building in the world, a 121-story office tower in Newark. He never did. He proposed digging a tunnel from Bergen County to the Bronx. It never happened. He said he would open the Newark Renaissance Mall. All that remains of that venture is an uncompleted shell.
In 1990, a bank started foreclosure proceedings on two of Mr. Grant's properties, saying his companies had defaulted on loans in excess of $17.5 million. The federal Environmental Protection Agency was pursuing another of his companies for 119 violations of the Clean Air Act stemming from the illegal demolition of asbestos-laden buildings in Hoboken, N.J. The case eventually resulted in a $60,000 fine.
That summer, under pressure from banks and regulators, Mr. Grant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for at least four of the companies under his control. But he insisted he was not done. In bankruptcy court, he promised he would recover within three years.
His resurrection came through Apple Tours.
Walter F. Timpone, one of his lawyers, said the idea for the company came to Mr. Grant when he saw double-deckers on a trip to London.
In August 1991, New York Apple Tours was incorporated. Mr. Grant built the company in his vision of salting the city with stops, giving riders the chance to hop off one bus and, whenever they wished, board another.
"This opened it up to tourists and let people see places around their city at their leisure," Mr. Timpone said. "It was, and is, fantastically successful."
Lawyers and business associates say that if Harry Grant was stung by his long run of setbacks in New Jersey, he did not show it. He was driven, they say, and resourceful. No job was beneath him. He turned wrenches in the motor yard. At times he flew to London and returned with luggage crammed with spare parts.
Lee Gelber, who was with the company in 1993 and is now manager of tour services for a rival, Gray Line, recalled Mr. Grant's work ethic: "Harry would do everything. He'd be up to his elbows in grease."
Under Mr. Grant's leadership, the business flourished, growing from a fleet of 2 double-deckers to 63 today, according to state records and the company's office. Mike Alvich, vice president of marketing and development, said that as the company grew, it provided a public service.
"We've helped the city in a number of ways," he said. "Tourism is a big part of the New York City economy, and we think that we've contributed to the growth of that."
But as the company grew, it attracted doubters, then enemies, who said its problems were pervasive, affecting all aspects of the business, from environmental compliance and public safety to record-keeping and customer service.
Apple Tours also angered residents and community leaders, many of whom said it illegally took empty buses down residential streets, made curb-side stops in unauthorized places, idled buses under apartment houses, irritated residents with diesel smoke and routinely double-parked, clogging byways already inundated with traffic.
In 1995, residents from West 22nd Street protested the company after discovering that it was using a rented parking area as a repair yard without proper permits. Under pressure from the city, the company moved its repair operations to Long Island City, Queens.
Tom Kirkland, who lives on West 22nd, said neighbors concluded that Mr. Grant and Apple Tours deliberately played outside the rules. "He didn't do anything by the book," he said. "The idea was to do it his way. Do it as long as he could. Do it until he gets chased out of the neighborhood."
In August 1995, the Department of Consumer Affairs accused the company of switching licenses on 43 occasions, apparently in an effort to use buses that had not passed state safety inspections or might not be insured. The entire fleet was temporarily taken off the streets. A settlement agreement required that the company pay a $100,000 fine and, among other things, remove Harry Grant as an officer in the company.
Friends and lawyers say that although Harry Grant may have severed his formal ties with the company, he has remained a presence.
"He's very much involved," said Frank Lucianna, one of Mr. Grant's lawyers and friends. "He's the guiding light."
Harry Grant, who lives in Alpine, N.J., did not return three phone calls last week. In an interview Friday, Hayim Grant declined to comment on his father's role in the company, except to say that the company had grown more responsible since 1995.
"Our record is very good," he said. "The company has really developed into a mature, professionally run, deep-management company. It's not a fly-by-night operator."
Whatever that role, Harry Grant's troubles, and the company's, did not stop after his removal as vice president. During the late 1990's, new problems mounted.
In 1998, an inspection team audited the company's compliance with a state law that mandates driver fitness and training and found more than 200 discrepancies, according to testimony on Thursday from Thomas Fullington, an assistant director of the State Department of Motor Vehicles. Apple Tours was fined $6,500, Mr. Fullington said.
Mr. Fullington also said the department was investigating Apple Tours again. According to his testimony, its initial review found similar problems, including an absence of documentation for driver training and medical exams.
Also in 1998, Harry Grant was indicted on charges of first-degree sexual abuse, accused of attacking a female employee at the company's bus yard in Queens. He pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and was sentenced to counseling and one year of probation, a law enforcement official said.
And in December of that year, a group of employees filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, claiming it had failed to pay overtime to as many as 700 workers from 1992 to 1998. The suit is in settlement negotiations, said Adam T. Klein, a lawyer for the employees.
By this time, inspectors from the State Department of Transportation began noting that the company's fleet had safety problems. In a series of inspections in 1998 and 1999, Apple Tours buses failed 42.5 percent of the time, according to state data. The state sets an inspection failure goal of less than 10 percent.
The state's data also show that the company's most frequent violations were in the most serious category, including deficient brake systems, steering or suspension components and emergency exits. Subsequent inspections have found that the company's inspection failure rate is improving, to 24.5 percent, but that is still two and a half times the state's compliance goal.
Hayim Grant said the failures did not affect safety or the accident last Monday. "There's no bus that's on the road operated by us that has not passed New York State Department of Transportation standards," he said. "Our safety record is excellent. This is the first serious injury that we've ever had."
But Judy Shotwell, vice president of the Midtown North Precinct Council, a neighborhood organization that works with the Police Department, said that for a long time, she and others also thought that it would take a pedestrian fatality to force the city into the current fight. "We all knew it," she said. "It was going to take a catastrophe."
In fact, it was a federal case that set in motion the city's efforts to close the company. Last week's fatality merely accelerated the action.
Last fall, Apple Tours pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in New Jersey to falsifying documents submitted to three federal agencies to avoid meeting federal safety and environmental standards on 70 buses it imported from 1991 to 1995.
By admitting to a sustained deception, city officials said, Apple Tours gave the Department of Consumer Affairs the evidence it needed to try to revoke the company's licenses. "They were convicted of a crime of essentially dishonesty," Mr. Giuliani said, adding that the evidence allowed "the extraordinary step of trying to remove their license for reasons that would usually be considered beyond the Department of Consumer Affairs."
With the death last week, the city filed an emergency motion asking Administrative Law Judge Judith Gould to suspend the company's license immediately, pending the outcome of the case. And as Judge Gould was beginning her hearings, the company faced another action.
On Thursday, the board of NYC & Company, the city's tourism agency, voted unanimously to terminate the membership of New York Apple Tours. Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, the agency's president, said the board had acted with knowledge of the pattern of problems, but had based its vote primarily on letters from disgruntled tourists.
"The complaints against this company exceed those against any of our other members," she said.
With the licensing fight still undecided, Hayim Grant remained resolute as the hearing ended on Friday. The tourists were pouring into the city for Memorial Day weekend. And though Hayim Grant said the police were cracking down on its buses, the company that Hurricane Harry founded was still in the fight.
"We're not looking to hurt this city," Hayim Grant said. "We love this city. We show it to thousands of people."

Map: "A Bus Line's Collision Course"
The red double-decker buses of New York Apple Tours have crisscrossed Manhattan since 1991. Part of their popularity stemmed from the company's network of stops -- some authorized by the city and others not -- that give riders the chance to tour at their own pace, hopping off one bus and boarding another. The sites of accidents involving the buses that were reported to the police from 1996 to 1999 freckle a map of Manhattan. They are clustered in Midtown, where on Monday, an Apple Tours bus operated by a driver who the police said did not have a proper license turned onto a crosswalk at West 45th Street and fatally struck a pedestrian.

HEADLINE: RISK OF ARMS RACE SEEN IN U.S. DESIGN OF MISSILE DEFENSE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
As President Clinton nears a decision on whether to build a limited national missile defense, American intelligence officials are warning that such a system could set off a cold-war-style arms race between China, India and Pakistan, administration officials say.
While the American officials have repeatedly said an antimissile defense is not aimed at Beijing, even they acknowledge that the system being designed could significantly undercut or even neutralize China's small nuclear force. 
 That could lead China to add to its nuclear arsenal. And if China built up its force, its regional rival India could do the same, as could India's rival Pakistan, heightening tensions along the world's newest nuclear frontier.
Such a scenario, which officials are expected to outline for Mr. Clinton in an official intelligence estimate due in June, has raised questions about the administration's own efforts to try to slow the spread of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles needed to launch them.
"If China increases the number of missiles it has, would India think it has to increase its missiles?" said a senior United States official familiar with the analysis being prepared. "And if India increases its missiles, then Pakistan does."
President Clinton has said he plans to decide later this year whether to proceed with a missile defense based on four criteria: the missile threat, technological viability of the program, the effect on arms control and cost. The response from China and Russia is an important factor in Mr. Clinton's decision.
While newly disclosed defense documents indicate that the Pentagon was researching ways in the mid-1990's to counter a limited Chinese missile attack, defense officials say that is no longer the American policy. The system under consideration, they insist, is intended to counter relatively small, unsophisticated missile threats from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, says Beijing's concerns may be eased not only by reassurances about the intent of the system but by general progress in economic and political relations.
"There are other dimensions to the relationship with the Chinese that are of far more long-term importance than national missile defense," Mr. Berger said in an interview.
The administration has expended enormous diplomatic energy -- unsuccessfully so far -- trying to persuade the Russians that a missile defense system would not threaten its much larger strategic forces. It has made even less headway with the Chinese.
There are several reasons why. Unlike Russia, which still maintains a force of more than 5,000 warheads from the cold war, China has deployed a minimal nuclear force, primarily 18 single-warhead land-based CSS-4 missiles.
The argument that the Clinton administration has used with the Russians -- that a limited missile defense is not a threat because it could be easily swamped by an overwhelming Russian missile attack -- does not apply to the Chinese.
China's old liquid-fueled CSS-4 missiles are kept on low alert with the warheads stored separately from the missiles. China also has 12 missiles on a submarine that rarely strays far from its port, from which it cannot reach the United States. And China seems convinced that the system would come closer to neutralizing its current nuclear force than has been publicly acknowledged.
"We don't deny to the Chinese that the system has some capability against Chinese missiles, but that is not what it is designed to do," said the under secretary of defense for policy, Walter B. Slocombe, said in an interview.
Another factor is China's apprehensions about the future course of relations with Washington.
American defense officials make plans according to a rival's perceived capabilities, not its intent. The Chinese make the same point, and complain that despite the assurances of the Clinton administration, they cannot be certain that a future administration would not use a missile defense against it, especially since China has often been cast as a threat by conservative Republicans.
A Clinton administration official said: "The Chinese tell us, 'You may not be directing the system against us, but what about the next guy? How can we be confident that the next administration may not have a different policy? It could use the system against us, just as it does against North Korea.' "
The Chinese also fear that the United States could adjust and expand a limited defense, which in its first phase will consist of a battle-management radar site in Alaska and 100 interceptors. And George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has said the United States would develop a far more ambitious defensive system if he is elected president.
Another reason for the Chinese suspicions is that the Pentagon has previously worked on defensive systems to counter the Chinese arsenal.
During the Bush administration, the Pentagon instructed the TRW Corporation, an American military contractor, to develop ground-based interceptors that would stop "limited attacks by China" using CSS-4 missiles, according to a 1993 document prepared by the United States Army.
The Pentagon insists that countering China is no longer a goal, and its Ballistic Missile Defense Organization declined to say whether it is still studying ways to intercept Chinese warheads.
But defense officials acknowledge that the planning documents are constantly updated with the latest science and intelligence estimates of ballistic missiles.
Beyond a direct threat from China, there are other reasons why the Pentagon might want to develop the means to thwart its missile systems. American intelligence officials cautioned in a 1999 analysis that Russia and China might sell countermeasures like decoy warheads to developing nations the United States wants to defend against.
The Pentagon's missile-defense organization has also acknowledged that the new American defense would have the "residual capability" to defend against the "unauthorized launch by an established nuclear power of a few missiles with simple countermeasures," a definition that includes the Chinese.
"The system has to be able to respond to more than just North Korea," a defense industry official said.
Seeking to ease China's concerns, the Clinton administration has argued that while an antimissile system may be effective against China's current arsenal, it would be less so against the updated arsenal China has long planned to build.
Even before the Clinton administration began seriously considering antimissile defenses, the Chinese were planning to deploy a solid-fueled land-based missile of intercontinental range that could be moved around on a truck, as well as a new submarine-launched missile.
American intelligence officials project that the Chinese will have "several tens" of new and old missiles that can reach the United States by 2015 under Beijing's current modernization plan.
A missile defense, then, would have little effect on the Chinese strategic modernization, Pentagon officials assert. China, they add, is more anxious about the provision of antimissile technology to Taiwan than it is about a defense to protect the United States.
Despite these arguments, however, Pentagon officials acknowledge that they know very little about the missiles, warheads and countermeasures the Chinese plan to deploy.
"We assume the Chinese plan to modernize their force," a senior Pentagon official said. "It's impossible to say how much it would be affected by a national missile defense of the kind we're talking about."
Some senior intelligence experts nonetheless believe that a missile defense will prompt the Chinese to build up their strategic force beyond what they had previously planned, in order to ensure that it remains viable.
Such a response by China would be consistent with orthodox arms control theory, which holds that the construction of a missile defense prompts an adversary to build more missiles in the hope that at least some can get through the defense.
The American intelligence community's assessment will be contained in a new official intelligence report on the responses of foreign governments to a United States missile defense. The White House asked in December that the report be prepared so that Mr. Clinton could consider it in making his decision on a missile defense. Officials caution that the estimate is still being prepared.
"We would expect them to continue and perhaps even enhance countermeasures," a senior United States official said. "We have projected that they will have several tens of missiles by 2015. National Missile Defense might prompt them to do more than that."
"That would be likely," the senior official added.
One way for the Chinese to extend their build-up would be to add new warheads to their old 18 CSS-4, transforming them from single-warhead missiles into four-warhead missiles. They might also double the size of their projected land-based mobile missiles.
As a result, the Chinese could have more than 100 warheads by 2015, which is more than the 100 interceptors the United States plans to deploy in the first phase of its missile defense. The Chinese, the administration official said, might even deploy more than 200 warheads if the United States continues to expand its missile shield.
China's expanded force of nuclear-tipped long-range missiles might not be directed at India, they say. But it would be a capability that the Indians could not ignore, and as a result India might build up the short-range missiles it used to defend against China.
Administration officials are divided over whether India would respond in such a way, but the emerging analysis has dramatically raised the stakes.
Seeking to balance its concerns over stability in South Asia with its interest in missile defense, the Clinton administration is likely to redouble its negotiating efforts with the Chinese and perhaps even explore new forms of arms control with Beijing. By all accounts, however, Washington has a difficult job ahead.
"The basic point we have made is that a missile system is not aimed at them, that we are comfortable with deterrent relationship with China," a senior Clinton administration official said. "But we have not been able to overcome their suspicions."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Martinez's Spirit Is Very Special, Too

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In the first week of November 1993, general managers were meeting in Naples, Fla., and the Yankees' general manager, Gene Michael, was there in quest of a starting pitcher. Among others, Michael had an eye on a young right-hander employed by the Los Angeles Dodgers.
"Gene Michael was one of the guys most interested in Pedro," recalled Fred Claire, who was then the Dodgers' general manager. "He really was the only one who was inquiring. He had a great interest. I said: 'Gene, I don't want to talk to you about who you might offer. I'm not going to trade him. He's a great young man and has a great upside.' " 
 No pitcher ever had a greater upside than Pedro Martinez, the dominating pitcher who is scheduled to start for the Boston Red Sox against the Yankees tonight. Had Michael been successful in prying Martinez from the Dodgers, he could have been pitching for the Yankees.
As the Dodgers' plans developed, they did trade Martinez, less than three weeks after Michael expressed his serious interest. They traded him to the Montreal Expos because the Expos offered them a second baseman, Delino DeShields. Jody Reed, who had been Los Angeles's second baseman in 1993 and had become a free agent, rejected an offer he shouldn't have refused. To his great regret, Reed said no to a three-year, $7.8 million contract and later had to accept a contract with Milwaukee for $350,000 for one year. As much as Reed's decision hurt him economically, it hurt the Dodgers competitively.
"Looking back, it turned out to be a terrible deal for us," Claire said. Had they not needed a second baseman, he added, he would, as he told Michael, not have traded Martinez. But even given that need, Claire said: "What I didn't put enough weight on was the spirit of Pedro. I recognized it but didn't put a high enough value on it. This young man has something that few people I encounter has and I should have recognized that."
Dan Duquette, the general manager who acquired Martinez for the Expos, left Montreal about two months later and became the Boston general manager. He reluctantly left Martinez behind but was intent on getting him again. He did, four years to the day after he obtained him from Los Angeles.
"Pedro has always been my favorite player," Duquette said, "because of his unique skills and his personality and his competitiveness. We are so lucky to have him. We owe a great debt to the Expo organization. He was a gift to the franchise."
Jim Beattie, Duquette's successor in Montreal, didn't want to trade Martinez, but explained why he did.
"We probably could have paid him," Beattie said, "but he wasn't going to sign with us until we did other things to show we were going to be competitive. We couldn't afford to do those other things. We couldn't convince him, so we felt the best thing to do was move him before he became a free agent."
Boston won the arm of the right-hander by offering Carl Pavano, a good young pitcher, and Tony Armas Jr., a minor league pitcher they had received from the Yankees for Mike Stanley three months earlier.
"A couple clubs turned us down when we asked for their players," Beattie said. "I'm sure some of those organizations look at it now and say, 'How could we say no?' "
The Yankees wouldn't trade Eric Milton for Martinez (they sent him to Minnesota for Chuck Knoblauch less than three months later). Cleveland declined to give up Bartolo Colon, who is in their starting rotation now.
Beattie can still feel the pain from trading Martinez. "I definitely would have loved to have kept him," he said. "He's got quality pitches, he's a great competitor, he's an intelligent player and he works hard."
Duquette credited Martinez with turning the Red Sox into a legitimate contender. The Red Sox have reached the postseason in each of the pitcher's first two seasons with them and appear to be headed there again this year.
Martinez, who has won the Cy Young award in each league, gained a permanent spot in postseason lore last October by pitching six hitless innings of relief against Cleveland in the fifth and deciding game of their division series. He followed that remarkable performance by holding the Yankees to two hits in seven innings after the Yankees had won the first two games of the league championship series. The Yankees, however, won the next two games, assuring that they wouldn't see Martinez in Game 7.
"That was a situation we certainly wanted to do everything we could to avoid," David Cone said. "I don't think any team in baseball would want that scenario."
Martinez's playoff performance wasn't even his best against the Yankees last year. In September he struck out 17 and allowed just 1 hit, a home run by Chili Davis. That gave him a two-start record of 29 strikeouts and 3 hits allowed in 16 innings.
"He could've won without any fielders behind him that night," Paul O'Neill said of the September game.
Martinez enters tonight's game with the lowest earned run average (1.19) and the lowest opponents' batting average (.167) in the major leagues. Last season he had the majors' lowest e.r.a. and was three points away from having the lowest batting average against.
"I don't know what Sandy Koufax was like during his incredible five-year run that everyone talks about," Cone said, "but Pedro's having that type of run, maybe even better. He's having arguably one of the best runs of all time. One year, two year, three year."
Jason Giambi of Oakland, one of this season's most productive hitters, called Martinez's pitches "electric." Larry Rothschild, the Tampa Bay manager and a former pitcher and pitching coach, said Martinez's fastball, curve and changeup are outstanding individually and collectively.
"In an at-bat against him," Giambi said, "you get one pitch to hit and if you don't hit it, you're heading back to the dugout." Yet Giambi said that he likes to face Martinez. "It's such a challenge," he said.
Rothschild, too, acknowledged that he enjoyed watching Martinez work even if he beats the Devil Rays.
"I almost hate to admit that," the manager said, "but he's so good at what he does you have to sit back and realize you're watching one of the best there is and take solace from that."
 
Making Baseballs
 Major league officials were in Costa Rica last week touring the Rawlings factory that makes major league baseballs. Orlando Hernandez was there two years earlier.
"I visited twice, once before I signed and once after I signed," said the Yankees pitcher, who lived in Costa Rica immediately after defecting from Cuba. "I've never seen anything like that. I saw it in Cuba, but it wasn't the same. The quality of the materials is better in Costa Rica.
"What impressed me the most was the way they make a baseball. It took me 35 minutes to make a baseball myself. The boss said to me, 'You may be a good ballplayer, but you don't know anything about making baseballs.' "
Hernandez, who apparently is the only major league player who has visited the factory, was asked if the ball he made was juiced.
He laughed and said through a translator, "If the baseballs were made the way I made it, there would be no home runs."
 
Indians' Pitching Woes
 For several years the Cleveland Indians tried unsuccessfully to secure a No. 1 pitcher. Last winter they finally succeeded, luring Chuck Finley into the fold as a free agent. The pitching gods, however, are still laughing at them.
On the same day earlier this month, two starters, Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright, and a reliever, Ricardo Rincon, went on the disabled list. Last week another reliever, Paul Shuey, joined them. Wright returned last night but lasted only 12 batters and one and one-third innings as he gave up seven runs to the White Sox.
Nagy had bone chips removed from his right elbow and is expected to be out for eight weeks.
The Indians used two rookies in their place last week.
Paul Rigdon dazzled the Yankees, shutting them out on two hits in his seven-inning effort, but Tim Drew, brother of J. D., lasted only three batters into the second inning against Detroit, giving up five runs (three earned).
Rigdon's trouble came later. He strained a muscle in his left side Friday and was placed on the disabled list yesterday.
 
Vidro's Hitting Soars
 When Jose Vidro first reached the major leagues, in 1997, he replaced an injured Vladimir Guerrero on the Montreal roster. Last week he supplanted the highly talented Guerrero as the Expos' leading hitter.
The unheralded second baseman, who in his first full major league season last year batted .304, reached .399 last week and then entered last night's game in San Diego at .391 to Guerrero's .381. "I've always liked him as a hitter," Jim Beattie, the Expos' general manager, said. "He reminds me of Edgar Martinez in his knowledge of hitting."
 Noting that Vidro had hit eight home runs, Beattie added: "Edgar didn't have a lot of power when he came up, but he developed it at the big league level. Jose has a chance to hit 20 to 30 home runs depending on how hot he gets. He has a great approach to hitting and he's a smart player."
The 25-year-old switch-hitter also was leading the league in hits (70) and multihit games (22) and was tied for the lead in doubles (17).

Taste of Brooklyn
www.tasteofbrooklyn.com
 
 O.K., so Brooklyn is not exactly the land of milk and honey. But there is plenty of other yummy stuff on the menu, so much that it is getting hard to keep track of it all. But don't despair. There is a Web site dedicated solely to monitoring, rating and sometimes ranting about the mushrooming restaurant scene in Brooklyn, U.S.A. 
 "The scene just exploded," said Lenny Karle-Zenith, who, with his wife Anne, founded the Web site, Taste of Brooklyn%%cq%%, last year. "Nobody really expected it." Why such gastronomic growth? "Like everything else in Manhattan, rents were out of control," he said. "It was much cheaper to open new places in Brooklyn." He added, "Many people were getting tired of the Manhattan food grind. And some restaurateurs tired of it, too. They saw Brooklyn as a prime market, especially the area around Smith Street, with all the young professionals moving into Carroll Gardens."
 The Karle-Zeniths moved to Carroll Gardens five years ago, "when there was nothing but a pizza joint," Mr. Karle-Zenith said. "But we're real foodies, so we began searching out little places in Brooklyn." The couple first encountered Patois, a top-rated bistro in Carroll Gardens. They soon found more culinary gems amid the boroughs' brownstones, and when more restaurants like Victory Kitchen began opening, "we decided it was time to create a directory and put it online," Mr. Karle-Zenith said.
WHAT YOU SEE -- The site is well organized and easy to navigate. But Brooklyn is a very big place. So far, the site covers only epicurean hot spots in Brownstone Brooklyn -- Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill and Fort Greene. Bay Ridge, Williamsburg and other neighborhoods will be added soon.
 Sections include "Find A Restaurant," which allows searching by neighborhood, cuisine or price; "Main Ingredient," describing one dish that is fairly Brooklynesque (this month, pasta) and providing local recipes; "Taster's Choice," with reviews written by neighbors called "taste buds," and "What's Cooking," almost daily updates on Brooklyn openings, closings, promotions, wine tastings and more.
 There is also a regular feature article (for example, an in-depth look at rice balls), a "Tastemaker" interview with a local chef or owner, a "Wine Lady" column and one called "Percy Speaks," a highly opinionated review of life, politics and eating out in Brooklyn, written by the Karle-Zeniths' downstairs neighbor.
 LINKS -- To several sites covering local food, art, culture and economic development.
 WHAT YOU GET -- A cross-referenced, constantly updated culinary excursion through the place that Ed Norton, of "Honeymooners" fame, once called "the garden spot of the world." DAVID KIRBY

HEADLINE: SCHOOLS;
A School District Under a Microscope

BYLINE: By ANITA DENNIS 

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD

 BODY:
"It's like astronaut camp for teachers."
In any word association game, that would hardly be the way most residents here would think of their school district. 
 Yet that is precisely the opinion one Harvard researcher has of schools run by Marilyn Davenport, who last year became director of elementary education in the South Orange-Maplewood School District and principal of the Seth Boyden Demonstration School.
Since the book "Frames of Mind" was published in 1983, school districts throughout the country have been influenced by the work of Howard Gardner, a Harvard University professor who developed the theory of multiple intelligences -- which simply means different people can be smart in different ways. And recently Ms. Davenport, an educator recognized as having had great success in implementing the theory, came to this district with its history of high achievement and is trying to maintain it.
"When we work with a child, we must think, 'I don't know how this child is smart, but I'm going to find out,' " she said.
In her previous job as principal of the Governor Bent Elementary School in Albuquerque, test scores consistently placed in the top 5 among the district's 80 elementary schools even though similar schools with many children from lower socio-economic groups might have typically placed in the bottom quartile.
Ms. Davenport's approach appealed to this district, which has about 6,300 students, and homes that range from modest to mansions. Like her school in Albuquerque, the towns have seen a rise in students from lower socio-economic groups.
In the first year of testing, in 1999, under the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, 76 percent of the district's fourth graders scored proficient or above in math, compared with 60 percent average statewide. In language arts, 55 percent were proficient or higher (compared with 42 percent statewide) and in science, 93 percent showed proficiency or above (compared with 86 percent statewide).
"We have a diverse community makeup and high expectations," says Peter Horoschak, the South Orange-Maplewood district superintendent who worked with Ms. Davenport in Albuquerque. "To me, that meant we had the makings for demonstrating that students from different kinds of backgrounds and ethnicities can really succeed."
One main focus for Ms. Davenport in her new job is the Seth Boyden Demonstration School, an elementary school where teachers can best develop educational practices to be used throughout the district.
The school, which has more than 450 students, this year accepted about 70 transfer students from other district schools as part of a continuing districtwide effort to achieve racial and economic balance. At an open house this month, about 200 people came to learn about the school and its open enrollment plan.
It is hoped that these efforts will help to reinvigorate schools with the district's lowest test scores, including Seth Boyden.
"If one or more of our elementary schools are perceived as being laggards, then as a community, we're going to fail," said the board of education president, Brian O'Leary, who chose to send his kindergartner to Seth Boyden in Maplewood instead of to the Marshall School in South Orange, his neighborhood school. "We can't say, well, two-thirds of our schools are really good. All of them have to be uniformly excellent."
Ms. Davenport is not alone in her embrace of the theory, but she is considered an exemplar of its practical application. After Dr. Gardner first visited Ms. Davenport's school in Albuquerque in the early 1990's, he told an associate that it reminded him of the finest prep schools.
In his groundbreaking book, Dr. Gardner questioned the idea of intelligence as a uniform capacity that can be measured in something like an IQ test. Instead, he has identified several kinds of intelligence: linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, inter- and intrapersonal and naturalist. Everyone shares these intelligences, the idea goes, but people are stronger in some areas than others. Once teachers have identified each child's strengths and weaknesses, they can better understand how the child can achieve.
"Children come to you thinking they're smart," Ms. Davenport said, "but sometimes in school we convince them they're not. Intelligence is not fixed. If you believe that, you don't think much can be done in school."
To achieve excellence, Ms. Davenport "feels that it's important for children to have a sense of competence and a feeling that they belong," noted Mindy Kornhaber, a Harvard researcher who works with Dr. Gardner and has investigated the practical use of multiple intelligence for the last nine years. Ms. Davenport's convictions provided the foundation for implementing the theory successfully, Dr. Kornhaber believes.
"Sometimes the theory is adopted because it sounds good," she said. "There's not a lot of prior thinking about why it sounds good or what it might do."
When Dr. Kornhaber studied Ms. Davenport's school in Albuquerque, she found that "the work that the children and the teachers were doing was spectacular."
"They had no art teacher and yet the classrooms were like children's museums," Dr. Kornhaber said. "The artwork was all project-oriented. If they were doing a project on the lifecycles of animals, they didn't just show you what a horse looked like. They built beautiful three-dimensional models of horses, and wrote an elaborate book about its lifecycle. They were able to do wonderful presentations about their work."
Although Dr. Gardner's work hasn't described how to implement the theory, Dr. Kornhaber thinks Ms. Davenport's work in Albuquerque was a good model because teachers called on children to use a variety of different abilities.
"They weren't just putting pencil to paper to produce a report on a horse. They were using their aesthetic sensibility," she said. "They had to communicate with each other to produce the work. There was even a logical-mathematical piece to it because they had to think about how to use multiple sources of data, how make points and use research."
As part of how to practically apply what the children have learned, Ms. Davenport says she has developed a list of intelligent behaviors for students, which range from understanding how they learn, to being joyful in school, to taking the time to celebrate their accomplishments.
In the South Orange-Maplewood district, Seth Boyden will be used to develop teachers districtwide.
As Dr. Kornhaber said, "For anyone who is interested in being at the top of their game, that's the school to be in."
Although Ms. Davenport has been in her new district only briefly, Dr. Kornhaber has no doubt she will leave her mark.
"The school will change in ways that are in line with her thinking, philosophy and experience, because she doesn't let go," she said.
While test scores will most likely not immediately reflect Ms. Davenport's work, the towns seem ready to stay the course.
"The key thing for a political figures like me is to make sure we hold the district to high standards and not back away from the importance of using public measures like test scores," Mr. O'Leary said. "At the same time, we have to give people time to make the substantial changes required to make sure we get good scores for the right reasons. We're not simply looking for good scores, but for quality education."

Whispers of Recession Are Growing Louder

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
"IT comes up in every meeting," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers. " 'Jeff, what is the risk of a hard landing?' "
Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donald Lufkin & Jenrette, and Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, are both hearing the same question, one that has been popping up in client meetings since the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest rate target by half a percentage point, to 6.5 percent on May 16. 
 "There is a growing minority that believes the Fed could prove to be too heavy-handed, too aggressive," said Mr. Galvin.
"It's a question that is being asked a lot more and it makes sense," Mr. Cliggott added. "It's going to be tough to land this thing gently," he said, referring to attempts to slow America's rapid economic growth without triggering a recession.
A recession? Yes, a recession. The mere fact that the big clients of these equity strategists are asking the question shows just how quickly the mood in the stock market has changed.
Mr. Applegate, Mr. Galvin and Mr. Cliggott do not think that a recession is likely, but they acknowlege that the risk has risen. Real signs of inflationary pressures and the refusal, so far, by the American economy to slow down appreciably are already forcing the Fed to be aggressive in raising interest rates. And that just increases the risk of a mistake, that is, a recession.
This mood change has helped fuel the market selloff since the Fed's rate increase. The Nasdaq index is off 13.1 percent since then, while the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 5.8 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500 index has dropped 6 percent.
Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said the mood change was "all rooted in an increasing amount of evidence that the labor market is too tight for comfort," which forced the Fed to be more aggressive.
He said there were two modes that Fed policy makers might be in when they raise their benchmark Federal funds rate on loans between banks. They might be trying to slow growth to a manageable, noninflationary pace before inflation becomes a problem. That is what the Fed did in 1994 and 1995, with its last big series of rate increases. And it is what the group appears to have aimed for since last June, with five moderate, quarter-point increases in the Fed funds rate.
The Fed's other mode is to be intent on stamping out rising inflation, Mr. McKelvey said. If the Fed were to enter this mode, he said, the central bank would probably slow growth to below the 3.5 percent sustainable pace in order to subdue inflation. But that is risky. Mr. McKelvey says that the Fed has rarely shifted into that mode without the economy ending up in a recession.
He does not know what mode the Fed is in now. And he speculates that one would get "10 different answers" at the Fed, a reference to the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's interest rate policy.
But Mr. McKelvey notes this interesting -- and possibly not irrelevant -- fact: Since World War II, when the three-month moving average of the nation's unemployment rate rose more than 0.3 of a percentage point, the economy wound up in a recession within a year.
The three-month moving average now is 4.03 percent, down from 4.07 percent the previous three months and the lowest it has been since February 1970. If this indicator held to historic form, a move up to 4.4 percent would be a really bad signal.
So, can the policy makers avoid a hard landing and push up the unemployment rate without tripping into a recession? This expansion has already broken many rules economists have long lived by. So maybe this time will be different. Maybe.

HEADLINE: Rewriting of Rent Regulations Gives Tenants and Landlords a New Battle Cry

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
There is a new battlefront between tenants and landlords. It is 200 pages of dense legalese quietly created by New York State officials to rewrite the rent regulations that cover 2.4 million residents, most of them in New York City, and that document has caused a furor.
The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal says that it is simply updating the rules to conform to laws, court decisions and regulatory directives since the last codification, in 1987. 
 But tenant groups accuse the state of making changes that favor landlords and undermine key protections for renters; changes for which, they say, there is no statutory authority. They say the changes will enable owners to raise rents improperly and to evict tenants.
But the housing agency's general counsel, Marcia P. Hirsch, denies those claims. The updating is required by law, she said, and the proposal clarifies numerous issues, including some that are being contested in court.
Although the state has not yet formally adopted the revised regulations, tenant leaders say they are preparing to challenge them in court. "There's no question that we're going to be suing to stop this," said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, which represents 17,000 individuals and 144 affiliated groups.
Sharp debate characterized public hearings on the issue Thursday in Manhattan, White Plains and Manhasset. Most of the rent-regulated apartments are in New York City, but about 70,000 are in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland Counties.
Landlords gave qualified supported to the proposal, but called for additional modifications.
"For both owners and tenants, this codification is an extremely valuable and useful process" because it consolidates all the rules in one place, said Joseph Strasburg, president of the city's largest landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 owners and managers. "The bottom line is that there is nothing new here."
But Mr. Strasburg urged several changes, including removing the time limit on when an owner can challenge whether the tenant whose name appears on a lease is really living in an apartment, and allowing owners to charge more than one month's rent as a security deposit.
Tenants' advocates adamantly opposed the changes in the revision, and accused the state of pushing the changes through without sufficient public review.
Mr. McKee linked the state agency's changes to an effort three years ago by the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, to eliminate rent stabilization. Gov. George E. Pataki eventually forged a compromise between Mr. Bruno and tenant groups that was perceived as a defeat for Republicans. But Mr. McKee called the latest move an attempt "to achieve pro-landlord changes that George Elmer Pataki could not win from the State Legislature in 1997."
The tenants' advocates said that the hearings were not well publicized, that the proposal was not advertised and that copies of the draft were not available at the hearings. "How can I comment on your proposed code when I don't have a copy?" asked Pat McGovern, a tenant from Manhattan. "I asked for a copy at the desk, and they said they would mail me one."
Despite the proposal's length, speakers were limited to five minutes each and were barred from proposing further changes, although that rule was ignored.
"This is a landlord's wish list," said David Robinson, a lawyer for Legal Services for New York City, a nonprofit advocacy group. "I looked through 125 pages and found one page of protection for tenants."
City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Democrat from Manhattan, said: "This is a travesty. You are trying to destroy what's left of rent control and rent stabilization."
One surprise speaker at the Manhattan session was the head of the union that represents the housing agency's 475 employees in New York City, Ralph F. Carbone, president of Local 1359 of District Council 37. Mr. Carbone said that he was impartial in disputes between between landlords and tenants, but that he felt compelled to speak.
"I found that the proposals were slanted significantly toward owners," he said, "going beyond what I believe the current state law and judicial precedents are."

Building Character

BYLINE: By TOM O'NEILL; Tom O'Neill is executive director of the Partnership for New Jersey and co-chair of the steering committee of the Coalition for Our Children's Schools.

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY today has a once-in-a-century opportunity. When the state Supreme Court ordered the construction and rehabilitation of schools in the poorest districts, it opened the way to the largest public works program in the state's history, even bigger than building the New Jersey Turnpike two generations ago.
The Legislature and the governor appear to be drawing closer to approving legislation to start these sorely needed projects. But so far the debate in the State House has failed to produce a program that can make the most of this enormous opportunity. With a little vision, this program could not only rebuild urban schools but also help revitalize entire communities. 
 A well-designed school construction program can improve educational outcomes and strengthen neighborhoods and families. Each school project can be planned with community development as a cornerstone. Schools can include spaces that might be a school nurse's office by day and a community health clinic during nonschool hours. Preschool centers should be included as a matter of course. Recreational, library and meeting space should serve students and the community, year round. California now requires that school planners consider these community-building features. Chicago's new school construction program also emphasizes community schools. Across the country, schools have built banking or food-shopping space into their buildings for job training or located in department stores or hospitals to provide exposure to careers and reinforce educational experiences.
New Jersey has not grasped the importance of gaining this potential leverage because it has not tapped the creativity of local communities in planning schools. The State House wants to centralize the financing, fiscal oversight and construction of schools into a single state agency. While the Economic Development Authority surely could provide financing and fiscal oversight and accountability, it lacks experience in actually managing construction programs of this range and scope. More seriously, it lacks familiarity with local schools and neighborhood needs. To maintain public confidence that huge sums are being spent wisely, New Jersey needs a sound system of state-level financing and fiscal control. But it also needs to harness the creativity and responsiveness of local planning and management.
New Jersey's cities do not lack for community organizations, businessinterests and concerned parents who want to improve their schools and neighborhoods. It is at the local level that coordination and community involvement will produce the synergies needed to improve both school and neighborhoods.
To enjoy even greater leverage from this investment, each project should incorporate job training, apprenticeship opportunities and local hiring goals for young men and women in the neighborhoods. The school construction program can start thousands of young people in good jobs where they can develop the traits and habits crucial to success in any career. But such programs are not assured under the currently debated legislation.
It is past time for the other two branches of government to abide by the Supreme Court's order and provide 100 percent funding for school construction in the Abbott Districts, those cited by the court. But many poor communities not covered by the court order should also be helped. Aid to those districts should be based on need, and provided through a rational formula to avoid further delaying new schools in the poorest districts while this contentious issue is resolved.
Through the recently formed Coalition for Our Children's Schools leaders from business, government, education and the nonprofit community are working to raise the level of awareness of this opportunity. If New Jersey does this right, our children, our communities and the entire state will benefit. If we dont, the chance might never come again, and we will fail to make the most of this enormous public investment.

HEADLINE: It's Futile to Put a Price on Slavery

BYLINE: By Glenn C. Loury; Glenn C. Loury is an economics professor and director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at Boston University.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
A visit to any courthouse, public hospital emergency room or welfare office in a large city confirms that our society is still marred by the social and economic disadvantage of African-Americans.
Yet, with overt racial discrimination less prevalent nowadays, many Americans are asking why a concern about social deprivation should take particular notice of race. This is a fair question. 
 One answer is that black disadvantage remains a special problem because it originates from slavery, to which there is this conservative retort: "So what? Slavery ended a long time ago."
This has prompted a new demand from advocates of African-American interests: reparations, a money settlement that is to be given as compensation for past racial injury.
Of course, the reparations issue has been around since the end of slavery, starting with "40 acres and a mule." But lately the issue has gathered steam. Representative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, has sponsored a bill that would establish a commission to study the issue. Randall Robinson, president of TransAfrica, a lobbying group, eloquently argues for reparations in his book, "The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks."
Prominent intellectuals, including Charles Ogletree, a professor at Harvard Law School, and Henry Louis Gates, chairman of Harvard's Afro-American studies department, were considering a class-action lawsuit asking for reparations, according to a March article in The Boston Globe.
Although I am not without sympathy for this position, I believe that framing the argument in these terms is a mistake. We need some reckoning with the racist past, but reparations encourage the wrong kind of reckoning. Winning compensation would, in the end, allow conservatives to get away with their "so what?" retort.
Let me illustrate with a rough analogy. In South Africa, after the transition to majority rule, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was empowered by the new government to pardon those who had committed political crimes during the long years of apartheid -- as long as the perpetrators of the crimes testified fully and truthfully to what they had done. Pardons were granted even to those who had killed blacks for the white regime.
In return, the undisputed truth of what had transpired under apartheid was established, and it is impossible to revise or challenge the record. The "so what?" retort is easily answered in South Africa -- now and in future generations.
Yes, the United States and South Africa are vastly different. But the South African case shows why compensation can never be the foundation for a satisfactory reckoning with the racist American past. Debts are things that are calculated and (sometimes) paid off. But the oppression of millions of human beings, orchestrated and abetted by national and state governments, is an atrocity of an altogether different order.
The heirs to this atrocity -- long established Americans and newly naturalized citizens alike -- should be confronted continually with the horrors of what their country wrought. They should be challenged to understand the contemporary consequences of these historic crimes.
The tort-law model underlying reparations advocacy -- he who causes damage to another is obliged to make the injured party whole -- is hopelessly insufficient here. It relies heavily upon being able to demonstrate in quantitative terms the nature and extent of injury.
How would one even begin to arrive at a sum for the reparation payments?
Who can say what the out-of-wedlock birth rate for blacks would be, absent chattel slavery? How does one calculate the cost of inner-city ghettos, of poor education, of the stigma of perceived racial inferiority? The severity of slavery's "injury" is far more profound than any cash transfer will be able to reverse.
Moreover, reparations would allow the majority of Americans to look at the situation as one where "we" do something for "them"-- alleviate their suffering, solve their problems, quiet their protests and then, once the debt is paid off, wash our hands of society's inequities.
Instead, we should follow another model, one that decrees that "we," meaning all Americans, should right the inequity for the sake of our country. We must attend to this matter so that our national fellowship and comity will not be emaciated, so that our moral pronouncements on the world stage will not be made into a hollow mockery.
As in South Africa, the deepest and most relevant "reparation" would entail constructing and inculcating in our citizens an account of how we have come to be as we are -- one that avoids putting the responsibility for the current problems of African-Americans wholly on their shoulders.
The "so what?" retort is historically naive and morally obtuse, but it is very American. So, too, is the clamor for reparations. After all, we are a problem-solving people who do not sit easily with the ghosts of our past. But the tragic legacy of slavery is a problem that simply will not yield to another application of American ingenuity. It will be with us for some time.

HEADLINE: We Are All Spendthrifts Now

BYLINE: By Mary Gordon; Mary Gordon is the author of "Spending," and, most recently, "Seeing Through Places" and "Joan of Arc."

 BODY:
It has become increasingly difficult to read a newspaper or magazine without encountering the details of extravagant, conspicuous consumption, usually on the part of new millionaires, or billionaires, usually under 30. Stories of $1,000 spent on a bottle of wine. Reports of a dish of boiled sole and a roasted new potato that costs $60, not counting, of course, tips and taxes. Apartments in New York City formerly considered marginally uninhabitable snapped up at the price of half a million dollars.
Our imaginations are drawn to these stories; they have the allure of soft porn, at least for those of us who congratulate ourselves on not jumping for the bait, those of us who believe ourselves capable of the statement, "It isn't worth it." 
 But what do we mean by "worth"?
When we use the word, we are talking about a system of equivalencies -- a transaction between the symbolic and the actual which many people believe is the most real thing there is, but which is, in fact, a sheer act of imagination. Whose idea was it that a hard, inedible and unprotecting substance (stones, shells, metal) could be traded for food, clothing, shelter?
The use of money is the purest act of faith; no anchorite who has followed a vision into the desert has acted on an idea as far-fetched as our belief that if we put a dollar in a machine we will be drinking a Diet Coke in a minute. Of course, we don't think of this strangeness all the time, but sometimes, when the numbers seem to have reached the fantastical, we question the idea of worth: how much should be handed over for what things?
These decisions are often based on personal history or biography. My mother's sense of worth, for example, was much different from mine. She had been a young woman during the Depression and was always haunted by the specter of real poverty, even during the prosperous 50's and 60's. She supported us on a secretary's salary, so we were never able to live luxuriously, but she suspected all expenditure, almost for its own sake.
She saved wrapping paper and tinfoil and Saran wrap. Closets and drawers were full of discolored papers and crinkled squares of foil and ill-smelling plastics. She usually waited for someone to die before replenishing her wardrobe: wearing the clothes of the dead seemed to her a superior choice to a purchase in a store. She deprived herself of the real pleasures of consumption: we never ate in restaurants or stayed in hotels.
My cousin and I (he was the son of her sister) feel that every time we buy something that gives us pleasure, we are undoing an old curse. We refer to such activities as "mental health purchases."
The flexibility of a sense of worth was brought home to me last week when my oldest friend and I sent our children shopping in Harvard Square. Thirty years ago, we had spent the summer in Cambridge, she studying physics (she later became a doctor), I working as a secretary in an insurance company (I later became a novelist). That summer, we made a weekly decision about whether we would share a frankfurter at a German restaurant, or a piece of apple cake.
Half a lifetime later, we dropped our teenage daughters off, shoving bills at them through the car window.
"How much did you give them?" my friend asked.
"Fifty dollars," I said.
"Me too," she told me.
Neither of us believed we had been extravagant, but we noted the difference 30 years and increased prosperity had made. Fifty dollars was liberal, it made us happy that we could offer our children an ease we hadn't had ourselves.
But what if we had given them $500? Is there ever a point at which it is important to say, "this far and no further"? Isn't there a moment when we question the relationship between what we paid and what we got?
Was the plate of sole really worth $60? Was the studio apartment really worth $500,000?
We use the word "disposable income," but shouldn't we consider what's being disposed of?
Is it only hypocritical or absurd to question what the poor could do with the money?
The fact that I have to fear that mentioning the poor will induce only yawns or groans, as if I'd questioned the propriety of sleeveless dresses, tells us something about what seems important, even discussable, to us now.
In these cloud-cuckooland times, there seems to be a gap between price tag and worth. Shouldn't we consider, without fearing that we've turned into Puritans or killjoys, taking a deep breath before speaking sentences whose language is made up of numbers that seem incomprehensibly distant from what once seemed reasonable?
Is this a real question, or just my version or my mother's shouted admonition: "Don't rip that wrapping paper off that box so fast! Do you think I'm made of money?"

HEADLINE: NEW ECONOMY;
Convergence, the nextstage in technology, may wind up being a different creature than expected.

BYLINE: By Seth Schiesel 

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif.

 BODY:
OF all of the buzzwords in the technology industry, perhaps none is invoked as blindly, reflexively and totemically as "convergence."
Talk to a senior technology executive these days and you will probably hear about how television, the telephone system and the Internet are converging to create an interactive world of information and entertainment. 
 But, in fact, convergence is not really happening, at least not yet. And when it does, it will probably take forms much different than those generally envisioned today.
That is not a conclusion a visitor might have expected to bring away from the annual Vortex conference that ended on Friday here on the Pacific Coast. Vortex is about convergence, and it may be North America's most concentrated gathering of top communications investors and executives. But according to an automated polling service at the conference, the Vortex attendees gave convergence an overall letter grade of D-plus for now.
They recognize that even though billions of dollars are being spent on convergence, immense obstacles remain. And in the end, convergence will be far less than universal.
At the first Vortex conference two years ago, the mood about convergence was positively giddy. "Two years ago here I remember people looking at the new carriers, the Qwests and Level 3's, and thinking that they were just going to make convergence happen," said a senior technical executive for a big local communications carrier. "I think what's impressing me this year is a new sense of maturity -- sobriety even."
A 21 percent drop in the Nasdaq will sober up just about anyone in the technology business. And it has. But beyond the financial picture, the emerging sense of realism about convergence seems based on a simple and renewed appreciation of the mundane technical obstacles that stand in its way, and on some newly creative thinking about what sorts of services will best embody it.
Technically, convergence is the last mile. That sounds obvious, but the last few years, at least some technology pundits, executives and investors have drooled over the exponential increases in bandwidth capacity in the nation's long-distance fiber optic networks and mistaken that for convergence.
But for all of the leaps in long-haul capacity, no more than 2 percent of the nation's 100 million or so homes currently log on the Internet with anything more powerful than an analog modem. The last mile of the nation's communications networks -- or the first mile, depending on who's holding the mouse -- is the part that actually touches homes. But this crucial link has not kept pace with the rest of the network.
The digital subscriber line technology that local phone companies want to use to deliver torrents of Internet data over traditional copper phone lines has had a particularly tough time living up to expectations. D.S.L. is far more difficult to put in place than was originally thought. And the bandwidth, or speed, it delivers is far less than was first contemplated.
In early 1998, when many of the nation's leading computer, software and local communications companies formed an alliance to support D.S.L., they thought it would generally deliver 1.5 million digital bits a second to consumers' homes. Today, it is unlikely that more than a quarter of the few hundred thousand households with working D.S.L. are consistently receiving more than a million bits, or a megabit, a second. Industry experts say that most D.S.L. households probably get only around 500,000 bits a second, at best. (Cable modems, the main alternative to D.S.L., more frequently deliver megabit-plus speeds, but in some ways those communications pathways are less reliable than D.S.L.)
Of course, even 500,000 bits a second is still an order of magnitude faster than the 53,000 or so bits a second that can be delivered by today's fastest analog modems. But consider that a single channel of TV-quality video, using compression technology, requires at least 2 million bits a second and often requires more than 5 million bits a second; it becomes quite clear that for the great majority of consumers, television as they know it is not going to be converging with the Internet soon.
But then, merging TV with the Internet is probably the wrong goal, anyway. Television is a one-way, centrally created and distributed medium. It is not the killer application for the Internet because the Internet does not operate like TV.
And yet, most demonstrations of converged applications that include video, including those at Vortex, are essentially television with some interactive buttons, like "buy now," or "chat about this program," tacked on the side of the screen.
"The trap is when people think about this new media strictly in the context of the old," said Michael O'Dell, chief scientist for Worldcom's Uunet operation, the No. 1 Internet carrier. "I have a problem believing that the future of the Internet is a bad version of cable TV."
Rather than take the form of merely repackaged traditional media, the most successful converged services will probably be cut from wholly new cloth to take advantage of the specific characteristics of cyberspace.
Napster, the service that allows users to swap digital music files, is a perfect example. And some technology experts believe that Napster is already consuming more of the Internet's bandwidth than is the leading Web site, Yahoo. Rather than simply selling compact discs online or putting radio stations online (the aural equivalent of adding a "chat now" button to a TV program), the very nature of Napster's service emerged from the Internet.
In fact, Vinod Khosla, the venture capitalist from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said trying to repackage traditional media online was actually hindering the deployment of broadband communications and converged services in general.
"When you're trying to migrate old services to a new medium, the barriers are high and the payoffs aren't that great," Mr. Khosla said. "But when you have a new service, maybe the barrier is high but I'll climb over it because the payoff is higher."

HEADLINE: A Commercial Makes Canadian Self-Esteem Bubble to the Surface

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta

 BODY:
Over the din of a multi-screen sports bar, Dallas Hyde recalled the magical moment at a Calgary Flames hockey game, when "he" stood up in the crowd.
"Everybody in the crowd went nuts," Mr. Hyde, 24, an oil change supervisor, recalled of the moment when Jeff Douglas stepped before a microphone to deliver The Rant. 
 "I'm not a lumberjack or a fur trader; I don't live in an igloo, eat blubber or own a dogsled," the Nova Scotia actor said, repeating lines from a Molson Canadian beer commercial that has become a nationalist mantra for 30 million Canadians this spring.
Addressing an invisible American audience, "Joe Canadian" patiently continued his lesson: "I have a prime minister, not a president. I speak English and French, not American."
"I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack," he said, uttering patriotic lines that now are recited in bars and high school hallways from Vancouver to Halifax. "I believe in peacekeeping, not policing; diversity, not assimilation."
By now the television version is flashing images of maple leaves and beavers as Joe Canadian reaches his climax, bellowing: "Canada is the second-largest land mass, the first nation of hockey and the best part of North America. My name is Joe and I am Canadian."
Canadian hockey teams struck out in the Stanley Cup for a record-breaking seventh year in a row, the Canadian dollar is stuck at two-thirds of the United States dollar, a southern brain drain is cherry-picking this year's crop of college graduates, but Canadians have found a powerful spine-stiffening elixir: a nationalistic beer commercial.
Tired of being measured against the eternal American yardstick, Canadians are doing something uncharacterically Canadian: beating their chests with patriotism.
The Rant, as the 60-second commercial is known, has won cheers in movie theaters, endless debate on talk radio, fist-pumping ovations by fans at National Hockey League games and 14,000 e-mail messages to a special Web site created by Molson, www.iam.ca.
"We were taken aback by how much it struck a chord with everybody," said Paul Thomson, a Molson spokesman, who quickly put the "Joe Canadian" actor on a national tour of hockey rinks. "There was a lot of Canadian pride that was below the surface, exploding the myth that young adult Canadians are not proud of their country."
At Schanks Athletic Club, the sports bar here, Kim Anderson said of the ad, "It's kind of neat for him to yell it out," though adding, "After all, everything here is American."
Indeed, in a nation with the highest level of foreign economic ownership in the developed world -- 23 percent of company assets -- the beer-drinking patrons of Schanks were sitting in the electronic wash of ESPN.
From British Columbia, long a liberal bastion, Lisa McCaskill, a sales manager, said, "I saw it in a movie theater in Vancouver, and people were cheering -- real patriots."
Glen Hunt, 35, a Toronto advertising executive, wrote the ad after returning to Canada last fall from a three-year stint in New York.
"We sent people out on the street to see how young people felt about being Canadian," said Mr. Hunt, a creative director for Bensimon Byrne D'Arcy. "They started pretty quiet, but once they got going it was a dormant volcano ready to erupt.
At the same time, this flag-waving surge has collided with two forces that historically have deflated chest-pumping patriotism here: English Canada's cutting humor and the nation's unity-defying regionalism.
"I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack," Mark Steyn, a National Post newspaper columnist, wrote recently. "That's because even though I am a beer-guzzling hockey fan, I took sewing classes in Canada's non-gender-stereotyping school system."
He noted that many Canadians feel squeamish about reciting the national oath of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II. On one hand, they gripe, pledging allegiance seems so American. On the other hand, swearing allegiance to the queen seems so British. Mr. Steyn concluded: "If you drink enough Molson, eventually even Canada makes sense."
In a country where east-west links are tenuous, comedians quickly deconstructed The Rant into a series of regional mini-rants.
From this western province, an "I am Albertan" parody hails John Deere for making "the best hats" and then rants, "I speak flawless English and gripe to the store manager about French labels on cereal boxes."
From Quebec an English-language radio station aired this satire that contradicted any notion of unity there: "I believe in language police, not equal rights," the announcer says in a heavy French accent. "I believe Club Supersex is an appropriate place for my wife and I to celebrate our anniversaire."
"The land where everybody is shacking up and the legal drinking age is just a suggestion," he continues. "Je m'appelle Guy -- and I am not Canadien."
From Newfoundland a regional rant concludes: "Newfoundland is the second island province, the first nation of drinking and the best party in North America! My name is Baz, and I am Newfie!"
Despite the inability of some Canadians to take patriotism seriously, The Rant is believed to have prompted the government of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, to announce that starting in September, each student will start the day by standing at attention, singing the national anthem, "O Canada," and pledging allegiance to the queen.
Here in Alberta, governing Conservative Party lawmakers are considering legislation that would require schoolchildren to sing "O Canada" at least weekly. In Quebec, which has been governed by the separatist Parti Quebecois since 1994, Canadian symbols like the national flag and anthem are officially ignored and Molson Canadian is not marketed.
The new nationalist mood has won applause in Ottawa, the national capital.
"Someone has decided nationalism sells," Charles Gordon, a columnist for The Ottawa Citizen wrote approvingly in Maclean's magazine. "If that's true, it's good. It means that a unique culture, in art and music and theater and writing, can survive in this country, survive in the face of a powerful culture pouring over our border every day."
Recently, Canada's heritage minister, Sheila Copps, went to Boston and showed the commercial to an International Press Institute panel, "American Culture -- the People's Choice or a Form of Imperialism?"
But unless a giddy new nationalism can really bubble out of a beer commercial, The Globe and Mail of Toronto offered this sobering cup of expresso. A few years ago the Charles R. Bronfman Foundation, a private cultural group, tried to spoon-feed history to the Canadian masses with a series called "Heritage Minutes."
"All they sparked," the newspaper editorialist recalled, "was a series of parodies on the Comedy Network called 'Sacrilege Moments,' financed by -- wait for it -- Molson."

HEADLINE: As Homicides Rise, New York Faces Return of Fear

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
New York preceded most cities in experiencing the historic drop in crime that has swept across America's urban areas and spurred an economic renaissance in many once-devastated neighborhoods.
But while crime in New York remains at a 30-year low, city officials have worked hard in the last year trying to allay fears that the city may be headed back to the days when more than 1,500 homicides a year were not uncommon. 
 By the end of 1998, the city's murder rate had dropped to its lowest point since 1964. But after a decline in homicides to 629 in 1998 from 2,245 in 1990, New York is beginning to record a slight increase, police statistics show.
Although all other major categories of crime have continued to decline, there have been 269 homicides this year, compared with 248 at the same point last year, police records show. And several recent crimes -- a woman attacked by a man with a brick in Midtown last fall, a spate of killings of cabdrivers and the slayings of five people last week at a Wendy's restaurant in Queens -- have drawn intense attention, suggesting that the perception, if not the reality, of a dangerous city may be returning.
Homicides, in fact, are down 62 percent compared with 1993, police records show. "When things are going well, sometimes the shock is so large because you have told people they don't have to worry about crime," said Thomas A. Repetto, chairman of the Citizen's Crime Commission, a police watchdog group in New York City.
While some law enforcement officials say domestic violence, gang killings and a growth in the juvenile and young adult population most often linked to murders are responsible for the two-year spike in homicides, Andrew Karmen, a sociologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said, "There is nothing you can point to and say that 'this is the culprit.' "
Mr. Karmen said economic, demographic and other factors are playing a role in the murder rate's increase, leading to questions about the extent to which law enforcement has suppressed violence. In New York, officials have credited smart and aggressive police work for the crime rate's decline.
Most experts agree that in many respects, the New York police have become victims of their own success: the declining crime rate has raised expectations and created statistical lows that will serve to highlight any future increases.
"There is a tremendous amount of fear," Mr. Repetto said, "because you've told yourself crime is not a problem."
But Yolanda Jimenez, the deputy police commissioner who handles community affairs, said city officials have been educating people about crime trends. "We have had a challenging four years," she said. "But in spite and despite all that, the large crime reductions have really paved the way for people to deal with issues like quality of life and programs for young people."

HEADLINE: Asia's Tycoons Prepare to Join Rush to Internet

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 28

 BODY:
In this densely packed city, where property is the coin of the realm, Raymond Kwok is as close as one gets to royalty.
Mr. Kwok's 46th-floor office looks out on a forest of skyscrapers, dozens of them built by his family. Across the harbor in Kowloon are sawtooth rows of apartment houses, also built by the family. The Kwok's real estate empire is one of the largest in Asia, making Raymond, 46, and his two brothers fabulously wealthy, even by Hong Kong's baroque standards. 
 These days, however, Mr. Kwok is worried about something that has little to do with concrete, glass and steel. "We always follow closely what is happening in the U.S.," he said. "In America, we see how technology is changing business, how technology is creating a lot of new businesses."
As the Internet sweeps across the Pacific, Mr. Kwok believes technology will unleash the same frenzy of sudden wealth and disorienting change in Asia. If his family wants to keep its place among Hong Kong's commercial elite, he says, it must join the revolution. So Mr. Kwok, a Harvard M.B.A., has devised one of the most ambitious Internet strategies of any old-line Asian company, creating a diverse portfolio of Internet start-ups related to his family's business.
The Kwoks are one of several wealthy Asian clans determined not to be left behind. From Taiwan to Thailand, the region's most powerful families have started a blizzard of online ventures. Whether their core businesses are in property, telecommunications or banking, Asia's tycoons are seizing on the Internet in hopes of expanding their reach.
In the process, the Internet is transforming the way business is done here and elsewhere in East Asia. With its emphasis on speed, openness, and collaboration, the Net is challenging traditional Asian values of prudence and family control. Decisions, which used to be made by the patriarch behind a veil of secrecy, are being pushed down the ranks as Asian companies embrace Silicon Valley-style management.
"The classic Asian family dynasty probably isn't the best suited to succeed on the Internet," said Peter Yip, the chief executive of Chinadotcom, one of Asia's first publicly traded Internet companies. "But I've been amazed by how quickly they've learned the business."
Not everyone is so sanguine. Despite their chameleon-like adaptability, Asia's tycoons may have trouble making the leap into cyberspace, critics say. For the last quarter-century, the tycoons rode a wave of double-digit growth. In countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, cozy ties with governments sheltered them from market forces.
"These guys think the Internet will bring them prosperity for the next 25 years," said Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong publisher who is putting his media properties online and starting an Internet shop-from-home service. "But to unlearn the lessons of the last 25 years is impossible."
Over time, Mr. Lai (pronounced lie) predicts, the culture of the Internet will erode the dominance of family dynasties in Asian commerce. By making information widely available, the Web will gradually devalue the networks of personal contacts -- known in Chinese as guanxi -- amassed over decades.
Mr. Kwok, though, thinks he can ride the technology tidal wave. He spent much of 1999 in the United States, roaming around conferences and quizzing entrepreneurs.
He discovered some online businesses that play to the strengths of property owners. One is providing specially outfitted office space to house computer servers. Another is creating Internet sites, including chat rooms and bulletin boards, for the residents of the apartment complexes owned by the Kwok family's company, Sun Hung Kai Properties.
Soon, Mr. Kwok packaged his collection of start-ups into a holding company, Sunevision, which went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. While Mr. Kwok is the chairman, he has recruited an outside executive to run it.
"The mind-set of a technology company is very different from a property company," Mr. Kwok said. "We needed to remove a lot of baggage."
For Jeffrey Koo Jr., the challenge was persuading his elders that the Internet was more than a fad. Mr. Koo, 35, is a fourth-generation member of a family that controls a vast empire in banking, telecommunications, cement and cable television.
In talking with classmates from the Wharton School in 1997, Mr. Koo became convinced that his family had to lash its future to the Internet. As president of the family's Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Mr. Koo began taking baby steps online. But his father turned down his first request for $10 million to finance an Internet service provider.
"My father and his brothers were against me doing this because they thought of it as a form of gambling," Mr. Koo said. "When I would talk excitedly about a new venture, they would look at me blankly."
In Mr. Koo's case, the elders came around when Microsoft bought a 10 percent stake in his start-up, GigaMedia, an entertainment and information service. Earlier this year, GigaMedia became the first Taiwan Internet company to go public on the Nasdaq exchange. Although it was caught in Nasdaq's downdraft, it is still worth well over $2 billion.
Now, Mr. Koo is developing online banking and a regional e-commerce service to complement the family's 75 percent stake in GigaMedia. Less than two years after his father gave the Internet the cold shoulder, Jeffrey Jr. said, he now talks constantly about the cyberworld.
To some students of Asian business, this is merely a new chapter in an old story. Ethnic Chinese families have traditionally prospered by adapting to new circumstances. Kwok Tak-seng, the patriarch of the Kwok family, started as a trader in southern China. By the 1950's, he had migrated to Hong Kong and become the local agent for the Y.K.K. zipper company of Japan.
Sensing more opportunity in property than zippers, Mr. Kwok began building apartment houses. By the 1980's, he was a leading real estate developer. Mr. Kwok died in 1990, but under his three sons, Sun Hung Kai grew into a conglomerate with interests in toll roads, cargo handling and mobile telephones.
"One good thing about old-economy companies is that they have profits and cash flow," said Raymond's older brother, Thomas, who oversees Sun Hung Kai's real estate business. "But old-economy companies need new-economy ideas to survive."
For all their rock-solid stature, however, Asia's tycoons face challenges from a host of upstarts. Mr. Lai, the publisher and a self-styled maverick, offers himself as an example. Last year, he started a venture that lets customers order groceries and other goods by phone or over the Internet. The company, adMart, delivers from its warehouses, cutting out the middleman.
In Hong Kong, the middleman for many of these goods is Li Ka-shing, a billionaire who owns one of the two local supermarket chains. When Mr. Lai's delivery business began to pinch Mr. Li's stores, he canceled his company's advertising in Apple Daily and Next magazine, the outspoken newspaper and weekly magazine at the heart of Mr. Lai's company.
For Mr. Lai, the lost revenue has hurt. But after years of tweaking Hong Kong's establishment in his newspaper, Mr. Lai relishes mounting a frontal assault on its most powerful local businessman. "I could never take on Li Ka-shing before," Mr. Lai said. "But if I'm riding on the back of a huge market force like the Internet, then even he can't stop me."
In a sense, the Internet is the second revolution to rumble through Asia recently. In 1997 and 1998, the regional financial crisis brought many family empires to the brink of ruin. Even in Hong Kong, property prices plunged by more than half, and are only now recovering.
In the aftermath, many Asian governments took steps to clean up their banks, tighten commercial regulations and force companies to improve their disclosure.
"Before the crisis, Asian firms regarded financial disclosure and minority shareholders as a necessary irritant," said Peter Churchouse, co-head of research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong. "Now they know they can't get away with that."
But if Asia's tycoons were humbled, the crisis did not dull their entrepreneurial instincts. Watching start-ups like Amazon.com become sensations in America, the tycoons saw a chance for a quick score. Virtually every conglomerate rushed out an Internet unit.
Li Ka-shing started e-commerce ventures through his two companies, Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings. He also backed a Chinese-language portal, Tom.com, which prompted a near-riot among investors when it went public last February. Tom.com tumbled in the global technology sell-off. But thanks to Mr. Li's gold-plated reputation, it still trades above its offering price.
"You've got to hand it to the conglomerates, they've maintained their position in a radically different economy," said Mark Duff, the founder and chief executive of Boom.com, an online stock-trading company here.
Indeed, Mr. Duff and other entrepreneurs fear that the tycoons are colonizing Asia's cyberspace. They say that the family companies can soak up money and talent that could have gone to more daring ideas.
It is true that the tycoon-backed ventures are often unimaginative. Sunevision's concept of providing warehouses for Web servers was pioneered in the United States by Exodus. Tom.com promoted itself as a mega-portal for Chinese audiences around the world. When it went public, its Web site consisted of a home page and links that went nowhere.
"Some of the initiatives in Asia are extremely shallow," Mr. Duff said. "But the brand names of the families are so strong that it doesn't matter. They get funded."
A few executives are trying to force deeper changes in Asian culture. Richard Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, is building an office park here. The 64-acre complex, known as Cyberport, is supposed to offer tenants a campus-like environment where ideas can be swapped and new businesses hatched.
Just 33 years old, Mr. Li is the brashest Internet entrepreneur in Hong Kong and a symbol of Asia's headlong flight into cyberspace. His two-year-old company, Pacific Century Cyberworks, recently won a $36 billion takeover battle for Hong Kong's main telephone company. Mr. Li is also building a satellite-delivered Internet service.
Mr. Li epitomizes the contradiction in Asia's version of the Internet. A scion of the Li dynasty, he has created a cyberage company crackling with the energy of employees hoping to strike it rich on stock options. The company's latest conquest has been likened to America Online's acquisition of Time Warner.
Yet Mr. Li would never have triumphed without a $12 billion syndicated loan arranged by the Bank of China to finance the deal. And analysts agree that Mr. Li would never have landed such a loan without his father's connections.
Likewise with the Cyberport. It may plant the seed for a fertile technology culture in Hong Kong. Yet rivals of the Li family have criticized the project because it was awarded to Pacific Century by the Hong Kong government in a back-room deal.
These days, the tycoons stop short of extolling Asian values, but they make no apologies for their privileges. "There's a blend of Western and Asian elements here," said Alex Arena, Mr. Li's top lieutenant. "It's not a question of being like the U.S. It's a question of cherry-picking from the U.S."

HEADLINE: Campaigning on Social Security

 BODY:
Social Security has emerged as a critical issue in this year's presidential campaign, but neither candidate seems prepared to address the system's long-term financial problems. Instead, Gov. George W. Bush wants to let individuals invest a small part of their Social Security contributions in the stock market, where he thinks they will earn a better return, and Vice President Al Gore proposes to keep the system largely intact with an infusion of general tax revenues. Neither proposal would really stabilize the system in the long run. In truth, though Social Security is projected to become bankrupt in four decades, the system is not all that far out of kilter. It would not be hard for bold politicians to devise a fix.
Social Security may well be, as Governor Bush has said, "the single most successful government program in American history." It was created in 1935, during the depths of the depression, to provide a guaranteed income to retired workers for as long as they live. Unlike private pension plans, Social Security benefits keep pace with inflation and, unlike 401(k)'s and other popular private plans, Social Security benefits do not fluctuate with stock and bond markets. Social Security provides the majority of income for most retirees and all the income for about a fifth of the elderly. 
 From its inception, the system has taken in payroll taxes from the working generation and turned almost all of them over to retirees. At the core of Social Security are the notions of social insurance -- everyone participates in a common plan -- and redistribution -- the program tilts in favor of low-paid workers. The benefits for low-paid workers are about 80 percent of their average lifetime earnings, while benefits for high-paid workers are about 30 percent of average earnings. The progressive formula has cut the poverty rate among the elderly by two-thirds, reducing their poverty to below that of the general population. That is a remarkable triumph.
The question before voters is whether a program born out of depression -- when poverty was rampant, few married women worked for pay and no one had 401(k)'s or I.R.A.'s to provide for retirement -- needs to be revamped.
One reason for thinking so is the projected bankruptcy -- a sobering but manageable situation. The system will run surpluses for the next 15 years, building a large reserve. But in 2010, the first wave of the baby boomers -- the nearly 80 million people born between 1946 and 1964 -- will begin to retire and collect retirement checks. The number of people in the work force for every retiree will fall from about five today to about three in only 30 years or so. That, and the fact that people are living longer, will put a strain on workers to support the retirement needs of the elderly. The system will begin to run deficits around 2015. By 2037, the trust fund is expected to be empty.
But for all the talk of bankruptcy, the system is not facing irreparable financial crisis. Even after 2037, payroll taxes will cover about 70 percent of promised benefits. Deficits over the next 75 years, the planning horizon for the program, will equal less than 2 percent of total payrolls -- hardly a catastrophic shortfall. If the economy were to grow only slightly faster than the actuaries at the Social Security Administration now project, the deficit would disappear.
One proposed remedy for financial imbalance is partial privatization, the approach favored by Governor Bush. Under current law, workers and employers pay a 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes into a public trust fund. Under partial privatization, workers could divert, say, two percentage points of that tax to private accounts that the worker could then invest in stocks and bonds. Workers would collect less money from the trust fund when they retired, alleviating financial strain on the system. But they would expect to more than make up for the loss by drawing from their private accounts.
Mr. Bush's sketchy proposal fails to answer where he would find the money to pay retirees as payroll taxes were diverted into private accounts. But there are other fundamental problems with the proposal as well.
Proponents of private accounts say that investors, based on data going back to the early 20th century, can expect to earn about 5 percent annually above inflation on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. By contrast, the taxes they "deposit" in the trust fund will earn an implicit return -- measured in future retirement benefits -- of only 1 to 2 percent above inflation.
But that comparison is highly misleading. Private accounts invested in stocks and bonds may well earn less than 5 percent because the economy is expected to slow over the next several decades as the population ages and because stock prices are now overvalued.
More important, the advantage that proponents cite on behalf of private accounts is an optical illusion. The trust fund faces the burden of paying trillions of dollars beyond what payroll taxes raise over the next 75 years to provide the benefits the system is obligated to pay current and future retirees. The sole reason that private accounts look like a better investment than the trust fund is that proponents assume the private accounts would be relieved of the burden of helping to pay that obligation. But that just deflects the burden onto someone else, requiring Congress to slash retirement checks or other government spending, or to raise taxes.
Mr. Bush cites as an advantage that private accounts can be invested in stocks whereas the trust fund by law cannot. But if the law were changed to let the trust fund itself purchase stocks, as President Clinton has proposed, it could invest in the markets far more cheaply than could private accounts. The cost of administering 150 million individual private accounts would be huge, eating away 20 percent or more of worker deposits. Private accounts could also subject individuals, including the poor, to unacceptable investment risk at the most vulnerable time in their lives. Worse, they undermine the principle of social insurance, setting individuals off to fend for themselves without looking out for the needy.
Vice President Al Gore proposes to leave the basic system unchanged and would use general revenues to extend the life of the trust fund to about 2050. He ducks proposing tax hikes or benefit cuts that would be needed to solve the system's problems after that date. Indeed, he does the opposite by proposing new benefits for stay-at-home mothers and for widows and widowers, thereby increasing the financial strain on the system.
The wiser solution is for Congress to cut benefits and raise taxes modestly, which is all that would be needed to close the system's financial gap. Congress could require all state and local government workers to join the system, boosting its tax revenues. Congress could also raise the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax, now set at $76,200, to keep pace with the rising earnings of high-paid workers. It could invest Social Security surpluses in private, high-paying bonds, or allow the trust fund itself to invest in stocks.
Raising the payroll tax by, say, a half percentage point in 20 or 30 years or transferring a small fraction of general tax revenues into the trust fund would go a long way toward solving the problem. If these and similar measures do not close the entire gap, Congress could hasten the transition to the higher retirement age, 67, that Congress passed in the 1980's. The Social Security "crisis" is less drastic than it seems, and can be fixed with relatively modest changes.

HEADLINE: High Hopes, Backed by Investments

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
For many years, Robert Simmons would drive past a vacant lot near the eastern edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant and dream of opening a restaurant there. Subsidized homes were going up all around that area, but the people living in them had no place to go if they craved a sit-down meal.
Now they do. In July, Mr. Simmons opened Choices, an immaculate plant-filled family-style restaurant at the corner of Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue. It has purple awnings, floor-to-ceiling windows, roomy booths, a menu offering "soulful, West Indian, Caribbean and other cuisines," and long lines when Bedford-Stuyvesant's many church services end on Sundays. 
 And this is not the only new enterprise in the neighborhood displaying Mr. Simmons's signature purple awnings. He also owns the laundry next to the restaurant, a beauty parlor across the street and several businesses farther west on Fulton Street, including a health club, a billiards parlor, a smaller restaurant and a second laundry.
Altogether, Mr. Simmons says, he's plowed $3 million of his own money into Bedford-Stuyvesant, the proceeds from selling seven McDonald's franchises, two of them in the neighborhood.
Mr. Simmons, 52, was raised in St. Louis and worked for McDonald's for seven years before the company asked him to move to New York in 1988 to take over a franchise at Fulton Street and Throop Avenue. McDonald's arranged the financing that enabled him to get started.
Ultimately, Mr. Simmons said, he felt the need to strike out on his own. "I wanted to see if I could use my talents somewhere else," he said. "I no longer wanted to be boxed in to limited menu items or pricing structure -- the corporate thing."
Kathryn Wylde, the chief executive of the New York City Investment Fund, a private company that seeks to stimulate job growth, describes Mr. Simmons as a "pit bull personified."
Ms. Wylde helped Mr. Simmons get space for his Choices restaurant in a new strip mall developed under the Anchor program, a joint venture between the city and the New York City Partnership, a major civic group, that was financed by Chase Manhattan Bank.
"He saw the diversity of the market needs in his own community," Ms. Wylde said. "He has the focus and ability to execute that has allowed him to deliver businesses to meet those needs in very creative ways."
As an African-American, Mr. Simmons belongs to a group that is vastly underrepresented among business owners in New York. In a survey conducted two years ago, the New York City Investment Fund found that blacks owned only 2.9 percent of the businesses in the city with employees, even though they make up about 25 percent of the population. (Asians, by contrast, constitute about 7 percent of the population and own 7 percent of the businesses with employees.)
But Mr. Simmons is not the only entrepreneur with high hopes for Bedford-Stuyvesant. For five years, Monique Greenwood, the editor in chief of Essence magazine, and her husband, Glenn Pogue, a freelance broadcast engineer, have operated a bed-and-breakfast, the Akwaaba Mansion, on McDonough Street.
In 1998, they opened a restaurant, the Akwaaba Cafe, around the corner on Lewis Street. Since then, they have acquired all the properties adjacent to the cafe. They plan to operate a coffee lounge in one of the spaces. Their tenants will include Bedford-Stuyvesant's first bookstore and an antiques shop.
"We hope that we're providing the inspiration for other people to invest in businesses here," said Ms. Greenwood, who has lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant for a decade. "We have incredible homes, but we don't have the kinds of services that other people in other communities take for granted."

HEADLINE: In Bedford-Stuyvesant, The Boom Remains a Bust;
Neighborhood Development Unit Under Fire

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
It has been more than three decades since Senator Robert F. Kennedy cast a spotlight on the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn by making it the focus of a bold new economic development program. By uniting "the best of community action with the best of the private enterprise system," he said, a model urban neighborhood could arise from the ashes of "physical decay and human despair."
For a while, the plan worked. Its most visible achievement was the conversion of an abandoned milk bottling plant in the heart of the neighborhood into a shopping plaza and cultural center. But there was more: hundreds of homes were rehabilitated, thousands of jobs were created, the neighborhood got its first large supermarket in years (a Pathmark that is still operating), and I.B.M. brought in a computer cable production factory that once employed 450 people. 
 A generation later, however, the predominantly black New York neighborhood that is reaping the benefits of a robust economy is Harlem, not Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Far from being central to current political and economic plans for reviving neglected areas, Bedford-Stuyvesant has receded into the shadows, community leaders say. Some blame the perception of rampant crime, even though crime is down. Others say Harlem has more political clout in Washington.
But many people both inside and outside Bedford-Stuyvesant also say that the organization that was intended to help bring prosperity to central Brooklyn -- the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation -- has served as an impediment to progress, an entrenched and sluggish bureaucracy instead of a spark plug for local entrepreneurs and nationally known merchants. Even the organization's new board chairman, Albert C. Wiltshire, says that Restoration needs to be put back on course.
The lightning rod for some of the criticism is Roderick B. Mitchell, the president and chief executive of Restoration for the last 12 years. His detractors call him prickly and arrogant, incapable of working cooperatively with other community leaders and unwilling to endorse any proposal that does not give Restoration joint ownership. Some local business owners say he has opposed efforts to bring new jobs to the area.
But Mr. Mitchell, who has a master's degree in business from Columbia University, contends that the Restoration has grown steadily stronger under his stewardship, having weathered the crisis that almost killed it during the Reagan years, when its financing dried up.
He cited several new businesses in Restoration Plaza -- among them Score, a computer learning center for children, and a Sterling Optical Center -- and the organization's continuing support of several longstanding cultural programs, including an art gallery and two theaters. He also pointed to a long-term $9.8 million project, which is nearing completion, to make the fortresslike Restoration Plaza more inviting.
"Restoration was always intended to be a catalyst to improve the quality of life, and we have held true to that mission," Mr. Mitchell said. "We have not deviated one bit. There's no question about it, that Restoration's achievements over the past 30 years have been extraordinary. And when you look at the amount of money that we have had available to us, it's even more extraordinary."
Restoration, a nonprofit corporation, oversees 11 subsidiaries. In its early years, Mr. Mitchell said, an estimated 80 percent of the company's revenue came from government sources, but in more recent years, it has received most of its money from rent and other earnings, he said. Last year, according to documents filed with the state attorney general's office, Restoration received $1 million in government grants and raised $1.3 million privately.
But the organization's glory days seem to have ended. Once a model for about 2,000 community development corporations across the country, Restoration is now running large deficits ($990,000 this past fiscal year, and $1.6 million the year before). Restoration-sponsored construction has ceased, and the organization has managed to attract only a few new businesses to the neighborhood in recent years.
When I.B.M. moved out in 1993, the company was replaced by an employee-owned computer repair business, where only 30 people now work. During the last fiscal year, Restoration reported that it spent $2.6 million on its programs, only $130,000 of which was used for economic development.
"I don't want to say that Restoration has outlived its usefulness," said Carlton A. Brown, a developer and a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident. "But they are stuck in a time warp. The organization under Mr. Mitchell has just not been that effective."
Mr. Brown, who is developing a commercial and residential project in Harlem that is also sponsored by the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Housing Partnership, said that Mr. Mitchell had failed to take advantage of similar opportunities in Bedford-Stuyvesant. (Mr. Mitchell, however, said that building housing was not part of his organization's mission.)
Some of Bedford-Stuyvesant's problems are apparent on Fulton Street, the bustling main commercial thoroughfare. It has street vendors, 99-cent stores, beauty and nail salons, jewelry and liquor stores, but few essential services like dry cleaners and sit-down restaurants. There are no movie theaters, bookstores or record stores.
"Recently, I needed to get an antenna for my television set," said Joanne Jeffrey, a neighborhood resident who works for the Police Department. "I'm driving all over the place just to find an antenna. To me, that's ridiculous."
There are, of course, many other explanations for the slow pace of commercial development in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a community of about 140,000 people. Central Brooklyn, home to about 300,000 people, has no politician to match Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem congressman who was instrumental in freeing up hundreds of millions of federal, state and city dollars for the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. Unlike Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant never had a glamorous aura. Nor does it have the high density that many retailers seek.
To out-of-town retail executives (and many New Yorkers), Bedford-Stuyvesant is a still a scary place. Crime has decreased considerably in recent years, but not as much as elsewhere in the city, according to a study sponsored by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, an organization that assists community development corporations.
Some merchants remain fearful. Nadi Ali, the owner of a men's clothing store on Fulton Street whose name he did not want published, keeps three German shepherds in back of his store as protection against break-ins. "They need more security in the streets," he said.
But Felix Liz, the manager of Town of Bargains, a furniture store on Broadway, said the neighborhood had become far safer in the last six years. "You could not walk on the street like you're walking today," Mr. Liz said.
Bounded by Flushing Avenue on the north, Broadway and Saratoga on the east, Atlantic Avenue on the south, and Classon Avenue on the west, Bedford-Stuyvesant (then known simply as Bedford) was once a fashionable district and home to retail magnates like Abraham Abraham and F. W. Woolworth.
With its hundreds of blocks of beautifully tended turn-of-the-century brownstones, Bedford-Stuyvesant has better housing stock than Harlem, a higher degree of home ownership and a larger proportion of middle-class residents. Property values in Bedford-Stuyvesant are rising, fueled by an influx of professionals seeking the kind of space and architectural details that are priced beyond their means in more gentrified Brooklyn neighborhoods.
Bedford-Stuyvesant could support some of the amenities that are cropping up in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn: coffee bars, art galleries and other urban "eye candy," said Colvin W. Grannum, the chief executive of the Bridge Street Development Corporation, a church-affiliated group in Bedford-Stuyvesant that has worked closely with the New York City Housing Partnership to develop affordable housing.
But first the community has to advertise its strengths, he said. "Forty percent of the people are poor, and business people look at that and say, 'There is no way this is going to work,' " Mr. Grannum said. "But the other 60 percent is solid, working-class families, and there is even some affluence."
Mr. Mitchell of Restoration, who is paid $135,000 a year, said there was a "red line that still circles this community," making it very difficult to get financing for economic development. He said it was practically impossible to get national retailers to return telephone calls, much less tour the neighborhood.
But a number of people who have tried to work with Mr. Mitchell, in the financial community and nonprofit world, say he himself makes the job harder. Most, however, are afraid to take him on in public.
People who are willing to speak on the record fault Mr. Mitchell in particular for failing to exploit opportunities to create more of the small businesses that can begin to turn around a neighborhood's image. Robert Simmons, a former McDonald's franchise owner who operates seven small businesses in Bedford-Stuyvesant -- all financed with his own capital -- said Mr. Mitchell rejected his proposal to develop long-vacant property at Fulton Street and Albany Avenue into a restaurant. Mr. Simmons said that Mr. Mitchell was "contributing to the negative look of the neighborhood by letting that building stay vacant."
Mr. Mitchell acknowledged that he told Mr. Simmons he had other plans for the parcel. "I can understand why Robert would be disturbed or even upset because he had a plan and that was a potential site," Mr. Mitchell said. "But then, we have a potential plan and a strategy also that we want to put in place. It doesn't mean that what Robert is doing I don't value."
Mr. Mitchell declined to disclose how he would use the site. "Our strategic plan is for internal purposes," he said.
Other people say Mr. Mitchell is wasting an asset right in Restoration Plaza: a recording studio in the basement that was once known as the Platinum Factory. Mr. Brown, the Harlem developer, said he got the brush-off when he tried to help a music producer lease the studio. Kevin A. Griffith, a former engineer at the Platinum Factory, filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Mitchell reneged on a deal to revive the recording studio and never returned a $25,000 investment.
Mr. Mitchell said he planned to move the recording studio, because the A train runs below it. He had no comment on the lawsuit.
Mr. Mitchell has also come under attack for resisting a union drive by handymen, porters and superintendents employed by Restoration. In March, the employees voted to become part of Teamsters Local 966.
Maintaining that he has been a friend to local entrepreneurs, Mr. Mitchell said that Restoration had lent more than $500,000 to small businesses in Brooklyn since 1995, including $150,000 to finance the Sterling Optical store (which is jointly owned by Restoration). One of the beneficiaries of the loan program was Howell Petroleum, a company that distributed automotive lubricant but was seeking to expand and become a general contractor.
Nevertheless, Bill Howell, the president and chief executive of the company, now known as Howell Industries, and a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident, said that Restoration had failed to take a leadership role in bringing the community better retail services, a shortcoming that was underscored when no one from the organization showed up at a recent "economic summit meeting" made up of numerous church and neighborhood groups.
Mr. Mitchell said he did not know of such a meeting.
"I always viewed Restoration as the center of the community for economic development," Mr. Howell said. "I think it's falling short. A lot more can be done."
Mr. Howell said he expected Restoration to turn around under Mr. Wiltshire, who was elected board chairman in March. Mr. Wiltshire, the manager of government relations for Consolidated Edison and a board member of three other community organizations, also said that Restoration needed to work cooperatively with other groups.
Mr. Wiltshire said he planned to hire a consultant to subject Restoration to the kind of scrutiny it has not previously encountered. The organization's board, of which he has been a member of 13 years, "needs to be proactive, as opposed to reactive," he said.
"I don't think the board has lived up to its responsibilities," he said, "and that includes me."

Chart: "Striving and Struggling In Brooklyn"
In the 19th century, the entire neighborhood, then one of the most fashionable addresses in New York, was known as Bedford. Beginning in the early 1900's, the name was applied primarily to the western section; the eastern section, where some of the most elegant brownstones were situated became known as Stuyvesant. As newer suburbs opened up elsewhere in the city after World War I, Bedford attracted less-affluent residents with diverse ethnic backgrounds. The neighborhood soon took on the hyphenated name Bedford-Stuyvesant.

HEADLINE: In a Changed Texas, Ranchers Battle Oilmen

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Tex., May 24

 BODY:
For nearly a century, the compact between ranchers and oilmen created the huge wealth that built modern Texas. The ranchers owned the land, the wildcatters found the oil, and everyone got rich together. Oil money built universities and football stadiums, gaudy hotels and world-class art museums.
Even today, an estimated one million people in Texas receive some sort of oil or gas royalty check. 
 But oil is no longer king in Texas, and as the economy has changed, the state has grappled with a less glamorous legacy of the high-flying days. There are 25,000 abandoned oil wells in Texas, an additional 15,000 sitting idle and tens of thousands of others that could be leaking and threatening underground aquifers at a time when drought has made water the state's most precious natural resource.
Now, the ranchers and the oil producers, the mythic figures of modern Texas, are fighting over cleaning up the mess. A growing number of prominent ranchers, including former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and the caretakers of the fabled King Ranch, are organizing against the oil industry, seeking changes in environmental and royalty laws, and portraying state regulators as toothless. Oil producers, on the other hand, say the landowners are just grabbing for money as the industry is only now recovering from its latest downturn.
"Some of these guys are out here biting the hand that fed them," said John Bell, an independent oil producer.
In the Texas of old, what was good for Big Oil was considered good for Texas. But attitudes are gradually changing as industries like high technology and health care lead the state's thriving economy. In recent months, citizens' groups in central Texas have fought plans to reopen a 700-mile underground gas pipeline, fearing that a leak could pollute the region's water source. In Houston, a new generation of business leaders, alarmed by the city's smog problem, is calling for solutions that include sharp reductions in pollution from nearby refineries.
Here in the harsh mesquite desert of West Texas, where the underground sea of crude oil known as the Permian Basin once made Midland a boom town, the bravado of the bygone era is not yet gone. Thousands of oil pumps still bob slowly up and down in the surrounding flat terrain, where the average summer temperatures exceed 100 degrees. Hotels still decorate rooms with paintings of oil wells.
A huge white Cadillac rumbling down Big Spring Street summarized the enduring local sentiment with a bumper sticker: "Wake Up America: For Our Security We Need American Oil."
Inside his office at the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, the executive director, Morris Burns, brightened at the memory of the region's past influence. "This was what won World War II," Mr. Burns said, recalling that the Permian Basin produced 25 percent of the world's oil to keep the American war machine going.
But production peaked in 1972, the oil bust came in the 1980's, and in the 1990's oil production in Texas dropped by a third. The recent spike in oil prices has helped producers recover from the disastrously low prices of 1998, but the overall trend is the slow decline of what analysts describe as a "mature" industry. For more than a decade, the major oil companies have been pulling out of West Texas, and this week Mr. Burns wearily absorbed another defection, as ARCO announced it would close its local office, which employs 165 people.
The newfound public advocacy of the ranchers is only the latest blow. Like so many in the oil industry, Mr. Burns says he suspects that trial lawyers in search of a new source of fees may account for part of it. He acknowledged that a small number of "bad actors" in the oil industry had behaved irresponsibly, but he said many of them had left the business over the past decade as regulations tightened.
"Producers have become much more environmentally aware in the last 15 years," Mr. Burns said.
Yet drive an hour west of Midland, past tiny oil towns like Goldsmith and the aptly named Notrees, and the environmental legacy is evident on the 174,000-acre Frying Pan Ranch. The property's owner, D. K. Boyd, bought it four years ago, adding it to his five other ranches in West Texas and New Mexico.
In all, his properties contain more than 2,000 oil wells. But when Mr. Boyd hired a San Antonio environmental consulting company to audit his properties, it found about 1,000 contaminated sites, with environmental damage estimated at more than $25 million.
There is heated disagreement about who is responsible for the mess, and Mr. Boyd is tied up in fiercely contested litigation with several of the oil producers leasing mineral rights on his property.
But regardless of blame, a short tour of the Frying Pan reveals obvious examples of the problems that ranchers say exist across Texas. A tank where crude oil is separated from salt water has spilled into the surrounding soil. A pipeline that burst a few weeks ago has left a brown stain across a 50-yard section. Mr. Boyd's ranch foreman, Bill Warbois, said some oil companies did little more than dump dirt to cover up the problems.
"That's wet oil," Mr. Warbois said, pinching some of the brown sand between his fingers. "You can smell it. You can pick that dirt up and literally squeeze the oil out of it."
Mr. Boyd, who ran his own independent oil company for 20 years, said the city of Midland had approached him about water rights in recent weeks for an aquifer that extends more than 20,000 acres beneath the Frying Pan. He said that he had not thoroughly tested the water source, but that a handful of test wells had shown some evidence of contamination.
"Water is more valuable than oil and gas, and becoming more so every day," Mr. Boyd said.
Vince Matthews, director for the Center for Energy and Economic Development at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin in Midland, said many of the wells on ranches like the Frying Pan had been drilled by the major oil companies more than 50 years ago and were now inevitably showing signs of deterioration. Mr. Matthews said smaller independent oil companies eagerly bought the properties with the exodus of the major concerns, but they did so as federal regulation tightened and environmental awareness started to take hold.
"The large oil companies saw this coming," Mr. Matthews said. "They said, 'We don't need this. We can go to plenty of places around the world, find bigger reserves, and we don't have to put up with this litigious society.' "
Environmental complaints have grown steadily in the past decade. Richard Lowerre, an environmental lawyer in Austin, said lawsuits over the contamination of ground water had become more common, particularly in West Texas. Oil companies often settle cases with an agreement requiring landowners not to disclose the terms, Mr. Lowerre said.
In 1997, the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil industry, reported 77 cases of ground water contamination from oil and natural gas activities, the majority of them in the Permian Basin, the most drought-stricken section of the state. In 1998, the commission received 976 complaints of oil field pollution from landowners.
In November, a number of prominent ranchers and large landowners founded the Texas Land and Mineral Owners Association. The approximately 500 members, who control millions of acres, include many from the ranching families that helped found Texas.
"This has never happened before in Texas," said Doug Beveridge, who manages land and oil leases for the King Ranch in South Texas. "You have never had landowners come together like this, exclusively. It should have happened 10 years ago."
Property rights are a passionate political issue in Texas, and in broad terms, the landowners are concerned primarily with pollution cleanup and royalties and their belief that the regulatory and legal landscape favors the oil and natural gas companies.
In Texas, unlike in many states, land ownership is severed between the surface and the minerals below. As a result, a landowner may or may not control the rights to any oil or natural gas below the ground. The oil companies sign leases with mineral owners, which grant them rights to drill wells and build pipelines. The mineral owners are paid royalties on any oil or gas production, while the landowners usually receive only a one-time payment of several thousand dollars for the use of their land.
In many cases, including that of Mr. Boyd, landowners also hold most of the mineral rights on their property. Usually, a company will sign a surface damage agreement with a landowner that stipulates cleanup responsibilities. But many landowners say there are companies that disregard the agreements or refuse to sign one.
The state requires that oil companies seal a well with cement plugs once production has stopped in order to prevent contaminants from escaping. The cost of plugging a well usually runs as much as $4,500. But some companies have just abandoned wells unplugged, particularly since 1998, when low prices drove many smaller independent companies to bankruptcy.
The landowners' association is lobbying for new laws addressing concerns about royalties and the legal rights of landowners in disputes over property damage, Mr. Beveridge said. The group is also proposing a bill to block oil and natural gas companies from abandoning wells.
The Texas Legislature has sporadically addressed the problem of abandoned wells by, among other things, passing a law that imposed a fee on oil and natural gas production to pay for plugging them. Last year, the state plugged about 1,600 wells. But declining production has meant fewer dollars coming into the cleanup fund. Oil companies also benefit from a state program that allows them to pay $100 for annual extensions on plugging wells. In some cases, companies have used these extensions to delay plugging for years. Officials estimate that 15,000 wells remain idle and unplugged because of this program.
Public attention to the problems was heightened in September when The San Antonio Express-News published a series of articles detailing the full scope of the problem. The Express-News series also explored the historically friendly relationship between the railroad commission and the oil industry. The commission's three members are elected and often receive large contributions from oil producers.
"Historically, there has been a great deal of cynicism, and people have characterized the railroad commission as a captive agency," said Tony Garza, a Republican member of the commission since 1998. "From time to time, their concerns have been extremely borne out."
In recent months, Mr. Garza has pushed the commission to be more aggressive in addressing abandoned wells and has met with resistance. At last month's commission meeting, Mr. Garza's proposal to curtail the $100 program was never brought to a vote. In the coming days, the commission's chairman, Michael Williams, is expected to make a recommendation on the fee program based on the findings of a commission he appointed to address the issue.
Just as the oil industry is declining, so, too, are many cattle ranches across Texas. Jan Wheelis, whose family has owned the McFaddin Ranch in Victoria County in South Texas since 1840, said she must find every way imaginable for her land to make money. She is considering harvesting mesquite trees, and she has leased hunting rights.
"You can make more money off hunting than oil in this place," Ms. Wheelis said.
Ms. Wheelis still keeps 250 head of cattle, but she has found that the drought makes it increasingly difficult to do so.
And so, she said, does the legacy of oil. Many of the 57 wells on her land are abandoned. Last month, she filed a suit against two companies, claiming that their failure to mend broken pipelines and other problems had created an environmental mess. In all, Ms. Wheelis said, she had lost 40 of her 2,664 acres to contamination.
Driving toward a lake of old cypress trees recently, Ms. Wheelis stopped her truck and listened to a metallic sound coming from a neighboring property.
"They're drilling another well," she said, and she drove away.

HEADLINE: Tax Incentive Approved For 'Green' Buildings

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
New York State has taken the lead in making commercial and residential buildings more efficient and more in harmony with the environment by adopting a "green building credit" against state income taxes.
The credit, which was included in the state budget signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki on May 15, is intended to encourage building owners and developers to use advanced technologies like fuel cells and photovoltaic panels to generate electricity and to use materials that improve air quality inside buildings. 
 "This is a huge deal," said Robert F. Fox Jr., a partner in Fox & Fowle Architects, which specializes in environmentally sensitive design. "Basically, the state is offering to pay developers for the excess costs of doing green buildings."
Green buildings are generally defined as those that use energy more efficiently than those with conventional designs and that provide workers with well-lighted spaces furnished with an abundance of clean air. One of the objectives of designing a green building is to avoid using carpets, paints or other interior materials that can release harmful chemicals after being installed.
The credit is limited to a total of $25 million for all projects over five years. It was advocated by an unusual alliance, including the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents owners, developers and brokers, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, a major environmental advocacy group. Similar bills are in the works in Maryland and California, but New York's law appears to be the first, according to the council.
"This collaborative effort is a prototype for other states and eventually the federal government to follow," said Deborah B. Beck, the executive vice president of the Real Estate Board.
The legislation provides a credit of 5 percent of the capitalized cost of a project -- up to $3.75 per square foot for interior work and $7.50 per square foot for exterior work -- to builders who meet energy goals and use nontoxic materials in construction. To qualify, a building must meet requirements for energy use, indoor air quality, waste disposal and water use.
There is also a credit equivalent to 10 percent of the cost of new air-conditioning equipment that uses refrigerants that do not harm the ozone layer. There are additional credits for tenants who build their interior space to conform with the goals.
Builders using fuel cells and photovoltaic panels, which produce electricity without the pollution associated with conventional power sources, are eligible for special additional credits. Both technologies also have the potential to produce power more cheaply than conventional methods, but they tend to be more costly because they are less developed.
"The point of the legislation is to jump-start industries," Ms. Beck said. "We want to go from custom installations to mass production. We want to bring more people into the marketplace and make it more competitive."
Fuel cells produce electricity by consuming natural gas in a catalytic process that does not burn the fuel. The only emissions are carbon dioxide and water, in contrast to the mixture of chemicals flowing from the stacks of plants burning fossil fuels. The technology is evolving rapidly, Mr. Fox said. "In five years, fuel cells will be able to provide power at one-third the current cost," he said.
Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity with no emissions at all. Although individually they do not produce much power, they can replace conventional materials in the skin of a building, and when wired together they can produce usable amounts of power without any expenditure for fuel.
Douglas Durst, whose Conde Nast building at the corner of 42nd Street and Broadway incorporates both fuel cells and photovoltaic panels, welcomed the legislation, but had some reservations. Because there is a yearly limit on the total tax credits that can be claimed, he said, there should be a way of preventing one big project from absorbing most of one year's allotment.
Participants in the discussions about the legislation said the five-year limit of $25 million was inserted to demonstrate fiscal prudence. But they said the cap might be raised or the time period extended if the program is successful.
Mr. Durst also said a mechanism needs to be developed "to help smaller builders who do not know to apply these technologies."
He said his company, the Durst Organization, would continue to incorporate green technologies in future projects despite a delay in financial benefits other developers find unacceptable. "We are a family business that is building for the next generation, so we don't mind long paybacks," he said.
Investments in advanced technology in the Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square allow the company to operate it more economically than conventional structures, Mr. Durst said.
William Rudin, whose Rudin Management Company is building a headquarters for Reuters at Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street, said the building incorporated technologies included in the legislation.
He said that the wiring in the building can use power from fuel cells and photovoltaic panels and that space has been allocated to install the cells.
The Reuters building also includes filters to improve indoor air quality and glass that resists ultraviolet rays, reducing the amount of power needed for cooling.
Daniel R. Tishman, the president of Tishman Construction, which managed the construction of both buildings, was part of a group of businessmen and environmentalists who helped draft the tax credit. "Since it costs a bit more up front," he said, "we wanted to design an incentive -- like an investment tax credit -- to encourage developers and landlords to do what's right for the environment."
Mr. Fox, who was the architect for both buildings, said the tax credits would pay 30 percent of the cost of buying fuel cells, less federal or state grants. And, he said, they would pay for 100 percent of the cost of the solar power panels, minus the cost of building materials that would have been used otherwise.

HEADLINE: Blighted Areas Are Revived As Crime Rate Falls in Cities

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 26

 BODY:
With the historic drop in violent crime beginning to take hold in even the most blighted urban areas, cities across the country are being transformed, as neighborhoods that had become frightening wastelands are showing glimmers of renaissance.
From Boston to New Orleans and Los Angeles to Miami, neighborhoods where drug gangs controlled the streets, commandeered empty houses and terrorized residents are beginning to seem safer and more livable, according to interviews with people in nine cities that have seen sharp drops in violent crime. 
 New homes are being built, stores are opening, subway and bus lines are adding service, and banks and shopping strips are breaking ground. There is less graffiti and fewer abandoned cars and vacant lots. And, for the first time in years, people are sitting on their front porches and parents feel safe letting their children walk to school.
In the U Street neighborhood of Washington, the subway system is operating later at night, and an organic grocery store and a private jazz club with a $2,500 annual membership fee are to open soon. In the Oakwood section of Los Angeles, forbidding eight-foot fences are being replaced with lower picket fences and other inviting designs. And in the Overtown and Liberty City neighborhoods of Miami, textile plants, production studios and a food processing plant are opening.
Especially striking is that people are beginning to move to these neighborhoods from more stable urban areas and the suburbs, the interviews suggest.
"There is a sense that cities are safer," said Robert Sampson, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. "And there is a return to the city among not just empty nesters, but people with kids."
Most of these neighborhoods are still struggling with crime and poverty. But the improvements have taken on such momentum that they do not appear to be slowed by increases in some violent crimes in several cities last year, including Boston, Houston, New York, San Antonio and San Diego.
In Chicago, surveys conducted by a Northwestern University political scientist, Wesley G. Skogan, have found that in the sections of the city where crime has declined sharply, primarily African-American neighborhoods on the South and West Sides, there have been "extremely large increases in the quality of life," Professor Skogan said.
He said residents in those neighborhoods had reported a lessening of drug and gang activity, declines in public drinking, loitering and disorder in the schools and streets that were cleaner and had fewer abandoned buildings and cars.
Changes like that were clear last week in one neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. In a city where neighborhoods are a source of strong local pride, this section about five miles west of the Loop did not even have a name until recently and had virtually fallen off the map, longtime residents say. Now they say the area has revived enough to be considered part of the Tri-Taylor neighborhood, which is near the University of Illinois.
"We were considered nowhere really," said Nancy Echevarria, 46, who has lived on Taylor Street almost all her life. "The neighborhood was taboo. It was like the O.K. Corral here. Gangs of 30 guys would position themselves right on the street selling drugs."
Ms. Echevarria and her husband, Fidel, who are raising two children, ages 7 and 9, and a granddaughter, age 3, used to call the police frequently, and in retaliation, she said, gang members put a bullet through her front door a couple of years ago.
But in the last few years, the rampant crime in the police district that includes the neighborhood dropped more than in any other section of Chicago, 36 percent from 1992 to 1998, police figures show. Ms. Echevarria said she sees far fewer drug dealers and there is only one vacant house left on her block. On Taylor Street, $350,000 condominiums are being built, and the value of three houses owned by Ms. Echevarria has skyrocketed, to more than $150,000 each from about $15,000 some 10 years ago.
Her children skate and bicycle on the streets, which have new sidewalks. "The other day," she said, "it was so nice to come out in the morning and just sit and hear the birds."
Experts say such progress results from a number of social and economic factors that have helped bring the decrease in crime and are benefiting from it. The booming economy has created so much urban development that builders and businesses are venturing farther away from well-established neighborhoods into ones that were on the edge of livability.
Cities are using budget surpluses to offer tax incentives to businesses that open in these areas. And in some places, like Chicago, other major changes are under way in these communities, including changes in schools and the dismantling of huge, crime-plagued housing projects, like Rockwell Gardens, not far from Ms. Echevarria's home.
With less crime, there have been more jobs. In Miami, Frank R. Nero, the president of the Beacon Council, a private, nonprofit economic development agency, said factories and other businesses had been moving into neighborhoods like Overtown and Liberty City.
"Investors are starting to feel more comfortable," Mr. Nero said. "The more investment you have in an area, the safer it is and the safer it will become."
In addition, as things improve and as new policing strategies concentrate on community outreach, residents have become more willing to cooperate with the police, which has helped reduce crime.
Henry Flack, who has lived in the Skyline Park neighborhood of San Antonio for 15 years, said he sees the police on patrol much more often and has developed more of a relationship with them.
"I know them, and they know me," Mr. Flack said as he sat on his porch the other day. "If they've got a problem, they let me know, and if I've got a problem, I know just who to call."
There was a shooting near his house several days ago, he said. "The police came by and told me that a kid had shot at another bunch of kids and I said, 'Oh, that would be so-and-so who lives in that green house over there,' " he said. "They had that deal wrapped up in a couple of hours."
In city after city, the changes are seeping into the fabric of neighborhood life.
In the Uphams Corner section of Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, an area known for crimes like the 1992 slaying of a man who was eating dinner with his wife at the Tasty Chicken restaurant, drug houses have been shut down and businesses have opened, including a children's clothing shop and a housewares store. Youth programs have sprung up, a park that used to be littered with used condoms and drug needles is being renovated, and the community has begun sponsoring a street festival.
"I see fewer bars on windows," said Jan Mattimoe, a middle-school teacher who helps organize a community improvement project. "This spring I've seen more flowers in this area than I've ever seen. There is real desire to get out there and make things look pretty."
In Washington's U Street neighborhood, Cici Mukhtar, the owner of a cafe, said she was glad to have a fancy organic supermarket and an exclusive jazz club moving in. That is all part of what has made the neighborhood more attractive, she said.
"It's amazing, just amazing what's happening here," Ms. Mukhtar said.
Myra Power, 28, who lived in the neighborhood from 1991 until moving to New York in 1997, was back last week, looking for work and a place to live. She said she noticed a huge change.
"When I lived here, I wouldn't leave home without my Mace," Ms. Power said.
Now, children stay out late playing basketball and waiting in line to use the playground swings. Construction crews are busy renovating old buildings and building new ones.
Ms. Powers said her friends now leave belongings out on their porches. "It used to be that the only thing they'd leave out was barbed wire," she said.
Instead of worrying about break-ins, she said, they fret over how to plant the most attractive garden.
In New Orleans, the crack houses and blighted buildings that choked the city's Irish Channel neighborhood are beginning to give way to avant-garde galleries, clothing shops and even a designer jewelry shop on Lower Magazine Street.
"There used to be a grocery next door that would sell one beer and one cigarette, and there was a pay phone there, so there was a lot of loitering," said Patty Spinale, who opened her lingerie shop, House of Lounge, on Lower Magazine Street two years ago. "The neighborhood has really significantly cleaned up in the last two years, in terms of people investing in it. More tourists are comfortable with venturing into the neighborhood."
And in Houston, Capt. Mark L. Curran, commander of the Eastside Division for the Police Department, said he hears evidence of improvement in the complaints he fields at civic club meetings.
"Back in the early 90's, it was rape and burglaries," Captain Curran said. "Now it's, 'I want you to take care of my neighbor's barking dog.' "
But as their neighborhoods have become more attractive, some residents have found themselves pushed out, along with the criminals.
The end of the gang warfare that had terrorized the Oakwood section of Los Angeles, just blocks from Venice Beach, meant safer streets in an area that had been the city's only black neighborhood near the ocean.
It has also meant that some people who had lived there for more than 30 years lost their leases, as landlords sold property to affluent newcomers or raised rents.
"Up and down the street you see whites walking these days," said Melvyn Hayward Sr., a neighborhood organizer and director of the Vera Davis Community Center. "In 20 years, you would never see that. They wouldn't come down here."
The changes are still quite new in most of these neighborhoods, and some residents are skeptical that the improvements will endure.
"There is still crime," said Cynthia Harris, a case worker for a health center, who lives in Uphams Corner in Boston. "My son finds needles in the driveway where he plays. And if I had an opportunity to move, I would."
In the Taylor Street neighborhood of Chicago, one developer, Senan Nugent, hires gang members to watch his properties so that other gang members will not steal plumbing pipes and supplies.
Still, Mr. Nugent and others say they would not be there if they were not convinced that it was a safe, promising place to invest.
Dr. Dave Williams bought a new three-unit condominium on Taylor Street for $367,000 this year, and he is renting it and three other buildings to students at the University of Illinois and employees at Rush Presbyterian Hospital. The renters are people who would not have dared live here in the past, Dr. Williams said. Many of the students come from the suburbs and drive sport utility vehicles, but they have no trouble getting their parents to co-sign their leases.
And although he put up high wrought-iron fences with electronic security systems at the condominium, he said that only 2 of his 12 tenants bothered to turn on their systems. "We were actually quite skeptical and nervous when we first invested," said Dr. Williams, an emergency room physician who lives downtown. "But things have gotten steadily better. It's really one of Chicago's new frontiers now."

HEADLINE: Words of Advice for Graduates on the Threshold of the Millennium

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
Legend has it that the longest commencement address, said to have been given in the early days of Harvard University, lasted six hours -- the first three in Latin, the latter in Greek. The shortest, alternately attributed to Andy Rooney or Woody Allen, was just two sentences: "We've given you a perfect world. Don't screw it up." 
 Every spring, they parade to the podiums of colleges and universities across the country, offering sage advice -- or at least a few one-liners. Poets and politicians. Athletes and artists. Diplomats and do-gooders.
This year seemed an especially auspicious opportunity for keynoters, as the Class of 2000, the first of the new millennium, switched their tassels from side to side.
They spoke of global responsibility -- to end poverty, fight disease, keep peace. They talked about technology, its gifts and its perils. They marveled at society's progress -- and questioned whether it has been swift enough in the field of human relations. They urged graduates to value time over money: "You must place interest in principle above interest on principal," Julian Bond, the chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., said at Washington University in St. Louis.
Many mentioned their own parents, and nearly all promised to keep their speeches shorter than the ones they could not remember from their own commencements. "I intend to stop speaking before you stop listening," George J. Mitchell, the former senator from Maine, told his audience at Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania.
Following are excerpts.
 
Seamus Heaney
Nobel laureate. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.
There is a dreamlike quality to every commencement day. But the veil trembles more mysteriously if you are graduating in the year 2000. It makes you wonder if the date is a destiny or an accident. A turning point in your life coincided with a turning point in our era. It is like the moment when a tide has risen to its highest and then rests: everything is at the full and yet everything is volatile.
You stand at a boundary. Behind you is your natural habitat, as it were, the ground of your creaturely being, the old haunts where you were nurtured; in front of you is a less knowable prospect of invitation and challenge, the testing ground of your possibilities. You stand between whatever binds you to your past and whatever might be unbounded in your future.
 
Anita Hill
Professor. Simmons College, Boston.
 First question that I want to ask you is, and I want you to really seriously ponder this, are you happy with the person you are today?
Did you keep the promises you made to yourself and apply all of your energies and resources to soak up every ounce of learning and life at Simmons and Boston? And on your way to this degree, did you help a child learn to read or do long division or, more likely today, write a computer program?
Did you visit an elder, listen to her story and learn to see the world vividly through dimmed and failing eyes? Did you maintain, or in some cases develop, a sense of humor, especially about yourself and even more importantly about the difficulties life sometimes brings?
And finally, on your way to your current learned state, did you remember to keep those parts from birth that endeared you to your family -- the innocence, the wonder, the naivete? . . .
Now I'm sure you're asking yourself, "What's with all the questions? Classes are over!" Well, consider this the last exam that you will have, and it's one you don't even have to take. It certainly isn't going to be graded; it's a self-examination.
 
Julian Bond
N.A.A.C.P. chairman. Washington University, St. Louis.
If we can shrink the world's population to a village of only 100 people, keeping all existing ratios the same, that village would look like this: there would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the Western Hemisphere -- north and south -- and 21 Africans; 52 would be female; 70 would be nonwhite and 30 white; 70 would be non-Christian and 30 would be Christian.
Six of the 100 people would own 59 percent of all the wealth in the world, and all 6 of those people would be from the United States. Eighty of the 100 people would live in substandard housing. Seventy would be unable to read and write. Fifty would suffer from malnutrition. One would have a college education.

Bill Amend
Cartoonist. Amherst College, Amherst, Mass.
For a graduating senior, it's got to be like music from heaven to hear that an Amherst education can actually lead to a job where you can wear sweats all day, sleep in late, play your stereo all you want, and get paid lots of money to draw silly little pictures in between games of Quake on your computer. . . .
Knowing you have an audience, especially one that matters to you, can be utterly paralyzing. The fear of failure, the weight of expectation, the indecision that comes from striving for perfection can transform even simple tasks into brain-melting impossibilities. But knowing you have an audience can also elevate you to do more than you might otherwise. And to do it better. To consider what you're doing from more that one view.
As a syndicated cartoonist, I have a huge audience. They tell me it's over 25 million readers. This might be cause for a little intimidation were it not for my handy science background reminding me that this is merely one 250-billionth the number of sodium ions in a single grain of salt. Trust me, anybody can write for salt.
 
Henry G. Cisneros
President of Univision Communications. Occidental College, Los Angeles.
Over the years I have learned that the people who are the most successful, the people I have admired the most, are not necessarily those who are the most brilliant, or witty, or have mastered a particular discipline, but those who had the stamina to stay the course over a long period of time. . . . It's like the difference between the shooting star that flashes across the sky and is gone -- you're not even sure it was there -- and the North Star that is there every night, night after night.
 
Desmond Tutu
Retired Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa. Brandeis University, Waltham, Mass.
You know the story of the farmer who in his backyard had chicken, and then he had a chicken that was a little odd looking. . . . It behaved like a chicken. It was pecking away like other chickens. It didn't know that there was a blue sky overhead and a glorious sunshine until someone who was knowledgeable in these things came along and said to the farmer, "Hey, that's no chicken. That's an eagle." . . .
And this man took this strange-looking chicken and climbed the mountain and waited until sunrise. And then he turned this strange-looking chicken towards the sun and said, "Eagle, fly, eagle." And the strange-looking chicken shook itself, spread out its pinions and lifted off and soared and soared and soared and flew away, away into the distance.

George F. Will
Columnist. Lafayette College, Easton, Pa.
The demoralization of society is advanced when the word "values" supplants the word "virtues" in political and ethical contexts. When we move beyond talk of good and evil, when the categories virtue and vice are transcended, we are left with the thin gruel of values talk.
Unlike virtues, everyone has lots of values. Everyone has as many as they choose! Hitler had lots of values. George Washington had virtues.
Values are an equal-opportunity business. They are mere choices. In contrast, virtues are habits, difficult to develop and therefore not accessible to all. Therefore, speaking of virtues rather than values is elitist, offensive to democracy's egalitarian, leveling ethos, which I say is precisely why talk of virtues should be revived and talk of values should be abandoned.
The purpose of American higher education is not to serve as a values cafeteria where young people are encouraged to pick whichever strikes their fancy. Rather, the purpose of higher education for citizens of a democracy should be to help them identify excellence in its various realms and to understand what virtues make it so.
 
George J. Mitchell
Former senator. Washington & Jefferson College, Washington, Pa.
John Gardner put it best when he wrote: "An excellent plumber is infinitely more admirable than an incompetent philosopher. The society which scorns excellence in plumbing because plumbing is a humble activity, and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity, will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy. Neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water."
 
Madeleine K. Albright
Secretary of state. University of California at Berkeley.
During the century just passed, we humans learned how to transplant hearts, fly spaceships, clone sheep and squeeze a library's worth of data into a single slender disk.
But as world events reflect, we remain far from mastering the art of human relations. We have invented no technology that will guide us to the destinations that matter most.
After two world wars, the Holocaust, multiple genocides and countless conflicts, we must ask how long it will be before we are able to rise above the national, racial and gender distinctions that divide us and embrace the common humanity that binds us.
The answer depends not on the stars of some mysterious forces of history; it depends on the choices that you and I and all of us make.
 
Benjamin S. Carson
Pediatric neurosurgeon. Ursinus College, Collegeville, Pa.
How many of you remember your birthday? Can I just see your hands? . . . Now what did your brain have to do for you to respond to that question?
Give you an example of the sophistication of your brain: First of all the sound waves had to leave my lips, enter your auditory meatus, travel down to the tympanic membrane, set up a vibratory force, which traveled across the ossicles of your middle ear to the oval and round windows, setting up a vibratory force in the endolymph, which mechanically distorted the microcilia, converting mechanical energy to electrical energy, which traveled across the cochlear nerve to the cochlear nucleus to the pons-to-medullary juncture, from there to the superior olivary nucleus ascending bilaterally up the brain stem to the lateral lemniscus and the anterior colliculus and the medial geniculate nuclei across the thalamic radiations to the posterior temporal lobes, going through the frontal lobes, coming down the . . .
Anyway! You get the point. And that's the simplified version of what your brain had to do. It can do much more complex things than that and you barely have to think about it. So with a brain like that, why would anybody ever utter the words "I can't?"
 
Judy Chicago
Artist. Smith College, Northampton, Mass.
I believe that one of the pernicious lies that has been told to your generation is that one can have it all. Although I can't explain how I knew it, I always knew that this was not possible. Again, I looked to history and discovered that those women who had achieved at the level at which I had set my sights had been childless and those that were not had suffered constant guilt at not being able to meet the demands of both their work and their children. And, believe me, I understand the irony of bringing this up on Mother's Day.
Although I would be the first to say that this situation is not a fair one, I must also state that I would hate for you to discover that choices must be made after you had already made those whose consequences will shape your life for years to come. I believe that it is important to be clear about your goals and to be willing to shape your life in a way that makes them possible to achieve.
 
John Wallach
Founder of Seeds of Peace. University of Southern Maine, Portland.
In a vastly expanding global economy with ever faster and faster communication, there is also a danger we'll lose touch with each other, with our own humanity. People may become pixels on a screen. You can already stay home, or as that full-page ad shows, be on the summit of a mountain in Nevada with your laptop, and e-mail the office, get your paycheck via satellite, pay your bills and order what you want and have it delivered -- without getting up out of your chair. You can access your e-mail or eBay or stocks or sports scores on your cell phone. Soon you'll be able to read an electronic book with e-ink, then plug the book in, delete its contents and receive another whole book.
Internet Telephony will soon revolutionize chat rooms. You'll be able to go online and chat with someone in China -- and see them. You'll be able to learn creative writing from Stephen King himself. Today, you can already have sex on the Internet, without the trauma of being rejected.
Are we entering an era when you will never really touch or feel another human being? . . . Will we use this new technology to become closer? Or farther apart?
 
Oprah Winfrey
Talk-show host. Salem College, Winston-Salem, N.C.
What is your purpose, what is your calling? . . .
What I know for sure is if you ask the question the answer will come. What I know for sure is, you have to be willing to listen for the answer. You have to get still enough to learn it and hear it and pay attention, to be fully conscious enough to see not just with your eyes but through them to the truth of who you are and what you can be.
What I know for sure is, you cannot run your life without surrender. . . . What I know for sure is that God can dream a bigger dream for you than you can dream for yourself. Surrender to the universe's dream for you. . . .
What I know for sure? You cannot let other people define your life for you. You are the author of your own life and your job is to align your will with that which is the greater will. . . .
You know what real power is? Real power is when you are doing exactly you are supposed to be doing the best it can be done. Authentic power. There's a surge, there's a kind of energy field that says, "I'm in my groove. I'm in my groove." And nobody has to tell you, "You go girl," because, you know, you're already gone.
 
Herbert W. Boyer
Founder of Genentech Inc. University of Pittsburgh.
One thing we have come to know is that our genes are not very different from many of our fellow travelers. Genes can be interchanged between man, mice, yeast and fruit flies. . . . Wonder is what sets us apart from all other life forms. . . . No other species wonders about the meaning of existence or the complexity of the universe or themselves. . . .
It can be argued that we will never understand anything in complete detail. Our knowledge is cumulative and ever changing. If we manage to survive and evolve we have about five billion years to work on it. It is difficult to imagine a world in which there is nothing left to wonder about.
 
Mumia Abu-Jamal
Death row inmate. Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio.
Who do you admire? . . . On any given list, if logical, the following figures will be found: Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X, Ella Baker, and W. E. B. DuBois. . . . Add Paul Robeson to that list. Does that help? How about Angela Y. Davis. . . .
We admire these people because, at critical junctures of their lives, they cast their lot with the oppressed, the poor, the worker or those in the third world. Now they didn't do this because it was popular; quite the contrary, it was quite dangerous for many of these people. . . .
They joined, aided and/or formed the movements that they did because it was the right thing to do. . . .
Have those lives had impact? Their lives have expanded the very notion of what freedom means in the minds of millions. . . . Their lives teach us all what it means to betray one's class, to contribute to the movements that have meaning and to work on behalf of the oppressed. You, at this commencement at Antioch, have the somewhat unique opportunity to prove that old axiom, that man is made for more than meat and life is more than bread.

Andy Rooney
Humorist. University of Virginia, Charlottesville.
We need more doctors and fewer medical programs. We need more mechanics and fewer car salesmen. We need more good television programs and fewer commercials.
Someone has to make something. I mean, who's going to rebuild those 250 houses that burned down last week in Los Alamos? An interactive communications network? A virtual meeting? I don't think so. It's going to take carpenters, plumbers and electricians.
When I don't have anything else to think about, I think about whether all of mankind cumulatively . . . whether we're all happier or not, or less happy, than we used to be. Used to be 100 years ago, 2,000 years ago, when people were living in caves without electric light, without automobiles, without airplanes, televisions, without computers, even without Diet Coke, are we happier now that we have all those things? . . . I'm puzzled about whether we're any smarter than people were at 1,000 or 10,000 years ago.
Don't rule out working with your hands. It does not preclude using your head. There's no reason why education should be incompatible with craftsmanship. . . . I can imagine not too far in the future a carpenter making $250,000 a year building a house for a computer programmer making $150,000 a year.

William Julius Wilson
Professor. Macalester College, St. Paul.
As a new millennium dawns, the eradication of extreme poverty ought to be one of our most urgent and important goals. Extreme poverty breeds disease and shortens life expectancy. It reduces the aspirations and severely limits the potential of children, many of whom cannot and do not envision the future, free of deprivation and despair.
In today's modern world, there is no reason why hundreds of millions of people and families have to live in extreme poverty. There is no reason why hundreds of millions of children have to grow up with little hope for a brighter future. Given the impact of modern technology, the unlimited growth and material resources and surplus wealth, it is possible to ensure that every man, woman and child experience a modicum of economic welfare.
 
B. D. Wong
Actor. School of Visual Arts, New York.
I've never been to a college commencement before. No, seriously, this is my first college commencement. Really. . . . Yeah, who knew that I would ever be able to thumb my nose at that lame-o state university I went to in my hometown for like 20, by standing up here in front of you all, all official and all. Being all wise. Having something to say. . . .
I am asking you to commit yourself today to choosing the fork of integrity. . . . From this moment on, commit yourself to that original vision, honor and cherish that original vision, and be faithful to it. Yes, marry it. Get hitched. The old ball and chain. . . . Those of you truly self-involved, singularly brilliant artists, will have terrible trouble keeping relationships anyway, so you better marry something. . . .
You won't be hearing from me when they say, "If there is anyone here who knows why these artists should not be joined to their futures, speak now or forever hold your peace." When you receive that diploma, say "I do," and marry yourself to that original vision. . . . I now pronounce you artists and lives.

HEADLINE: FUJIMORI IS VICTOR IN PERU'S RUNOFF AS PROTESTS GROW

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, May 28

 BODY:
In a runoff vote long on protest but short on suspense, President Alberto K. Fujimori swept to victory today against an opponent who had urged his supporters to abstain because of what he called vote fraud and an array of campaign irregularities.
Mr. Fujimori had hoped for a third landslide victory that would venerate his successes in defeating two terrorist groups and hyperinflation and making peace with Ecuador after decades of border tensions. Instead, the 61-year-old president won a hollow victory leaving the country badly polarized and facing possible economic sanctions just as it tries to emerge from recession. 
 The balloting capped a campaign full of dirty tricks, violent demonstrations and condemnations from Mr. Fujimori's opponent, Alejandro Toledo, who dropped out on May 18, although his name remained on the ballot. The United States, France, Britain, Canada, Argentina and Costa Rica echoed his criticisms.
Even before the voting drew to a close, demonstrations grew more intense, and downtown Lima was filled with the pungent smell of tear gas. Government helicopters buzzed overhead as tens of thousands of demonstrators assembled tonight. That scene was played out in cities across the country.
Speaking to the enthusiastic, chanting crowd, in which many were carrying lit candles, Mr. Toledo said he planned to lead a nonstop, nationwide movement to nullify the election.
"Dictatorship degrades people," the 54-year-old American-trained business professor said. "It silences people. Dictatorship is the impotence of reason that brings repression."
"We need to mobilize people across Peru peacefully," said Mr. Toledo, standing in blue jeans and a button-down shirt on a platform overlooking one of Lima's main plazas.
In a particularly provocative gesture, Mr. Toledo introduced a retired general, Francisco Morales Bermudez, who was the last military president of Peru, to speak to the crowd. "I've read many chapters of the history of Peru," said the general, who ruled Peru in the late 1970's, "but I have never seen such a shameful thing as this election in the history of our country."
Based on exit polls and most of the votes counted, Mr. Fujimori had more than 50 percent, while Mr. Toledo had about 16 percent. The rest of the ballots were left blank or nullified.
The Organization of American States released a report last week saying, "The Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could be considered free and fair." It said government funds were used in the Fujimori campaign, media access was dominated by the president, and there was not enough time to inspect new computer vote tabulation software to ensure a fair count.
Before a single vote was cast, election observers from the Organization of American States and the Atlanta-based Carter Center withdrew in disgust after they failed to persuade the government to postpone the election. Mr. Toledo, the only challenger on the ballot, did not vote and told reporters the election was as "fraudulent as a soccer game in which the field is tilted and one side chooses the referees and the reporters who cover the contest."
Mr. Fujimori's bid for a third term has stirred opposition here ever since Congress fired three judges more than two years ago for ruling that a constitutional ban on a third presidential term prohibited the president from running. Mr. Fujimori argued that he could run since the Constitution was written after his first term, meaning the ban would apply only if he ran for a fourth term.
Many voters appeared to be going through the motions of voting in an election that lacked drama after Mr. Toledo pulled out 10 days ago.
"There is no institution in this country that is free anymore," Enrique Fernandez, a 48-year-old folk music promoter, said before voting in the working-class neighborhood of Rimac in order to avoid a $35 fine for not voting or problems with the police. "The Justice Ministry and election authorities are totally controlled, and this is all a fraud."
Aides to Mr. Toledo predicted that protests around the country would continue to gather momentum. There have already been strikes and road blockades in the cities of Iquitos, Cuzco and Chiclayo in recent days, as well as several violent incidents in Lima, including stone and firebomb attacks by university students on the presidential palace.
The tainted Peruvian election will dominate a meeting of foreign ministers of members of the Organization of American States in Canada this week. The ministers could ultimately decide on sanctions, although in the past severe action has been taken only in cases of coups or other overt interruptions of democratic process.
It is more likely that sanctions will come from the United States, where Congress has already passed a joint resolution calling for a review of all political, economic and military relations. Still, it remains doubtful that Washington will cut very deeply into assistance that goes into Peru's efforts at combating terrorism and narcotics trafficking.
The Clinton administration pushed hard for Mr. Fujimori to hold a second-round vote during a questionable slow count in the days following the first-round balloting on April 9. But in recent weeks Washington has softened its criticism of Peru and allowed the Organization of American States, a usually cautious organization, to take the lead in pushing for democratic reform here.
Nevertheless, President Clinton had strong words for Peru on Friday, the day after the election authorities had decided to go ahead with the vote. "Free, fair and open elections are the foundation of a democratic society," he said. "Without them, our relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected."
Mr. Fujimori is counting on the United States to go easy on him, rather than jeopardize the cooperation of the two countries in economic, anti-terrorism and especially anti-drug programs that have halved this country's coca plant production in the last five years.
"It would be terrible if our anti-narcotics collaboration was upset, and we will continue to welcome U.S. investment," Mr. Fujimori said.
Mr. Fujimori used an assortment of carrots and rather sharp sticks on his way to a third five-year term. In a wave of populism, he raised the minimum wage and handed out land titles to 150,000 peasants during the campaign. But he was also besieged by criticism by international election observers for a range of campaign irregularities. Mothers dependent on government milk and food handouts were pressed to attend Fujimori rallies, for instance, and intelligence agents harassed opposition leaders.
Many tabloid newspapers that have connections to Mr. Fujimori's intelligence service and all television networks save one cable station either did not cover the Toledo campaign or tilted their coverage toward salacious and unproved allegations of financial fraud, sexual innuendo and claims that he had an illegitimate daughter.
Just this week, a journalist who said he had videotapes showing Mr. Fujimori's intelligence chief meeting with election officials was assaulted by three unidentified men. From a hospital bed, he said the assailants had cut his wrist to the bone with a saw as they demanded that he disclose his sources inside the intelligence agency.
Immediately after the April 9 vote, cries of fraud arose when ballots and tally sheets disappeared for several hours. The election authorities announced that Mr. Fujimori had not received the required majority to avert a second round only after three days of heavy international pressure.
Mr. Toledo ran a strong race in the April first round, promising to give the poor jobs and to disentangle the courts and congress from the tight grip of presidential control.
But he appeared to fumble badly when he suddenly dropped out of the race, claiming that he was not willing to lead his supporters into a fraudulent vote unless the election date was postponed several weeks to give international observers an opportunity to audit computer software designed to count ballots.
He slid in a variety of opinion polls, as voters either expressed disappointment in his apparent surrender or dismay that he was willing to incite unrest and damage the image the country.
A poll conducted by Datum Internacional between May 19 and 22, which only the week before showed a virtual tie between the two candidates, showed that 55 percent of voters disapproved of Mr. Toledo's decision to drop out of the race. The poll also showed Mr. Fujimori leading Mr. Toledo by a 54 to 46 percent, suggesting that Mr. Fujimori could win a clean, free election anyway.

HEADLINE: Repeal the Draconian Drug Laws

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Drug Laws That Destroy Lives" (editorial, May 24) is on target. So many politicians and criminal justice experts privately admit that the Rockefeller laws are self-defeating and costly and should be repealed. Why the delay?
First, several upstate communities are prison towns. Their economies would be in a state of upheaval if the prison population decreased as a result of sensible drug laws. Jobs are at stake and alternative employment must be part of the planning. 
 Second, many products, from soap to steel, have lucrative contracts with the Department of Correction. They view a diminishing prison population as one that causes decreasing profits.
Your editorial's position must be accompanied by plans to incorporate the real needs of those who profit from prisons.

HEADLINE: Repeal the Draconian Drug Laws

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is indeed alarming that 22,300 largely nonviolent drug offenders are in New York prisons (editorial, May 24).
Rockefeller-era laws have not only clogged this state's prisons with low-level drug offenders, but also pull apart families and neighborhoods, leaving children without parents and communities economically and socially fragmented. 
 Legislative bodies must begin to rethink current drug sentencing laws. The criminal justice system can engage families as resources in their treatment of addiction. Once supported in working partnerships, families have been shown to play a positive and powerful role in treatment and long-term recovery.
Let us treat substance abuse by tapping into the inherent strengths of families and communities, rather than punishing those struggling with addiction.

HEADLINE: The Joy of Giving

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Charitable Giving Surged Again in '99, by an Estimated 9%" (news article, May 25): 
 It is positively heartening to know that American philanthropic endeavors have grown at such an incredible pace, outflanking the country's economic growth and continuing a tradition that has been apparent throughout our nation's history. In today's technological revolution, it is both joyous and remarkable to read that we still consider charitable endeavors a top priority.
As early as 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the extraordinary commitment this country had to good works. A hundred and sixty-five years later, this sentiment continues to resound deeply in the hearts and actions of the American people.

HEADLINE: Building Wealth For Everyone

BYLINE: By Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a senator from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Social insurance began in Europe, principally in Germany in the Bismarck era. In 1911, Winston Churchill carried unemployment insurance in the House of Commons, representing the Liberal government. The Tories opposite said the workers would spend the money on drink; Churchill said it was their money. Whereupon a first principle was established.
The American Association for Labor Legislation, an academic group, was established in 1906. Workers' compensation laws began to appear. Soon, in Albany, Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner brought us "mothers' pensions" and the like. 
 In the 1930's, for the first time we enacted national legislation providing unemployment insurance, an old-age pension to be known as Social Security, and a mother's pension, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The first two programs were presented as contributory insurance. I knew Frances Perkins, who was then the secretary of labor, and have talked with one of the experts involved, Luther H. Gulick of Columbia University. Both would go on about Franklin Roosevelt's insistence that each worker have a separate account, like a bank account. His or hers. As F.D.R. put it to Gulick, so that "no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program." (Observe that A.F.D.C. was not contributory. Soon it became known as "welfare," and it was repealed in 1996.)
President Eisenhower brought us disability insurance, expanding workers' compensation. Then came President Johnson with Medicare, a contributory health insurance plan, and Medicaid, a welfare measure. A once-a-generation sequence had evolved.
And now we have the opportunity for a grand culmination, starting this century with a system of voluntary, contributory savings plans such that Americans will end their working lives with a measure of wealth. An estate. And for the first time, an American idea!
A bit of background. In 1977, Social Security, the retirement program, was changed from a pay-as-you-go system to a partially funded system. The revered Robert J. Meyers, who was present at the creation in 1935 and still analyzes Social Security financing, records, "The underlying financing mechanism was to build up a reserve." No one noticed this. I was a member of the 1977 House-Senate Conference Committee that enacted the law, and I surely didn't notice. Nor was it reported.
We added two percentage points to the F.I.C.A. tax -- Federal Insurance Contribution Act -- such that today some 80 percent of American households that pay this tax pay more in Social Security than in income taxes. In time, larger Social Security surpluses appeared, enough to moderate the even larger federal budget deficits of the 1980's, and then to bring us into the overall budget surplus of today.
Now here is the point. If we will make a few, admittedly difficult but wholly defensible changes in the existing program, those two extra percentage points won't be needed. Workers could take back their half -- the employer keeps the other half -- or could choose to invest the two percentage points in a personal savings plan modeled on that available to federal employees since 1987. Let the magic of compound interest work its magic.
Here are the main changes.
Use an accurate cost-of-living adjustment. The consumer price index overstates inflation by about eight-tenths of a percentage point, even after recent improvements made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Next, provide normal taxation of benefits, which are now only partially taxed. Then extend coverage to all newly hired state and local workers, a quarter of whom don't pay into Social Security from their primary earnings but get benefits through part-time jobs.
Finally, increase the number of years counted in computing benefits from 35 to 38. Of a sudden you are in 75-year actuarial balance and don't need those two percentage points of payroll taxes.
On March 18, 1998, Senator J. Robert Kerrey and I introduced the Social Security Solvency Act, with these benefit adjustments and a provision for a "voluntary investment of payroll tax cut by employees." In 1999 it became the Social Security Solvency Act of 1999, the first Senate bill introduced in the 106th Congress other than those reserved for the two leaders. We also included Senator Kerrey's proposal to provide every child with a nest egg of $3,500: $1,000 at birth and $500 on each of the child's first five birthdays.
With respect, this is where the coming presidential debate should begin. The numbers add up; they are from the actuaries at Social Security. There are some tricky details, including a far-off increase in retirement age. (But note that now most folk, 76 percent, retire before reaching 65, the so-called normal retirement age.) And of course the main debate will concern the personal savings accounts.
It would be unforgivable to label this "privatization." But it has already begun. These savings accounts are being referred to in New York Times reporting as "partial privatization."
The term goes back to the presidential campaign of 1964, in which Barry Goldwater made an offhand remark that Social Security should be made voluntary. In the definitive study, "Policy Making for Social Security" (Brookings, 1979), Martha Derthick explained that though the remark was "not the party's position and not even clearly the candidate's position," it was "transformed by media coverage and the ridicule of rival candidates (including other candidates for the Republican nomination) into a symbol of Goldwater's radical conservatism." As such, she wrote, "it figured conspicuously in the campaign."
Doris Kearns Goodwin, a distinguished historian of the period, recently described a Democratic ad of that campaign depicting scissors cutting a Social Security card in half.
The charge is hurled at every opportunity. Establishing personal savings accounts is described as turning Social Security over to Wall Street. Dock workers would become day traders. A market downturn could wipe out benefits.
The latter charge is obscene. The present progressive retirement benefit is fixed in our bill. There is no occasion to touch it. We add a savings plan modeled on the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees, including senators. The government matches up to 5 percent of an employee's pay. The money is invested, at the employee's choice, in one of three plans, ranging from government bonds to a stock index fund. The employee can switch around from time to time. If there is an element of risk even in a 40-year stretch, at no time are basic Social Security benefits at risk. Those are funded and solid, just as they are today and have been for 60 years.
The Thrift Savings Plan was essentially an adaption for federal workers of various retirement plans, principally the 401(k), as it is known, which were passing the tax committees in the 1970's and 1980's. In the Senate it emerged from the Government Affairs Committee. Al Gore, then a senator and a member of the committee, said on July 30, 1985, "An employee savings plan with government matching funds will give every worker the opportunity to supplement a defined and predictable pension amount." He praised a Congressional Research Service report, "Civil Service Retirement: Capital Accumulation Plans for Federal Employees."
A parallel arrangement under Social Security would, at a 7 percent non-inflation-adjusted rate of return, provide an average worker (making $30,000 a year), with $350,000 of savings at the end of 45 years. A measure of wealth.
In 1944 the British came up with the slogan of "cradle to grave" protection. We propose something beyond: an estate! For doormen, as well as those living in the duplexes above.

HEADLINE: Pay Phone Companies Rush To Refit for the Internet Era

BYLINE: By DENNIS BLANK 

 BODY:
The pay phone is an endangered species. With cell phones seemingly in every pocket or briefcase, fewer and fewer people must rely on phones that are attached, quaintly, to a wall or booth.
There are still two million pay phones across the United States, but that is down by 300,000 the last two years alone. 
 In response, the companies that make or operate pay phones are rushing to reinvent themselves, working to change the perception that pay phones are nothing but black boxes for making calls. New technology will transform them into tools to provide communications access to the Internet, find local news and weather and even offer e-mail.
In the meantime, though, economic reality is forcing the removal of many phones. "For every five telephones we installed in North Carolina today, we're taking out six," said Glenn Lancaster, president of Triangle Telephone in Cary, N.C.
This shift hurts poor people the most. In many urban areas, including New York, at least 25 percent of low-income residents have no telephone -- cellular or otherwise. The pay phone can be their lifeline, providing the only way to get help in an emergency, hunt for a job or call friends.
But when phones do not pay, they may be removed. Nationwide, the average number of calls for each phone has declined from 712 a year, to 588. And once a given phone does not yield a profit, phone companies often eliminate it. The cost of operating pay phones is going up faster than revenue from them, Mr. Lancaster said. He and other operators in North Carolina want the price of a call raised from 35 cents to 50 cents.
"The coin-based revenue model is dying fast as pay phone operators see their coin revenue model drop 20 to 30 percent," said Michael J. Boyle, president and chief executive of Elcotel in Sarasota, Fla., one of the leading pay phone manufacturers in the United States.
"They need to find a way to reinvent themselves," said John Bain, an analyst at Hoak Breedlove Wesneski in Dallas.
Elcotel is breaking new ground with 27 software patents that would transformed the black box into a snappy unit with a five-inch video screen that provides ads, restaurant listings and access to "800" numbers.
"Our strategy is move our industry from coins to content," Mr. Boyle said.
After spending $8 million on research, Elcotel sold 45,000 of its new Grapevine models for $125 million to Canada Payphone, which began installing them in March.
In June, new software will be installed to make them Internet-friendly. Mr. Boyle said new revenue would be generated from advertisers, transaction fees and revenue-sharing agreements. The new phones can be used with a credit card.
Other manufacturers are also introducing new units. Intellicall of Dallas introduced units that play audible spots of six seconds to eight seconds before a call is made.
Andrew Suzuka, president and chief executive of Key Factors Advertising in New York, which is teaming with Intellicall, estimates that revenue from the average pay phone will rise $15 a month.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is installing 80 new touch-screen units with full Internet access at Kennedy Airport, said Dennis Novick, president of TCC Teleplex, an independent pay telephone supplier.
But he says the old-fashioned pay phone will not die. "There is a place for the public pay phone," he said -- for those unwilling, or unable, to join the cellular revolution.

HEADLINE: Most Stock Markets Rise in Europe and Asia

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 29

 BODY:
European shares closed up in quiet trading today led by technology, media and telecommunications, while shares in Asia ended mostly higher.
In Europe, dealers attributed the low volumes to the closing of the London and Wall Street exchanges for public holidays. 
 In the 11-nation euro zone, the Euro Stoxx 50 index rose 1.4 percent.
The Frankfurt DAX climbed 1.13 percent, to 7,016.66 points, while the Paris CAC 40 added 1.24 percent, at 6,205.13 points. In Paris, France Telecom ended up 2.60 euros, or 1.8 percent, at 144.40, having earlier touched a high of 148, on investor enthusiasm for an expected bid of more than $37 billion for the British mobile phone operator Orange. The deal is expected to be announced today.
"People thought they would pay extra for that, so it's good news that it's included in the price," said one dealer. "It's still a huge expense, but investors see it as a good move for France Telecom."
Asian markets mostly climbed today as investors put aside worries about Wall Street's direction ahead of Memorial Day.
Those markets that did fall did so mainly on local concerns and a firmer performance from the Tokyo and Hong Kong markets helped to shore up other regional exchanges.
Share prices in Tokyo closed 1.5 percent higher led by hopes of bigger corporate profits and stepped-up demand for information technology issues, brokers said.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended 237.30 points higher, at 16,245.44.
"Selling pressure has subsided as investors become more optimistic about corporate earnings and buy up high-tech shares," said Kazue Mayuzumi, a senior market analyst.
In Hong Kong, share prices rose 1.8 percent on short-covering ahead of the expiration of futures contracts.
"The rise is due to short-covering ahead of settlement of the May future contracts tomorrow," said Michael Ng, deputy managing director at Sassoon Securities.
The Hang Seng index gained 252.37 points, to close at 13,975.07.
Dealers, however, said trading was cautious with the outlook for United States interest rates uncertain.

HEADLINE: Now, the Glass Is Half Empty;
Microbreweries in the Slow Lane

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 29

 BODY:
After 14 years in the beer-making business, Richard Doyle, a founder of the Mass. Bay Brewing Company, no longer pays much attention to the humid, bready scent of barley malt and yeast bubbling over into foam-topped buckets. But the smell is still comforting, reminding him that the brewery is running all out, producing nearly two million gallons of Harpoon beer a year.
Mr. Doyle recently added a sixth 24-hour production day to the brewery's workweek. Indeed, business is as good as it ever was at the height of the specialty beer boom in the mid-1990's. 
 But some of his colleagues in the Massachusetts microbrewing industry have not been so fortunate. Local brewers like Bristol, Middlesex, Pilgrim and Old Newbury have all closed their doors. Thinking back on the boom, Mr. Doyle, who is also chairman of the Brewers Association of America, described the rush to market as a busy intersection without a traffic light.
"There was so much product going through, it was just crashing," he said. "We needed time to kind of tow it all away."
The craze in the 1990's for craft-brewed beers with a variety of tastes (and names) suddenly jammed store aisles with fanciful brews like Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsner, Long Trail Double Bag Ale, Rogue Shakespeare Stout and Pig's Eye Pilsner. For consumers used to basic labels like Coors and Bud, it was a bit much. Some microbrewers collided with distributors who refused to carry their products and financiers who clamored for profits even as sales slowed.
As a consequence, for the first time, more microbreweries in the United States closed last year than opened. And more bottles will head for the clearance shelves this year.
But those craft brewers that lived through the shake-up -- and there are many -- are telling a tale of leaner, more economical brewing, more conservative growth and more thoughtful business plans. They are taking a breather before making another, more sober run on the American beer market, which is dominated by three companies that have 80 percent of the market: Anheuser-Busch; Miller Brewing, a unit of Philip Morris; and Coors.
Above all, the independent beer makers say they are paying more respect to their roots. The craft beer industry grew at a euphoric rate of 50 percent in both 1994 and 1995, spurring some regional brewers -- heady as prom queens with their local popularity -- to rush their products into new markets. But when growth stalled in 1997 and 1998, many retreated to their home states and the comforting loyalty of customers in their own backyards.
Deschutes Brewery of Bend, Ore., stopped shipments to Colorado and San Diego. Pyramid of Seattle and the Breckenridge Brewing Company in Denver cut back on their out-of-state attempts as well.
What they found, said David Edgar, president of the Institute for Brewing Studies in Colorado, was that beer drinkers in Oregon had a special affection for their Black Butte Porter, and Alabamans stuck with their Red Mountain Red Ale.
"The industry will always be primarily about local beers," he said. "The lesson was learned that just because you were the cat's meow in Portland doesn't mean that automatically consumers are going to embrace your brand as strongly in Seattle."
The Shipyard Brewing Company in Maine, for one, began on the Kennebunk River in 1992, but within a few years expanded into New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Chicago, Florida and parts of Virginia. Then sales slumped. Shipyard retrenched to New England, where it currently sells 75 percent of its product. Fred M. Forsely, its co-founder, has not given up thoughts of going national, but meanwhile he is coping with "being able to accept a small piece of a very loyal market."
"If we go to Chicago again," he said with humility, "we won't expect to sell three trailer loads a month again."
There have been a handful of closings in New York as well. In upstate New York, where the trend was slow to dig in, there are about a dozen working microbreweries, including Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown, which opened in 1998, and Flying Bison in Buffalo, which began brewing last year. All have set their sights on the local market, which gives them good odds of succeeding, said Bill Metzger, a trade publisher in Buffalo.
Many brewers call New York City a hard market to break into. But the Brooklyn Brewery built a loyal following by handling its own distribution. Sales have grown consistently since it began in 1988, said Stephen Hindy, president and co-founder. Last year, Brooklyn Brewery sold 32,000 barrels, 80 percent of them in the metropolitan area.
"It was a slow way to grow, but owning our own trucks and doing our own deliveries has taught us a lot about the beer business," Mr. Hindy said. "We know a lot about what our customers are saying."
At the Sunset Grill and Tap in Boston, which offers about 60 American craft brews from its 112 taps, beer enthusiasts still sample the occasional seasonal Summer Wheat Ale or Octoberfest brew. But instead of jumping on the new brand of the month, drinkers generally stick with established products from Sam Adams (made by Boston Beer and the biggest and best-advertised craft beer in the country), Sierra Nevada (a best-seller from California) and New England makers like Vermont's Magic Hat and the Tremont Brewery, a tiny Boston producer.
"A lot of it, at this point, is just credibility," said Marc Kadish, the bar's owner. "Breweries change, and the owners change. Or it's simply not fresh. Somebody takes a chance, tries an interesting microbrew and is disappointed. Why do people go to McDonald's? It's consistent, and people know what they're going to get."
Even very good beer makers ran into problems. Some, expecting the euphoria of the beer craze to continue, poured borrowed money into beer-making and were caught with a lot of shiny equipment to make too much beer for too few drinkers. Catamount, Vermont's first microbrewery, completed a $5 million dollar plant just as growth began to top out. It closed last month.
The Frederick Brewing Company of Maryland found itself in a similar predicament in 1997. It built an $8 million beer-making plant with a 100,000-barrel annual capacity, but wound up producing only about 32,000 barrels there. Last year, Frederick was bought by the Snyder International Brewing Group of Ohio.
Irene Firmat, a founder of the Oregon-based Full Sail, has seen several brewers in her region merge or consolidate. Others continue to struggle with whether to go public, stay private or form a partnership with an industry giant. Her own company faced the same question when two of her partners recently wanted out of the business. Full Sail employees bought them out in 1999, and the brewery is now worker-owned.
Ms. Firmat credits Full Sail's survival, in part, to the Pacific Northwest's taste for better beer. "Craft beer is part of the consciousness of the region," she said, pointing out that special brews account for about 10 percent of beer sales in the area, as opposed to about 3 percent nationally. "That helps a lot to buffer the changes in the industry."
One change was increased competition from imported beers. If a customer was willing to spend a little more for a six pack, it turned out he was more likely to buy a brand that had been around for 50 years than 50 days. East Coast brewers in particular felt the competition of brands like Heineken, Corona and Bass, which helped push consumption of imports to 9.2 percent of the American market last year.
The craft beer promoters have themselves to blame.
"In general, tastes have definitely developed," said Mr. Kadish, the bar owner. "People were so scared of the imports and the dark beers, and now I.P.A. is a household word." As with India Pale Ales, customers barely sputter when they order a Bitburger, Warstiener or Hackerphscorr.
To further erode consumer confidence, the megabrewers played an awkward role in the specialty beer field. The large beer makers answered the call for unique beers with their own homespun-sounding labels, including Anheuser-Busch's Red Wolf, Coors's Killian's Red and Miller's Red Dog. As if that scarlet trio were not confusing enough, consumers were unsure whether they were drinking a hometown favorite or a quaintly packaged version of a megabrew.
Meanwhile, some smaller companies, eager for expansion money, became megabrewer protectorates. Miller, the Milwaukee-based giant, bought a 50 percent stake in the fast-growing Shipyard in 1995. In exchange, Shipyard gained access to Miller's laboratories and, probably most important, its distribution system. But Miller apparently lost interest when Shipyard's barrel production dropped from 39,500 in 1996, to 25,300 in 1998. Last month, Shipyard announced it was taking on some debt to buy back those shares.
Despite the recent doldrums, industry analysts are optimistic. Beer sales increased 1.6 percent last year, primarily because the prime beer drinking population, considered to be people (mostly men) in their 20's and early 30's, is also up. Beer prices, which have lagged behind inflation for some 15 years, have climbed.
There are still over 420 small brewers in the United States -- up from about 200 in 1994 -- and their stories are as varied as their labels. Together, sales at four of the largest specialty brewers -- Boston Beer, Pete's Wicked, Redhook and Pyramid -- fell 24 percent between 1996 and 1999. Yet half of the top 50 craft brewers had double digit sales growth last year.
Some have been blissfully unaffected by the turmoil. New Belgium sales were up more than 40 percent last year. Sierra Nevada, the second-largest craft brewer in the United States, has grown right along since its founding in 1981, increasing its sales nearly 15 percent last year and 26 percent the year before.
Mr. Doyle, the beer association chairman, said resisting the temptation to go for maximum growth helped his Harpoon Brewery keep its footing as others around him slipped. "We were not leveraged, we're not highly leveraged now," he said. "Our focus was making sure that we were very profitable at the size we were, to store up resources for the time when the industry thawed again."
So far this year, most of the specialty brands have reported an upturn in sales, said Frank C. Walters, the director of research for the trade newsletter Impact. "A lot of the streamlining, getting rid of the deadwood brands, we think was probably completed in the last half of 1999," he said. "Things are starting to grow again."
Shakeouts have their advantages. At the National Craft Brewers Conference in Milwaukee last month, attendees were mostly experienced brewers interested in seminars like Hopping to Perfection and The Biodiversity of Yeast. There were fewer newcomers looking to hop on a bandwagon. "These events used to be full of tire kickers," said Gary Fish, president of the Deschutes Brewery. "There's not so many of those people any more."

Coffee Group Stumbles In Plan to Raise Prices

BYLINE: By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 29

 BODY:
Borrowing a page from OPEC's strategy book, the world's leading coffee producers have agreed to withhold beans from the market to raise the price from seven-year lows.
But since they reached that agreement a little more than a week ago, cracks in the unity of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries and its allies have already appeared. 
 The price of coffee, which rose in the days immediately after the agreement, has since relinquished some of that gain. On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for July delivery reached nearly $1.04 a pound after the agreement, but by last Friday it had retreated to $99.2 cents a pound.
Meeting in London on May 19, the 14-member association, working with five nonmember coffee producers, said they were prepared to withhold 20 percent of coffee crops from the market. The producers, which make up about 85 percent of the world's coffee production, said they would come up with a more detailed plan by June 16 when they return to London for another meeting.
Commodities analysts have grown increasingly skeptical, however. They point to the lack of specifics about how such a plan would work, in the face of an increasing world supply of coffee beans.
"The market is in a vacuum," said Arthur Stevenson, a commodities analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. "Only once we find out how the governments involved intend to effectuate those plans and how they intend to finance them will we know whether this whole thing has any real legitimacy and credibility."
Doubts about the success of such an agreement started appearing even before the meeting began, when some of the major world coffee producers, including the leading robusta bean producer, Indonesia, said that they lacked the resources to pay coffee growers to withhold supply.
"I think that one of the challenges in such a plan is putting in the financial or economic mechanisms to be able to fund those within the coffee sectors that would be receiving money to retain their crop," said Robert Nelson, president and chief executive officer of the National Coffee Association of the United States. "That is going to be of primary concern to the farmers."
Mexico, one of the coffee producing association's nonmember observers, along with Vietnam, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, has said that it planned to offset the lost exports by stimulating domestic consumption of coffee. But stimulating consumption is a long-term process that is unlikely to absorb the excess supply of coffee. Brazil, which is the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee beans, will be the pivotal player in the success of the plan to withhold coffee beans. At the moment, Brazil seems committed to seeing that the plan is successful.
"The government wouldn't being doing all of this if it didn't want the plan to work," said David Nahum Neto, the general secretary of the Association of the Coffee Industry of Brazil.
Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, the agriculture minister of Brazil, said after the meeting in London that the country had already allocated $167 million to financing the retention of about 3 million 60-kilogram bags of coffee from Brazil's total crop for 1999-2000 of about 27 million bags.
But Brazil's coffee industry, which is expected to expand sharply in the coming years, is taking an increasingly larger share of the world market. That is something that experts say the country will be unlikely to jeopardize by restricting supply over the long term.
Theoretically, at least, withholding coffee is akin to the strategy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to curtail the production of oil. OPEC has been successful the last few years in restricting how much each member produces, a strategy that has raised the price of oil.
But that may be where the comparison with coffee ends. Coffee, unlike oil, is not critical to the smooth functioning of the world economy, so producers have less influence over the market. To make matters worse for the coffee exporting countries, history does not provide any examples of successful agreements to keep beans off the market.
"In the past, these types of agreements have proven ineffective and unenforceable," said Mr. Nelson of the National Coffee Association of the United States.
Until the June meeting of the coffee producing nations, analysts say, coffee prices will remain vulnerable to speculation about an eventual agreement. Traders will also be keeping a close eye on Brazil, where the onset of winter in June could affect the coffee crop. A damaging frost in the coffee belt of Brazil could make a price agreement unnecessary.

U.S.-European Union Tax Dispute Is Growing

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Despite the Clinton administration's hope for a quick resolution to a multibillion-dollar dispute with the European Union over corporate tax policy, the problem appeared to be escalating today on the eve of President Clinton's meeting with European leaders in Lisbon.
In a statement issued here before Mr. Clinton's departure, Stuart E. Eizenstat, the deputy treasury secretary, said he was saddened and disappointed by a rebuff on Friday by Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner. 
 Mr. Lamy said the administration's proposed revision in the way some foreign sales by United States-based corporations were taxed would still not bring the United States into compliance with the World Trade Organization's rules against subsidizing exports.
"We firmly believe that our proposal is W.T.O. compliant, in fact and in law," Mr. Eizenstat said in his statement.
He added, "I am saddened that the E.U. has not yet seized this opportunity to negotiate a solution based on our proposal. We are disappointed that a chance may be lost to accomplish this goal."
The dispute is over a tax break, worth billions of dollars, that federal law currently allows exporters through the use of so-called foreign sales corporations, subsidiaries set up in places like the Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam.
Overseas sales channeled through these subsidiaries escape both sales tax and duties. In 1999, hundreds of United States companies, including Boeing, Microsoft and General Motors, saved about $4 billion by using these legally sanctioned offshore tax havens.
Despite an agreement between the United States and the European Union not to challenge each other's tax policies, the E.U. challenged the policy on the ground that amounted to an illegal effort to subsidize exports by making them more competitive.
An appeals panel of the W.T.O. agreed in a ruling three months ago, setting off the administration's effort to come up with an acceptable alternative.
Mr. Eizenstat said today that even in the absence of a negotiated solution, the administration would work with Congress to enact new tax legislation that in its opinion met the world trade body's objections.
The tax issue is only one of several trade-related disputes, including skirmishes over bananas, genetically modified products and aircraft noise, that have cast a shadow over economic relations between the United States and members of the European Union.
Under Mr. Eizenstat's plan, the United States would repeal the foreign sales corporation plan and replace it with special income tax rates for both export and nonexport foreign sales by eligible manufacturers.
The commission said, however, that the changes meant United States-based companies would still have to export to benefit -- the very aspect of the original plan that was condemned by the W.T.O.
The United States proposal also contained two other elements that the commission considered incompatible with global trade rules -- a 50 percent United States content requirement for products benefiting from tax breaks and a transfer pricing plan that allocates a proportion of profits to the foreign sales corporation.

HEADLINE: Museum Brings Town Back to Life

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass.

 BODY:
Of all the dying mill towns in New England, this was the deadest.
By the mid-1980's, 70 percent of its storefronts were empty. The Sprague Electric Company, the city's largest employer and long its dominant presence, closed in 1985, putting 4,137 people out of work and affecting virtually every family in North Adams, a city of 18,000. 
 The unemployment rate, the highest in Massachusetts, ran from 25 percent to 30 percent. The local newspaper kept a front-page box score on plant closings. A developer suggested that the whole town, at the foot of steep mountains, be flooded to provide lakefront property.
"We had hit rock bottom," recalled John Barrett III, the city's mayor for the last 17 years. "We were the butt of jokes. The Adams Print Works closed, another 2,200 jobs. The hotel went bankrupt; it was the third time. Everything was bankrupt."
But now North Adams is in renaissance, a nascent Soho in the Berkshires.
More than two-thirds of the town's shops are occupied, including a downtown-slick restaurant, 55 Main, with spotlights and arty furnishings. Artists have moved into some of the long brick mills, and one old mill houses a farm that grows shiitake mushrooms.
This month, plans were announced for a $5 million project to turn a deteriorating stretch of Victorian houses into a bed and breakfast to be run by the Red Lion Inn of nearby Stockbridge.
"I think it's wonderful to have an excuse to be doing something in North Adams. I think it's a great place," said Nancy Fitzpatrick, president of the Red Lion, a favorite with the crowd that frequents Tanglewood.
The unlikely catalyst of this change, a gigantic museum in an abandoned factory featuring maple trees growing upside down and sculptures made out of tons of industrial debris, was nearly hooted out of existence as a $35 million boondoggle before it could be born.
"You've got to understand, everybody laughed at this," said Mr. Barrett, who remembers and bristles at every slight North Adams has ever suffered.
In the year since it opened last Memorial Day weekend, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, known as Mass MOCA, has been hailed as a wild success, drawing more than 105,000 visitors to its galleries, 25,000 more to performing arts events, garnering architectural and preservation awards, and, in an arrangement that is crucial to its financial security, renting commercial space to eight tenants so far, with 60,000 square feet scheduled to be occupied by October.
It was a hard, 14-year struggle into being, a cliffhanger of state funding cut-offs, small-scale fund-raising, deadlines missed and extended, plans juggled and changed.
Much of the credit goes to Mr. Barrett, the blue-collar mayor, and Joseph C. Thompson, a soft-spoken art historian from Williams College via Oklahoma, who has devoted most of his working life to the project.
Refusing to give up a dream, Mr. Thompson and his development director, Jennifer Trainer, went for months without pay, turned down lucrative job offers and, along the way, fell in love, married and now have an infant son. And an infant museum.
"Without Joe, this wouldn't have happened," said Michael Conforte, director of the Clark Art Institute in neighboring Williamstown.
Mass MOCA also owes much to three post-modern phenomena.
The first is the tendency of artists to create works that, although they are called minimalist, are huge, so huge that art experts say 90 percent of them cannot be exhibited. Some are so big and so minimalist that they do not even exist; they are just instructions as to how to build them in the unlikely event there should be room.
The second phenomenon, as manufacturing is abandoned, is the existence of big empty industrial spaces. New York's Soho neighborhood was a manufacturing center, after all, before artists (and later investment bankers) inhabited its lofts.
The third, is the explosive growth of e-commerce and Internet companies in this region, which is being called the Silicon Village. Web companies are among the museum's main tenants, including eZiba.com, which markets exotic crafts over the Internet.
The museum also owes much to Williams College, five miles to the west. Williams gave crucial initial backing to the museum. Some of the college's wealthy and well-connected alumni, who bear a fond allegiance to the surrounding hills, invested in the project. And since the 1960's, the college's art history department has spawned a network of museum directors and curators, including the current director of the Guggenheim, Thomas Krens.
Mr. Krens conceived of Mass MOCA while running a more traditional expansion of the college's Museum of Art, where he was director.
In 1986, when Mr. Krens came looking for more display place, Mayor Barrett showed him the abandoned Sprague plant. It sprawled over a third of the town, with 27 buildings on 13 acres, and resembled a walled medieval city, though in rough industrial brick, with a clock tower, courtyards and a branch of the Hoosic River flowing through it. The plant was built in 1874 for a thriving textile industry; when that went under in 1942, it was bought by Sprague, which made the trigger for the atomic bomb, components for the Gemini moon mission and electronic capacitors.
Entranced, Mr. Krens spun a vision for a museum, involving a luxury hotel, the architect Frank Gehry and the collection of an Italian industrialist, Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, who had more than 200 artworks from the 1960's and 1970's.
Michael S. Dukakis, then the governor, bought into the idea as a development plan for this forlorn corner, which had been bypassed by the state's economic boom in the 1980's. Mr. Krens estimated that the museum could be opened by 1990.
But in 1988, Mr. Krens left for the Guggenheim, Mr. Gehry and the Italian count went with him.
In a sense, the Guggenheim's much-hailed museum in Bilbao, Spain, is a flossier version of Mass MOCA, an effort to revive a faded Basque industrial city with a government-funded museum.
Mr. Thompson, a protege of Mr. Krens, inherited the project, but by the next year the "Massachusetts Miracle" went bust. Mr. Dukakis was out by 1990, and the Republican administration of the new governor, William F. Weld, cut the $688,000 in development money that Mr. Dukakis had slipped in the budget.
The Boston Globe sneered at the plan as "endive economics" and other newspapers were equally dismissive, calling it a pipe dream and a hare-brained scheme.
But the sometimes puckish Mr. Weld visited the old factory in the fall of 1992 and, like others, fell under the spell of its space, saying later that he liked its karma. After contemplating an exhibit displayed at the factory, a work by Mario Merz that resembled a spiral of mismatched tables set up for a hotel buffet, Mr. Weld gave the go-ahead for a gradual release of state funds.
But there were more problems, and at one point even the Mayor Barrett said "I'm all MOCA'd out."
The project was finally saved in 1994 when the Jacob's Pillow dance center became a sponsor, as required by legislation. This also changed the plan significantly, adding dance, movies and concerts by singer Patti Smith and others.
Still, even after the years of struggle, the mayor is unable to stifle a giggle as he walks past the art that is saving his town.
Like Joseph Beuys's "Lightning With a Stag in its Glare" which is owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, but is too big, at 3,000 pounds and 22 feet tall, to be shown there. It is a huge bronze triangle suspended from the ceiling with an aluminum sawhorse-looking thing and a bunch of little metal lumps.
There is some difference of opinion about which is the lightning (Mr. Thompson says it is the big triangle), but it seems impossible to construe the lumps as anything but, well, deer droppings.
"I can't keep a straight face," Mr. Barrett said. "Droppings, hee, hee, hee. My citizens say they've got stuff like this in their basements."

HEADLINE: Few Blacks Where Tips Are High;
Racial Diversity Is Rare for Waiters in Elite Restaurants

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS with MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
In New York City's restaurant firmament, where establishments ceaselessly open and close, where fortunes are made and lost overnight, and where chefs can go as hot and as cold as the soup, there are few unchanging truths.
But one reality has dominated the city's enormous inventory of distinguished restaurants: a scarcity of black waiters.
"For anyone who eats in high-end restaurants in Manhattan, it is impossible to ignore the fact that there is very little, if any, diversity in many, many restaurants," said Andrew G. Celli Jr., the bureau chief for civil rights in the New York State attorney general's office. "It's really in your face." 
 While more than 26 percent of New York City's population is black, only 10.5 percent of its 48,176 waiters and waitresses are black, according to 1996 census data. Since many of those are working in low-end neighborhood restaurants, the racial disparity among waiters in mid-to-high-priced places is greater.
For many city restaurantgoers, though, that truth takes awhile to sink in.
"People are so used to the exclusion of African-Americans, you don't even notice," said David A. Paterson, a black state senator whose district includes Harlem and part of Washington Heights.
The reasons for the disparity are as complicated as diners' orders. Interviews with dozens of restaurant owners and waiters, and with state, city and labor leaders reveal an industry that acknowledges a dearth of black waiters, but offers several reasons for their absence.
At many Chinese, Japanese, Italian and other ethnic restaurants, for instance, owners say that they employ no blacks as waiters because they need to hire employees sharing their own backgrounds. They say that customers demand the authenticity implied by the presence of ethnic waiters in ethnic restaurants.
Other restaurateurs say few blacks apply for the jobs even though new restaurants are plentiful and waiters are scarce. And both black waiters and leaders acknowledge that black Americans may be rejecting what they perceive as a servile profession.
But many blacks working in high-end restaurants in New York City say that the real reason their numbers are so small is racism.
Waiting jobs could have considerable economic significance in black neighborhoods where boom times have certainly not brought full employment. Jobs in the city's 20,000 restaurants have increased 24 percent since 1992 in an industry that generated about $7.2 billion in revenues in 1998. Waiters at top city restaurants can earn from $40,000 to $70,000 a year or more.
"Restaurant jobs are steppingstones into careers and opportunities for many," said Lloyd A. Williams, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. "There is absolutely no question that blacks are being discriminated against as waiters and waitresses."
Certainly many black waiters perceive this to be true. Chris Harvey, a waiter at Aquagrill in SoHo, said he had been shut out of previous jobs because of his skin color. "Young whites come and go, but it takes me longer to find a job," Mr. Harvey said. "So when I find a place, I stay."
George Thomas, 35, remembered the days when he was trying to get a toehold in the industry. "I have faxed restaurants with my qualifications," recalled Mr. Thomas, who is black, "and they expressed excitement. Then they saw me in person, and the whole conversation changed."
He kept applying for jobs, refused to take no as an answer, and became a waiter, a maitre d'hotel and sommelier at Gotham Bar and Grill in Greenwich Village. He later became a waiter captain at the three-star restaurant Daniel on East 65th Street, and for the last year, he has been a captain at the four-star Bouley Bakery in TriBeCa.
But his is the exceptional story. "In some respects there is a ceiling for black people," Mr. Thomas said, adding that in regard to managers, maitres d'hotel and captains, "there are not many blacks at fine restaurants."
One of them, Daniel Smalls, 36, a former waiter, is now a manager at Guastavino's at Bridgemarket, where 40 percent of the waitstaff of 120 is black. "A lot of black people began to apply here when they saw me," he said.
White waiters predominate at many of New York's better-known restaurants. For example, of the 10 waiters and 5 captains in the dining room of La Cote Basque, the haute cuisine doyenne at 60 West 55th Street, none are black.
Only one of the eight waiters and three captains at Le Perigord, the 36-year-old French grande dame at 405 East 52nd Street, is dark-skinned -- a server from Bangladesh. Of the 48 waiters in the dining room and banquet operation of the four-star Le Cirque 2000, on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, two are black.
But the owners of Le Perigord, La Cote Basque and Le Cirque 2000 say they do not have racist employment policies. "The majority of our people working here are minorities," said Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque 2000, "including our chef," who is Cambodian.
Nevertheless, Brooks Bitterman, research director of Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which organizes the city's nonhotel waiters, said the whiteness of waiters was striking considering "that 99 percent of low-wage kitchen workers are nonwhite minorities, Hispanics and Asians." Dr. Bitterman added, "That contrasts with white senior cooks in many kitchens, and the primarily white front-of-house staffs."
While women's groups and the state attorney general's office have challenged sex discrimination at some of New York's elite restaurants, racial discrimination has not really registered on the official radar screen. Mr. Celli of the attorney general's office said, "We have several open investigations involving several high-end luxury restaurants," but these cases focus on sex discrimination. Racial discrimination may be involved, he added, because "when you look at one thing, you often find other sorts of things."
Restaurant discrimination cases have traditionally been difficult to prove, but in 1998, the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission won a prosecution at the Harley-Davidson Cafe in Midtown: an African-American waitress, Lisa McDonald, won $175,000 after complaining that she had been verbally insulted (she accused the manager of saying "you look like Buckwheat") and ordered to redo her hair at the restaurant.
In February 1999, the Times Square Brewery agreed to pay $450,000 to $650,000 to settle a lawsuit involving accusations of discrimination and racial slurs, filed on behalf of 27 employees, but it admitted no wrongdoing.
Mr. Williams, of the Harlem chamber of commerce, suggested that a more representative labor organization might encourage black waiters to enter the restaurant industry. Yet currently only a little more than 10 percent of the city's waiters are represented by the two principal restaurant unions. Leaders of Local 6 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union said the union has little control over whom restaurants hire. The local represents nearly 4,000 New York hotel waiters earning $25,000 to $100,000 a year.
Some unionized restaurants contend that seniority rules make new job openings for blacks very scarce. "Our waiters are here for life, and last September we had our first job opening in three or four years," said Georges Briguet, owner of Le Perigord, explaining how he had hired the restaurant's Bangladeshi server.
Individual restaurateurs have made efforts to hire more blacks. Danny Meyer, co-owner of the Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Tabla and 11 Madison Park, said that five years ago, he became concerned about the "sameness" of his front-of-house staff. "I asked managers why the staff wasn't more diverse," Mr. Meyer said. "I wasn't satisfied with their answer that 'no minorities applied.' "
So Mr. Meyer gave blacks visible jobs as hostesses and maitres d'hotel, blacks noticed and began applying, and "things have changed dramatically now that we have people of color right at the front door." He added that now his staff is more diverse and so is his clientele.
Mr. Meyer does not insist that his Indian-themed restaurant, Tabla, employ only Indian waiters. Some restaurateurs, though, maintain that they cannot hire black servers because doing so may make ethnic restaurants seem less authentic to customers. "In the older, high-end French and Italian places -- where the proprietor is of a certain age -- these people want to surround themselves with members of their own culture and their own age," said Eric Weiss, whose company, Service Arts Incorporated, has hired the staffs of many high-end restaurants.
But Peter Ward, president of Local 6 of the hotel and restaurant employees' union, said that "it is ridiculous to suppose that you need to be Italian to serve Italian food."
Some black waiters say they have faced racism from customers, too. Mr. Thomas said he would not soon forget the customer at Gotham Bar and Grill who told him, "For a colored boy, you're not too bad." And Mr. Smalls of Guastavino's, who previously worked his way up to manager at the four-star Jean Georges near Columbus Circle, remembers customers there who kept insisting on speaking to the real boss. "I'd have to say to them, 'No, the manager -- that's me,' " he said.
Some blacks say that another problem is the lack of black chefs in New York City's finest kitchens. Carl Redding Jr., 36, said that he was not able to find a top cooking position in a white-owned restaurant, so he opened his own, Amy Ruth's, which serves up home-style Southern cuisine on West 116th Street in Harlem.
But Mr. Redding said that racism works both ways: "there is racism on the part of blacks against whites," meaning that several Harlem restaurants hire only black waiters.
Bedelia Woods of Sylvia's, the soul-food landmark in Harlem, said this is not the case at her restaurant. "Our doors are open to everybody," said Ms. Woods, a daughter of the owner, Sylvia Woods. She added that when white servers answer the restaurant's job advertisements and ask for directions, "when we say uptown in Harlem, they may not come."
Part of the reason for the scarcity of black waiters, some suggest, may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. "Young African-American women and men don't go out for those jobs," State Senator Paterson said. "They think those jobs are closed off to them."
And it may be that the idea of serving people is the hurdle. Perhaps other blacks "think it's a belittling job," Mr. Smalls suggested.
Can patrons change the status quo? Some black leaders suggest that their buying power can speak volumes. "We should not eat where we can't work," said State Assemblyman Keith L. Wright, who represents Harlem.
Mr. Celli of the attorney general's office agreed that the diners hold the cards. "The restaurant industry is driven by consumer likes and dislikes," he said. "If we change the culture so that, as a society, it is no longer attractive to have an all-white, all-male work force, then the customer will have to be right. And there will be change."

HEADLINE: Contact With a Web of Agencies Failed to Prevent a Disabled Girl's Death

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
In the nearly two weeks since a 5-year-old girl with cerebral palsy was found dead in her Bronx apartment, her body no more than a 17-pound skeleton pocked with roach bites, investigators have been sifting through the details of her short, ailing life. Did she die of malnutrition, as a preliminary autopsy suggested? Was it her mother's fault? Should anyone have spotted the dangers that awaited the child, or prevented her decline?
The answers to those questions are weeks away, and who, if anyone, is culpable for the death of the child, Ahsianea Carzan, is far from certain. The medical examiner's report will take another week, and the city's Administration for Children's Services is conducting its own internal inquiry. 
But interviews and a review of records suggest that over the last few years, Ahsianea and her family came into frequent contact with a web of private social service agencies and government officials charged with helping families in crisis.
Mired in many difficulties at once -- bouncing from one apartment to another, a bitter custody fight, domestic violence charges against the children's father, Caseim Brown -- the Carzans had paraded through Family Court on several occasions. Child welfare caseworkers visited their home at least twice. A probation officer may have, as well.
They were seen by doctors -- as recently as November -- as well as by school officials, a psychologist and at least two private social service agencies that work with needy children.
At almost each point, the family was referred to a sprinkling of services. Whether they were appropriate and whether the mother, Ebony Carzan, availed herself of those services or found them helpful remain unclear.
She seems to have alternately rejected and sought help, particularly when it came to raising Ahsianea, sometimes following the suggestions of professionals, sometimes missing doctors' appointments. She has refused to speak to a reporter.
In the end, it seems, none of those who came into contact with the family were able to pinpoint the perils that Ahsianea faced. Nor, apparently, were they able to aid her mother, a 24-year-old unemployed woman and former orphan who had fled an allegedly abusive boyfriend and was raising four children alone on welfare and disability benefits for her severely disabled daughter.
As for her other children -- 1, 6 and 7 years old, and now in the city's custody -- the attorney appointed by the court to represent them says they, too, suffered.
"It appears there may have been some form of corporal punishment," the lawyer, Aleza Ross, said. She could not say, however, if and how the child welfare agency failed to protect them.
The Carzans first came to the attention of the city school system in April 1998. A doctor at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, where Ahsianea was seen, recommended that she be evaluated for a preschool special education program, according to a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, Margie Feinberg.
School officials in Staten Island, where the family lived at the time, sought the mother's consent, as required by state law. But consent never came. Ahsianea was never evaluated.
A few months later, in October, during a custody battle in Manhattan Family Court, the children came to the attention of the Administration for Children's Services. Mr. Brown accused Ms. Carzan of neglect. Child welfare caseworkers visited her home, and the court ultimately granted custody to the mother and visitation rights to the father. (For her part, Ms. Carzan had already accused Mr. Brown of a string of domestic abuse incidents. His criminal case is pending.)
They may have been visited by a probation officer, frequently used by the courts to inspect homes in contested custody cases, around that time as well. Probation department officials were unable to confirm whether that happened in this instance.
The child welfare agency's investigation found no evidence of neglect. Still, a portrait of a family in crisis emerged. A spokeswoman for the agency, Jennifer Falk, said they referred Ms. Carzan to a shelter for domestic violence victims and suggested that she seek counseling at the Puerto Rican Association for Community Affairs, a troubled agency shut down a few months later.
Ahsianea was also referred for evaluation to the Lucille Murray Child Development Center, a private group in the Bronx that assesses and provides day care services for developmentally disabled children.
There, on Jan. 13, 1999, Ahsianea was seen by a social worker, an occupational therapist, a psychologist and a speech pathologist. Her needs, recalled the social worker, Yolande Schelling, were plainly daunting. The child could not speak or move her limbs. She was blind. She needed intensive treatment -- the sooner the better, by Ms. Schelling's account.
Ms. Carzan, the social worker noticed, had no help in caring for the child. Indeed, their apartment in the Patterson Houses is not even equipped with a wheelchair ramp.
"When the child came in for evaluation, I saw possible signs of neglect," Ms. Schelling said in an interview last week. "The child was not receiving any services, and the child was a paraplegic."
But to get Ahsianea into a program, her mother needed to submit a doctor's report. Two weeks later, when she failed to do so, officials at Lucille Murray said they became worried. On Feb. 4, they faxed a note to the Administration for Children's Services; officials there responded by saying the family was already known to them.
Over the next two months, the center twice dispatched a social worker to the family's home, each time pressing Ms. Carzan to furnish a medical report for Ahsianea. "I was a bit fearful about this case," Ms. Schelling said. "She seemed so overwhelmed, having to bring all these kids. We went to her."
The home visits did not put Ms. Schelling at ease. Ahsianea was sitting in a stroller. Why had her mother not acquired a chair especially designed for paraplegic children, she wondered. The girl's hands were clenched in a fist -- cerebral palsy can severely restrict motion -- and the inside of her palm was covered with festering wounds.
Ms. Carzan did not seem uncaring, Ms. Schelling recalled, just overwhelmed. "She said, 'I try to do my best,' " Ms. Schelling said. "I thought this was a young parent who needed to get that child to treatment."
Ms. Carzan finally furnished the doctor's report in April. Though it was not as thorough as she would have liked, Ms. Schelling said, it allowed Ahsianea to be enrolled in a special education program.
In the end, Ms. Schelling's efforts bore no fruit. The next month, school officials in the Bronx recommended the Lavelle School for the Blind, a private academy in the Bronx under contract with the state. As a kindergarten student, Ahsianea was to attend classes five hours a day, five days a week, and receive language, occupational and physical therapy.
But according to the spokeswoman for the city schools, Ms. Feinberg, the girl's mother refused. And that was her prerogative: state law does not require a child to be in school until first grade.
So even after the mother refused, the school system had no reason to call the state central register on child abuse and neglect, Ms. Feinberg said. "At no time was there any neglect seen," she said.
Officials at the Lavelle School never saw Ahsianea. The next time they heard of their would-be pupil, she was dead.
For its, part, the Administration for Children's Services closed the Carzans case last August, having found no evidence of neglect.
A few months later, in October, Mr. Brown was back in court, again seeking custody and again charging that the children were neglected.
By then, the children's grandmother, Alberta Hanley, had also complained to the agency about possible neglect and abuse. Another visit by a child welfare investigator followed. The older children were interviewed, the home inspected. It does not appear that the caseworker saw Ahsianea. No evidence of abuse or neglect was turned up.
The next month, a doctor at Lincoln Hospital saw the child. Hospital officials said they could not comment on the doctor's diagnosis, except to say that she had been seen at the hospital twice earlier that year. She had also missed a number of appointments, said a hospital official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
The caseworker's report, prepared after the second visit, did not appear to indicate whether the family had received any of the services to which they had been referred the first time around, or whether Ahsianea was receiving treatment.
Should the caseworker have done more?
Agency officials said they would not comment until an internal investigation is completed. "We're looking into whether all proper casework was followed," Ms. Falk said.

HEADLINE: French Officials Warn Further Decline of Euro Could Harm the European Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 29

 BODY:
France's prime minister, finance minister and central bank governor rallied to the support of the sagging euro today, warning that a further decline could damage the economy of the 11 nations that share the currency and adding that the European central bank might take action to halt the slide.
The euro has shed 8.5 percent of its value against the dollar this year, and more than a fifth since its introduction in January 1999. 
 The fall has fanned inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods and raised concerns among many of the region's 290 million citizens about their savings.
France's top officials chose the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the Bank of France, created by Napoleon with a mandate to protect French citizens from inflation, to voice their concerns about the euro's weakness.
More than 100 central bank officials are in Paris today and Tuesday to attend events linked to the anniversary of the French central bank.
The euro's exchange rate "isn't satisfactory," said Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. Finance ministers from the euro nations would support central bank action that led to a "solid and stable" currency, said Laurent Fabius, the finance minister, echoing Jean-Claude Trichet, the Bank of France governor, who said the European central bank would be vigilant to ensure the euro is a "strong currency."
Mr. Fabius said that the European central bank might raise interest rates to halt the currency's decline and ensure inflation did not accelerate. The region's inflation rate averaged 1.9 percent in April, just below the European central bank's 2 percent limit.
Many investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates for a fifth time since early November at the next meeting of policy makers on June 8.
The 3.75 percent benchmark rate is 2.75 percentage points below the United States Federal Reserve's benchmark, a gap which has helped brighten the allure of the dollar. The euro declined 0.5 percent today, to 92.67 cents.
Mr. Fabius indicated that finance ministers might prefer intervention to support the euro in the form of buying the currency on the open market, rather than raising interest rates. Higher borrowing costs would "harm economic growth," making it harder for governments to achieve "full employment, while lowering budget deficits and taxes," he warned.
While unemployment is falling in France and Germany, the euro region's two biggest economies, a tenth of the work force in both countries is still out of work.

HEADLINE: Despite Defeat On China Bill, Labor Is on Rise

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Despite the American labor movement's loss in the bruising battle over the China trade bill, supporters and opponents of the movement say that after years of decline, labor has once again become a powerful political force.
Unions provided important political muscle that helped Vice President Al Gore locked up the Democratic presidential nomination, and they are certain to be a major force for the Democratic Party in the fall. 
 After many people wrote off labor as an irrelevant, toothless dinosaur, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has displayed considerable muscle on Capitol Hill. Labor has blocked legislation to grant the president fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements and has helped push through a higher minimum wage and the Family and Medical Leave Act.
In other signs of labor's strength, white-collar workers, including doctors and psychologists, are flocking into unions as never before, and labor registered its biggest organizing victory in 60 years by unionizing 74,000 Los Angeles home-care workers last year.
Much of this rebound has been engineered by John J. Sweeney, who was elected president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. four and a half years ago on a platform of reviving labor after its membership and influence had slipped steadily for two decades. To rebuild labor, Mr. Sweeney has focused on attracting new members; as the best evidence of a turnaround, he points to last year's 265,000 jump in union membership -- by far the largest rise since the 1970's.
Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said it would be foolish for anyone to think that labor was weak because the House of Representatives defied it last week and approved permanent normal trade relations with China.
"Anybody who stands up and says, 'We won this thing by a couple of votes and therefore labor is weak,' they don't know how to count," said Mr. Donohue, who led the corporate fight for the trade bill. "Labor has a lot of money. Labor has a lot of forces on the ground. Anyone who wants to declare them weak, just look out for the next fight."
This year, the 13-million-member A.F.L.-C.I.O. has pledged to assemble its biggest army of campaign volunteers; tens of thousands will distribute literature at workplaces and make millions of get-out-the-vote telephone calls.
The labor federation's endorsement of Vice President Gore gave him much-needed assistance in the Democratic presidential primaries, with union foot soldiers helping him trounce former Senator Bill Bradley in the Iowa caucuses and capture the New Hampshire primary.
Political experts also give labor much of the credit for Democratic victories in 1998, from Gray Davis's election as governor in California, to Charles E. Schumer's triumph over Alfonse M. D'Amato for a New York Senate seat, to the party's surprising success in gaining House seats in the last midterm elections.
"It's like night and day comparing the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political operations today with those in the 1994 elections," said Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political report. "It's like comparing a Model T with a Ferrari."
But labor has a long way to go to regain the economic might it had in the 1950's. Back then, 35 percent of the nation's work force belonged to unions compared with 13.9 percent today. The sectors where unions have traditionally been strongest, like steel, automobiles, mining and apparel, have been losing jobs the fastest, while the sectors where unions have the least representation, like technology, finance and fast food, are the fastest-growing fields.
Organized labor is losing about half the elections in which workers vote on whether to unionize largely because many corporations mount aggressive and expensive campaigns that urge workers not to join unions. As a result of such corporate tactics, unions now represent fewer than 1 in 10 private-sector workers.
"The labor movement has done very well in the public sector, organizing government employees, but in the private sector, it is still very difficult," said Richard Hurd, a labor relations professor at Cornell University.
Labor also faces other problems: the occasional embarrassing episodes of union corruption, repeated Republican efforts to weaken unions, and internal feuding among union leaders over political strategy and trade issues.
Businesses contribute 15 times as much in campaign money as unions do, and many Democrats still keep their distance, fearful of accusations that they are in Big Labor's pocket. And for all their efforts, unions lost the fight they cared about most in the last few years, the China trade bill.
To reinvigorate labor, Mr. Sweeney has advocated more militant tactics, like those used by thousands of striking Los Angeles janitors who repeatedly blocked traffic last month to draw attention to their low wages. He has also worked to reduce labor's unwanted reputation as a "special interest" by having it focus more on helping low-wage workers and by forming alliances with religious leaders, environmentalists, immigrant groups and college students protesting overseas sweatshops.
"John Sweeney has a commitment to reach out to those who have been largely bypassed by the labor movement," said the Rev. Howard Hubbard, the Roman Catholic bishop of Albany, who has helped lead efforts to rebuild the clergy's once-strong ties with labor. "He's reached out to the forgotten workers -- child-care workers, nurses' aides, janitors, people at the low end of the scale. He's made a commitment to show solidarity with the poorest workers."
With union membership falling by nearly a fourth from 1979 to 1995, Mr. Sweeney has made attracting more members his No. 1 priority. He often cites studies showing that labor's declining power is a major reason that after-inflation wages have declined for most workers in the last quarter-century.
Mr. Sweeney has used his bully pulpit to urge the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s 68 member unions to hire more organizers and to spend millions of dollars more each year on recruiting. Still, in his first three years at the federation's helm, union membership slid by 150,000 as many unionized workers retired or companies closed unionized factories and moved operations overseas.
But Mr. Sweeney's ambitions seemed to pay off last year when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that union membership grew by 265,000.
Union leaders say they hope those gains are not a one-time blip, but the start of a long-term upswing, although many labor experts say the jury is still out.
"I think we're starting to turn the corner," Mr. Sweeney said. "While we've had significant progress in terms of organizing, we still have to do a lot more. We can't rest on modest growth." His ambitious -- some say unrealistic -- goal is for unions to organize one million new members each year, meaning there could be a net gain of 500,000 members after layoffs and retirements.
But there is a huge obstacle to reaching this goal. Only a handful of unions, most notably the Service Employees International Union and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, are making an all-out effort to attract more workers. Mr. Sweeney said he wished that more unions copied the union he once headed, the Service Employees, which devotes 45 percent of its budget to organizing -- 10 times the percentage of many unions. That union recruited 155,000 workers last year, many of them janitors and hospital employees, the most any union has organized in one year since 1918.
"There is still tremendous inertia among certain unions," said Kent Wong, a labor relations professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "The level of activism among some unions has changed dramatically, but many unions are having tremendous difficulties changing."
In an effort to expand union membership, Mr. Sweeney has gotten the labor movement to reverse its long-held position and embrace immigrant workers, rather than oppose their taking jobs. In the 1980's unions were convinced that immigrants were driving down wages so labor backed a law that punished employers who hired illegal immigrants.
But this year the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has called for ending such employer sanctions and granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Labor changed direction because it now views immigrants as a natural audience for its message and because it sees many employers taking advantage of illegal immigrants.
One welcome development for labor is the surge in interest shown by white-collar workers. With managed care squeezing their incomes and professional freedom, thousands of doctors are joining unions, while in New York State, 3,000 psychologists have unionized. Nationwide, 10,000 podiatrists have joined unions and so have more than 20,000 customer service workers at United Airlines and US Airways.
Hundreds of I.B.M. workers showed interest in unionizing last year after their company sought to cut their pensions. And even a few dozen workers at Microsoft called for a union because they were angry about being long-term temporary workers, with few benefits, rather than permanent workers.
"In a lot of industries, because of the way things are changing, people realize they need some form of collective voice," Mr. Sweeney said. "People are seeing the problems they're confronted with are too big to resolve by themselves."
In the wake of the China trade battle, one of Mr. Sweeney's biggest problems is that many political and business leaders have pegged him as protectionist and anti-trade. These critics misunderstand his position, he insists.
Convinced that past trade accords have helped business but not labor, Mr. Sweeney said he told the Clinton administration that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would oppose any trade agreements that did not protect workers rights. So when he learned that the administration's trade deal with China contained no worker protections, he saw no choice but to oppose it.
"I think trade is good for our country," Mr. Sweeney said. "It's important to our successful economy. We recognize that globalization is here to stay, so the question is how do workers around the world share in the fruits of globalization?"

HEADLINE: Gas May Reach $2.25 a Gallon, Schumer Warns

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Unless action is taken now, gasoline prices will hit $2.25 a gallon this summer followed by a spike in heating oil costs worse than the one last winter, Senator Charles E. Schumer predicted yesterday. But federal energy officials disputed his figures.
Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from New York, urged the Clinton administration to help drive prices down by releasing federal oil reserves into the market. He made his proposal in a joint letter dated Friday with Senator Susan M. Collins, a Republican from Maine, to the federal energy secretary, Bill Richardson. 
 But Secretary Richardson disagreed with both the premise and the proposal. "These are unnecessarily alarmist views, as they do not reflect current market conditions or projections," he said yesterday. His agency's experts forecast a national average price of $1.40 to $1.45 a gallon by the end of summer.
The average price for regular unleaded gasoline in New York City is $1.64 a gallon, up from $1.27 a year ago, according to a recent survey by the AAA automobile association.
The two senators blamed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, charging that it had failed to keep its promise to increase production enough to hold crude oil prices to $28 a barrel. Instead, the price has been hovering around $30.
"If OPEC continues to constrict supplies of oil and we fail to release reserves, the price of gasoline will go to $2 this summer and $2.25 by Labor Day, and home heating oil prices will be through the roof," Mr. Schumer said at a news conference in Manhattan.
Such increases would divert money from other needs and could curtail summer vacation plans, he said. Worse, increased fuel charges would raise the price of food and other commodities because of higher trucking costs. Such inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to push interest rates up, which would slow the economy. "It points a dagger at the heart of our economy," Mr. Schumer said. "Gasoline at $2.25 a gallon is not just a nuisance; it's a crisis."
The nation's oil reserve is about 600 million barrels stockpiled in Texas and Louisiana, set aside by law for emergencies.

Phone Upstart In China Plans $5 Billion Stock Offering

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 29

 BODY:
Two months after China's largest oil company staggered onto the stock market here, the country's second-largest telecommunications company announced today that it would seek to raise as much as $5.26 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong and New York.
The company, China Unicom Ltd., hopes to get a warmer reception than PetroChina, a state-owned oil company that was tarred before its offering by charges of labor and human rights abuses. China Unicom will probably be spared those brickbats, analysts said, because it is an upstart phone company rather than a vast oil giant with operations as far apart as Tibet and the Sudan. 
 "China Unicom is a very different animal than PetroChina," said Andrew Look, an independent fund manager here. "PetroChina is a typical old-economy company. China Unicom doesn't have that baggage. It is a technology play, and a play on China's entry into the World Trade Organization."
But Unicom, which was started by the government six years ago to challenge the state monopoly, China Telecom, has its own problems. It recently shelved plans to upgrade its network with a mobile phone technology licensed from Qualcomm. And it has had to unravel joint ventures with more than 20 foreign partners, whose investments the Beijing authorities declared illegal.
Most troubling, China Unicom has only a 14 percent share of the country's burgeoning cellular phone market. China Telecom, which raised $4.2 billion in a stock offering in 1997, has the bulk of the business -- plus the favor of market analysts, who consistently put its shares at the top of their recommended lists.
"Unicom has yet to prove its mettle in the marketplace," said Rohit Sobti, an Asian telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney here, in a report published in February. "We believe the company has a long way to go before it can effectively compete" with China Telecom.
China Unicom said in its prospectus that it would issue almost 2.46 billion shares, each at a price between 11.50 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.48, and 14.50 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.87. It will also offer 2.34 billion shares in the form of American depository receipts in a price range of $14.76 to $18.61.
If the offering is fully subscribed at the middle of the price range, the company said, it would raise nearly $4 billion. At the top end of the range, the proceeds would be $5.26 billion -- making Unicom the largest stock offering in Asia outside Japan. The Japanese phone giant N.T.T. spun off its cellular operation, NTT DoCoMo, in an offering that raised $18 billion.
Unicom said it planned to use the cash from the offering to underwrite a $12 billion expansion of its cellular, long-distance and data networks. Although the company is an also-ran in the mobile phone market, it operates the largest paging business in China, with 43.5 million subscribers.
"The Chinese authorities have helped Unicom by giving it licenses and injecting the paging business," Mr. Look said. "This is a very sexy story."
Certainly, China Unicom's story has had corporate soap opera qualities. In its early years, the company's status as an upstart was appealing to foreign investors like Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. They agreed to put in money, even though it meant setting up awkward joint ventures to circumvent China's restrictions on foreign investment in telecommunications networks.
Then, in 1998, Beijing declared these arm's-length investments illegal, and ordered the company to dissolve them. China Unicom spent many months in often-rancorous negotiations with the partners -- in the process becoming a symbol of the perils of foreign investment in the country.
China Unicom said it would take a one-time charge of about $100 million to buy out the remainder of the joint ventures. As part of the settlement, it will also issue warrants that allow its former partners to buy shares of China Unicom six months after the initial public offering.
The company's technology foray has been similarly ill-starred. In February, it signed an agreement with Qualcomm to upgrade its network with a digital mobile phone technology known as C.D.M.A., or code division multiple access. Today, it told investors in Hong Kong that it would abandon the plan because C.D.M.A. was in danger of being superseded in two years by so-called third-generation cellular technology.
With this record of flip-flops and false starts, some analysts say that China Unicom is destined to be a weak sister to China Telecom. But Unicom can take solace from PetroChina: after being picketed by protesters and initially spurned by investors, it now trades comfortably above its offering price.

HEADLINE: Lazio Falls and Splits His Lip, But Keeps Marching at Parade

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: BABYLON, N.Y., May 29

 BODY:
Representative Rick A. Lazio tripped and fell face down onto the pavement today at a Memorial Day parade here, splitting his lip. But he dusted himself off and finished the route before going to the hospital, getting eight stitches and then marching in a second parade in Queens alongside the man he replaced in the race for the Senate, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The injury means that Mr. Lazio will most likely have a swollen lip on Tuesday afternoon, when he is expected to formally accept the Republican nomination for the Senate at the Republican convention in Buffalo. 
 The candidate and his supporters quickly seized upon the accident and sought to turn it to their advantage, both with humor and by using it to try to illustrate Mr. Lazio's perseverance, before it could become the wrong kind of political metaphor about missteps or stumbling on the campaign trail.
And like Bob Dole, who fell off a stage at a campaign stop in California during the 1996 presidential race, Mr. Lazio quickly poked fun at his mishap. "I was so happy to be home that I had to kiss the ground," Mr. Lazio, who fell in his own district, said after leaving the hospital. "I didn't know that it would kiss back."
It was indeed a hometown parade for Mr. Lazio, one he said he has marched in since childhood. Along the way, he greeted many spectators by name, shook many hands and kissed many babies. Then, his jacket and tie and leather dress shoes notwithstanding, he would sprint back to the head of the parade, literally running for office. It was during one of these sprints that he slipped and fell onto Deer Park Avenue.
Dabbing at his mouth with a bloodied handkerchief and a bag of ice from a nearby deli, Mr. Lazio finished the parade.
Some spectators were confused at the sight of him, as shouts of "Good luck, Rick!" and "Keep her out of New York!" were replaced by cries of "You've got lipstick on you," and, more accurately, "Your lip is bleeding!" When Mr. Lazio finished the route, his aides looked on nervously as he paused to talk to reporters before driving back to his home in nearby Brightwaters for help.
Aides said that once he got home, Mr. Lazio got prompt advice from his wife, Patricia, a nurse, who took one look at his lip and recommended a trip to the hospital.
So he got stitches at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, changed into a pair of rubber-soled boat shoes for better traction, and went back onto the hustings to campaign with Mr. Giuliani at the Little Neck-Douglaston Memorial Day parade along Northern Boulevard.
It was the first time Mr. Giuliani had campaigned with Mr. Lazio since deciding not to seek the Republican nomination for Senate himself.
This parade was not without chaos either. The mayor and the injured congressman soon found themselves facing a crush of reporters so unruly that police reinforcements were called in to restore order, and trying to talk about campaign issues and economic opportunities over the din of the roaring mufflers of Rolling Thunder, a motorcycle club made up of Vietnam veterans who were riding in the parade.
The mayor seized on all this as evidence of Mr. Lazio's grit. "Look at him, he's a real New Yorker," Mr. Giuliani said. "He's got a fat lip, he can talk over the worst kinds of noises, it doesn't bother him and he's out here answering all your questions."
The mayor's comments were a not-so-veiled allusion to Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who, as first lady, is often kept from the press by the Secret Service.
But if the morning parade was in the heart of Lazio country, the afternoon parade was clearly in Mr. Giuliani's territory. The mayor got the loudest cheers from the crowd.
And Mr. Lazio, while warmly greeted, was not always recognized. "Who's that with the mayor?' " one spectator asked.
But there were plenty of well-wishers. Joe Martino, 73, who served in the Pacific in World War II, said, "I was sorry to see Rudy Giuliani get out of the race, but we're for Lazio."
And Linda Delligatti, 65, who goes to the parade every year and gets a kiss from the mayor, got a kiss from Mr. Lazio, stitched lip and all, this year. "On the cheek," she said. "The mayor kissed me too. I hope he gets better."
Still, for all the spectacle of Mr. Giuliani's endorsing his onetime rival for the Republican nomination and actively stumping for him, many eyes remained on Mr. Lazio's sutured mouth. As the parade continued along Northern Boulevard toward 251st Street, a member of the mayor's staff might have averted another accident when he noticed that Mr. Lazio's shoelaces were untied. "Sir, your shoes," he cried out.
When Mr. Lazio knelt down to tie them, he was instantly surrounded by photographers seeking to capture the moment.

HEADLINE: POPULATION SHIFT IN THE WEST RAISES WILDFIRE CONCERNS

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
The wildfire that swept through Los Alamos, N.M., this month is setting off alarms across the mountain West, where more and more Americans have chosen to live on the forest's edge.
Experts say that housing shift has multiplied the danger that fires could kindle similar disasters elsewhere. And the shift is behind an urgent new Congressional quest for millions of dollars in emergency money to try to ease the risk. 
 The blaze in Los Alamos, which consumed hundreds of homes, was a pre-emptive fire gone awry. But in communities like Ashland, Ore., and Missoula, Mont., whose populations have swelled with former city dwellers, the fire has served fresh notice that residents sit astride a volatile mix.
"It's not a matter of if the fire occurs, it's a matter of when," said Paul Summerfelt, a top Fire Department official in Flagstaff, Ariz., which is surrounded by the world's largest forest of Ponderosa pines and where half of the 60,000 residents are said to face a severe wildfire risk.
Across the country, the damage caused by wildfire to homes and property increased sixfold from the 1980's to the 1990's, to a total of $3.2 billion over the last 10 years, federal officials say. In an average year over the past decade, 1,200 homes burned, more than double the number over the previous decade.
Already this year, more than 40,000 wildfires have consumed more than a million acres, more than in any similar period since 1996.
With the lesson of Los Alamos in mind, Congress and the Clinton administration are working on a plan that would focus an urgent new round of fire-prevention efforts this summer in the danger zones where populations and wild land meet.
"As people get their homes closer and closer to nature, they become more and more at risk," said Kenneth O. Burris Jr., chief operating officer of the United States Fire Administration, which is based in Emmitsburg, Md.
The emergency measure is being drawn up by Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and other Western lawmakers with help from the Forest Service and other federal agencies. It would nearly double, to $115 million from $65 million, the amount of money available to the government this year for efforts intended to prevent wildfires.
In part, the plan would pay for more prescribed fires, like the one that ignited the Los Alamos blaze, in a fiasco for which the federal government has accepted responsibility. It would also emphasize safer but more costly efforts, relying in part on manual cutting and thinning of the dense, overgrown forests that surround many Western mountain communities and lie at the heart of the fire risk.
"The events of the past two weeks in New Mexico demonstrate that we cannot simply allow nature to take its course," Senator Bingaman wrote in a May 19 letter to Mike Dombeck, the Forest Service chief.
Fire, of course, is a natural event, but few Western forests remain in their natural state. Experts say the current fire problem is a legacy of the last 100 years, in which most fires have been suppressed and large trees logged, leaving today's forests unnaturally dense, choked with debris and fire-prone.
Those years of fuel accumulation have made it more likely that even a small fire caused by lightning will spread. That danger is reflected in statistics showing that the number of wildfires that destroy 1,000 acres or more in the United States has increased to a recent average of about 80 a year from 25 a year in 1984.
But there is no doubt, the experts say, that the wildfire problem has been compounded by rapid population growth in the nation's most forested states, particularly by the building of legions of ranchettes, vacation homes and developments near forest boundaries. That trend has added new fronts to the kind of threat that has long plagued places like Southern California, where population growth into remote canyons and hillsides began several decades ago.
For one thing, the proximity of people to forests makes it more likely that a cigarette or a lawn mower spark, for example, might ignite a blaze; an estimated 90 percent of wildfires are caused by humans. Of even more concern, the experts say, is the fact that the presence of houses makes forest fires more difficult to control, because priority is given to protecting property, and more difficult to prevent, because traditional fire-prevention methods like controlled burns are often unpopular with residents.
"We've created a situation in which the forest is like a wood stove," said Andy Stahl, executive director of the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, a group of 13,000 current and former employees that is based in Eugene, Ore. "We've loaded that stove with paper and shavings and sticks and the like, but now it's sitting in the middle of a living room, and we're telling the forest managers, O.K., take care of this stuff, but don't burn the house down."
The Forest Service estimates that some 40 million Americans live in what it calls the "urban/wildland interface," directly adjacent to or scattered within unpopulated areas with wild land vegetation. The agency's estimate does not say how many of those people face a wildfire risk, but separate findings by some fire-prone states leave little doubt that the number is high.
In California and Colorado alone, officials there say, about three million people face at least a moderate wildfire risk, including the many who have built new homes in recent years in areas like the Sierra Nevada foothills in California and Jefferson County, west of Denver.
A study by Dave Theobold, a researcher at Colorado State University, focusing on areas within two miles of forest boundaries found that population densities in those once remote parts of the state had quadrupled from 1960 to 1990, even before the last decade's building boom.
"Clearly, the states with a lot of forests have through most of the last decade shown disproportionate growth and disproportionate home building, and that implies that we're going to have more people living close to the forest than in the past," said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Homebuilders.
What happened in Los Alamos has dealt a major setback, at least for now, to prescribed fire, the method most commonly used by federal officials to reduce fire risks on Forest Service and National Park Service lands. In that case, what was to have been a controlled blaze in the Bandelier National Monument quickly spread out of control, ultimately burning more than 46,000 acres.
The 30-day moratorium on such burning imposed by the federal government remains in effect, and last week Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt extended the ban indefinitely on park service land. Across the West, the example is bound to harden local resistance to the setting of blazes like the one in Los Alamos.
The main alternative, the manual trimming of countless commercially worthless small-diameter trees, faces problems of its own. It is so costly that the Forest Service has typically enlisted timber companies to do the work as part of contracts that also allow traditional logging activity. But such arrangements have also tended to stir strong opposition from environmental groups.
For example, in Ashland, Ore., a community popular among wealthy former city dwellers, a Forest Service plan to reduce the risk of a fire that could cut off the city's water supply has been blocked for the last four years by critics opposed to the fact that it would allow timber companies to carry out new logging.
Frank Carroll, a spokesman for the Potlatch Corporation, a timber company based in Spokane, Wash., criticized such opposition as shortsighted. "We have got to face reality," Mr. Carroll said, "and what's happening now is that various groups are absolutely bent on a course of catastrophe for communities in the West."
As one potential model, some Congressional and administration officials have been looking to a project under way in Flagstaff, where a coalition of government, industry and environmental groups has begun to make a dent in trimming the dense Ponderosa forest that extends even within the city limits.
Even there, however, opposition from groups like the Forest Guardians, an organization based in Santa Fe, N.M., has acted as a brake. The group opposes what it calls the commercialization of the national forests, and its executive director, Rex Wahl, suggested that residents worried about fire danger should not expect someone else to solve the problem for them.
"They move to the forest and then they want to get rid of the forest, because it's being touted as a threat to their property," Mr. Wahl said. "They need to take some responsibility for the danger themselves."

HEADLINE: Franks Uses His Insider Status As a Selling Point in Senate Race

SERIES: IN THE RUNNING -- Second of four profiles of the Republican candidates for the Senate in New Jersey.

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 29

 BODY:
Representative Robert D. Franks, just in from Washington and a vote on the House floor, breezed into a candidates' night not long ago at the Days Inn in Roxbury, N.J., wearing his political experience as comfortably as his unwrinkled dark suit.
After some small talk about the cloud formations he had seen as his plane landed, Mr. Franks ticked off a series of accomplishments of the Republican majority in Congress, and argued that his party deserved more credit than President Clinton did for the declining budget deficits and the roaring economy. Then he moved on to his role on the Transportation Committee and the specifics of legislation to ease congestion on state roads. 
 "I'm the one candidate in this race who has served in federal office," said Mr. Franks, a four-term member of Congress who is among the four Republicans seeking the party's Senate nomination in the June 6 primary. "And I believe I have accumulated the experience to weigh in on your behalf."
Such declarations of Beltway familiarity sometimes breed contempt -- or paeans to term limits -- but Bob Franks projects his Washington experience as a plus.
He has spent a lifetime steeped in politics and government. It started at age 15, when he worked as a youth coordinator in an early State Assembly campaign of Thomas H. Kean, who would later become governor. Mr. Franks himself was elected to the Assembly at 28, and later served as the state Republican chairman from 1989 to 1992, the year he won his seat in Congress.
During that rise he forged relationships with county leaders, healed divisions in the state party and exuded an earnestness and ambition that Mr. Kean said came across to most as "a love and enthusiasm for government that is very rare."
"But he's different from a career politician, because he takes courageous stands," said Mr. Kean, a reference to their shared views in favor of abortion rights and on other social issues. "He is one of those people who can bring people together in the center, because he is not off to the right or the left."
Despite these encouraging words, the former governor has not endorsed anyone in the primary race, which also includes State Senator William L. Gormley, another of his longtime political allies. The other candidates are James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, and Murray Sabrin, a former Libertarian.
Still, in a state where Republicans seeking to advance to higher office are stacked up like jets waiting to land in fog at Newark International Airport, Mr. Franks has had his share of problems lately in promoting amity and bringing people together. His "career track," according to one prominent Republican, had always pointed toward running for governor in 2001.
But that goal put him on a collision course with his fellow Union County Republican, Donald T. DiFrancesco, the State Senate president. That played out in a battle for control of the Union County Republican Party chairmanship in 1998, a fight Mr. DiFrancesco's side won.
When Gov. Christine Todd Whitman decided last fall not to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Frank R. Lautenberg, Mr. Franks averted any further confrontation by shifting to the Senate race. But it may be a temporary cease-fire. "Bob's modus operandi is collaboration," one Republican leader said, "but all bets may be off if he doesn't win the Senate nomination and decides to return to a run for governor."
In an interview, Mr. Franks, 48, admitted that as a career politician, he could face hostility from time to time. But he has tried to blunt the label by voluntarily returning 5 percent of his annual Congressional salary of $141,300, adopting a gift ban in his Congressional office and donating his frequent flier miles to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children with life-threatening illnesses.
"I'm not your father's politician," he said, "and that's why I have won consistently in a district that has 22,000 more Democrats than Republicans." He was born in Hackensack but spent part of his childhood in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn.
It was there that his passion for politics seems to have surfaced. At 13, he found himself drawn to a storefront plastered with campaign posters for Charles Percy, a Republican candidate for governor of Illinois. Mr. Franks said he walked in and emerged with the job of handing out campaign literature, "a fun thing to do." Mr. Percy lost, but two years later Mr. Franks worked on his successful Senate campaign.
Soon after, the Franks family returned to New Jersey. Mr. Franks recalled his father, a pharmaceuticals salesman, softening the blow of the relocation by telling him that their new community of Summit was staunchly Republican. The teenager quickly became active in the party, helping to resuscitate the local Young Republicans and recruiting volunteers in local campaigns.
He attended college at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind., and later earned a law degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
After returning to New Jersey, he began his political career in earnest, with a plan to run for the Board of Freeholders in Union County in 1979. But then a veteran state senator decided to step down, allowing the area's Republican assemblyman to move up. Mr. Franks set his sights on Trenton. He won, and served 13 years in the Assembly.
By 1989, the Republicans were in disarray, unable to hold the governor's mansion against the onslaught of Jim Florio. The party chairman resigned, and Mr. Franks, who had developed a reputation as a diligent lawmaker who could bring factions together, was tapped to be leader of the state party.
Three years later, Representative Matthew Rinaldi, a veteran Republican, left the party in the lurch when he resigned and ended his re-election bid just three months short of the general election. The well-liked Mr. Franks was a shoo-in as a last-minute replacement.
In the race for the Senate nomination, Mr. Gormley has raised the most money, but Mr. Franks is not far behind with his goal of raising $2.5 million for the primary. And he has something that Mr. Gormley does not, Sheriff Edward Rochford of Morris County said: a grass-roots network around the state made up of people whom Mr. Franks helped as a state legislator, party chairman and congressman.
"I met him when he was my instructor in Republican 'candidates school' when I first ran in 1992," Sheriff Rochford said. "He taught me what he does, and that is to try to make most of the people accept you by sitting down and explaining your positions to them and by embracing your opponents and not going negative."
That has changed some in the thick of the battle with Mr. Gormley, as Mr. Franks has been aggressive in recent debates.
Glenn Paulsen, the Republican chairman in Burlington County and a Franks supporter, recalled how 11 years ago when Mr. Paulsen sought to oust a longtime Republican officeholder who had made a racial slur, Mr. Franks, then party chairman, stood with him "without flinching and on principle." Mr. Franks used to show up unannounced at the campaign headquarters to help out.
"He seemed young but tremendously energetic, and you knew this wasn't just another politician, but a real guy," Mr. Paulsen said. "So when he announced that he was running for the Senate nomination, I didn't hesitate and was on the phone to him asking what he needed me to do."
One of the keys to Mr. Franks's seeming broad appeal is his moderate record. While he voted with the Republican majority to impeach President Clinton and joined with Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, in pushing the Republican Contract With America in 1994, he continued to be moderate on domestic economic issues as well as on foreign policy, while liberal on many of the social and cultural issues dear to conservative Republicans.
"On the core values of the Republican Party, which are freedom, economic opportunity, personal responsibility, I'm a bedrock Republican," Mr. Franks said. "While in Washington I have concentrated on sending the power and the authority back to the states."

HEADLINE: Summer Residents Want Year-Round Voice

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y., May 26

 BODY:
Behind the privet hedges that shield the many monstrous mansions in this village by the sea, something semi-revolutionary is brewing.
The rich people who summer in the Village of Southampton are up in arms, in an understated, law-abiding kind of way, about an American principle for which Colonial patriots tossed tea into Boston Harbor: taxation without representation. 
 "We don't say we cannot afford to pay the taxes -- we never admit to that -- but we don't like to pay taxes that are onerous and we don't like to be ripped off," said Lowell Harwood, a seasonal resident. Though he owns a beach house here that he estimates is worth $6 million, Mr. Harwood, like others with a permanent residence elsewhere, cannot vote in village elections.
The seasonal residents of Southampton are hardly alone in their hunger for a vote away from home. From Cape Cod to Colorado, second-home owners are clamoring -- usually with the help of their lawyers -- for a limited franchise. They want a voice in how their tax dollars are spent and in how much year-rounders may charge them for services they seldom use.
Mr. Harwood, 70, who made his fortune in parking and property development in Manhattan and whose glass-and-wood home in the dunes has a swimming pool, tennis court and putting green, doesn't expect sympathy.
"Nobody is going to feel sorry for us," he said, referring to himself and his wealthy neighbors on Southampton's Meadow Lane. "That is not what we are looking for. We just want justice."
This village, which predates the Boston Tea Party by 133 years, has been floating in a deep green sea of property tax money since the 1890's. That's when plutocrats like W. K. Vanderbilt began to erect gargantuan houses that they insisted on calling cottages. Since then, in an inexorable march of the moneyed to the sea, more and more summer people have bought their way into Southampton, as more and more year-round village residents have been bought out.
Village officials say that about three-quarters of the village's property taxes are paid by summer people, who have no vote in local elections unless they choose to make Southampton their permanent residence. The justice that summer people seek is the right to vote on village matters, like who will be mayor and the setting of special tax assessments for roads and water service, while keeping their permanent residence back home, which usually means Manhattan or the suburbs of New York.
Like most states, New York allows residents to claim only one legal residence for voting purposes. "You can't have two addresses for voting," said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections. "That is the election law."
Yet even some year-round residents of resort communities are beginning to agree with summer people that the law should bend to the reality of an increasingly affluent nation where sales of vacation homes continue to soar. According to a survey this month by the National Association of Realtors, 377,000 vacation homes were sold in 1999, an increase of 9.3 percent from the last survey in 1997.
"It really is a taxation-without-representation thing up here," said John Quenell, a year-round resident of Lower St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks and a councilman in the Town of Brighton, N.Y. "The way things work out in the eastern end of Long Island or up here, it is the people who don't live year-round and don't use the services who end up footing most of the bills. It is not fair."
In the Adirondack village of Speculator, year-round residents approved spending $5.3 million last year to build a school for 103 students. In response, part-time residents, who account for about 40 percent of the school district's tax base and could not vote on the proposal, filed a federal lawsuit, which is pending.
There are about a dozen states, including Connecticut, Colorado, North Dakota and Indiana, that grant nonresidents a vote on some local issues. The right was endorsed three years ago by a federal appeals court in Denver, which ruled that seasonal residents who owned property in the tiny resort of Mountain View could vote on all local matters, in a town where they pay eight times more property taxes than year-round residents.
"It is clear that the nonresident property owners have a sufficient interest in town affairs to make it rational for the town to include them in the political process," the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled.
That is exactly what Bill Hattrick, a former mayor of Southampton, believes is both fair and inevitable for summer communities on the South Fork of Long Island.
"It is a grave injustice in this country to take the money of the summer residents and not give them full membership in the club," said Mr. Hattrick, a year-round village resident who is president of the Southampton Association, a group of about 700 mostly part-time residents who own large estates.
Scholars who study tax policy in the United States dispute just how grave that injustice may be.
"I have never been too concerned that the very wealthy are underrepresented by our political system," said James Hines, a professor of business economics at the University of Michigan Business School and director of the school's Office of Tax Policy Research. "Even if they have one vote, or in this case, no votes, their interests are still represented by their economic power."
There is a limit to how much the locals can charge the rich, Professor Hines said, because the rich can simply move away. But he added that in the Hamptons, where competition is keen among the rich and celebrated to flaunt their money and celebrity, the soak-the-rich limit might well be incalculable.
"On one hand, it is unfair," said Professor Hines, referring to what he said is a well-established pattern of year-round residents' extracting high taxes from seasonal property owners. "On the other hand, it is hard to cry your eyes out about it, given all the other tragedies in the world."
Year-round residents of the Hamptons, who spend their summers stuck in traffic and who have seen countless potato farms gobbled up by supersized mansions, certainly are not shedding tears for the disfranchised pain of summer people.
"You can't really make an intelligent decision as a voter if you are only out here three months a year," said Francesca Haley, a waitress at Silver's Restaurant on Main Street in Southampton, who lives in nearby Bridgehampton. "I don't feel they have a right to dictate how my life is going to be when they are not here."
Mr. Harwood, the wealthy developer who lives on Meadow Lane in Southampton, says he does not want to dictate anything to the year-round residents. He merely wants to fix a costly problem with his water bill, which he says is a monument to "taxation without representation and taxation without service."
Mr. Harwood and about 100 other similarly rich property owners on Meadow Lane pay hefty water taxes to the nearby Hampton Bays Water District, although they do not receive a drop of water from the district.
Mr. Harwood pays $1,800 a year for this nondelivery of water. He also pays about $700 a year for water that he does receive from the Town of Southampton Water Authority.
Since a hurricane severed a water line in 1938, no one in Southampton Village has been able to take water from the Hampton Bays Water District. But this has not stopped the annual billing. The 5,900 or so people who do receive water (and who live next door in Hampton Bays, a moderate-income community) like having their water taxes subsidized by rich Southampton people who cannot use what they must pay for.
"If I can afford a house like mine, these people feel that I can afford to pay their water bill," Mr. Harwood said. "I don't mind giving money away to charity, but I don't like it taken away."
A referendum has been proposed that would allow voters in the water district to decide if the 100 Southampton property owners in the district who get no water can stop paying bills, which average $1,500 a year. The rub in any such referendum is that property owners like Mr. Harwood, whose permanent residence is in Short Hills, N.J., would not be eligible to vote.
"We are going to see if we can get the vote," Mr. Harwood said. "Then we are probably going to have to sue."
Politicians in the Hamptons say they are sympathetic to both the frustrations of summer residents and resentments of year-rounders.
"Permanent residents feel they can't drive around any more because of traffic, and sometimes they can't even walk around because of the crowds of summer people," said Joseph Romanosky Jr., the mayor of Southampton Village, which has a year-round population of 3,900 and a summer population of 25,000.
"And now you are telling them that the summer people should have the right to vote?" asked the mayor. "They don't know these people and they don't trust them."
Fred Thiele, the assemblyman whose district includes Southampton, said the Legislature in Albany would sooner or later be forced to address the voting matter seriously. In his district on the South Fork, nonresidents own more than half the residential property.
"This issue is not going to go away," he said.

Peru Election Turmoil: Stability vs. Democracy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, May 29

 BODY:
The students have been back in the streets, throwing Molotov cocktails at the presidential palace, and the police have been firing back, with tear gas and water cannon. A journalist was tortured last week after he said he had evidence that the intelligence chief was conspiring with election officials. The army called for order. 
 On the surface it appeared so familiar, as President Alberto K. Fujimori rode to a third term on Sunday in an election so full of dirty tricks that Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate, withdrew from the race, and all the international election monitors backed off, too, before a single vote was cast.
But this battle has a different script. Issues that were important before the end of Communism are not the issues any longer, and the same is true around the region.
Old issues of land, class conflict and resistance to imperialism that were foremost during the waves of guerrilla insurrections, university revolts and military coups in Peru from the 1960's into the early 1990's are no longer setting the sparks.
The new dominant issue facing Peruvians is whether the nation is best served by politicians who put democracy first, or those who put stability first. It is a question that was not resolved Sunday, because the election was effectively not contested.
"Before, the issue was survival," said Francisco Diez Canseco, a former congressman and human rights activist. "Now it's about whether the virtues of authoritarianism are to be replaced by the growing desire of people for broader political participation."
The question crosses class and ideological boundaries. It raises uncomfortable choices for a nation whose few experiments in democracy brought corruption, inefficiency, instability and economic chaos.
And United States policy makers also find themselves in a quandary, wanting to encourage free elections but also to support a government that has been a strong ally against terrorism and drug trafficking.
The cast of characters and alliances would have seemed impossible before Communism's collapse, when the political currents flowing across Latin America originated in Washington, Moscow and Havana.
Take Mr. Toledo, whose resume and platform would have been unthinkable just a few years ago for someone proposing to annul an election and overthrow a government.
Though he comes from a poor family, Mr. Toledo is a former World Bank employee and business school professor, and has a doctorate from Stanford. He says his first project, if he ever makes it to the presidential palace, would be to create an independent uncorrupt judiciary. His core constituency is the urban middle class.
For Mr. Toledo, the choice for Peru now is between "democracy and dictatorship."
In the past, moderates like him usually found themselves facing a choice between the right and the left, and they usually lost out in coalitions with Marxist guerrillas or right wing generals. Today in Peru, the moderates are leading the revolution and the leftists are following.
Standing between this rather unrevolutionary lot and power is President Fujimori. The son of Japanese immigrants, Mr. Fujimori remains in many ways the ultimate outsider even after 10 years in power. He is still the target of nasty racial jokes by the Lima elites, and he is proud that his core constituency entails the urban shantytown dwellers and Indian villagers in regions most severely attacked by Maoist terrorists in the 1980's and early 1990's.
Mr. Fujimori has a long list of accomplishments, ranging from the defeat of two terrorist groups and hyperinflation to making peace with Ecuador after more than a century of border strife. He has probably built more schools, roads and health clinics to serve the poor than every other Peruvian president combined.
The problem with Mr. Fujimori, according to his critics, is that he fires judges when they disagree with him, he uses his intelligence agency to harass his opponents, he finds ways to put cronies in charge of television stations, and is willing to convict suspected terrorists without giving their lawyers the benefit of cross-examination. In short, he does not give democratic rules a very high priority.
In an interview last week, Mr. Fujimori said his muscular tactics may not be pretty but they are necessary. "In emergency situations," he said, "I had to take emergency measures that may have appeared anti-democratic." He promised that once he is inaugurated on July 28, "there will be certain corrections."
In 1992, Mr. Fujimori temporarily disbanded the Congress and Supreme Court, saying he needed more powers to defeat the terrorists and narcotics traffickers. The traditional political parties that controlled those institutions, he argued, only stood in the way. Washington and Latin democracies were highly critical, but the Peruvian people went along enthusiastically, and Mr. Fujimori won a re-election landslide in 1995.
Opinion polls suggest that the Peruvian president might well have won a clean, uncontested election this year again, although by a much narrower margin. With Peru no longer in crisis, a growing number of voters appeared ready to give democracy a chance again.
In the end, historians will probably judge Mr. Fujimori on the basis of how he puts Peru in shape for an eventual change to democratic rule.
What Mr. Toledo and Mr. Fujimori have in common is their blurring of ideological distinctions. What does it mean to be conservative or progressive -- when the two candidates, who otherwise seem to be at war with each other, essentially share economic and social goals?
It is much the same in Mexico, where some left-leaning activists are backing the conservative presidential candidate as the best way to crack the dominance of a ruling party that has been in power for seven decades. Or in Chile, where the first Socialist president in a generation has embraced the heart of the free market economic policies first put in place by the Pinochet dictatorship.
Or in Bolivia, where a former military dictator now rules as a democratically elected president in alliance with former guerrillas. Or even in Colombia, where guerrillas with Marxist origins recently took to exchanging views with visiting investors from Wall Street.
Political turbulence continues to roil much of the region. Only the whiff of tear gas remains the same.

HEADLINE: A Holiday Weekend Turns Manhattan Into an Isle of Calm

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
The sun sidled up over Manhattan ever so quietly yesterday, indifferent to the chill of the air. It matched the mood of the city: introverted, solitary, almost secretive.
Deserters who thought that they were leaving the city to be overrun by holiday tourists could think again. What they left behind was a muted New York, with sparse streets and unhurried pedestrians. 
 With summer, like a watched pot, refusing to boil, everything seemed subdued and, after a frenzied weekend, eerily serene. Taxis scudded through Times Square with nary a honk. A movie director could not have arranged for sidewalks so modestly populated. At a Starbucks, the young baristas who usually juggle orders from a crowd four deep took it easy while a man in a black velvet coat and black shades napped in an overstuffed armchair.
Even the shoppers on 34th Street moved more as if nursing hangovers than hunting down Memorial Day bargains. Those who normally considered themselves lucky to get a seat in the small sliver in the center of Herald Square presided over entire tables. Enisa Terzic, a Macy's clerk with cropped dark hair and lips lined in black, read her copy of Cosmopolitan with as much composure as if she were sitting in the window of Dean & DeLuca's.
But for Rene Ramirez, a Barnes & Noble deliveryman, and many others who tried to conduct business yesterday, the ease of getting around, and in Mr. Ramirez's case, the promise of $3 instead of $2 for every book that safely reached its purchaser, did not make up for the absence of people. "Today, maybe a lot of people go upstate or to other places, and it's not easy to find them," he said.
At a street fair on Madison Avenue below 53rd Street, business was hardly any better for Paul's Concessions, a sausage stand. "I got a break all day long," carped Paul's son, Eric Behling, 31, giving away two corn dogs.
At the Empire State Building, the yards of velvet rope used to control traffic hung undisturbed and unemployed. What was usually a three- to four-hour wait had dropped to 30 minutes.
"This is the deadest I've ever seen it for Memorial Day," said Joey Lopez, an observatory guard, shaking his head as though in sorrow for all those who would miss the sight of four states from one spot. "It's unlimited today. The view is impeccable."
Theories. There were theories. "I think a lot of people come to New York for the shows, and there are no shows today," said Marie Burke, up from Boston for the shows and a little shopping.
Behind her, a Japanese woman had pulled a chair up to Bryant Park's grassy lawn as if it were a breakfast table, and sat down to peruse her newspaper. She did not have much to say, not even her name. "I'm just enjoying this solitariness," was all she would venture.
Resting together on the largely vacant steps of the main branch of the New York Public Library, two retired women from Flatbush, Brooklyn, who had walked uptown after shopping, made their guesses.
"Everyone's going to the parade, and I think it's not high summer yet," Elsie Fabio said. Then, she conjectured that it was simply a matter of locale. "While we were walking up, everyone seemed to be going down," she said.
But even the usually clogged sidewalks of SoHo were free-flowing enough to attract even those accustomed to avoiding that part of town. Susan and Jason Salgado, TriBeCa residents who identified themselves as "members of the financial community," had come home early from a weekend in Syracuse just for the pleasure of having the city (almost) to themselves. "That's what we love about New York, finding times when the city is less crowded," Mrs. Salgado said.
The afternoon shadows were lengthening, people were returning from their long weekends, and the air was beginning once more to strum and vibrate. A not-so-distant car honked. But the Salgados grinned at each other, the errands they had saved up for weeks completed, and a few shopping bags over Mr. Salgado's arm. "It just has a very kind of European feel to it, just walking out on the streets," he said. "Nothing to do, nowhere to go. We don't have to be any place."

HEADLINE: The Fear of Taking Paternity Leave

BYLINE: By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
James M. Strauss does not consider himself a wimp. But Mr. Strauss, a Manhattan lawyer, was not going to take an extended leave of absence when his son Evan was born last June. One of the reasons: He feared that his co-workers would question his machismo.
"If I had said that I was planning to take more than two weeks off, people would have looked at me askance," said Mr. Strauss, an associate at Putney, Twombly, Hall & Hirson. Instead, he took just three days of vacation to help his wife with their newborn. "There's definitely a perception out there that child care is a burden that's still expected to fall on women," Mr. Strauss said. 
 Though it has been seven years since Congress signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for new parents, most men do not take advantage of this legal right. Some decline for economic reasons, but for others, it is fear that keeps them in the workplace -- fear of being ridiculed, fear of being discriminated against, even fear of losing their jobs -- some specialists say.
"Men are terrified to take parental leave," said Suzanne Braun Levine, a former editor of Ms. Magazine and author of "Father Courage: What Happens When Men Put Family First" (Harcourt, 2000). "While their organizations may profess to be family friendly, their bosses are giving them the message that men who take leave are not very manly, or are somehow letting down the team."
That's the message that a former South Carolina state trooper, David Roberts, says he got when he asked for six weeks off to care for his newborn daughter Cindy in 1996. Mr. Roberts, who had been with the state police nine years at the time, says he made the request because his wife was still in nursing school. He says his superiors responded by telling him that "a man's job was to work, not stay home with the kids."
"One of my bosses told me this long story about how he had never let his wife work -- even though they had so little money that they had to eat beanie weenies to make ends meet," Mr. Roberts said. "Basically, he said I was less of a man for wanting to care for my child." Mr. Roberts said he was intimidated into withdrawing his request and was later dismissed in retaliation for making it in the first place.
Last June, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Public Safety on his behalf. The department's lawyer, Vance J. Bettis, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and said that Mr. Roberts's accusations "just aren't true."
The former trooper, Mr. Bettis said, "was terminated for reasons unrelated to his requesting leave."
In a strikingly similar case, also brought by the A.C.L.U., a jury awarded a former Maryland state trooper, Kevin Knussman, $375,000 in February 1999 for the first-ever sex-discrimination verdict in conjunction with the 1993 federal family leave law. Mr. Knussman contends that his supervisors told him that "God made women to breast-feed babies, and men can't fulfill that role." That case is being appealed, and Betty Stemley Sconion, principal counsel for the Maryland State Police, says that Mr. Knussman was not discriminated against. "He made a mountain out of a molehill," Ms. Stemley Sconion said. "His superiors made an attempt to accommodate his request for leave."
Sara Mandelbaum, a Manhattan lawyer who represents both Mr. Roberts and Mr. Knussman for the A.C.L.U., says accusations of bias against family-oriented fathers is not confined to blue-collar male bastions like law enforcement. "We hear about situations like this all the time in the white-collar world, although sometimes the message is more subtle," Ms. Mandelbaum said. 'I often hear from men on Wall Street, or from lawyers, who say their bosses have hinted that they wouldn't get promoted if they took an extended leave for nurturing purposes.'
Paula Rayman, director of the Radcliffe Public Policy Center, which studies workplace issues, says a Harvard professor recently confided that his boss told him he would never get tenure if he took time out from work to care for a new baby.
"Companies like to put on a family-friendly front," Ms. Rayman said, "but behind the scenes, managers are sending out a totally different message."
In researching her book, Ms. Braun Levine says she interviewed a human resources manager for a major company who said he advised male colleagues to take a combination of sick leave and vacation time to avoid having the words "parental leave" emblazoned in their employee records. "He seemed to feel that taking paternity leave would be a strike against you," she said.
Even at some companies where parental leave is encouraged, human resources managers say they see few male takers. "Very few men here take more than a week off for the birth of a baby, and usually, they just use vacation time," said Donna Klein, a vice president at Marriott International in Bethesda, Md. "If you're a man, there's still somewhat of a stigma attached to taking paternity leave per se."
The only companies that see larger numbers of men taking parental leave are the ones that offer paid leave -- and even there, senior executives have to set an example first, according to workplace experts.
"It makes a big difference if you've got a manager to lead the way," said Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president for research and information services for Catalyst, a New York-based research group that studies women's issues.
Such a manager may have made the difference for Joseph J. Kelleher, an associate at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, a Manhattan law firm that offers both male and female employees a full month of paid leave after the birth of a child. Mr. Kelleher took advantage of the firm's policy after both of his daughters, now 3 and 5, were born. "I didn't feel funny about it, mainly because there are several folks here who have children and have done the same thing," Mr. Kelleher said.
According to Christine Wagner, director of legal personnel for the firm, more than 80 percent of eligible men have taken advantage of the policy since its inception in 1993, including several partners. But Ms. Wagner knows her firm is in the minority.
"A lot of firms offer some kind of leave policy, but their managers don't walk the talk," she said. "Here, our male partners did -- and it's really opened the floodgates."

HEADLINE: Gambling On a Hip-Hop Musical;
Drawing on Roots and Legends in a Show at the Apollo

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
When a group of rap legends and Harlem-based artists announced last month that they would be mounting a Broadway-style musical in the landmark Apollo Theater, the show was presented not only as an indicator of Harlem's economic and cultural renewal, but as the birth of a virtually new theatrical genre as well: the hip-hop musical.
But nothing is ever simple when it comes to exploring an embryonic artistic form, or, for that matter, stretching the borders of artistic expression in Harlem. The Apollo has never been known as a venue for plays. And while hip-hop may have invaded every other aspect of culture, it has not yet established a place for itself on the American stage. 
 The play, "Echo Park," opens tomorrow. It has drawn on rap legends and community resources like the National Black Theater and the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, and it looks to set down a version of hip-hop history at a time when the genre, now more than 20 years old, is given more and more to reflection and historiography. As with almost any theatrical production, this one has had its share of artistic struggles, sleepless nights and financial headaches, but "Echo Park" also comes to the stage bearing the burden of trying something that has not been done before.
A week before the curtain was to rise, the big dance numbers were almost seamless, with break dancers leaping effortlessly into back flips and diving across the stage into head spins, and the rappers hitting their marks dead on. But the director was lamenting that the dramatic scenes verged on lethargy, and the producers were still worrying about the financial troubles of a venture that must turn a profit.
The first installment of a trilogy that traces the genre's history since 1978, "Echo Park" is a would-be "Hair" for the hip-hop generation, chronicling the rise of a rough-hewn cultural form from the neglected parks and train yards of Harlem and the Bronx to a multibillion-dollar industry. The cast includes the rap luminaries Kurtis Blow, Grandmaster Caz and D.J. Hollywood, but the producers, Lifted Productions, also took a grass-roots approach, enlisting graffiti writers to design the set, city B-boys for break-dancing parts and untested neighborhood actors for other roles.
The producers, who regard this presentation of Echo Park as a work in progress, have held ticket prices to $20 to $35 and have not invited critics to the one-month run at the Apollo.
"We want to get input from the community and improve it so it's ready for a tour, or going overseas, or maybe going to Broadway," said Eric H. Vinson, the executive producer. "The idea is to get an affirmation from the Harlem community, because, if you've ever watched 'Amateur Night at the Apollo,' you know how hard the audiences there can be. That's the real test for us."
The project was born two and a half years ago, when Kelly D. Scott, a former model and actor who has appeared in small parts in television sitcoms like "Martin" and "Living Single," teamed up with Sean Couch, a former N.B.A. basketball player and, later, a financial analyst for such Wall Street firms as PaineWebber and Shearson Lehman.
At the time, Mr. Couch and Ms. Scott were both working on an all-black production of the Maxwell Anderson play "The Bad Seed" at the Victoria Five Theater in Harlem. Neither is an accomplished playwright, though each has done some theatrical writing -- in 1996, after Mr. Couch left Wall Street, he wrote "The History of the Blues," for the National Black Theater; Ms. Scott, a published poet, has written two unproduced scripts. They wrote the script and produced "Echo Park" together, with Ms. Scott, a neophyte, directing.
The two had grown up just blocks apart in Inwood Heights but had never met, and they shared many of the same childhood experiences. Both spent time in the late 1970's in Echo Park, off Tremont Avenue in the west Bronx, where disc jockeys would rig their sound systems to lampposts and mix funk and R & B sounds r to create a danceable beat. They witnessed the emergence of break dancing at such "park jams," where teenagers from opposing gangs faced off and "battled" each other to flaunt head spins, back flips, robotic maneuvers and other novel moves.
"We now have a whole generation of kids who grew up in hip-hop culture but don't understand its origins," Mr. Couch said. "They don't know that it's a lot more than them getting on the mike and rapping. Hip-hop was an explosion of suppression. The thread that runs through it all was the desire to be seen and heard, the ability to shine. I wanted to tell that history through the people who lived it."
The writers looked to their own experiences for inspiration.
"I wrote the park scenes because I was in the park a lot playing ball, and the club scenes were Kelly, because her aunt was a big promoter and she was in the modeling scene," Mr. Couch said.
But they were also influenced by the stories of those around them. As Ms. Scott put it, "D.J. Hollywood, Grandmaster Flash and all those guys were my heroes."
Most notably, they lifted moments from the life of Grandmaster Caz, born in the Bronx as Curtis Brown, and reborn in the 70's as M.C. and D.J. Casanova Fly. When he was 19 and a member of the Cold Crush Four, Mr. Brown offered a book of his rhymes to his group's manager, Henry (Big Bank Hank) Jackson, who went on to record the seminal "Rapper's Delight" ("I said, hip hop, the hippie, the hippie, to the hip hip hop") as part of the Sugarhill Gang in 1979.
The song is widely regarded as the hit that began rap's invasion of the mainstream, and Casanova Fly, supported by a number of hip-hop historians, claims authorship, although he says he has never seen a dollar for his work. In the play, a character named Doc achieves fame after stealing the main character's signature raps.
Mr. Brown's is a quintessential music business story, and because he is also performing in the show, it hovers in the rehearsal hall like a kind of medieval morality play. As a generic D.J. narrator in "Echo Park," Mr. Brown is boyishly gleeful in his role, especially when he's spinning mixes at the turntables. "I think this story is based on everyone's story," he said. "Everyone coming up in the pioneer days of hip-hop can relate to it."
The authors also borrowed loosely from Kurtis Blow's early life. Born Kurt Walker, he was a precocious young man who grew up in Harlem in the 70's and much to his mother's consternation spent a lot of his time scratching up her records. "At 13, I knew I wanted to be a D.J.," he said. "I knew this was going to be big, huge. I had no doubt."
The main character, Scott Jenkins, routinely clashes with his mother, secretly a rhythm and blues singer, who calls his form of expression "loud, stupid music."
Mr. Walker, as he prefers to be called, now 40, was living in Woodland Hills, Calif., enjoying life as a family man with his three young sons, writing theme songs for the NBA teams, and working as a disc jockey on the Los Angeles radio station KPWR, "Power 106," when Ms. Scott, an old friend, asked him to return to New York City for the production last year.
Back in the city for the first time in 15 years, Mr. Blow, who is on a leave of absence from his radio job, appreciates the admirers who stop him as he walks from the East Harlem rehearsal studio to a pizza place nearby. "I go home feeling life has revisited these old bones," he said.
Although he wonders privately if the M.C. character, Doc, may be portrayed as a bit too much of "a snake," (arguing that M.C.'s were often the ones who got lost in the fame game) he says he wanted to participate in the musical because it helps set the record straight.
"There's so many different versions of the history," he said. "Now, everyone is fighting for their own part of the history when in actuality, we're all part of the fabric."
Because the writers were on a mission to create a comprehensive picture of hip-hop's early years, 1978 to 1981, they brought a variety of elements together on the stage: break dancing, graffiti art, D.J.'s and rappers.
"This show is the first of its kind to incorporate all the elements of hip-hop culture, the music, dance, art and spoken word," said the show's choreographer, Adesola A. Osakalumi. "You're not just seeing the parts, but the integration of the parts."
Mr. Osakalumi, who has been break dancing since the 70's, is a member of GhettOriginal Productions, the dance company behind "Jam on the Groove," which ran at the Minetta Lane Theater in 1995. Jon Pareles, the chief pop critic of The New York Times, called the show "jubilantly hyperactive" in a review.
But Mr. Osakalumi said that keeping the dances period-specific was a challenge. "There were dance moves that were done then that are now lost," he said. "Then there are others that have evolved, like the elbow spin -- they used to do a half-spin and now they do four or five spins -- so the dancers have to resist the temptation to push it forward."
Similar difficulties were faced by the Big Time Crew, a graffiti art group from the Tremont section of the Bronx, which spraypainted the boldly colorful wild-style graffiti set. "It's much more elemental than the work today," said Joe Rodriguez, a member of the Crew. "Now, we're more into background and sceneries. Before, it was just your name, or wild-style train art."
The producers spent two years looking for the right mix of artists, and, about a year ago, held auditions that attracted actors and dancers from as far away as Germany and Japan. But they decided to cast closer to home.
One dancer, Josh Ortiz, 18, is a nephew of the Bronx dancers the Incredible Breakers and learned many of his moves from his uncles. Alien Ness, 32, born Luis Martinez in the Bronx, was an original member of Zulu Nation, a group that assembled around the rap figure Afrika Bambaataa, and often frequented Echo Park as a teenager. "I'm practically playing myself," said Mr. Martinez, whose character in the show is called Kid Ness. "That's what they called me when I was 12."
Because many in the cast had no professional acting experience, the group spent six weeks training at the National Black Theater in Harlem. And they spent five weeks in rehearsal at the Burgos center in East Harlem.
Writing the script and assembling the cast, the producers said, was easier than securing financial support. Mr. Couch and Ms. Kelly enlisted Mr. Vinson to do the heavy hitting. Until 1993 Mr. Vinson headed a sports and entertainment management and marketing company whose clients included Savion Glover and Ossie Davis; he is now a managing partner in Interactive Sports Signals, which he said enhances the sound systems in sports arenas. As executive producer, he had enough pull to convince executives at Colgate-Palmolive and Pepsi to support the production through joint marketing efforts. But Ms. Scott, Mr. Couch and Mr. Vinson also invested some of their own money in the production, which has a $250,000 budget.
There were also nonbudgetary hurdles.
The Apollo, acclaimed for starting the careers of musical giants like Ella Fitzgerald and James Brown and producing the television show "It's Showtime at the Apollo," has never been known as a theatrical venue, although it regularly presents shows touring on the "chitlin circuit" of black-oriented theater pieces. By opening up the theater's doors to productions like this, said Grace Blake, executive director of the Apollo Theater Foundation, the theater's governing board, the theater hopes to attract a new crowd.
Those involved hope it will also serve another purpose.
"A person like me who has been in hip-hop for 25 years wants to see the same things stay alive -- the routines and the mannerisms -- passed down through the generations," said Mr. Blow. "Because as much as we need to change the bad things, the good things need to be passed along too."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Resurfaced Last Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence surged in May and came close to the record it reached in January, despite the roller coaster stock market and six increases in interest rates in the last year.
The results of the monthly survey released yesterday represented a sharp turnaround from April and confounded expectations that consumer spending, the main driver of the longest economic expansion in United States history, was headed for a downturn. 
 The Conference Board, a New York-based research group, said its consumer confidence index rose to 144.4 in May, approaching its high of 144.7 reached in January.
The closely watched indicator had declined in the previous three months, in which wild swings occurred in the stock market. Economists had expected another decline in the index in May, to 136, from a revised 137.7 in April.
"Stock prices have been going down, but people have been getting used to it and realizing that the market is not collapsing," said David Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI. "Everybody's got a job; incomes are going up; inflation is still low -- all's right with the world."
The consumer confidence report is closely watched by economists and financial markets because consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of America's economy.
The turnaround in consumer confidence came despite an aggressive campaign by the Fed to slow the economy. The Fed has raised short-term rates six times over the last year, including a half-point on May 16, the biggest increase in five years.
Signs are beginning to emerge that the higher borrowing costs are slowing down purchases of major items like homes. Nonetheless, the Conference Board's survey showed that consumers' appetite for big-ticket purchases remained strong. The May results found that 3.6 percent of respondents intended to buy a home in the next six months; only 3.2 percent said so in April. Also, 32 percent said they planned to buy a major appliance, up from 29.7 percent.
Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's research center, said consumers were focused on favorable conditions in the labor market, including a 30-year low in unemployment. She predicted that consumer confidence would remain strong through the summer.
Analysts said the report did not clear up questions about whether the Fed would continue to tighten credit at its next regular meeting, June 27 and 28.
"We'll be watching things like car sales to see if consumers actually do spend more," said Gary Thayer, chief economist for the brokerage firm of A. G. Edwards & Sons.

HEADLINE: Indulging Russia Is Risky Business

BYLINE: By Zbigniew Brzezinski; Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser in the Carter administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With Air Force One scheduled to land in Moscow later this week, President Clinton still has not faced the fact that his policy of "engagement" with Russia has become a colossal disappointment. But in his visit to Moscow, he will encounter that reality face to face, when he is greeted by President Vladimir Putin, a former colonel in the K.G.B., the son of a party apparatchik as well of the grandson of a trusted member of Lenin's and then Stalin's personal detail.
Let it be said that in the area of relations with Russia, Mr. Clinton deserves some credit. The denuclearization of Ukraine and Belarus and the reductions of strategic forces by both the United States and Russia were negotiated with persistence and success. Ukraine's independence has been strongly supported. The United States expanded its relations with independent states in the southern Caucasus and Central Asia. Most important, under Mr. Clinton's leadership, NATO was enlarged eastward, and the administration has pledged to continue that expansion, including the Baltic states. 
 Unfortunately, however, the policy of "engagement" with Russia has deteriorated into a one-sided courtship. No longer is the Clinton administration striking a balance between positive inducements and negative pressures. The administration not only endorsed Boris Yeltsin's bombardment of the Russian parliament in 1993, but persisted in hailing Mr. Yeltsin as a tested democrat, even though his erratic presidency was a mixture of anarchy and authoritarianism. Sadly, doing so discredited the very meaning of the word democracy in the eyes of many Russians.
The policy of engagement hit a low with Mr. Putin. Though his election in March was precipitated by an arrangement whereby Mr. Yeltsin resigned the presidency and Mr. Putin became acting president, and no real alternative candidate was available to the Russian people, the White House praised the election, hailing it as the country's first democratic transfer of power in Russia's nearly 1,000-year existence. It even hailed Mr. Putin himself as a "reformer," despite some justifiable concern about his background. Mr. Putin's prompt appointment of five secret police and military officials -- one is widely known as a specialist in suppressing dissent -- as supergovernors was quietly ignored.
In the years leading up to this "election," the Clinton administration financially supported and promoted economic reforms in Russia that enriched only a few, including some top Russian leaders. The resulting pervasive corruption was simply ignored until Western and Russian news media exposed it -- and even then, the administration did not alter its policy.
The Clinton administration excused and even justified two Russian wars against the Chechen people. President Clinton compared the Russian campaign to Lincoln's efforts to preserve American unity and proclaimed, to widespread criticism, that the war's objective was "to liberate Grozny."
The summit this weekend, if not handled properly, poses new risks. First, President Clinton, in his eagerness to embrace a "democratic" Russia, could reach a hastily contrived agreement regarding missile defense that may undermine stable strategic deterrence while prompting allied disunity. Such a quick deal -- designed as a defense against North Korea -- could precipitate China's efforts to upgrade its nuclear forces and ignite allied fears that the United States is seeking security for itself alone.
Second, Mr. Putin could seek to enlist the United States in his effort to assume the role of protector of the Central Asian regimes against fundamentalist pressures emanating from Afghanistan. He would like support for a Russian-sponsored anti-Islamic coalition that would regain a dominant role for Russia in that region.
Mr. Clinton must not once again be so hasty in extolling the new Russian president as a democratic reformer. A dose of dignified restraint, based on a realistic assessment of where Russia is headed, could help redeem a policy of "engagement" that has gradually lost its way. It is not too late.

HEADLINE: With Trade Links Stronger, U.S. Insurers Scout for Business in China

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 30

 BODY:
Sy Sternberg, the chairman of New York Life Insurance, is in China this week trying to figure out whom to meet so as to ensure that his company is next among the dozens of insurers who have applied for a license to do business in China.
"We don't know what the process is in awarding licenses," said Mr. Sternberg, though New York Life has devoted more resources than almost any other American insurer to securing the right to operate here. He has tried to touch all the bases -- from officials of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. Still, he cannot be sure that he has met the person who makes the final decision. 
 So it goes in China's murky business world, where market access depends on whom you know and how happy you have made them -- though no one will tell you who those people are. Instead, chief executives like Mr. Sternberg operate on supposition and hearsay to identify the hidden decision makers and cultivate "top of mind," which means making their company the first that Chinese leaders think of when considering foreign supplicants from their industry.
China's entry into the World Trade Organization is supposed to change all that, and with the House willing to grant China permanent normal trade relations, American companies are expected to share in any W.T.O. bounty. The Senate is also considered likely to approve normal trading status for China. Were Congress not to grant Beijing such status, it could enter the W.T.O. anyway and exclude the United States from many trade benefits that W.T.O. membership conveys.
As part of China's W.T.O. membership, the country has promised to publish all rules and regulations governing trade and to create clear procedures for acquiring licenses to do things like sell insurance in the country. If Beijing holds to its promise, China will undergo a sea change in how business is conducted and take a step toward government by rule of law instead of administrative fiat.
"It's not going to happen overnight, but 10 years from now we'll look back and say it was a turning point," said Patrick Cranley, the head of the Cigna Corporation's efforts to win a license in China and chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce here in Shanghai.
In fact, China's transition to Western-style transparency is likely to be piecemeal and slow. But the insurance industry is one of the areas that promises a reasonable pace of change, for one thing because there is little concern that foreign companies can dominate a market in which comfort and familiarity play such a key role. The state-owned People's Insurance Company of China currently has 70 percent of the market.
Domestic companies stand to benefit almost as much as foreign concerns from the promised candor. Already, Western insurers have helped crack open markets that orthodox state-owned companies never considered or dared not try to enter for fear of angering officials in Beijing.
For example, no Chinese insurer sold life insurance to individuals before the American International Group won a license to do so in Shanghai seven years ago. The slim commissions paid to Chinese insurance agents did not warrant the effort. Then A.I.G. began paying its agents as much as 40 percent of the first year's premium and the individual life insurance business took off.
"No one imagined that Beijing would allow that, so no one ever tried," said Albert Lu, a former agent for the China Pacific Insurance Company and now ING Insurance's chief representative in China. All major Chinese life insurers offer individual policies today.
China needs a developed insurance industry now more than ever as the country tries to shift the burden of cradle-to-grave benefits away from its over-encumbered state enterprises, half of them only breaking even or losing money. Instead of providing free medical care, many state-owned companies are buying health insurance for their employees. A move from state-subsidized housing in favor of individually owned homes has increased the need for property and casualty insurance. And many people now buy life insurance with an annuity attached that serves as a pension.
Growth in the market has slowed from what it was a few years ago, but remains higher than in Western economies. Life insurance premiums, which grew 40 percent annually early in the 1990's, are still growing at more than 10 percent a year. And life insurance premiums account for only about 1 percent of China's total economic output -- one of the lowest rates in the world, and behind nations like Bulgaria and Zimbabwe.
Once China enters the W.T.O., it has promised to lift restrictions on the number of foreign companies it will allow to operate. Foreigners are to be allowed to sell insurance in at least three cities immediately upon China's joining the global trade group. After three years, all national restrictions are to disappear and foreign insurers allowed to sell group insurance, the market's largest segment, from which foreign companies are still barred.
For now, though, no one knows what the licensing process will be and so companies like New York Life and Cigna are continuing their relationship-building strategy. New York Life, for example, has established a $250 million infrastructure investment fund that it will use to support Beijing's current drive to build up the country's long-neglected Western regions. To help invest the money, the insurance company has hired the China Development Bank, run by Chen Yuan, former deputy governor of the Chinese central bank, which was the country's insurance regulator until late 1998.
Mr. Sternberg of New York Life has spent much of his own time lobbying for the license or otherwise trying to demonstrate his support for China, meeting for example with more than 100 members of Congress to push for normal trading relations.
"Our growth strategy is to expand into high-growth emerging markets," Mr. Sternberg said, "and China is an important part of that strategy, so it's important that I dedicate my time."

HEADLINE: Premier, It Seems, Isn't Alone in Seeing Japan as Divine

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 30

 BODY:
With a furor over his characterization of Japan threatening his party's hold on power, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori stood before journalists for 40 minutes on Friday denying that he had blurred the boundary between church and state.
Mr. Mori's strenuous self-defense rested on his contention that in calling Japan "a divine country with an emperor at its center," he had intended to say nothing more than that the emperor is a popular and cherished national symbol. 
 But whatever the prime minister's intentions, by touching on a taboo subject with such little caution he has shown the jagged edge of a nostalgic form of nationalism that is enjoying a powerful resurgence among conservative politicians.
His statement continues to embroil his office, giving his cabinet a 19 percent approval rating in a poll after he had made the remarks, the lowest ratings of any prime minister on the eve of national elections.
The problem with the denials is that the pronouncement was a perfect summation of State Shinto, the racist official religion that that drove Japan's expansionism in Asia and its war with the United States.
Mr. Mori may have denied that he was advocating a state religion or deification of the emperor, as existed in the past, saying, "That is utterly contrary to my personal belief."
But critics said it strained credulity for him to argue that his phrase, uttered before a Shinto political group, was unrelated to militarist Japan's wartime creed.
"Of course he recognized the nuance of what he said, and tried to show his sympathy for the people he was addressing," Takeshi Sasaki, a professor of politics at Tokyo University, said. "He tries to do this at whatever gathering. It may not have seemed like a very serious statement, but it has become a very serious matter."
To be properly understood, critics and historians say, the "divine nation" remarks must be seen in the light of recent right-wing statements and initiatives that call for, among other goals, moral indoctrination for youth, a clampdown on foreigners and a national holiday to honor the wartime emperor, Hirohito.
Late last summer, conservatives in the legislature won passage of a law to legalize the flag and a national anthem that is a paean to the emperor. Others have begun agitating for rearming the country, potentially even with nuclear weapons. A deputy defense minister, Shingo Nishimura, had to resign in the fall in a storm of criticism after he made such a proposal.
At the heart of the conservatives' project is the revision of a constitution written under American occupation and a dream of reversion to a mythical state that is strong and unsullied by undue foreign influences.
That members of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed since 1955, except for a period of less than two years, openly contemplate such ideas is at once an expression of the party's strength and its weakness.
The party remains powerful because more than ever it lacks an effective opposition. Even the diplomatic constraints of the cold war, when Japan was locked in an anticommunist alliance with the United States and several Asian countries, have faded.
"Although many L.D.P. members have a reactionary view of history, they were not able to express themselves, because of the overwhelming influence of the United States on the one hand and because of the restraint required by the international situation in East Asia on the other," said Yasuaki Onuma, a professor international law at Tokyo University. "However, with the sharp decline of the Socialist Party and the end of the cold war, the feeling of the majority is that we have gone too far in keeping silent on the issues of our relationships with others and national identity."
Although the constraints have loosened, the Liberal Democratic Party has been weakened by a decade of economic decline as severe as any advanced nation has experienced since the Great Depression.
Even though there is no strong opposition, the party owes its governing majority to an unusual and unpopular alliance with a pacifist Buddhist-affiliated party. And nowadays, most voters are skeptical independents.
Seen in this light, the appeals to the values and methods of the past may simply reflect a party desperately reaching to the past for answers to Japan's problems -- and to appeal to voters.
Mr. Mori's plummeting poll numbers since the "divine country" remarks, however, strongly suggest that such a clumsy approach is doomed to backfire.
And the ruling class's nostalgia may cost it more than votes. When a legislator states, as one did in Parliament this week, that Hirohito "built today's peaceful and prosperous Japan," the first casualty is the truth.
But beyond the historical record, as long as the leaders remain prisoners of an unexamined past, other countries will continue to look on Japan as an insincere, untrustworthy and potentially threatening nation.
"The Mori refusal to retract his statement harms Japan, and understandably so, because for Westerners in particular, Pearl Harbor caused Japan to be labeled as treacherous," said Herbert P. Bix, an American historian at Hitsosubashi University in Tokyo, and author of a coming biography of Hirohito. "His explanation borders on deceitfulness of the worst sort. Over and over again in Japanese politics, you can see leaders speaking out of both sides of the mouth, and the result is that Japan just isn't trusted."

HEADLINE: Serbia's Detroit That Was: In Distress and Angry

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: KRAGUJEVAC, Serbia, May 24

 BODY:
Velimir Pajevic, a pediatric surgeon, says that the average size of the craniums of newborns here is one centimeter smaller than in 1991, a result of declining nutrition.
Kragujevac, the capital of Serbia in the early 1800's, is a city of nearly 200,000 people, built around the Zastava car and munitions factory, said to be the first factory built in the Balkans. 
 But after a decade of war, sanctions and decline, about 60 percent of those of working age are not working, said Branislav Kovacevic, president of the Sumadija Coalition, a regional opposition group in this traditional heartland of Serbia.
Zastava, which employed 40,000 people 10 years ago, now employs 4,000, officials here say. Some 20,000 people are officially unemployed, while 35,000 others are on "paid leave" from Zastava and its associated companies.
Branko Vuckovic, a reporter and editor with Radio Kragujevac, said the city used to be the Serbian Detroit. "Now it's the Serbian Gdansk," he said, referring to the Polish shipbuilding city, where Solidarity was born, that no longer makes many ships.
He gestured to the remains of a few espressos and mineral waters on a cafe table. "That's about 100 dinars," he said, or about $2.50 at the unofficial rate of exchange. "Those on paid leave from Zastava are paid 350 dinars a month -- just three times what's on this table."
The government is repairing part of Zastava bombed by NATO during the war, and says it has plans for greatly expanded car production. But few here believe such assertions, saying the only future for the factory is an assembly arrangement with a more modern car company, currently impossible because of international sanctions.
Life is so hard here, for so many, that this is known as "the valley of the starving." Of course, that is an exaggeration, since many city dwellers get by because of their connections to the land, said Borivoje Radic, head of the city's Executive Council and a member of the Democratic Party.
Yet life has rarely been harder here, he says. The city is also home to at least 20,000 refugees, 15,000 of them from Kosovo and the rest of them Serbs who fled from Bosnia and Croatia. But the city's annual budget, given the decline of the country's currency and economy, is now only a fourth of what it was in 1997, Mr. Radic says -- the equivalent of $4 million, down from $16 million.
So there is plenty of anger here, in one of the most important towns for Serbia's democratic opposition, some 90 miles south of Belgrade. Here the opposition coalition built in 1996 and called Zajedno, or Together, remains together, unlike that in Belgrade, where the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic and the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic are usually at daggers drawn.
"If it weren't for the opposition leaders in Belgrade, Milosevic would not be in power," Mr. Kovacevic said. "People no longer believe in the people on the stage of those rallies."
Here, about 2,000 people a night gathered to protest the seizure ofStudio B in Belgrade, the main opposition television station, while the crowd of protesters in Belgrade itself, 10 times larger in population, had shrunk to fewer than 700.
Part of the problem is that Studio B was perceived as a propaganda organ for Mr. Draskovic, much as state television serves the interests of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, and did not serve as a true public-interest station.
Here, there is a full complement of news, with Radio B2-92, which lost its frequency in Belgrade, available, as well as opposition television news and documentaries. A local FM station broadcasts the Serbian-language programs of Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, the BBC and Deutsche Welle all day long. "People here are well informed," Mr. Vuckovic said.
A local opposition weekly, The Independent Light, said Serbia was "on the razor's edge," but described Belgrade as "deaf, blind and anemic," a pun on the association of independent broadcasters, or ANEM, whose broadcasts can no longer be heard in the capital. But it is also a commentary on the general view of Belgrade from here, which is of well-off, cynical, corrupt politicians and citizens who are largely indifferent to the fate of the nation.
"Belgrade is a great disappointment," Mr. Radic said. "You can't expect to defend Studio B from here. If they dared to take TV Kragujevac, we couldn't avoid a serious conflict." Like Studio B, TV and Radio Kragujevac are owned by the city, which is run by the opposition.
In fact, four years ago, the Serbian authorities tried to seize control of the television here. Up to 50,000 people gathered around the station, which had been occupied by the police. People cut off electrical power to the building and threatened to invade it; a deal was done and the station was left alone.
It would be the same now, Mr. Vuckovic said. "In Serbia, we say that when you show your teeth, the government retreats. But when people are undecided, then they just go faster."
But as everywhere in Serbia there is more talk of revolution than signs of it.
"Here, the situation is highly explosive," Mr. Radic said. "It would only take a spark." Mr. Vuckovic agrees, saying, "It's like a small room full of gas fumes."
But the phlegmatic Dr. Pajevic thinks that the reality is far different.
There is less of a sense of revolution here than of passivity, anxiety and alienation. People are still afraid to lose what little they have left, and they mistrust the desires and capacities of the Belgrade leaders of the opposition.
Dr. Pajevic, the surgeon, says the right analogy is surgical, not military. "We're far from an explosion," he said. "What you have here is anesthesia, anesthesia and hopelessness. There is so much disappointment in the opposition, many people won't even vote."
People live day to day, he said, scraping by on friends and gray market trading. Few pay their electricity bills, but the government does not insist, a form of social pacification. "Our boss plays nice like that," Dr. Pajevic said, laughing. And while the independent newspaper Blic is available here, for eight dinars, "for the same money, people will buy bread and milk for their kids."
Vesna Pajevic, the doctor's wife, is a city official in charge of social welfare issues. A former member of Mr. Draskovic's party, she became disgusted with its hierarchy and joined the Democratic Party instead, which has also disappointed her.
"The credibility of the opposition is dropping even here, where the coalition continues," she said. "There is too much corruption and not enough clear goals and strategies. People need to see that we are working for them."
The biggest mistake of the opposition, Dr. Pajevic said, was to win local elections four years ago and take power. "These guys were practically jobless, and now they've got cars and salaries and cell phones and things to lose," he said. "They've become fat and happy. People wonder if they really do want change. People think that both the regime and the opposition want to keep the status quo."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
The Wisdom of Thoughtfulness

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN 

 BODY:
Every few weeks, some Silicon Valley start-up tries to lure Mary Morse, a software engineer, away from Autodesk, a computer-aided design company in San Rafael, Calif. At least one of them has dangled an options package that could have made her rich by now.
But Ms. Morse invariably says thanks, but no thanks. The reason she is staying put, she says, is simple: she likes her bosses.
There is a lesson here for managers that they ignore at their peril in the current job market. Being a tough guy might have worked a decade ago when corporate America was downsizing and laying off workers by the millions. But that era, exemplified by Albert J. Dunlap, the roving chief executive nicknamed Chainsaw Al who boasted about how many people he had dismissed to raise the stock price of his companies, is over. 
 The American workplace has evolved to a kinder, gentler state. With unemployment at a 30-year low, bosses realize that they have to do more than pay good salaries and lavish perks on their employees if they want to keep them. They also have to be nice to them.
And now comes a Gallup Organization study that shows that most workers rate having a caring boss even higher than they value money or fringe benefits. In interviews with two million employees at 700 companies, Gallup found that how long an employee stays at a company and how productive she is there, is determined by her relationship with her immediate supervisor. "People join companies and leave managers," said Marcus Buckingham, a senior managing consultant at Gallup and the primary analyst for the study.
Ms. Morse's two-year career at Autodesk is Exhibit A for that reality. She has worked under several managers so far, she said, and they have all gone out of their way to please her. The first one guided her through a six-month internship, accommodating her college schedule and providing time off for finals. The second sealed her loyalty to the company by insisting on paying her $5,000 more than she requested as her starting salary.
"I think what he said without saying it was, 'You're more valuable than even that, and I'm going to give you what you're worth,' " she said.
Then that manager's supervisor approached her unexpectedly and asked to be her mentor -- an offer that she says filled her with "shock, amazement and delight."
Ms. Morse accepted, and the supervisor asked her to draw up a list of short-term and long-term goals. She provided her with a list of training courses, both inside and outside the company, that would help her meet those objectives. And finally, the supervisor contacted Ms. Morse's boss to make sure he would give her the time off to take the classes.
Enter boss No. 3, David Lein, Autodesk's automation manager. Mr. Lein, Ms. Morse said, summoned her to his office from time to time to discuss her career hopes. After she completed a project for the redesign of a large piece of computer code, he asked her what she wanted to do next. When she said she wanted to be a software engineer, he recommended classes and gave her the time off to go.
Two months ago, Mr. Lein and other managers arranged for Ms. Morse's transfer to a position testing more complex software designs, even though she lacked the experience that was supposedly required for the job. While not technically a promotion, the job required more expertise than her previous one and was a logical step to a higher-paying job.
All the kindness she has received the last two years, Ms. Morse says, is literally worth a million dollars to her. Before she joined Autodesk, and again nine months after her arrival, she was wooed by a telecommunications company that specializes in high-speed data transfer.
Both times, she says, the company had not yet gone public and offered her 7,000 stock options at an exercise price of less than $1 a share. She was tempted, but rejected the offer after she was told that although she had career aspirations for software development, the company would not honor them. The interviewer told her, she said, "If I hire you, you'll remain here in testing."
Had she accepted, she would be sitting on options worth $1 million at the current stock price. But she has no regrets. People at the company that wanted to hire her tell her they are bored and frustrated. "The general feeling is that they are putting in their time," waiting for their options to be vested so they can bail out, she said.
And friends at other Silicon Valley firms complain to her that they have trouble getting up in the morning, telling her, she says: "This thing worked out great, but I'm miserable."
Workplace specialists say Ms. Morse's experience is not unusual -- nor is the unhappiness of her acquaintances at other companies. The No. 1 reason people quit their jobs, they say, is dissatisfaction with their supervisors, not their paychecks.
"It's taken a tight labor market for employers to think though the social contract they are striking with people," says Charles A. O'Reilly III, visiting professor at the Harvard Business School and co-author of "Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results With Ordinary People," which is to be published this year by the Harvard Business School Press. "When job opportunities are plentiful, people with crummy bosses leave."
In fact, they are four times more likely to leave than are people with nice bosses, according to a 1999 study conducted by Spherion, a staffing and consulting firm in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Lou Harris Associates. In the survey, only 11 percent of employees who rated their supervisor's performance as excellent said they were likely to look for a job in the next year, while 40 percent of those who rated their supervisors' performance as poor were likely to jump ship.
To be sure, there are plenty of bosses out there with mean streaks, especially in highly competitive industries like movie-making or macho strongholds like oil. Scott B. MacKenzie, a professor at the Kelley School of Business of Indiana University who has studied workplace behavior for several years, says "jerks" can still rise to the top if they are stellar performers.
Moreover, being nice to employees is not a magic potion against defections. The big layoffs of the late 1980's and early 90's all but destroyed the tradition of loyalty to the company and replaced it with a new culture of job-hopping. "With downsizing, companies began saying, 'Don't expect a long-term future here, but keep your skills up to date,' " says Mark Roehling, a professor at the Haworth School of Business at Western Michigan University. Employees complied, he says, with the result that many will leave as soon as a better offer comes along.
What should a company that is plagued by defections do? Change its ways, advises B. Lynn Ware, an industrial psychologist who heads Integral Training Systems in Menlo Park, Calif. If a company learns that a valued employee is disgruntled, it should discuss it with him. "You say something like, I really want you to have a better work experience than you've had recently,' " Dr. Ware said.
Some old-economy companies are training managers in the art of benevolence. Macy's West, a division of Federated Department Stores, in San Francisco, recently began a pilot program of assigning mentors to new managers and telling all managers that up to 35 percent of their compensation would be linked to how well they retained the people under them.
The policy has apparently encouraged managers to be more accommodating to employees' needs. Ellen Murrin, a group sales manager for women's ready-to-wear clothing, for example, said she was now more likely to grant requests for schedule changes and time off than she used to be.
Other companies are also pushing their managers to be friendlier. An International Paper plant in Moss Point, Miss., holds morning training sessions on positive reinforcement, and David Sulik, a paper-machine superintendent, says they have changed his ways.
He used to hover and watch for mistakes. As a compliment, he would offer a pat on the back or a curt "good job." Now, he has cut back on the criticism and become more effusive in his praise, even writing the occasional thank-you note to an employee for an exceptional performance. He also chats with workers more than he used to.
"I think they trust me more than in the past," he said.
And that trust can pay off. Mr. Lein, the manager at Autodesk who was extra helpful to Ms. Morse, says that just as she has, he, too, has had to resist entreaties from other high-technology companies. He averages two job offers a week, to say nothing of an avalanche of 200 e-mail pitches from headhunters that he filters out with a software program that spots telltale words.
His reason for staying is similar to Ms. Morse's. When he looks around Silicon Valley, he says, "I see people burning out, companies going under and never making it to the I.P.O.
"Maybe I'm a bit of an anomaly," he adds. "Job satisfaction and being challenged means as much to me as the money part of it -- just so as long as I feel rewarded."

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Raises Forecast to 4% Growth

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 30

 BODY:
Economic growth in the industrial world will accelerate this year, to the fastest pace in more than a decade, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said here today, revising its growth estimates upward for the euro region, Japan and the United States.
The combined economies of the 29 member nations will grow 4 percent this year, the O.E.C.D. said, up from a forecast in December of 2.9 percent. 
 In recent months, the world economy has rebounded more quickly from recession in Asia, Latin America and Russia. This faster growth is reducing unemployment, though also increasing interest rates.
Citing high oil prices and possible rises in the price of some other commodities, the O.E.C.D., a grouping of the world's wealthier nations, said there is a "risk of a spillover into 'core' inflation and inflation expectations," though by raising rates, central banks should keep "inflation low nearly everywhere."
In its twice-yearly Economic Outlook, the organization said nations now use energy more efficiently than in the 1970's, when surging oil prices set off inflation. That "limits the overall impact of any price rise as well as exposure to future shocks," it added.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Broaden Their Look at the Clean Air Act

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today expanded its continuing review of the Clean Air Act by agreeing to decide whether the statute requires the government to look beyond the public health benefits of reducing air pollution and consider the economic costs as well.
The court's action raised the stakes even higher in a case, to be argued next fall, that already promised to be one of the most important environmental and administrative law cases in years. 
 Last week the justices agreed to hear the Clinton administration's appeal of a ruling by the federal appeals court here that the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by the Environmental Protection Agency, handed such broad authority of a legislative nature to the administrative agency as to amount to an unconstitutional "delegation" by Congress of its lawmaking power.
Acting today in the same case, the court granted a separate appeal, filed by the United States Chamber of Commerce and a group of regulated industries, that asked the justices to examine the Clean Air Act from a different perspective.
If the court were to read a broad cost-benefit requirement into the agency's rule-making authority, the business groups said, the whole delegation question could be avoided, because the cost-benefit requirement "could functionally serve as the necessary intelligible principle" to preserve the law's constitutionality.
The Clinton administration had argued against granting the business groups' appeal, characterizing it as an invitation to a judicial override of a choice that Congress had already made. In enacting the Clean Air Act, the administration told the court, Congress "reasonably concluded" that pollution standards "should be based on health and welfare considerations alone so that Congress and the public know that E.P.A.'s judgments on the health and welfare threats posed by particular criteria pollutants are not compromised by considerations of economic and technical feasibility."
At issue in the case are new standards, set by the agency in 1997, for ozone and small airborne particles. The administration's appeal is Browner v. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257, and the appeal granted today is American Trucking Associations v. Browner, No. 99-1426.
In invalidating the new standards in its ruling last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Environmental Protection Agency lacked "any determinate criteria for drawing lines" and had "failed to state intelligibly how much is too much." The opinion, by Judge Stephen F. Williams, suggested strongly that a cost-benefit analysis could supply such criteria.
But Judge Williams said the appeals court was constrained by its own precedent, a 1980 decision known as the Lead Industries case that specifically barred the agency from considering any factor other than public health. Only the Supreme Court was in a position to set that decision aside.
Although it declined to review Lead Industries when the decision was issued, the Supreme Court is familiar with the cost-benefit issue from a series of regulatory battles in the early 1980's involving the Occupational Safety and Health Act. In a 1980 case, for instance, a deeply splintered court struck down the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for exposure to benzene, holding that although the agency did not have to engage in full cost-benefit analysis to justify new regulations, it did have to make a preliminary finding that existing exposure levels posed "a significant risk of harm." That requirement presented a limiting principle that would avoid a finding of undue delegation, the court said then.
In an interview today, Edward W. Warren, a lawyer here who won the benzene case 20 years ago and will argue for the business groups in this case, said his clients were not asking the court to adopt a "technocratic, lives-for-dollars" analysis of the Clean Air Act or to use the case as a vehicle to "transform the administrative state." He said it was possible to interpret the statute as making public health the primary consideration, with cost considerations coming in only at the point of selecting among alternative strategies.
For purposes of the case, the most relevant phrases of the Clean Air Act are those that instruct the administrator of the E.P.A. to set air quality standards that while "allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health."
There are no completely safe levels, above zero, of the pollutants that the law regulates. According to the business groups' brief, the phrase "adequate margin of safety" suggests that the agency "must trade off the costs and benefits of additional safety, just as designers strive to engineer 'adequate' -- but never complete -- safety into every product they design."
There were also these developments at the court today:
 
Church Arson
After its ruling last week that the federal arson law does not apply to arson of a private residence, the court ordered two federal appeals courts to reconsider whether the law applies to arson of a church. In one case, Rea v. United States, No. 99-6136, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, found that a church annex, used as a schoolhouse and for other activities, was sufficiently connected with interstate commerce to be covered by the law.
But the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, almost simultaneously vacated a man's guilty plea for burning a church. In that case, United States v. Johnson, No. 99-1266, the appeals court said the government had not shown that the Hopewell United Methodist Church in Centerville, Tex., had the "explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce" necessary for federal jurisdiction.
In its unanimous decision last week, Jones v. United States, No. 99-5739, the court held that Congress did not intend the arson law, which requires that a building be "used" in an activity affecting commerce, to apply to a house used as a private residence.
If the appeals courts disagree on how the ruling applies to churches or other types of buildings, there is a good prospect for further Supreme Court decisions.
 
Potomac River Dispute
Exercising its infrequently used "original jurisdiction" to resolve suits between states, the court said it would allow Virginia to proceed with a suit against Maryland over use of the Potomac River, which forms a border between the two. Maryland owns the river, under a grant from King Charles I of England in 1632, but under various interstate compacts Virginia has been allowed to make "reasonable use" of the Potomac from its own shoreline, including the construction of pipes to draw river water for drinking.
Virginia brought this case, Virginia v. Maryland, No. 129 Original, to protest Maryland's refusal to allow the Fairfax County Water Authority to build a new intake pipe from the shoreline to a point in the main channel, 725 feet offshore. The county authority says the new pipe is needed because the current intake pipe, at the shoreline, is subject to runoff, clogging by leaves or ice, and other problems that would not occur near the middle of the 2,000-foot-wide river.
Maryland unsuccessfully urged the court not to accept jurisdiction, on the ground that administrative proceedings were still going on that could resolve the dispute without involving the Supreme Court. The justices are likely to appoint a special master to take evidence and recommend a resolution.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Make Strong Showing; Nasdaq Soars a Record 7.9%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index surged to its biggest percentage gain and the second-largest point gain in its 29-year history yesterday as investors snapped up technology heavyweights like Intel, Cisco Systems and Oracle.
The index shot up 254.37 points, or 7.9 percent, to 3,459.48. Of the stocks that make up the Nasdaq 100 index, 98 rose in price and 2 lost ground. 
 Even with the gains, the Nasdaq is still down nearly 15 percent so far this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 44.43 points, or 3.2 percent, yesterday, to 1,422.45, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.89 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,527.13.
The performance of the Nasdaq was the highlight of a very strong session for stocks generally.
"This could be the start of something good," said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies & Company. Mr. Allyn and others said it was significant that stocks, which opened strong, remained that way throughout the session.
"Investors expected the market to rally and fail, as they have so many times during this correction," he said. "When the market didn't pull back, it came as a surprise."
Despite the positives and the possibility of an impending summer rally, there are some caveats. This was the first day after a long weekend, and trading volume, a good gauge of investor enthusiasm, was fairly light. About 844.2 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
And the gains were recorded without a great deal of market-moving news developments. Later this week investors will be confronted with a number of important economic reports, including the May employment data, which is scheduled to be released on Friday.
But for a day, optimism reigned.
"The Nasdaq is the index people will be watching going forward, because it is seen as still being vulnerable," said Bill Schneider, head of block equity trading at Warburg Dillon Read.
The gains came on a day when Laszlo Birinyi, one of Wall Street's most bullish stock market forecasters who runs his own market research firm in Westport, Conn., turned a bit cautious.
Mr. Birinyi, whose forecasts over the last few years have been closer to the market's actual performance than those of most of his colleagues, started the year predicting that the S.& P. 500 would rise another 20 percent.
"A lot of things have changed," since then," he said yesterday. As a consequence, Mr. Birinyi says the S.& P. will record a gain of 8 percent to 10 percent this year.
"As we look at the flow of funds, we don't see nearly as many stocks being bought as over the last several years," he said, "and the stocks that are being bought are not being purchased as aggressively."
In addition, although money flowing into equity mutual funds is up 150 percent from a year ago, and funds flowing into aggressive growth funds are up 220 percent, "those stocks aren't really reacting," he added. "And cash levels are not unusually high."
"I am not bearish," Mr. Birinyi concluded. "There are still a lot of situations which look very good. I guess I am rationally exuberant."
Big technology stocks like Cisco and Oracle jumped yesterday. Cisco gained 41 5/16, to 59 7/8. Oracle, the database software maker, gained 7 3/16, to 74 3/16.
Semiconductor manufacturers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices rallied after a Lehman Brothers analyst issued a bullish report on the industry.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index rose 11.1 percent, its biggest gain in six weeks.
Advanced Micro soared 11, to 85. Intel surged 8 3/16, to 125 3/4.
Telephone stocks got a boost from France Telecom's $40 billion acquisition of Orange P.L.C. from Vodafone AirTouch.
Sprint's PCS wireless unit rose 7/8, to 54 3/8. AT&T's wireless group gained 1 5/16, to 27 5/8. And SBC Communications rose 1 5/8, to 44 1/4.
VoiceStream Wireless jumped 19 1/2, or 19.4 percent, to 119 7/8, after a Japanese newspaper reported that NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, was in talks to buy as much as 20 percent of the United States cellular phone company.
Qualcomm was the most actively traded stock, rising 10 5/16, to 76 3/8. The stock, which rose 27-fold in 1999, is down 60 percent so far this year.
Financial service did well after analysts at Goldman, Sachs issued a report saying they expect investment banking business to pick up.
Merrill Lynch gained 3 9/16, to 94 5/8. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette rose 21 1/16, to 39 1/2. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed at 67, up 3 5/16, and Goldman Sachs rose 2 3/16, to 72.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Fall
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices fell as stocks surged and as consumer confidence rose to its second-highest level, adding to speculation the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates further to slow growth and inflation.
"There's no compelling reason to get into Treasuries," said Paul Corbin, who helps manage $4.2 billion at the Brown Investment Advisory and Trust Company and two weeks ago bought WorldCom Inc. debt for its higher yields.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 6/32, to 102 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.09 percent from 6.06 percent on Friday. The 10-year bond fell 10/32, to 100 30/32, while the yield rose to 6.37 percent from 6.32 percent Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.552	96.891	High Rate	5.73%	6.15%	Investment Rate	5.89%	6.43%	Low Rate	5.68%	6.08%	Median Rate	5.70%	6.13%	Total applied for	$25,942,049	$25,502,147	Accepted	$10,855,389	$10,207,397	Noncompetitive	$1,311,405	$1,008,303

HEADLINE: Clinton Visits Europe With Same Baggage, Trade and Missiles, That Reagan Carried

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: LISBON, May 30

 BODY:
President Clinton today became the first president to visit Portugal since Ronald Reagan in 1985, and as Mr. Clinton opened his last scheduled trip to Europe as president, he found himself confronting the same major issues that Mr. Reagan faced -- trade disputes and missile defense.
While Mr. Reagan supported a space-based missile defense system known as Star Wars, Mr. Clinton will be pushing his own plan to deploy a limited missile defense system, if he can reach agreement on modifying the 28-year-old Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
 As they had done for days leading up to the trip, aides to Mr. Clinton stressed again today that they did not expect him to reach any concrete agreements, as Mr. Reagan also failed to do 15 years ago. But in contrast to the significant anti-American demonstrations that Mr. Reagan received, only one "Clinton Go Home" slogan was seen today on a wall in Lisbon.
An article today in the left-of-center daily Publico underscored the difficulty Mr. Clinton faces in selling his missile defense initiative -- not only to Russia but also to the rest of the world. The newspaper compared Mr. Clinton's dilemma to that of Mr. Reagan on "Star Wars," saying Mr. Clinton will "have to persuade his European partners that the new American antimissile defense system that the U.S. wants to develop can bring advantages to European security and world peace."
"But this is a difficult task," the article continued, "especially for a president at the end of his career, in the face of negative reaction already expressed in most European capitals. Europe is afraid that this initiative, a 'soft' version of Ronald Reagan 'Star Wars' in the 80's, will end up triggering a new arms race, alienating Russia and feeding Beijing's nuclear ambitions."
Few people turned out to see Mr. Clinton today. But the president still found that the opening day of his weeklong trip to Europe was full of mutual praise and old-fashioned sightseeing, and his day of meetings with a close ally was relatively free of contentious issues.
Mr. Clinton reinforced just how enjoyable a day it had been, saying in a toast to Portugal's president, Jorge Sampaio, at a state dinner tonight: "It has been a pleasure for me to spend time with another president who likes to read detective novels, listen to good music and play golf. We could have had a two-day summit on those three topics alone."
From here Mr. Clinton will travel to Berlin, to Moscow -- where he will have his first meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin -- and finally to Kiev, Ukraine. While in Berlin, he will also meet privately with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, who will be attending a political conference along with Mr. Clinton and other leaders. The two leaders are expected to discuss Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon last week and the status of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
Welcoming Mr. Clinton to Portugal today, President Sampaio said: "It was from here five centuries ago that the Portuguese navigators -- who explored the Atlantic coast of Africa, discovered the maritime route to India, found Brazil and circumnavigated the earth -- set sail. Our increasingly globalized world owes a lot to their deeds."
Mr. Clinton echoed Mr. Sampaio's words, saying, "Here at this historic point of embarkation, from which Portuguese explorers led an entire continent to see beyond the horizon, we find ourselves again, as you said, Mr. President, on a new voyage of discovery."
The two men stood together at the sun-bleached limestone 16th-century Belem Tower at the entrance to Lisbon's harbor, where Portuguese frigates honored Mr. Clinton with a 21-gun salute. The two presidents reviewed an honor guard of paratroopers in fatigues, white gloves and purple ascots who are headed to East Timor as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force. Portugal asserted residual rights over East Timor, which is now moving toward independence, for more than two decades after the territory was seized by Indonesia in 1975.
"I know that this nation is proud of those troops and their mission, and on behalf of the American people, I thank you for it," Mr. Clinton told Mr. Sampaio.
From there, a cavalry regiment of musicians on horseback led Mr. Clinton's motorcade to the Jeronimos Monastery in the town of Belem. There, he laid a wreath at the carved tomb of the poet Luis Camoes and spent half an hour touring the 16th-century structure.
Then, after a tour of the interactive Knowledge Science Center, Mr. Clinton told scientists and researchers, "I have just had a lot of fun." He also praised what he called cutting-edge research across national boundaries on diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. "These diseases can ruin economies and threaten the very survival of societies," said Mr. Clinton, whose administration has elevated issues like disease to the top of the national security agenda.
On Wednesday, at the 17th-century Queluz Palace outside Lisbon, Mr. Clinton will meet with the European Commission's president, Romano Prodi, and Portugal's prime minister, Antonio Guterres. Portugal currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.
The United States and the 15-nation European Union are locked in complicated disputes over European restrictions on the importation of bananas, American beef and genetically modified foods.
On the other side, the European Union objects to a sales tax break that the United Sates grants to major corporations that set up operations in offshore tax havens like the Virgin Islands and Barbados. Those companies are not required to pay American sales tax and duties on their exports, which the European Union argues is a form of subsidy that will amount to about $25 billion to American companies over the next five years.
In Berlin, Mr. Clinton will attend a meeting with leaders of more than a dozen other countries on "third way" politics, with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder as host. The approach, also described as "progressive governance," explores a middle ground between traditional forms of socialism and capitalism.
In Aachen, Germany, on Friday, Mr. Clinton will be awarded the International Charlemagne Prize, presented annually to a person who has worked toward European unity. Other recipients of the award have been Churchill and Francois Mitterrand, the late French president. The only Americans to have received the award have been George C. Marshall, author of America's plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
During the weekend, Mr. Clinton will be in Moscow for his first summit meeting with Mr. Putin. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, told reporters last week that the visit would produce no breakthroughs in arms control or Russia's objections to an American missile defense plan.
On Monday, Mr. Clinton will address the Russian Parliament, becoming the first American president to do so. Later that day, he will travel to Ukraine for a meeting with President Leonid Kuchma before heading home to Washington that night.
Mr. Clinton has eight months left as president, but in some quarters he is already being talked about in the past tense.
The article in Publico, the Portuguese daily, said of his visit: "On the other side of the Atlantic, he is looked as if he already belonged to the past. In Europe, he is being given the prize to those who have aided the European cause. Bill Clinton was a good president to Europe." The article was titled, "Clinton Says Goodbye to Europe."
And Portugal's leading tabloid newspaper, Correio da Manha, focused on Mr. Clinton's enormous $4,000-a-night suite at the Dom Pedro Hotel. Situated on the top floor, it has, the newspaper said, a panoramic view of the capital, "a private elevator for security, luxury furniture, original works of art, a spacious hall, tropical plants, a bar, a winter garden and a private terrace of 160 square meters."
"It also has a private dining room for 12 people, with a terrace of 60 square meters, connected to a fully equipped kitchen," it continued. "The suite has two more rooms, the bigger of which looks out to a natural solarium. There is a dressing room and a marble bathroom connected to this room, as well as panoramic vistas over Lisbon, a sauna, a Jacuzzi with hydro massage."
At the state dinner tonight, Mr. Clinton was serenaded by Mafalda Arnauth, Portugal's hottest young fado singer. Fado is melancholic Portuguese music played with string instruments and built around the concept of saudades, the yearning for a past that was better and may never return.

F.C.C. Proposes Relaxing Some Broadcasting Rules
The Federal Communications Commission proposed easing several decades-old regulations on broadcasters, including one that prevents companies from owning a broadcast station and newspaper in the same city and another prohibiting a company from owning more than one national television network.
The proposals may significantly affect several pending and recently completed mergers. Existing rules would have required significant divestitures after Viacom's acquisition of CBS and the Tribune Company's proposed purchase of Times Mirror. Page A1. 

Breakup Fees Detailed in Airline Deal
According to a copy of the proposed merger agreement between United Airlines and US Airways filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, US Airways would have to pay $160 million to United's parent, UAL, if it breached the contract, while UAL would be forced to pay $50 million to US Airways if it withdrew. In addition, either company can terminate the agreement if the merger is not completed by Dec. 31. Shares of US Airways rose 6.25 cents, to $43.625, while UAL fell 81.25 cents, to $51.9375. C2.
 
N.T.T. of Japan Is Urged to Cut Fees
Senior members of Japan's ruling party are pressing Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the dominant telecommunications company, to reduce the high connection fees charged to competitors, an issue that has caused deep trade friction with the United States. C4.
 
Consumer Confidence Resurfaces
Consumer confidence surged in May, according to the Conference Board, to 144.4, close to the record it reached in January despite the roller coaster stock market and six increases in interest rates in the last year. C2.
 
Supreme Court Tackles Clean Air Act
The Supreme Court expanded its continuing review of the Clean Air Act to consider the economic costs. The court's action raised the stakes even higher in a case, to be argued next fall, that already promised to be one of the most important environmental and administrative law cases in years. A19.
 
Meet the Nicest Man on Wall St.
It was luck that got him out of Nazi Germany in the 1930's, John H. Slade says, and luck that got him his first job in New York as a runner for Bear, Stearns at $15 a week. Decades later, he says, it was a lucky encounter on a train that led to romance and marriage. Today, Mr. Slade, 92, the honorary chairman of the executive committee at Bear, Stearns, puts in a four-day week and calls himself "the luckiest man in the world." The Boss. C10.
 
Sotheby's Board Choice Is Criticized
Ronald Baron, whose investment funds are the largest outside investors in Sotheby's Holdings, says electing Robert Taubman, the son of the company's former chairman, to its board, would represent a conflict of interest in the face of the continuing criminal investigation into price fixing at the auction house. C2.
 
Internet Access for Road Warriors
Larry Brilliant, chairman of SoftNet Systems, empathizes with business travelers in need of computer access. A unit of his company plans to start a system of wireless networks in airports, hotels and convention centers that will sell high-speed Internet services and e-mail access.

Truth in Advertising

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Oh no, not another column on Social Security! But the mailbag suggests that the issue needs one more go-round, because some readers still think Social Security is just a pension fund -- one that compares unfavorably with private retirement plans. And it's true that lately it is being run more like such a fund than before. But the many decades in which it was run on a pay-as-you-go basis hang heavily over the system's prospects, and any honest plan for reform must come to grips with that legacy.
For most of its existence, Social Security was basically "unfunded": it didn't invest the contributions workers paid in, it simply paid them out to retirees. This hand-to-mouth operation worked because the nation's working population was steadily growing; so each generation, when it reached retirement age, could count on being supported by a much larger generation of workers. For those who worked in the system's early years it was a terrific deal. 
 But baby boom was followed by baby bust. In the decades ahead, a huge number of retirees will need to be supported by a rather small number of workers. Pay-as-you-go would require either slashing benefits, sharply increasing required contributions, or both.
Of course officials have known for a while that this was coming, and they actually -- surprise! -- took some responsible precautions. In 1977 required contributions were increased without a corresponding increase in benefits, and as a result the system has been steadily accumulating a fund that will greatly delay the date at which it runs out of money. But the fund still isn't big enough, and the increased contributions mean that the implied rate of return for today's workers is low compared with what they could get if they were free to invest their money for themselves.
The reason for that low return, once again, is not that the Social Security Administration is a lousy investor; it's that today's workers must over-contribute because previous generations of Americans didn't put in enough to finance their own retirement. It's a legacy of the pay-as-you-go past.
Now what could a politician who wants to let workers invest their own money honestly propose? He might say: "I think that workers should be free to invest their own money. Of course, that means that we won't have enough money coming into the Social Security system to pay the benefits currently offered to Americans over 65; so I'm slashing those benefits, starting today. After all, the future belongs to the young!" Before making that proposal, however, the politician should learn a trade; he's going to be looking for another job very soon.
Or he might say: "I think that workers should be free to invest some of their contributions, say 15 percent, on their own. Of course, we have to maintain the benefits of today's retirees. So in return for giving today's workers the privilege of investing 15 percent of their contributions, I'm going to cut their guaranteed benefits by a lot more than 15 percent -- 30 percent, 40 percent, whatever it takes to keep the system actuarially sound. I believe that today's workers can make enough money in the stock market to compensate. And if you can't, my fellow Americans, that's your problem!"
That, as far as I can make out, is what George W. Bush is actually proposing -- though he has been more than vague about the details. He hasn't specified how much guaranteed benefits would be cut, let alone clearly stated that the percentage cut would have to be a lot larger than the share of contributions workers were freed to invest. (The plan described by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan on this page yesterday would in effect impose cuts on that scale, mainly through reduced cost-of-living adjustments and increased taxes on benefits.)
What a politician can't honestly say is something like, "Even if a worker chose only the safest investment in the world, an inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond, he or she would receive twice the rate of return of Social Security" -- as if that were a meaningful comparison, as if the obligations to today's older Americans didn't have to be met. But that quote isn't made up -- it's what Mr. Bush actually said.
All I can say is that he'd never be able to get away with it if Al Gore were still alive.

HEADLINE: U.S. SEEKS TO EASE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON BROADCASTERS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission proposed easing several decades-old regulations on broadcasters today, including one that prevents companies from owning a broadcast station and newspaper in the same city and another prohibiting a company from owning more than one national television network.
In a biennial review that Congress ordered as part of its overhaul of the telecommunications industry four years ago, the F.C.C. said it had begun preparing new rules to relax, but not eliminate, both the cross-ownership and dual-network restrictions. 
 It also proposed changing the manner in which the listening audience of local radio markets is measured by regulators in a way that could enable companies to own more stations than they do under current limits.
The proposals may have significant implications for several pending and recently completed mergers in the broadcast and newspaper industries. Existing rules would have required significant divestitures after Viacom's acquisition of CBS and the Tribune Company's proposed purchase of Times Mirror.
Officials said some restrictions had become outdated as Americans increasingly turned to new technologies like satellite television and high-speed Internet services.
At the same time, a wave of corporate deals has led to new levels of concentration in the broadcast, cable and telephone industries, testing the ownership limits imposed by both the F.C.C. and Congress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
"The media marketplace has become increasingly dynamic and competitive, with an expanding number of information outlets and media platforms, and more Americans than ever before are using these options," said William E. Kennard, the commission's chairman. "The report we issue today balances the public interest in diversity of ownership with the demands of a changing marketplace and the broadcast industries' need to realize economic efficiencies and remain competitive."
Both the cross-ownership and dual-network regulations were rooted in the idea of promoting diversity of the airwaves, and officials at the F.C.C. said that they were not planning on eliminating the restrictions but easing them in particular cases.
While the proposed changes outlined today are more gradual than some large companies had sought, they would be a significant policy change for the agency, which has defended itself against legal attacks and criticisms over the rules.
In the case of the cross-ownership rules, the commission said that there was still a need for restrictions in many areas to prevent a company from controlling both a newspaper and television station.
But the commission also concluded that in some cities, particularly large ones with many media outlets, "there might be situations in which the rule may not be necessary to protect the public interest in diversity and competition."
In the case of the dual-network rule, the agency said that two emerging television networks, UPN and Warner Brothers, were still developing and ought to be able to try to attract new investments from a major network. But commission officials said they would not alter rules that prevent the four majors -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- from acquiring one another.
Officials expect the proposed rules to be issued in the next few months, and the commission would then consider them. The proposed changes come after heavy lobbying by some of the nation's largest broadcasting and newspaper companies, which have big stakes in trying to hold onto recently acquired TV companies.
The cross-ownership restrictions have threatened to force the Tribune Company, which has agreed to buy Times Mirror, to sell some properties in three cities -- New York, Los Angeles and Hartford -- where the companies have newspapers and broadcasting properties. In New York, Tribune would own both WPIX, a WB affiliate, and Newsday, which is based in Long Island.
The Tribune Company has also spent years trying to persuade the F.C.C. to permit it to own both a newspaper and a television station in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
The dual-network rule has threatened to force Viacom, which recently completed its acquisition of CBS, to sell its half interest in UPN. When it approved the deal four weeks ago, the F.C.C. gave Viacom one year to sell its stake in UPN. But if the agency finishes writing new rules before then, the company might not have to put the network up for sale.
The commission stopped short of recommending any easing of the limitations that have prevented the stations owned by a company from reaching more than 35 percent of the national television audience, prompting Fox, which is at the limit and wants to expand, to immediately file a lawsuit against the agency.
"The F.C.C. decision today is a textbook case of arbitrary and capricious government action," said Chase Carey, chairman and chief executive of Fox Television.
"The national TV ownership cap, which may have served a purpose in the days when only three TV networks competed in local markets, long ago outlived its rationale and is now harming rather than promoting its original public-interest objectives of diversity, localism and competition," he said. "In an era in which scores of nationwide programming networks are available to viewers from cable and satellite providers, it makes no sense to artificially limit the number of markets in which broadcasters can compete."
Mr. Kennard said that Fox's argument had confused trends in the local market with trends in the national market and that there remained a compelling need to prevent any one company's stations from controlling the national market.
"The majority of Americans still get most of their news and public affairs information from broadcast stations, and in a participatory democracy like ours, it is vitally important that we encourage the widest possible dissemination of this information from diverse and antagonistic sources," he said. "Our structural ownership restrictions seek to promote this First Amendment principle."
Other critics said that Mr. Kennard's own observation that most Americans relied heavily on broadcasting to get their news demonstrated the need to keep the cross-ownership in place.
"Broadcasting remains the single most important source of information at the local level for many, many voters, and most of the rest get their information from newspapers," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, which promotes diversity on the airwaves.
"To have these voices controlled by fewer and fewer owners cannot help democracy," he said. "The evolution of the Internet has yet to make any significant change on how people decide to cast their vote for the mayor. The degree to which a few large economic powers in any community can control the debate is no less today than it has been in the past."

Since last week, leaders at the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, and US Airways have said repeatedly that they are committed to seeing their controversial $4.3 billion merger through to completion. But it turns out that it would not be very taxing for either side to walk away from the deal.
According to a copy of the merger agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, US Airways would have to pay $160 million to UAL if it breached the contract, while UAL would be forced to pay $50 million to US Airways if it backed out of the deal. 
In addition, either company can terminate the agreement if the merger is not completed by Dec. 31. The deal faces many regulatory hurdles in Washington, making it likely there will be a delay.
Such financial bounds appear rather loose when compared with other recent deals like America Online's proposed $165 billion merger with Time Warner Inc. In that case, AOL must pay Time Warner $5.4 billion if it pulls out, while Time Warner is obligated to pay America Online $3.7 billion if it walks away. There is also a second multibillion-dollar breakup penalty if stockholders at either company reject the deal.
Merger experts said that breakup fees normally represented a percentage of each company's equity and that the higher fees in the case of the AOL-Time Warner merger merely reflected the higher values of those two companies.
But one week after the UAL-US Airways deal was first disclosed many in the airline industry wonder if the deal will ever be completed. Most of the speculation centers on the next wave of merger announcements that many analysts said were sure to come and would make regulators and Congress reluctant to approve a merger between the country's largest airline -- UAL -- and its sixth largest, US Airways. At the top of the list are a possible deal between the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, and Northwest Airlines, and a merger of Delta Airlines and Continental Airlines.
Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, announced yesterday that he would join federal authorities and officials in New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in taking a hard look at the UAL-US Airways deal. "The merger of United and US Air would create an airborne behemoth with huge implications for our consumers and economy," he said. UAL and US Airways hope to win over state and federal regulators by selling most of the US Airways operations at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington to DC Air, a new airline being formed by Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television and a US Airways board member.
DC Air will receive seven gates at Reagan National and 222 coveted takeoff and landing slots at the airport, where the number of daily flights is limited, for $141.2 million, according to the memorandum of understanding between Mr. Johnson and UAL and US Airways that was also filed with the S.E.C. yesterday.
In addition, UAL has agreed to lease maintenance sites, jets and ticket counters to the fledgling airline. The memorandum also states that "United will provide interim employees for up to six months to staff 'open' positions, while DC Air hires and trains, if needed, at United's cost."
UAL and US Airways executives said that DC air would quickly become a strong competitor with the combined United-US Airways, but others are not so sure. An analysis by Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber, found that the number of airplane seats flown from Reagan National would decrease by 15 percent after DC Air began operating compared with what United and US Airways each fly today.
"It would appear that there will be fewer seats at the outset rather than more seats," Mr. Buttrick said. "It is certainly hard to see how that is good for the consumer."
He added that DC Air could expand its service from Reagan National over time but that would not be easy given the restrictions at the airport. Another hurdle facing the deal is the approval of employees at both airlines. The leadership of the union representing United's 10,000 pilots, who own about a quarter of UAL's stock, will begin three days of meetings in Chicago today to discuss the deal. James E. Goodwin, UAL's chief executive, is scheduled to address the group this afternoon.
As Mr. Goodwin has previously stated, the merger agreement guarantees that there will be no layoffs at the combined airlines for two years. Nevertheless, it will be a tough audience. Last week, Rick Dubinsky, the chairman of the United union's master executive council who is also on UAL's board, criticized Mr. Goodwin for pursuing the merger before first sealing a new contract with the pilots. Those talks are expected to go on for months.

HEADLINE: On Teacher Pay, City vs. Suburbs Isn't That Simple

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
For the last five months, the union representing New York City teachers has been peppering newspapers, radio and prime-time television with advertisements that make a powerful argument for raising salaries: city teachers earn a whopping 25 percent less than those in the surrounding suburbs, the ads say.
The union is preparing to negotiate a new contract with the city, and it is hoping to rally public support with the $3 million worth of ominous ads. One claims that as a result of the salary gap, "many experienced teachers in New York City are being cherry-picked" by suburban school districts. Another declares that the salary gap is "why we are facing a crisis of unmatched proportion," a reference to the union's prediction that 54,000 teachers will leave city schools over the next five years. 
 But the facts are more complicated than the advertisements let on. An analysis of salary data compiled by the state teachers' union found that while some school districts in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties pay up to 40 percent more in some experience levels than New York City, those districts are the exception to the rule. In the 1998-99 school year, the starting salaries in those counties were only about 12 percent higher on average, according to the data.
The average entry-level salary in those counties was $34,068 in 1998-99, compared with $30,203 in New York City. Nassau County paid the highest starting salary -- $38,122 for teachers with a bachelor's degree and no experience. Orange County's average starting salary, $32,794, was only 8.6 percent higher than New York City's.
The gap was larger among more experienced and more educated teachers. In their first year on the job, teachers with master's degrees and 30 additional credits earned an average of $41,236 in Westchester County -- about 21 percent higher than the $34,117 their counterparts earned in New York City. First-year teachers with master's degrees earned $43,268 in Nassau County -- about 27 percent more than those in New York.
The highest-paid teachers -- those with the highest education levels and the most years on the job -- earned an average of $81,666 in the five suburban counties last year, more than 29 percent above the average $63,037 in New York City.
Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, maintains that the union's advertisements are not exaggerating when they talk about a 25 percent gap between city and suburban salaries. She pointed to a report last year by the State Education Department, which found that the median teacher salary in New York City was 39.96 percent less than in Nassau County, 49.38 percent less than in Rockland County and 44.47 percent less than in Westchester County.
The numbers are higher than those based on averages partly because suburban school systems tend to have more experienced teachers than New York City. That makes the median salary in suburban districts significantly higher. A median salary is one that falls in the exact middle of a ranked payroll; half the teachers earn more and half less.
"It would not be my style to exaggerate a gap that's already too big," Ms. Weingarten said about the 25 percent figure that the union is using in its ads. "There are many different ways to construe average salaries, but this is an honest estimate."
Another contention in some of the ads -- that "many experienced teachers" are being "cherry-picked" by suburban school districts -- may be more misleading. In response to a lawsuit in which more state aid is being sought for city schools, state lawyers recently presented data suggesting only a few hundred teachers leave New York City for suburban schools each year.
The data, provided by the State Education Department, found that 259 city teachers left for suburban districts from 1996 to 1997, while 395 left from 1997 to 1998. If those numbers are correct, the New York City school system -- which has 75,000 teachers -- is hardly experiencing an exodus of teachers to the suburbs. One major reason may be that from year to year there are generally only a handful of openings in any one suburban district.
"It's true that the number who actually leave is not huge," said Michael Rebell, a lawyer for the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a coalition of advocacy groups that filed the school financing lawsuit. "The bigger problem is getting teachers to come here in the first place. It's pretty clear that the salary differential, plus the harder working conditions in city schools, make the suburbs much more attractive."
During the school financing trial, state lawyers also suggested that suburban districts paid teachers more because they required longer hours than New York City did. But New York City union officials say that those additional hours are generally for preparation or professional development, not for teaching.
Ms. Weingarten said the union based its ads on anecdotal evidence about teachers leaving for the suburbs, because it was difficult for the union to collect accurate figures on teachers who leave city schools.
The union's fight for higher salaries might be bolstered by a study about to be published by Dr. Hamilton Lankford, an economics professor at the State University of New York in Albany. The study found New York City was the only large city in New York State to pay its teachers less than the surrounding suburbs.
The most striking example is Yonkers, where new teachers will earn $40,068 under a new contract and teachers with the most training and experience will earn $90,311. The new starting salary is 30 percent higher than Westchester's average starting salary in 1998-99, the latest year for which figures are available. The new top salary is 6.4 percent higher than the county's average top salary of $84,912 in 1998-99.
Certified teachers who are new to the profession are the ones most likely to flee to the suburbs, union officials said, because they have the least invested in the city's pension system. New York City cannot afford to lose those teachers, they said, not only because so many older teachers are retiring but because young, inexperienced teachers are the most likely to teach in hard-to-staff schools.
No matter how much salaries here increase, suburban schools are going to remain enticing for city teachers because of their smaller classes, newer buildings, more plentiful supplies and general tranquility. Kelly Orr, 31, left Public School 108 in South Ozone Park, Queens, last fall for a middle-class school district in Nassau County. Mrs. Orr, a remedial math teacher, is making $48,572 at her new school -- roughly $10,000 more than she did in Queens.
Mrs. Orr said that while the main reason she went to Long Island was the higher salaries, another was smaller classes. She started out last fall with 39 students in her sixth-grade class at P.S. 108, she said. The sixth-grade classes at her new school have about 22 students each.
"A salary of $38,000 for a sixth-year teacher with a master's degree was just not sufficient," Mrs. Orr said. "When you're 30 years old and you've got all this education and you're still not making ends meet, you don't have much choice. I had to go."

HEADLINE: A Dark Horse in a Field of Republican Obscurity

SERIES: IN THE RUNNING -- Third of four profiles of the Republican candidates for the Senate in New Jersey.

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 30

 BODY:
When James W. Treffinger was growing up in Maplewood, crucifixes adorned the walls in several rooms of the family home, but in one, a picture of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was positioned slightly higher than the cross.
Mr. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, grew up in a working-class family loyal to the Roman Catholic Church and the Democratic Party. His father was a factory worker who turned steel ingots into wire. His grandfather was a truck driver. 
 "We didn't know many Republicans," Mr. Treffinger said recently in the mural-lined conference room of his county offices in Newark. "My family idolized F.D.R. and Truman and John Kennedy. It was a Catholic family, so Kennedy was a double hero."
But in 1986, Mr. Treffinger switched parties and enrolled as a Republican after years of disillusionment with the Democrats and their fiscal policies, which he believed were irresponsible.
In his race for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in next Tuesday's primary, Mr. Treffinger is facing a problem that echoes his childhood perspective: many voters surveyed say they still do not know much about the four Republicans running. And they know less about Mr. Treffinger than they do about two of the other candidates, State Senator William L. Gormley and Representative Robert D. Franks. The fourth candidate is Murray Sabrin, a Ramapo College professor who once ran for governor as a Libertarian.
To overcome these disadvantages, Mr. Treffinger is banking on his working-class roots, his record in government, his political base in Essex County and his vision of a Republican Party that is fiscally conservative but socially inclusive.
Breaking out of the pack will be tough, however, for Mr. Treffinger, 50, a former Wall Street lawyer and mayor of the township of Verona with little exposure on the state political scene and a modest campaign war chest.
Mr. Gormley, who has raised $2.4 million so far, and Mr. Franks, who has raised $1.6 million, are widely considered to be the two front-runners. But Mr. Treffinger believes that in spite of his smaller reserve of campaign funds (he has raised about $1.2 million), he can make an impression with sheer doggedness. He shows up every weekday morning at work an hour or two early, so that he can spend his evenings making seven or more campaign appearances throughout the state. On weekends, he sometimes makes more than a dozen campaign stops a day.
"The bad news for all of us is that over 70 percent of Republican primary voters don't know any of us," he said. "But the good news for me is that over 70 percent of the likely voters don't know any of us, so I have an opportunity to become known."
He is crisscrossing the state every day, delivering his message of what he calls populist conservatism while wagging his thick head of hair and speaking in a soft-voiced cadence reminiscent of Ronald Reagan. "My limit is five people," he said of the sometimes small crowds he draws, "because maybe they can go out and talk to five more people about me."
Mr. Treffinger will benefit from having his base in northern New Jersey, the most populous part of the state. He was an Essex County freeholder before he was elected executive in 1995, and has since built a reputation for turning around the fiscally troubled county. Just before he took over, the county was facing a $161 million deficit. In his office, he found desk drawers stuffed with unpaid bills. Revenues for the previous year had been overestimated by more than $35 million. Mr. Treffinger's predecessor, Thomas J. D'Alessio, was later convicted and imprisoned for money laundering, fraud and extortion.
In one year, Mr. Treffinger nearly closed the budget gap, by selling county assets, making severe personnel cuts and engaging in what some called sleight-of-hand debt juggling. But he did it without proposing property tax increases. His actions impressed Wall Street analysts, who raised the county's bond rating. Just as important to Republican Party leaders, he managed to get elected twice in a heavily Democratic county, the state's second most populous.
In addition to Essex County, Mr. Treffinger is counting on strong support from Passaic and Hudson Counties on Primary Day, and has been spending a lot of time in Morris and Monmouth Counties, all densely populated counties whose votes could tip the balance in his favor.
But he will be limited by the amount of money he has to spend. Mr. Treffinger said he probably would not be able to afford advertising on network television, an expensive proposition in New Jersey because voters live in the radius of either the New York City stations or the Philadelphia stations, two of the more costly television markets. So he is relying on cable television, radio and direct mailings.
Chuck Haytaian, the state Republican Party chairman, acknowledges that Mr. Gormley and Mr. Franks have some clear advantages over the other two candidates. Nevertheless, he said, Mr. Treffinger should be taken seriously. "I wouldn't take Jim Treffinger for granted," Mr. Haytaian said. "He's running a good campaign and he's had two good wins in Essex County."
Mr. Treffinger is also getting support from Mayor Bret D. Schundler of Jersey City, another Democrat-turned-Republican who won election in a heavily Democratic area. The two men have followed very similar paths politically and are friends. They met while working for Senator Gary Hart when he was seeking the Democratic nomination for president.
Mr. Schundler said he and Mr. Treffinger had dinner one night about a year ago at a Portuguese restaurant in Newark's Ironbound district, and agreed to help each other attain higher office. "I'm supporting Jim for the Senate, and he's supporting me for governor," Mr. Schundler said.
Mr. Treffinger was born James Padalino in Newark. His mother and biological father never married, and when he was 4, she married Fred Treffinger, who adopted him and gave him his name. He attended St. Benedict Prep School in Newark and became the first member of his family to graduate from college, receiving a degree in history, magna cum laude, from Seton Hall University in 1972. He studied in Germany as a Fulbright scholar.
Mr. Treffinger said he is a "frustrated historian" who reads to relax. He is reading two biographies, one on Ronald Reagan and the other on John Quincy Adams.
Mr. Treffinger portrays himself as the most fiscally conservative of the four Republican Senate candidates. He favors a flat tax that would allow few deductions besides home mortgage interest and state and local taxes, and he would get rid of the capital gains tax, the so-called death tax on estates and the tax on Social Security benefits. He has also pledged not to raise taxes, and said that if elected, he would try to give voters the right to call a referendum to enable them to override any tax increase passed by Congress.
He endorses term limits and campaign finance reform, and has refused to accept money from political action committees. He believes that states ought to determine their own gun laws and supports abortion rights, saying that despite his religious beliefs he has no intention of trying to criminalize abortion.
And as a former Democrat, Mr. Treffinger wants to work to make the Republican Party more inclusive. "We as a party have to start speaking and acting in more populist tones, reformist tones, more inclusive tones," he said. "We have to let people know that we care about them. The lie that the Democrats are the party of the people, if it ever was true, hasn't been true in a very long time."

Making a Living by Making a Sale

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Whether they ring up shirts and sweaters on a cash register, stock groceries on shelves or show homes to potential buyers, America's salespeople are the worker ants of the booming economy. There are a lot of them -- they account for one of every nine jobs in America -- and their numbers will continue to grow.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the number of sales and marketing workers will increase by 2.3 million, to 17.6 million, in 2008 from 15.3 million in 1998. And the job creation will be fastest for the highest earners, the bureau says. The ranks of financial-services sales agents, a group that includes stockbrokers and financial advisers and whose average annual pay exceeds $60,000, will surge 41 percent, to 427,000, the agency said. That compares with an average projected growth rate for the overall sales force of 14 percent. 
 Store clerks and cashiers will continue to form the backbone of the business, though their numbers will rise at a slower clip, to 9 million from 7.7 million, according to the bureau. Much of their work is low-skilled -- with pay to match: cashiers earned an average $15,230 a year in 1998, or about one-third the $47,600 that the average chief executive of a large company made in a single business day last year.

Remember Ethics, Graduates Are Told

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., May 30

 BODY:
Princeton University's president warned graduates today that crumbling respect for authorities and institutions meant that a sense of moral purpose must temper their use of technological and scientific advances like genetic research.
"We have to accept the fact that in a world that is changing as fast as ours, all thoughtful citizens will have to share in the anguish of finding the right moral perspective within which to accommodate these changes," said the university president, Dr. Harold T. Shapiro, who is the chairman of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission. 
 "Today, we strain harder than ever before to define ethical guidelines that will help us to navigate this flood tide of discovery," he added, "as we struggle to construct new moral perspectives within which science and technology can thrive."
On a cloud-covered day, the university conferred 1,092 bachelor's degrees and 625 advanced degrees. Some form of honors was awarded to 44.4 percent of the seniors.
Five honorary degrees were also conferred. In the sciences, honorary doctorates were awarded to Val L. Fitch, a Nobel winner and the James S. McDonnell distinguished university professor of physics at Princeton, and to Mary F. Lyon, the British researcher whose work in mouse genetics led to the discovery of a sex-linked gene mutation process.
In the humanities, honorary doctorates went to Mae C. Jemison, the first African-American woman astronaut, and to Wendy Kopp, the founder and president of Teach for America, a national teacher corps of recent college graduates.
An honorary law doctorate was awarded to Gordon E. Moore, a cofounder of Intel.
The valedictorian, Andrew Houck, an electrical engineering major, spoke about the significance of trees in an address that drew a standing ovation.
"A society grows when the old men plant trees in whose shade they will never sit," Mr. Houck said, quoting a Greek proverb. "I would encourage all of us not to spend our entire lives lounging in our ancestors' shade, but to venture out in the sun ourselves, ensuring a well-shaded future for the comfort of those to come."
On Sunday, Queen Noor of Jordan spoke to graduating seniors about the importance of public service, and reminded them that poverty and despair were common throughout the world despite technological advances and a booming economy at home.
After today's ceremony, graduates filed onto Nassau Street through the FitzRandolph gates for the first time in their careers. Although the gates are open all year, by tradition undergraduates avoid them until they graduate.
 
Cornell University
On a gray, chilly Sunday afternoon in Ithaca, N.Y., 6,000 undergraduate and graduate students filled Schoellkopf Field, from end to end and sideline to sideline, for Cornell's 132nd commencement.
The approximately 3,700 undergraduates were reminded of a far more somber occasion that marked their first year on campus: the death in December 1996 of Carl Sagan, the popular science writer and Cornell professor.
"Everyone, even if they never met him, was impacted by losing him," said the class president, Julie-Anne Dittmer. Remarking that he "could have been such a tremendous resource over the years," she said, "There was something different on the campus after that."
On Saturday, Ms. Dittmer addressed her classmates at Convocation Day, urging them to retain their school friendships in the future.
In an interview, she said: "You get so busy that you forget you're leaving for a while, but it finally hit me the other day when I was going through the yearbook. The tears started flowing then."
The commencement speaker, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, told the graduates that many of their best moments were ahead.
"The excitement is just beginning," he said. The best times and the great adventures of graduates' lives are "beginning at a historic time," he said. "We live in a new world where everything is changing."
He emphasized the point by telling the gathering that in 1993, when most of the seniors were starting high school, there were 13 Web sites on the Internet. "Today, seven years later," he said, "there are more than 14 million."
